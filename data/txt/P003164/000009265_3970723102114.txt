KAFUE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (STAGE II)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(Loan 919-ZA)
Preface
The project constituted part of the 'Long-term plaa for the
development of hydroelectric resources in Zambia and was justified as a
least cost project to follow the Kariba North Eydro-Electric Project (Loan
701-ZA, completed December 31, 1980).  As the Bank's fourth loan towards
the construction of Zambia and Zimbabwe's interconnected system, operated
by the Central African Power Company (CAPC), it was designed to meet the
system needs through 1980. Loan 919-ZA (US$115 million) became effective
on January 15, 1974 and the last disbursement was made on May 4, 1983. The
Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Eastern Africa Regional
Office based on the appraisal report and other documents in the Bank files,
a completion report prepared by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation
Limited (ZESCO), the borrower and executing agency, in December 1978, and
the findings of a project completion mission which visited Zambia in August
1983.
The PCR gives the main points of the project, which was
technically straightforward and satisfactorily implemented from the
physical and technical point of view.   towever,  the demand on Zambian
generating facilitics has been lower than forecast at appraisal, and it is
likely to decline once Zimbabwe commussions coal-fired generating capacity
from 1985 onwards.  Consequently, even after allowing for the effects on
hydroelectric production of abnormally low rainfalls in the region during
1982-1984, and for major maintenance work on turbo-generating units, a/ it
Is concluded that the investment iin the project should have been delayed by
eleven years.   The report notes that ZESCO  did not generate adequate
earnings during the project peried in part because demand was lower than
forecast at appraisal and in part because tariff increases proDosed by
ZESCO were not accepted by the Government.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reportier., this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluations Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower.  The comments which were received
have been taken into account in preparing the final report and they are
reproduced as Appendices to the report.

KAFUE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (STAGE II)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(Loan 919-ZA)
Highlights
The project is the second stage of the Kafue hydroelectric
development, and consists of the construction of a dam on the Kafue River
at the Itezhitezhi site to provide storage, the installation of two
additional 150-MW generating units at the existing station located 250 km
downstream from the dam, and a 60-km, 330-kV transmission line. Its main
objective was to meet the forecast needs to 1980 of the Zambia/Zimbabwe
interconnected power system, of which the Zambia Electricity Supply
Corporation (ZESCO) forms a part and for which institution this was the
first  Bank  Loan.    Other  objectives  were  the  strengthening  of  ZESCO
institutionally, chiefly in respect to recruitment of key personnel and
technical assistance to management, and the requirement that ZES0O should
earn adequate revenues. The project achieved its technical objective, but
it failed in the self-financing objective.
Time overruns ranged from about seven months on one unit to ten
months on the transmission installation (paras. 3.07-3.10). Overall actual
costs were very close to the estimate, the most significant cost overrun
being on interest during construction related to the time overrun on
implementation (para. 3.14).
Institutional performance under the project was satisfactory
except as related to generation of revenue, in which ZESCO was relatively
powerless since its proposals to increase retail tariffs on which the
financial performance had been predicated were not acceptable to the
Government. Another factor beyond ZESCO's control was that demand has been
lower than anticipated, resulting from the general economic recession
(para. 4.02).   Furthermore,  there are poor prospects for demand in the
region increasing quickly to absorb the potential for power production from
Kafue Stage II, especially with regard to exports to Zimbabwe. The updated
estimated economic rate of return is only 6.6X (see para. 7.03, Basic Data,
Annex 7-1) compared to the 18Z at time of appraisal, reflecting that the
project was earlier than was economically justified.
Some of the lessons learned are predictable in view of a main
conclusion drawn from the project completion report in Fambia's Kariba
North Hydroelectric project (Loan 701-ZA, June 27, 1983)'and in view of
sector experience in the Eastern and Soutnern Africa region. Firstly, the
need is highlighted for a reliable demand forecast and analyqis to take
account of major uncertainties in demand (para. 4.07). Secondly, following
from the first lesson, it is emphasized that in cases where after
commissioning the project, it emerges that the main market for its output
is different from the appraisal forecast, in this case the market became
a/ Project Performance Audit Report No. 4661, August 12, 1983.



exports to Zimbabwe, a/ the Bank should have the power to be consulted on
any proposal that prejudices sales to this market, in this case the
agreeement of July 1, 1977 between CAPC, CPC and ZESCO (para. 6.01).
Thirdly, the need for a redefinition of Zambia and Zimbabwe's power-sharing
relationship is stressed  (paras.  1.04, 4.04 and 5.03).   Fourthly,  the
dominant effect of Government policy on the financial viability of a
utility (para. 6.02), the problems caused by lack of foreign exchange to
purchase spare parts (para. 6.07) and the success of particular forms of
technical assistance (paras. 9.05 and 9.0g) are common findings with the
Kariba North Project Completion Report. b Lastly, as in the case of the
Kariba North Project, the importance of thorough ground investigation
during the preparation of a dam project is emphasized by the experience at
Kafue (para. 3.04).

KAFUE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT - STAGE II
LOAN 919-ZA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   INTRODUCTION
The Project
1.01           The  project  is  the  second  stage of  Kafue hydroelectric
development and consists of a dam at Itezhitezhi on the Kafue River to
provide storage, the installation of two additional 150-MW generating units
at the existing station located 250-km downstream of Itezhitezhi and a
60 km, 330-kV transmission line.
1.02        The project was implemented by the Zambia Electricity Supply
Corporation (ZESCO) generally as scheduled, meeting essential target dates.
The Power Sector
1.03       In 1963 the Central African Power Corporation (CAPC) was formed
by Zambia (Northern Rhodesia) and Zimbabwe (Southern Rhodesia) to take over
the assets, staff and functions of the dissolved Federal Power Board (FPB),
namely the supplying of bulk power to the two countries.   All major
generating stations in both countries are connected to the CAPC grid and
are operated by CAPC as owner or, in the case of Kariba North Power
Station,  a/ under  leasing arrangements.   The output was sold to five
distributing companies - The Copperbelt Power Company (CPC) and ZESCO in
Zambia, the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC), and the municipalities of
Harare and Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.   This interconnected system generated
13,897 GWh i/in FY 1983.
1.04      Over the years both Zambia and Zimbabwe have not been completely
satisfied with these bulk distribution procedures and the functioning of
CAPC. Zambia revised the financial a/ relationship between ZESCO, CPC and
CAPC in July 1977 (Section VI, para. 6.01) and has now entered into a joint
study with Zimbabwe, concerning the operations and future status of CAPC.
The recommendations of this study committee are scheduled to be available
shortly (para. 5.03).
1.05      ZESCO was incorporated on December 3, 1969, to be responsible for
all aspects of power generation, transmission and supply in Zambia other
than those functions performed by CPC, CAPC and the Kariba North Bank
Corporation (KNBC), the latter having been formed to construct the Kariba
North Bank Station.  In January, 1970, the Zambian Electricity Supply Act
became  effective,  which  vested  the  assets,  liabilities,  rights  and
obligations of existing electricity undertakings in ZESCO by statutory

order of the Hinister responsible for electricity.  On July 1, 1970, ZESCO
acquired the Central Electricity Corporation (CEC) which distributed power
to Lusaka and the surrounding areas, the Northern Electricity Supply
Gorporation (NESCO), which supplied small towns and villages In isolated
areas and the Victoria Falls Electricity Board (VFEB) which owned three
generating stations at Victoria Falls.  On January 1, 1972, ZESCO assumed
responsibility for the Livingstone municipal operations from VFEB and the
Ndola Council Electricity operations.  By July, 1972, ZESCO had also taken
over five municipal electricity operations in the Copperbelt area.
Currently ZESCO supplies all areas of Zambia except the Copperbelt mines
and the Broken Hill mines at Kabwe.
Bank Lending to the Power Sector
1.06        The Bank's first power operation in the region was a loan of
US$80 million (Loan 145-RN, June 21, 1956) to FPB to finance part of the
cost of the first stage of Kariba, consisting of a dam across the Zambesi
River, a 600 MW power station on the South Bank and a 330-KV transmission
system extending to principal centers of demand in Zambia and Zimbabwe.l/
The second loan for US$7.7 million (Loan 392-RNS, October 1, 1964) in 1964,
to CAPC, financed part of the cost of transmission expansion in Zambia.
Both loans were guaranteed by the U.K. Government as prime guarantor and
subsequently, by the Governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe.   The third Bank
loan of US$40 million (Loan 701-1, July 7, 1970) to KNBC was to finance the
second stage of Kariba, consisting of an underground power station on the
North Bank of the Zambesi River at Kariba with an installed capacity of
600 MW, a generating plant of four 150 MW turbo-generator units and a
transmission line to the main Kariba substation. A supplementary Bank loan
of US$42.1 million was approved in July 5, 1974, to cover additional
project  costs.    The  first  two  projects  were  completed  before  the
establishment of the Operations Evaluation Department, and completion
reports were not prepared.  The Kariba North Hydroelectric Project (Loans
701-1 and 701-2) was audited by OED and the report was distributed on
August 18, 1983.

2.01       The project is the second stage of the Kafue project which was
the means for achieving Government of Zambia's objective of self-
sufficiency in power for Zambia. a/ The Kafue project, in accordance with
CAPCO's system development plan (February, 1969), was also the recommended
project to follow Kariba North and the expansion of CAPC's generation and
transmission a/ system in Zambia and Zimbabwe.
1/   The name-plate rating of the six turbo-generators at Kariba South is
100 MW, but the machines were uprated to 117.5 MW after commissioning
based  on  judgment  of  their  delivery  capability.    Following  the
commissioning of the Kariba North Bank Power Station in 1976, CAPC
reassessed the capacity of each unit from 117.5 MW to 111 MW (in total
from 705 MW to 666 Mw).al

Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval
2.02        Feasibility studies and project preparation for the Itezhitezhi
reservoir  development  were  performed  during  1967-71.    These  studies
determined that the project represented the most economic method to provide
additional firm energy capability required to meet  the for-east energy
demand of the Zambian power system of which ZESCO's dystem forms a part.
In July, 1972, the Government of Zambia applied fo: Bank financing.   In
response, an appraisal mission visited Zambia in August, 1972, and a loan
equivalent to US$115 million became effective JanoAary 15, 1974.
The Project's Role in the Long-term Plan
2.03      The development of the hydroelectric potential of the Kafue River
has been overshadowed by the development of the Zambezi River at Kariba.
The debate as to whether Kariba or Kafue should have been developed first
dates from the time of the short-Lived Central African Federation
(1953-63). In early 1953 development of the first stage of Kafue was the
consultants'  least cost solution.   In spite of the ensuing opposition,
especially from the main industrial and mining consuners in the Copperbelt,
to the decision of the Federal Government to develop Kariba in preference
to the Kafue Scheme, the construction of the first stage of the Kariba
development (Loan 145-RN) began in 1955 and was completed in 1960.   Two
major Kariba developments followed (para. 1.06).  After Southern Rhodesia's
unilateral declaration of independence in November 1965, Zambia decided to
embark on the Kafue scheme with the objective of being self-sufficient in
meeting its own power demand, a/ and thus the first stage of the Kafue
hydroelectric development was begun in 1967 and completed in 1972.
2.04      The project for the second stage of the development of Kafue was
seen by the Government to be a continuation of developments to ensure
Zambian self-sufficiency in power. The Bank's appraisal mission viewed the
Kafue II Project in the context of the Zambia-Zimbabwe interconnected
system, and its analysis inaicates that a large proportion of the output
from Kafue II would be sold to Zimbabwe consumers under the CAPC
arrangement.   At that time the Zambia-Zimbabwe interconnected system was
and presently is operated by CAPC.   Subsequently,  Zimbabwe unilaterally
commenced development of thermal generation capacity based on coal to be
supplied from the Hwange coal fields.   Stage I (4x120 MW) and Stage II
(2x220 MW) are scheduled to be commissioned in 1984-86.   A new long-term
power plan for the combined Zambia/Zimbabwe system was prepared for the
Government of Zimbabwe in 1981 and updated in 1983, and it determined the
extensioa of the Kariba Hydroelectric Power complex to be the least-cost
option as the next project.  However, due to the uncertain demand outlook
and the historically complex relationship between Zambia and Zimbabwe in
power sector development, which is now undergoing review (para. 5.03), the
timing of a further project is not definite.
Project Description
2.05         The project consists of a storage dam on the Kafue River at
Itezhitezhi and a 300 MW addition to the Kafue power station located 250 km
downstream. The project increased the firm output of Kafue from 1800 GWh



- 4 -
to 5250 Gvh and the total average a/ annual generation from 3600 GWh to
6200 GWh. The main features of the project are:
(i)  a rock and earthfill dam, 1500 m in length and 55 m mzaximum
height;
(ii)  two diversion tunnels in rock, each with a cross sectional area
of 190 m2 and a length of 500 m, which incorporate regulating
structures and gates;
(iii) a concrete chute spillway with three radial gates;
(iv)  two 150 HW generating units at Kafue station with ancillary civil
works and switchyard extensions; and
(v) a 330 kV single circuit traasmission line, 60 km in length,
connecting the Kafue power station to the Kafue town grid
substation.
Covenants
2.06      The principal covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements are
shown, annotated, in Annex 2-1. They include safeguards for the standard
of engineering consultants and senior management to and in ZESCO, require-
meats for inspection of the dam, and conventional financial clauses.
IIl. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Startup
3.01       The loan was scheduled to become effective on October 15, 1973,
but iwas delayed until December 15 to allow for transfer of legal title of
Kafue Stage I to ZESCO.  Effectiveness was again delayed until January 15,
1974, to allow time to obtain complete understanding of the legal opinion.
Thus, the loan became effective on January 15, 1974, six months after
signature.
3.02         Some preparatory works, which included camp construction, a
transmission line to supply power to the construction site, a ferry for
crossing the Kafue at the damsite, and paving of the access road were
carried out in advance of the execution of the maiu works. In June, 1972,
ZESCO instructed its consultants to prepare tender documents for construc-
tion of the main dam.  The Bank was not associated with the preparatory
works which were substantially completed by October, 1973. The Bank was,
however, involved in the process for prequalification of civil works
contractors and in the selection of the contractor for construction of the
main dam and appurtenant works. This contract was awarded on May 15, 1973,
and the contractor was on site by mid-June, 1973.

Revisions
3.03        The substantial change to the project was the addition of 30
relief wells required to reduce high artesian pressures, and the installa-
tion of a system of pneumatic boostering for use under special circumr
stances. In September 1976 it was determined that the aquifer, because of
its great width and depth, has a very low flow velocity, and therefore,
will have very little effect on the safety of the dam.   The artesian
pressure of the aquifer, however, coald have an unfavorable effect on the
dam stability, and uncontrolled leakage from the aquifer downstream of the
dam could cause erosion in alluvium, mudstone or weathered rock, which,
over a long period, might affect the supporting fill causing settlements
and slides. The relief wells control the aquifer by discharging the flow
downstream at lower head losses than would occur at discharge at natural
springs.  The cost of this effort was about US$6 million equivalent.
3.04      Other design changes and variations were:
(i) use of concrete lining of bottom and side walls of tL2 diversion
tunnel outlet canal necessitated by the quality of the rock;
(ii)  use of rockfill in downstream berm to facilitate future raising
of the dam;
(iii) installation of an emergency spillway to ensure means of
discharge if one of the main spillway gates were to become
inoperative;
(iv)  modification of design of main dam to allow use of unclassified
rock, thus offsetting prior delays in fill work;
Cv) use of impervious fill at spillway of wing dam, lining of the
walls of the channel and weighted berm on filter downstream due
to foundation rock being pervious;
(vi)  repair of cavitation damage to bulkhead gates of the diversion
tunnels including steel lining, resulting from discharges during
construction period;
(vii) use of rock fiLl in front of intake and outlet canals of diver-
sion tunnels; and
(viii) omission of radio link system.
Although these changes did not have a significant effect on construction
costs, they do show the need for adequate ground investigations at dam
sites during the project preparation stage.
Implementation Schedule
3.05       Construction work on the dam had been scheduled to start during
the latter half of 1973 and the reservoir was scheduled to be filled during
1978.  Prior to initiation of the project, the water conductor system of
the power station and the power house excavation had been completed as part



- 6 -
of Stage I. Work related to Stage Is (the project) at the power station
involved mainly the steel lining of penstocks and the installation of the
generating units scheduled for the end of 1976.
3.06       The Itezhitezhi reservoir was filled to fuLl retention for the
first time on June 2, 1978, in accordance with the schedule.
3.07   The two generating units  (numbers 5 and 6) were scheduled for
commissioning on October 1 and December 15, 1976, respectively. Actual
commissioning took place on April 28 and May 25, 1977, due to earlier
delays in the installation of the erection program for the generators and
control equipment.  Completion  of  the  penstock steel  linings was also
delayed due to an inability to obtain steel of the prescribed quality for
the lower parts of the linings, but this delay did not influence the date
of commissioning as the linings were available in time to meet the revised
erection schedule.
3.08       During testing of the turbines, troubles were experienced with
settings of mechanical overspeed guards which required the modification of
the guards.
3.09       The transformer bank of three single units and the three 330 kV
cables with auxiliary equipment were scheduled to be commissioned on
October  1,  1976.    This  schedule  could  not be  met  due  to  transport
problems. The 330 kV cable failed before the start of the trial run. SiLa
repair was unsuccessful and a new cable had to be manufactured. This new
cable was put in service in August, 1977, but failed after one month's
operation. The transformers were commissioned on April 28, 1977, utilizing
the spare cables as replacement for the cable that failed.
3.10       The delay in commissioning did not cause any significant loss in
usable a/ energy production as the existing four units were capable of
consuming the total water flow at that time.   Liquidatiag damages were
obtained from the manufacturers of the cable to cover the extra costs
resulting from the longer stay of the engineering staff and the additional
costs of other contractors resulting from the delay in commissioning.
Procurement
3.11        All goods and services costing over US$20,000 were procured
through  international  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  Bank
guidelines, with no regional preference.   Prospective contractors on the
dam and larger contracts were  prequalified.   On the Itezhitezhi dam,
twenty-five firms were prequalified, including eight from West Germany,
five from Italy, three each from U.K. and Yugoslavia, two each from France
and U.S., and one from Greece and Sweden. Ten submitted bids. Ten firms
from various countries prequalified for the 330 kV switchgear and
transformer connection. Bids on the dam were opened on January 26, 1973,
while power house bids were not opened until the end of 1973. Contracts
were awarded as follows:

3.12       Procurement was carried according to Bank practices and there do
not appear to have been any problems arising from this requirement.
Problems did occur from insufficient planning by the contractors,
manufacturing delays, inability to obtain prescribed steel for penstock
linings, and transport problems from the port to the site.
3.13        Two engineeriag consultants were retained, one for the 330 kV
transmission line, and the other for all other aspects of the project. The
contract with the main consultant was an existing contract with the
Government which had been assumed by ZESCO. Payment under the contract was
based on percent of the construction costs (5% plus reimbursables). This
contract approach was not very satisfactory to either party, as ZESCO was
required to pay reimbursable expenditures which were not under its control,
and the consultant was concerned about a ceiling on cost variations.
Although the terms were interpreted and revised to everyone's satisfaction,
a specific contract for the work to be performed under the project based on
manmonths of effort would have been a better approach.

Costs and Disbursements
3.14        A comparison of the appraisal estimate of project costs with
actual project costs is shown in Annex 3-1.   Total project costs of
US$148.4 million were US$8 million (5Z) below the appraisal estimate of
US$156.4 million. Construction costs of the dam were US$16.5 million (15Z)
below the estimate, partially offset by the high costs of the power house
and transmission system, and interest during construction being over the
estimated US$3.3 milLion (13Z) and US$5.1 million (27X), respectively.
Thus, overall actual costs were very close to the estimate, despite
considerable inflation during the implementation period and various
revisions to the works (para. 3.04). This good performance is partly due
to the Bank's engagement of a consultant to make an independent estimate of
the costs of the main civil works prior to agreement on these costs. The
most significant overrun was in interest during construction due, to a
large extent, to a longer than originally planned implementation period.
3.15      The Bank's disbursements under the loan were slightly behind the
estimation at appraisal, and at the close of FY79, when full disbursement
was expected, ran about 6X below the figure even though the project was
complete.  The Bank agreed to extend the closing date of the project to
December 31, 1982, and to make the remaining undisbursed loan funds
available for drilling more relief wells and associated civil works, if
needed to control the aquifer problem (para. 3.03). In 1982 ZESCO requested
that the closing date be deferred to December 31, 1983 and that the excess
funds be made available for spare parts and maintenance services.  This
request was denied on the grounds that these costs should be handled under
aormal maintenance and replacement procedures.
3.16       Although the loan was closed December 31, 1982, withdrawals for
eligible expenditures incurred prior to che closing date were allowed up to
June 30, 1983.  On July 8, 1983, ZESCO was informed that the undisbursed
balance of the loan, in the amount of US$4,07,101.28, was cancelled as of
lay 4, 1983, the last withdrawal date.
Operations
3.17       Phase II of the Kafue Gorge Power Station was commissioned in
April and May of 1977, but no contribution could be made to the Zambian
system until September 1977 due to a fault in the cable to the Phase II
transformer.a/     The output of the station was further restricted  in
October, 1977, by an earth fault on the low voltage winding of a Phase I
transformer.  This transformer was temporarily replaced by the Phase II
transformer whose cable had failed.a/    These problems were not cleared
until the first quarter of 1980 Gpara. 3.23).   However, they did not
seriously affect the interconnected system, as power demand was lower than
had been anticipated (para. 4.02). The Itezhitezhi reservoir was filled to
full retention level for the first time on June 2, 1978.
Ecological Aspects
3.18      The project was examined for potential environmental effects at
appraisal, in particular the consequences of the elimination of the
a/ ZESCO's comment - see Appendix A.



flooding of the Kafue Flats below the dam during dry years. Such flooding
is essential for the growth of the grass upon which a large number of
animals survive, including a rare antelope, the Lechwe. After two years of
the project's operation this was found to be fully compensated for by
augmentation of the low flows of the river by special releases from the
storage reservoir. No monitoring was set up so the success of this measure
is uncertain.
3.19          By the time of the project  the Kafue Gorge hydroelectric
development had already stimulated the University of Zambia to establish a
Kafue Basin Research Project (KBRC, 1967) to "encourage a balanced program
of incerdisciplinary research and to contribute to the planned development
of the Kafue Basin.  As a result a selection of papers were published 2/,
which pioneered acceptance of the need for an integrated approach to the
development  of energy resources.   As the energy sectors of Sub-Saharan
African ce.intries are being comprehensively assessed the case for this is
becoming increasingly clear.
3.20       The appraisal report mentions the precautions necessary against
schistosorniasis and tsetse flies which would presenc a health hazard to the
labor force working on the project.   No specific follow-up to this was
found on file.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and the Borrower
3.21           The  technical  competence displayed at all levels  of  the
consulting engineers' organization dealing with the project was acceptable,
and their performance overall was satisfactory.   They acted promptly and
represented ZESCO generally with fairness to the contractors. Some
differences did occur between LESCO and the consultants on the need for an
emergency spillway, the criticality of alluvial flow in the diversion inlet
channel, the timing for the erection of the regulation gate, and the need
for design of the penstock steel lining.   Rowever, these differences must
be considered, to a great degree, subjective, as they refLect different
concepts  of  design  to  fulfill  a  structural  requirement.    ZESCO  has
concluded from the experience that no amount of expertise in the consult-
ancy sulpport can replace competent corporate personnel. They consider that
their staff and the consultants cooperated well and collectively performed
effectively.   The consultants continued to inspect the dam periodically
after completion in 1979 to check that no oroblems were developing.
..22            The  panel  of  experts  performed  extremely  effectively,
particularLy in relation to a critical aquifer problem which developed
during construction. Although the Government of Zambia and ZESCC initially
believed chat this panel should serve as advisors to the consultants rather
chan ZESCO, their opinion now is that it vould have been better to have had
them advise ZESCO directly with the full cooperation of the consultants.
3.23      The performances of the various contractors were as follows:

Itezhitezhi Dam
(a) Access road - completed in early 1970, on schedule;
(b)  Permanent camp - completed in mid-1973, on schedule but requiring
some accelerating measures;
(c) Ferry and landing - completed on mid-1973, on schedule;
(d) Permanent access road - completed in mid-1973, on schedule
despite need to extend it to meet the new Fusaka road;
(e) Transmission line - completed in mid-1973, on schedule;
(f)  Diversion tunnel -  construction was significantly delayed due to
insufficient planning by contractor. Delay was not detrimental to
the other works;
(g) Spillway - manufacture of radial gates was delayed but delivery
was in time to prevent any effect on project schedule;
(h) Main civil works - This work was subjected to major design
changes during implementation.   It appears that the contractor
underbid for the project which resulted in major funding
problems. Generally, the workmanship was good, but management
difficulties were apparent and reliance on second hand construc-
tion equipment was evident.
Kafue Gorge Power Station Extension
(a) Civil works - Commissioning was delayed, but did not cause any
serious problems;
Cb) Turbines, valves, cooling, drainage and revatering plant -
Commissioned on April 28 and May 25, 1977, rather than the
scheduled October 1 and December 15, 1976.  During tests of the
turbines some trouble with setting mechanical overspeed guards
was experienced and the guards had to be modified. The turbines
then performed very well, causing no power losses. The coopera-
tion of the contractor was very good;
(c) Penstock steel linings - The steel iinings were delayed in
manufacture, but did not seriously affect the other contractors
or cause any additional delay.  The contractor could aot obtain
the prescribed quality of steel and hamd to modify the design to
accept a lower quality steeL. The cooperation of the contractor
was good, and the standard of work was satisfactory.
(d) Generators - The generators were commissioned on April 28 and May
5, 1977 rather than October 10 and December 15, 1976. The initial
delay was due to an insufficient number of erectors and the
lengthy operation for balancing the rotor of unit 5. During the
first year of operation the overvoltage protection capacitors in
the excitacion system were damaged and a fault developed in a

winding bar of uutt 6, requiring replacement of the bar. Except
for these faiLures, the quality of the work was good and the
generators performed well;
(e) Transformers and cables - The plant was commissioned on
December 6, 1976, rather than as scheduled on October 1, 1976.
The major cause for the delay was transport problems. However,
the 330 kV cable failed before the trial run and had to be
replaced. The replacement cable failed in August 1977, seriously
limiting the unit's contribution to the interconnected system.
This failure was the manufacturer's responsibility and would have
had extremely serious effects had demand not been lower than
forecast.   Other than the cable, the quality of the work was
good;
(f)  330 kV Switchyard,  330  kV connecting  line - The plant was
commissioned on April 28, 1977, rather than as scheduled on
October 1, 1976. The quality of the work and the cooperation of
the  contractor  were  very  good.    The  plant  has  performed
effectively;
(g)  Generator switching station, control equipment, local power and
lighting - This equipment was also commissioned in April and May,
1977 rather than as scheduled on October 1, 1976.  The standard
of work and the cooperation of the contractor was very good. The
equipment has performed without problems.
3.24      The performance of the borrower has been satisfactory.  Staffing
is reasonably well organized.   Maintenance procedures are in accordance
with manuals and good records are maintained. The major operating problem
has been lack of spare parts due primarily to lack of foreign exchange for
their purchase.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market
4.01        The performance of ZESCO in the bulk and retail power sales
markets is the key to the prospects for the Kafue Stage II Project. There
has been a significant shortfall to date in market growth, both in Zambia
and Zimbabwe, compared to the power demand forecast made at the time of
appraisal. Furthermore, there are poor prospects for demand in the region
increasing quickly to absorb the potential for power production from Kafue
Stage II, especially with regard to exports to Zimbabwe. Developing trends
in demand during the 1970s and early l980s and the decision of Government
of  Zimbabwe  to  develop  indigenous,  coal-fired  generating  capacity
(para. 2.04) have removed the prospects for achieving the appraisal
forecast of selling the full output from Kafue Stage II from the early
1980s.  In contrast, there appears to be strong prospects that the demand
on ZESCO's generation facilities to the late 1980s could be met from
installed generation capacity without Kafue Stage II.



- 12 -
4.02       Government of Zambia's decision to proceed with Stages I and II
of the Kafue project was based on its own forecast for the Zambian system,
taking into account CAPCO's requirements.a/   The Bank's appraisal of the
Kafue Stage II Project was based on a market forecast prepared by CAPC in
1972, which was during a period of high optimism for growth in export-
oriented industries and mines in the region, but was also shortly before
the onset of the slowdown in worldwide economic growth resulting from the
1973 increases in oil prices.   CAPC's forecast growth  rate for demand
prepared in 1972 for the period to 1980 was 36 percent higher than the
corresponding growth rate forecast by CAPC in 19b9 for the Kariba North
Project appraisal (Annex 4-1).  The forecast and actual growth rates for
the period 1973-1980 are as follows:
Combined
Zambia   Zimbabwe   System
…Z/------ Zlyedr      …
Kafue II Appraisal forecast (1972)               6         10          8.3
Kariba North Appraisal forecast (1969)           6          6.2       6.1
Actual average growth rate                       2.6        6.0       4.4
By 1980, actual enetgy demand on the Zambian system (5,478 GWh) was 31
percent below the level forecast in the Kafue II appraisal (7,891 GWh), and
on the combined system (12,327 GWh) was 25 percent below the level forecast
in the Kafue II appraisal (16,416 GWh) and 11 percent below the level
forecast in the Kariba North appraisal (13,923 GWh). It is noteworthy that
the Kafue II AppraisaL Report makes no reference to the Kariba North
Appraisal demand forecast, particularly the reason for the substantial
increase in forecast growth.
4.03          Even though actual  demand had diverged  significantly  from
forecast demand by 1980, by the time that the project had been substan-
tially  completed  (1976),  the  variance  was  still  only  7  percent.
Consequently, the development of power demand during the implementation of
the Kafue II Project was not sufficiently at variance with the appraisal
forecast to warrant reappraisal of the timing of the project or the
possibility of dividing it into phases to spread out the investment over a
longer period.
4.04        Significant shortfalls between forecast and actual power demand
developed from 1977 onwards in both Zambia and Zimbabwe.   Nevertheless,
ZESCO has been able to export substantial quantities of power to Zimbabwe
up to 1983 (Annex 4-2), latterly due to abnormally low rainfalLs in the
Zambezi catchment area which has reduced Zimbabwe's allocated hydroelecCric
production. 3/  This level of exports is u-iikely to be maintained once
Zimbabwe commissions its coal-fired generation capacity (para. 2.04).
Throughout the latter part of the 1970s, power demand in Zambia registered
little growth due to the depressed state of the Zambian copper industry,
3/ If this situation persists, the firm energy rating of the hydroelectric
stations on the Zambezi and Kafue rivers would need to be reviewed and
possibly decreased, and the analysis of system power and energy balances
given in Annexes 4-2 and 4-3 of this report would have to be modified
accordingly.

which accounted for over  80% of total Zambian demand for power.   The
development of significant shortfalls also coincided with the change in
operating arrangements between ZESco and CAPC (para. 6.01), which resulted
in ZESCO taking on responsibility for distributing power throughout Zambia
and providing CAPC with power for Zimbabwe. In turn, CAPC was relieved of
the obligation to purchase the power produced from Kafue and Victoria Falls
power stations.  In the light of subsequent developments in market demand,
it is evident that the change in the arrangements has placed the full
financial burden of any attributable a/ underutilization of Kafue II's
capacity  onto ZESCO.   It  is probable  that  there will  be  substantial
underutilization up to the mid-1990s in terms of attributable sales 4/ to
Kafue Stage II (para. 7.03).
Project Role
4.05      The appraisal report indicates that the output from Kafue II was
foreseen to be required from 1978 to meet forecast growth in energy demand
in both Zambia and Zimbabwe  (Annex 4-2).   Thus,  the appraisal  report
foresaw an export role for the project, whereas Government of Zambia
considered the project as necessary for Zambian self-sufficiency in
power.a/   In fact, without the Kafue II Project, the Zambian system could
have mec actual Zambian demand at least to the present (Annex 4-2).
Furthermore, the combined Zambia/Zimbabwe system could have met actual
demand up to 1981 and would have experienced only relatively small deficits
in capacity and energy in 1982, 1983, and 1984. 5/ ZESCO's prospects for
marketing the potential attributabLe power from Kafue II appears to
deteriorate rapidly for the remainder of the 1980s due to lack of growth in
demand from Zambian sines and industries, and to the loss of the Zimbabwe
market for some years following commissioning of the Hwange coal-fired
generation  units  (para.  2.04).    CAPC  has  prepared  new  power  demand
4/ Potential attributable power is defined as the incremental marketable
power from Kafue Stage 1I after the full potential power from previously
installed  generating  capacity  has  been  allocated  to demand.    Thus
attributable power is less than actual production from Kafue Stage II to
the extent that other stations, installed prior to Kafue Stage II, are
not operated at full output.   For instance, in 1983 actual production
from other stations was 6,403 GWh compared to a firm energy capability
of 7,469 GWh.  Thus, attributable power to Kafue Stage II was 2,263 GWh
compared to actual production of 3,329 GWh.
5/ ZESCO, in its comments on a draft version of this report (see appendix),
noted that the combined Zambian/Zimbabwe system would have experienced
serious  energy  deficits  in  1982 and  1983 without Kafue  II due  to
abnormally low rainfalls in the region, and that Kafue II's output would
be required if low rainfalls continue.  Rovever, even during these years
Zambian production capability without Kafue II was adequate  to meet
Zambian demnand alone, thus satisfying Goveenment's objective of self-
sufficiency.
a/ ZESCO's comment - see Appendix A.

forecasts for Zambia and Zimbabwe in which the mediur-term annual growth
rates have been reduced to 3 percent and 4 percent respectively. Projected
capacity and energy balances for the Zambian and Zimbabwean systems based
on CAPC's latest demand forecast (Annex 4-3) show that the Zambian system
without Kafue 1t could meet Zambian demand to 1988, and that Zimbabwe will
not require imports of electrical energy from Zambia between 1986 and 1994
if  the Government  of  Zimbabwe  follows  a policy of maximizing use of
domestic generation capacity and minimizing reliance on imports. There is
evidence that the Zimbabwean Government intends to follow this policy,
despite the present extremely low bulk tariff rate for sales from Zambia to
Zimbabwe  (presently  equivalent  to  US¢0.7/kWh).    During  this  period,
Zimbabwe would need to rely on the Zambian system for some peaking and
reserve capacity which Zambia could provide with its facilities excluding
the Kafue Stage II capacity.
4.06       In such circumstances, the prospects for relatively slow growth
in Zambian demand due to the deterioration in the world copper market,
together with Zimbabwe's policy of avoiding substantial dependence upoa
imports from Zambia, is likely to have resulted in Zambia investing in the
Kafue II Project many years before the project was required.   The firm
capacity and energy capability of Zambian generation facilities excluding
Kafue Stage II would be adequate to meet CAPC's latest forecast Zambian
demand up to 1988, some eleven years after Kafue Stage II was commis-
sioned. From 1988, some of Kafue II's potential output would be required
only to meet growth in Zambian demand until 1995. Thereafter, up to about
a third of the output would be exported to Zimbabwe with the proportion
declining from 1998 with growth in Zambian demand. Thus, Zambia could have
delayed the investment of nearly US$150 million (in mid 1970s price terms)
for about eleven years at a loss of export revenue of about US$5 million in
1982/84 due to small deficits in energy capability on the combined Zambia/
Zimbabwe system (Annex 4-2), which would have resulted in some power
shortages in Zimbabwe but not in Zambia.  The revised estimated economic
rate of return of the project is low (para. 7.03) as a result of the
forecast low atLributable sales to the project.  In retrospect, therefore,
the heavy capital investment in the Kafue II Project has not generated an
economic return to Zambia but has benefitted Zimbabwe to a limited extent,
especially at the low bulk tariff rate.
4.U7         Although the subsequent development of indigenous coal-fired
capacity by Zimbabwe without regard to optimal development and operation of
the combined Zambia/Zimbabwe system has turned out to be of major signifi-
cance for the economics of the Kafue II Project due to lower growth in
demand than forecast, at the time of appraisal it would not have appeared
so even if such development had been considered, since the forecast demand
growth rates were sufficiently high to give reasonable prospects of a
market for Kafue II output in thits eventuality.   Furthermore, the CAPC
system that existed in Zambia and Zimbabwe at the time of appraisal was
still being treated and operated as one system, and thus the concept of
exports was not deemed  significant.   In this situation,  the Kafue II
Project was identified by CAPC as the best option for meeting forecast
demand on its system according to the determined least-cost development
program for the CAPC system. In practice, there has been surplus capacity
on  the  combined  Zambian/Zimbabwe  System  since  the  commissioning  of
Kafue II.  The agreement of July 1, 1977 (para. 6.01) has proved to be



- 15 -
detrimental to the market for production from Kafue II (para. 4.04). The
lesson for future projects is that in cases where after commissioning the
project, it emerges that the main market for its output is different from
the appraisal forecast, in this case the market became exports to Zimbabwe,
the Bank should have the power to be consulted on any proposal that
prejudices sales to this market.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organization Effectiveness
5.01       In early 1975 ZESCO engaged management consultants to review and
appraise its organization structure of all operations and activities of
ZESCO except those of a strictly technical/engineering nature.  The final
report of this study was issued in November 1975.  The recommendations of
the study were approved by the Board with some amendments after much
deliberation and delay and were tuade effective January 1, 1979. Under the
new structure, the three administrative areas were replaced by Functional
Divisions within each district.
5.02          However,  the new organization was beset with difficulties
relating to the establishment of these strong district units due to
scarcity of experienced personnel and lack of funds for implementing the
reorganization. Therefore adjustments were made merging the Rural division
with the Distribution and Supply division and by splitting this division to
cover the activities of North and South. The position of Chief Engineer
was reintroduced in all divisions.
5.03        In spite of these numerous organizational changes during the
recent years, personnel shortages, uncertainties over the final organiza-
tion of the sector and severe financial constraints, ZESCO has provided
reasonable service. However it would appear that the effectiveness of the
power sector could be improved significantly by a redefinition of the roles
of ZESCO, CAPC, the Kariba North Bank Company Ltd. (KNBC) and the Copper-
belt Power Company (CPC), and by the merging of similar functions which are
being performed by two or more entities.  The merging of functions would
more effectively utilize the scarce management and technical expertise, and
a redefinition of the planning and operational roles of ZESCO and CAPC is
deemed to be urgently needed.   As a result of this urgency, the Higher
Authority for Power (HAP) which was established in 1963, a/ to safeguard
the interests of Zambia and Zimbabwe has established a committee to examine
the functions and future role of CAPC in Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Bank was
requested to nominate and cover the costs of an independent chairman. The
remainder of the committee is composed of four members from each country.
The report of this committee is expected shortly.
Growth
5.04       ZESCO experienced considerable growth during the 1972/82 period
which would have been greater had there not have been a recession in the
metal industries (para. 4.04). Some measures of growth follow:

Staff Recruitment and Training
5.05      In view of ZESCO's satisfactory training practices at the time of
appraisal there was no specific training component to the project.
However,  ZESCO's  personnel  policies,  training  and  recruitment  programs
aimed at employment of Zambians in all posts for operators, clerical,
administrative and craft staff by 1976, for technicians and engineers by
1980 and for all management  shortly thereafter.   These goals were not
completely achieved due to shortages of qualified local personnel,
particularly in the higher level posts, but some success was realized as
shown below.  The major success was that in 1974 a/ the post of general
manager was filled by a Zambian for the first time. A comparison of total
personnel and expatriate staff follows:

program for recruitment and training.   Graduate engineers are recruited
from the University of Zambia and other universities and are trained in a
two year studentship program..  Technicians are trained at the Northern
Technical College in Ndola and the Zambia Institute of Technology in Kitwe,
respectively. Craftsmen are trained in the six Government Trades Training
Institutes.   After recruitment these personnel also undergo an internal
training program for 12 to 18 months.
5.07        Accountancy training has not been readily available in Zambia.
Recently courses leading to local awards have been instituted and these
courses and overseas training have been used by ZESCO to the extent
possible.    However  ZESCO  continues  to  depend  heavily  on  expatriate
accounting personnel.
5.08       ZESCO's training activities are conducted in training centers at
Ndola and Kafue Gorge.  The Ndola center opened in March 1971 and to date
has trained 400 employees in electrical/mechanical crafts. The Kafue Gorge
center has operated since July 1974 for the training of plant operators and
control engineers.
5.09      Overseas training facilities have been utilized when the required
courses were not available in Zambia. The number of employees enrolled in
overseas courses has increased from 2 in 1973 to 14 in 1980 and 32 in 1982.
5.10       ZESCO's recruiting and training efforts have not been completely
effective as it has not been able to maintain its staff at the approved
established level.  ZESCO believes that the unattractiveness of its salary
scales prevents it from attracting required senior staff in both the local
and expatriate markets.  At March 31, 1983 there were 106 vacancies (only
2% of the authorized staff).   However these vacencies appeared  in the
higher technical positions and therefore had a greater effect on ZESCO's
performance.    There  is  no  record  of  ZESCO  consulting  the  Bank  on
appointments of Chief Engineer and Financial Controller, although this was
required  by  covenant.    However,  those  appointed  appear  to have  been
competent and the Bank would probably not have had any difficulty in
accepting the appointments. Details are as follow:

Management Consultants
5.11        Although not initially a part of the project, as a result of
accounting problems encountered (para. 5.01) management consultants were
funded under the project to evaluate the accounting system, introduce
budgetary  control,  set  up  a  management  information  system,  introduce



- 18 -
financial controls, evaluate staffing and training of the accounts
department, institute financial forecasting, review the organization
structure and evaluate the proposal to obtain in-house computer
capability. The consultants' recommendations were implemented from early
1976; as a result ZESOD and the consultants have:
(i) established an effective accounting and information system;
(ii) significantly reduced the time required to process accounting
data and have made annual financial results available within two
months;
(iii) established an effective budgetary control system with defined
cost centers;
(iv) decided to install in-house computing facilities; and
(v)  initiated a new organLzation structure (January 1, 1979).
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Arrangements
6.01      The details of the actual financial statements vary significantly
from the projected statements at appraisal due to changes in operating
arrangements with the Central .4frican Power Corporation (CAPC) and the
Copperbelt Power Company (CPC) effected July 1, 1977. At appraisal it was
assumed that CAPC would purchase all the available power from the Kafue
Hydroelectric Facility. 6/ However, effective July 1, 1977 the following
changes were initiated:
Ci)  benefits and costs of the Kariba Facility were to be shared
equally between ZESCO and CAPC;
(ii) CAPC's transmission costs in Zambia were to be reimbursed by
ZESCO;
(iii) ZESCO's Southern Area ceased to purchase power from CAPC;
(iv) ZESCO started to supply power to CPC;
(v)  ZESCO's Copperbelt Area ceased to purchase power from CPC; and
(vi)  ZESCO pays CPC a rental for the use of CPC's transmission network
in the Copperbelt Area.
These changes are responsible for many of the variances in actual revenues
and expenses from the appraisal forecast but did not affect the overall
6/   ZESCO and CAPC concluded an agreement on December 28, 1973 under which
ZESCO would sell all power generated at Kafue and Victoria Falls Power
Stations to CAPC.



- 19 -
variance in the financial performance of ZESCO.  Comparative financial
statements are included as Annexes 6-1 through 6-3.
Financial Performance and Compliance with Covenants
6.02       The major failure in the project was the inabiliry of ZESCO to
generate adequate earnings during the projecr period.  Demand was weaker
than foreseen at appraisal (para. 4.02). M1oreover. Zambia's sales tariff
to Zimbabwe was inequitably low (USt0.7/kWh). In addition, ZESCO took over
responsibility from CAPC for supplying bulk power to CPC in 1977 (para.
6.01) at rates that have subsequently been ever lower than to CAPC, thus
providing a heavy subsidy to the copper industry.   The resulting lower
earnings position was constantly brought to the attention of the Borrower
and  the Government.   The  Bank reviewed  and  supported ZESCO's  tariff
revision proposals and financed a financial management study to develop
improved practices for control of operating costs and for the projection of
future costs.   For the most part the Bank's efforts did not aipear to
improve ZESCO's earnings position, and the required retail tariff revisLons
were not implemented. Actual tariff revisions are detailed in Annex 6-4.
6.03       At appraisal it was anticipated that ZESCO would earn a rate of
return on net plant in operations, properly valued, varying from 8.1Z in
FY74 to 9.1% in FY80. The rate of return convenant was set at 8% beginning
in FY75 which was expected to produce internal funds adequate to finance an
average of about 26% of the construction prograa costs.   ZESC0's actual
performance was significantly below this estimate and in no year met the 8%
rate of return requirement of Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement. Annual
earnings performance was as follows:
Contribution
Rate ce Return            to Construction
Fiscal Year               (X)                        (Z)
1974                    6.4                        11
1975                    3.4                        17
1976                    3.9                        16
1977                   4.3                          1
1978                    5.1                        19
1979                    0.8                        NEG
1980                   2.7                         46
1981                   6.3                         30
1982                   6.6                         18
It is significant that since no revaluation of assets has occurred and no
formula for revaluation was agreed, the above rates of return reflect an
historical cost investment base.   Rates of return computations based on
revalued assets bases would probably be about 30 to 50Z below these rates
of return.
6.04        The financial performance anticipated at appraisal was partly
predicated on retail tariff increases of 25% on July 1, 1973 and 10% in
FY78 and retail power sales increasing from 1,165 GWh in FY73 to 2,423 GWh
in FY80 (actual was 1,064 GWh and 1,404 GWh respectively).   Because of
considerably lower retail demand for power on ZESCO's facilities during the



- 20 -
project period than forecast at the time of appraisal, greater tariff
increases were required to meet the fixed costs of operations. Delays in
the implementation of tariff increases and the adoption of lower levels of
increases  than required  further  aggravated  this  situation.   The  1973
increase was made effective in October 1973 and produced only a 10% revenue
increase.   The second tariff revision during the project implementation
period was made effective September 1, 1979 and resulted in about a 25Z
revenue increase when studies established the requirement at 40 to 50Z.
ZESCO, in September 1975, submitted a tariff proposal calling for an
average increase of 40%. Government rejected this proposal on the grounds
that it was inflationary and would hurt domestic consumers. Again in April
of 1976, ZESCO submitted a proposal to increase industrial tariffs along
the lines of the previous proposal. Government deferred its consideration
awaiting revisions of the bulk agreement with CAPC. This tariff policy has
contributed significantly to ZESCO's poor earnings performance during the
FY73-80 period. Details of the Retail Tariffs are shown in Anne'c 6-4.
6.05         As stated in paragraph 6.04, one of the major contributing
factors to ZESCO's poor financial performance was lower than the
anticipated retail demand for power resulting primarily from the general
economic recession during this period versus the optimistic outlook at the
time of appraisal.  A comparison of the appraisal projection and actual
retail sales made by ZESCO retail demand during this period follows:

6.06       A second factor which adversely effected ZESCO's operations was
the rural electrificati,n program.   Rural operations have continued to
produce losses during the entire period and by FY82 reached K 7 million.
These losses result from the high cost of operating diesel stations and the
low  load factors  of  these stations.    ZESCO has  attempted,  with  some
success, to mitigate these losses by connecting isolated stations to the
main grid when possible and using the diesel units as standby.   However,
rural development has been a high priority of Government, which has con-
sidered power as the catalyst for bringing economic development to rural



- 21 -
areas. Thus rural activities have continued in spite of losses. It would
appear that rural electrification should be inititated more selectively,
giving priority to areas with strong economic potential, and that funding
of these operations during the interim period until they are viable should
be obtained from a subsidy produced by a special addition to the retail
tariff or, less desirably, from a grant from Government.
6.07         Another factor which has limited ZESCO's ability to provide
services to existing consumers in the quantity desired and to connect
additional consumers has been the lack of foreign exchange available in
Zambia.   ZESCO's operating and capital expenditures have a high foreign
exchange (material) component, and therefore ZESCO has not been able to
obtain the materials and equipment to expand and to maintain its system.
ZESCO had requested that the unutilized funds of the Bank loan for this
project be used to provide some foreign exchange for this purpose.    The
Bank did not approve this request as the unutilized funds had been
allocated for the drilling of relief wells and associated civil works at
the Itezhitezhi dam; no exception was made to Bank policy that funds for
maintenance should be generated through operations or be provided by
Government's giving reasonable foreign exchange priority for such purposes.

The significant change in the debt-equity ratio in FY76 resulted from
Government's conversion of K 60.3 million of its loans to ZESCO into
equity.  ZESCO has requested further conversions to improve its financial
structure and reduce its debt servicing requirement.   As shown above the
debt service coverage has become critical following the end of the 5 L/2
year grace period on the project's Bank Loan in 1979.   Government has
reviewed this situation on numerous occasions but has not as yet decided on
any additional capital structure changes or further tariff increases
required to meet the increased debt service costs.

Financing Plan
6.09        A summary of the financing plan during the seven years period
FY73-79 appears on the following page.  These data illustrate that the
shortfall of revenue caused by lower than foreseen sales volume and tariffs
and the extension of the project implementation period forced ZESCO to take
on substantially more debt than had been expected at the time of appraisal.

Audit
6.10       Throughout the 1973-82 period ZESCO's accounts were audited by
a British firm of chartered accouatants.   ZESCO and the Government have
been satisfied with their performance and the Bank has been satisfied with
the reports produced by them.  Since actual construction under the project
was virtually completed in 1977, ZESCO ceased sending annual financial
statements in accordance with Section 5.02 of the Loan Agreement which
states that the certified copies of its financial statements should be
forwarded to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the report
year. These reports were completed during the third or fourth month after
the end of the respective fiscal year, but they were obtained during the
completion mission's August 1983 visit to Lusaka and found to be completely
satisfactory.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
7.01       At the _ime of appraisal the cost of the project was compared to
the costs of the development of hydroelectric sites on the Zambesi River,
including extension of the Kariba complex, and it was determined that Kafue
II would be the lowest cost option for providing firm energy and capacity.
Kafue II was also compared with a thermal power station at the Maamba
Colleries in Zambia for which special boilers would have been required as
the coal has a low calorif ic value of about 8000 BTUs/lb and a very high
ash content (40%).   Its construction might have posed problems and was
expected to be about 26% more costly  than Kafue II.  Thus even without
giving consideration to the significant fuel price increases which have
occurred during recent years, the Kafue II project would have remained the
least cost solution to meeting the appraisal forecast increase in demand.
Rowever, in the light of subsequent market developments and forecast
trends, the least-cost solution would have been to delay implementatioa of
Kafue II until the late 1980s, even though it would still have been the
next project for Zambia (para. 4.06).
7.02       At appraisal it was foreseen that the third stage of Kafue 7/
would  be  commissioned  by  end-1979.    In  1976,  it  was  shown  by  the
consultants that the Kariba North Bank Extension 8/ should be the next
project in the least-cost development program as Zimbabwe (post UDI
Rhodesia) had started the construction of the coal-fired 480 MW Hwange
Power Station - Stage 1.   The  third stage of the Kafue Project was
scheduled to be commissioned by 1980, however preparation work on it was
stopped  when  it was  clear that  the demands  for electricity  in both
countries were  not growing as expected  due to the worldwide economic
recession, crisis in the world copper industry and civil war in Zimbabwe
(para. 4.02).
Economic Rate of Return
7.03         A revised rate of return of the Kafue II Project has been
calculated on the basis of a number of assumptions about future operations
including CAPC's January  1984 demand forecast  (para. 4.05).   The most
critical assumption is that the retail tariff for power in Zambia and the
bulk sales tariff to CAPC are increased in line with inflation in
Zambia. 9/ Benefits are computed from attributable retail sales in Zambia
and bulk sales to CAPC (for export to Zimbabwe) from Kafue II production
7/   300 MW, 1500 GWhJa at the time of appraisal of Kafue II; consultants
later increased the proposed installed capacitj to 400 MW.
8/   Extension of the Kariba complex,  on either bank,  would add  firm
generation capacity but would not add firm energy capability.   Such
development would complement the Hwange thermal capacity and existing
hydro capacity in the system.
9/   Tariffs in current price terms are converted to constant price terms
by using the index of Gross Domestic Expenditure in Zambia.



- 24 -
and the projected tariffs (Annex 7-1). Benefits and costs are expre8sed in
constant price terms (1983 was selected as the base year). On this basis,
the revised economic rate of return of the Kafue II Project is estimated to
be 6.6%.
7.04       At the time of appraisal the rate of return was estimated to be
18%.   The decline in the rate of return is largely due to a much lower
level of attributable sales to Kafue II between 1984 and 1998. It is worth
noting  that  the  appraisal  estimate  was  calculated  on  the  highly
conservative basis of valuing the total project output at the bulk sales
rate to CAPC, which was then extremely low (US4O.7/kWh).   A significant
proportion of the project output was forecast to be required to serve
Zambian demand, which would have been considered to have a higher economic
value to Zambia. 10/ Thus, the estimated project economic rate of return
based on the appraisal forecast would have been higher than 18Z if this
consideration had been taken into account.   Consequently the decrease in
the project rate of return between the time of appraisal and the present
time is greater than indicated by comparing the rates in the project
appraisal report and the updated estimate.
VIII. BANK'S ROLE
8.01       The Bank played an important general role in the preparation,
appraisal, financing and supervision of the project, which formed part of
the long-term plan for the development of hydroelectric resources in
Zambia, with which the Bank had been associated from the time of its first
Loan (145-RN), towards the first stage of Kariba (para. 1.06), completed in
1962. The Bank was involved in the prequalification and selection of civil
works contractors; its recommendation for the engagement of a consultant to
make an independent estimate of the costs of the main civil works prior to
agreement on costs appears to have contributed to achieving realistic
estimates (para. 3.14).
8.02      The Bank's requirements and recommendations on setting up a panel
of experts for the dam, and on the employment of management consultants
ensured adherence to international quality and safety standards and had a
beneficial effect on the project and ZESCO as an institution.   The Bank
recognized potential adverse environmental effects at appraisal, mitigatory
measures were agreed upon and implementation was satisfactory.  The Bank's
attempted infLuence on staffing concentrated on covenants about key
personnel to complement ZESCO's training program which was judged to be
satisfactory at appraisal. The Bank had little success in influencing the
Government to implement tariff revisions required to meet the earnings
covenant of Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement, despite many efforts by the
Bank to support ZESCO's application for tariff increases (para. 6.04).
10/  The present bulk sales rate to CAPC is also about UStO.7/kWh.  The
economic value of power in serving Zambian demand is at least equal to
tne retaiL tariff  (equivalent to about UStl.7/kWh).   The economic
value is probably greater than this level in serving the demand of the
Zambian copper industry through sales via CFC, even though the bulk
saLes rate to CPC is also much lower than the retail tariff.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
9.01        Construction of the project was performed efficiently and its
commissioning was relatively on schedule at a cost which was slightly below
that originally estimated.
9.02            Although  a  transformer  cable  failure  a/  arislig  from
manufacturing defects prevented the project from making !'contribution to
the intercoanected system power requirement according to schedule, this did
not result in a significant loss of revenue to ZESCO due to the low
increase in demand, resulting from the worldwide recession and particularly
its effect on the metal Industries. This factor, together with Zimbabwe's
development of coal-fired generating capacity, will delay the achievement
of full utilization of the Kafue 11 facility for many years.
9.03      Lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts appears to be a
continuing problem which is a consequence of the scarcity of foreign
exchange in Zambia due to the decline in export earnings from the copper
industry.  The depressed state of the industry is likely to persist and
therefore shortage of foreign exchange will probably have a detrimental
effect on ZESCO's operations for the foreseeable future.
9.04        The failure to increase power tariffs in a timely manner has
seriously affected the financial viability of ZESCO.  This, coupled with
lower than expected demand and sales volume, has been the major negative
factor  in  overall  project  performance.    This  problem  may  have been
mitigated if tariff action had been a condition of Bank participation
subsequent to this project.   The possibility of participation beyond the
Kafue II project existed in the extension of the transmission system and
rural electrification, in which the Bank was not involved. The Bank will
shortly start discussions with the Government of Zambia on the preparation
of a power rehabilitation project, which will provide an opportunity for
the Bank to influence power pricing in Zambia.
9.05         The extent of the revisions to the dam design (para. 3.03)
suggests  inadequate ground  investigation work before  construction.   A
frequent lesson of dam projects, which this seems to exemplify, is the need
to ensure adequate ground investigation.
9.06        A review of the project cost estimates by a second technical
consultant helps to ensure the reasonableness of these estimates and
mitigates the size of actual cost over or underruns.
9.07       A committee of experts for periodic examination of the dam is
very desirable, and in a situation such as in this project where major
problems are experienced (the hot springs), the required attentior. can be
immediately focused.
9.08         The organization of the power sector in Zambia needs to be
reviewed and possibly reorganized to make operations more efficient in the
context of the coordination of all institutions in the energy sector. Also
a/ ZESCO's comment - see Appendix A.



- 26 -
Zambia and Zimbabwe' s relationship within CAPC needs to be redefined to
assure both parties that the interconnected system is working effectively
and represents the cheapest source of required power for each country. A
study of CAPC's operation is currently in progress  (para. 5.03).   The
findings of this study are expected during 1984. This study should provide
recommendations relative to the future organization of the power sector in
Zambia and Zimbabwe and to the place of CAPC in this organization.

PREFACE
Page (iii)
Paragraph 1             No comment
Paragraph 2            It is not apparent how demand on the Zambian system could be met
up to 1988 without Kafue Gorge Stage II especially in terms of
energy. We take SECONDARY energy as not-firm for planning
purposes.
It is important to differentiate installed capacity from generating
capacity. For example at Kariba South as G5 was dowr for
rewinding throughout 1983, installed capacity was 666MW  Para. 2
whereas generating capacity was 555MW. Similarly         amended.
at Kafue Gorge 9O0MW is installed capacity but 750MW
was generating capacity.

corrected.
Highlights
Paragraph 3            The political environment at the time was a major factor in
the Government's decision to go ahead with both Kafue Gorge   Footnote
Stages I and II with the overriding urge for Zambia to be  added to
self-sufficient in electrical power. Exports of power to Zimbabwe para. 3.
were not considered even in posse. In any case exports to
Zimbabwe commenced to be requited from 1st July, 1977
prior to which both Zambia and Zimbabwe constituted a
single market for CAPC which purchased power at cost from
generating stations and sold it at economic prices. It is
off the mark to suggest that Kafue Gorge Stage U development
was intended for an export market.

demand forecast".                                   somewhat.
As noted earlier, Kafue Gorge Stage II did not foresee a
requitable export potential but rather a need to be self-
sufficient as well as to satisfy system demand.

fullest extent possible. Beyond 1987, exports to Zimbabwe
may be substantially reduced but possibly not totally.
Zambia's energy requirements now stand at 6.4TWh.
The revisedfirm potential from Lake Kariba is IOTWh
(under normal conditions). Thus each country's
entitlement is 5TWh.
Without Kafue Gorge Stage II total energy available
to Zambia (excluding secondary energy) would be
STWh Kariba, 0.7TWh Victoria Falls and l.8TWh Kafue Gorge
giving a gross total of 7.5TWh or an effective 6.4TWb per
annum. Seemingly there would be only a small shortfall
of 0.08TWh/a. However, when one accounts for
