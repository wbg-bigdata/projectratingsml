MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ROMANIA
FOR A PRIVATE FARMER AND ENTERPRISE SUPPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Romania for US$100 million equivalent for approval. The proposed loan
would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity including five years
grace and would help finance a private farmer and enterprise support project.
2.        Iagkrouud.  Romania has a land area of 237,000 km2 of which 43% is
cultivated and 20% is meadows and pastures. It has a population of
23.4 million including a work force of 11.7 million, 35% of which is employed
in agriculture. Agriculture, including agroindustry, accounts for 20% of GDP
and until the late 1980. accounted for 23% of total exports, 50% of which were
to the EC. At the time of the 1989 revolution the state presence was
pervasive in agriculture. Of the ha 10 million of arable land, 88% was
operated by state farms and production _ooperatives. The bulk of the food
processing and distribution system was operated by inefficient state
enterprises. Since the revolution the Government has embarked on an ambitious
program of system reforms to liberalize the economy. The princlpal elements
of these reforms applying to the agricultural sector lnclude redistributlon of
land to the private sector (ha 8 million), agricultural price liberalization
and promulgation of a new banking law based on competitive banking principles.
These initiatives, which are still in the process of belng implemented, have
set the scene for addressing many sectoral issues. The main issues in the
process of being addressed ares (a) restructuring of agricultural support
institutions including those providing inputs, extension servlces, marketing
information, and credit; (b) institutLonal strengthening of the banking system
to upgrade the operating performance of most commercial banks providing rural
credit; (c) setting interest rates at positive levels in real terms; (d)
elimination of de facto state monopolies in processing and distribution; and
(e) completion of the price liberalization process.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Because of its favorable resource
endowment, agriculture ln Romania has considerable potential for growth and
most products can be produced competitively. The historical bias ln favor of
state farms and the lack of resources in recent years has caused the private
agricultural sector which now controls 80% of the arable land to be starved of
capital resources. Consequently, private agriculture ie a subsector which is
likely to respond rapidly to investment and institutional support. The Bank's
lending strategy in agriculture is to support the government effort to
establish a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to a gradual
development of a market-driven private agriculture. The Bank's role in
agriculture is especially aimed at providing support for the emerging class of
private farmers and rural entrepreneurs to stimulate a rapid supply-side
response to increasing market esgnals. This strategy is conceived withln the
objectlves of the IMF stand-by arrangements and supports the aims of the
structural adjustment loan (SAL). SAL addresses policy and Lnstitutional
issues particularly relevant to the privatization and transformation of
agriculture into a market based sector. The Bank is currently preparing a



-2-
Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) which is expected to
substantially improve the efficiency of the financial intermediation system
and provide a basis for the reform of the Agricultural Bank (AS) and the
Romanian Development Bank (DB), the financial intermediaries (FIs) to be used
and strengthened under this project. Significant distortions of pr.ces in the
agriculture sector persist notwithstanding the liberalization of agriculture
prices on all but a few essential cummodities. There are a number of reasons
for this, in particular, a distribution system that is dominated by a few
large inefficient enterprises, a ban on the export of key commodities and an
overvalued exchange rate. Notwithstanding these distortions, we are
proceeding with the proposed project in tandem with our policy die gue to
address and remove these price distortions in a reasonable time-frame. The
macro-policy dialogue, including the implementation of the SAL, as well as key
sector tasks, beginning with a broad review of agriculture sector strategy,
will be the vehicles through which all these issues are addressed. At the
same time, support to the agriculture sector, which is a central part of the
Government's reform program, is needed quickly. The proposed project is
therefore designed to meet these needs, while minimizing the risks associated
with price distortions, by limiting its support to selected investments that
are clearly economically viable. Experience gained through the project and
project-related sector studies under preparation may provide the basis for
other Bank operations to support further development of the market economy in
the agricultural sector.
4.        Project Obiectives. The objective of the project is to support
private sector development in rural areas and thereby raise agricultural
output, increase efficiency of production, generate employment and impro,
standards of living. The project aims to achieve this through financing
credit to private farmers and other private businesses for (a) the improvement
of input supply, food processing, marketing and distribution services, and (b)
on-farm investment in order to increase production and productivity.
5.        Project DescriAtion.  The loan would finance private investment in
viable agricultural and other rural businesses. It is intended to be wide-
ranging but to exclude those ineligible subsectors assessed not to be
economically viable. It would cover both investment items and incremental
working capital. Funds would be made available to partially finance
investment by private individuals, farmer associations or private companies in
the following categories:  (a) marketina and trade of aoricultural Droducts,
especially for transport, wholesaling and retailing of both agricultural
outputs and inputs; (b) Drocessina of aaricultural groducts, particularly
small- and medium-scale investment to increase value-added in the rural areas;
(c) aaricultural production including livestock; and (d) other rural business.
6.        The loan would support an aggregate investment of about US$165
million. Of this, about US$74 million is expected to be for marketing,
distribution, services and other rural businesses, US$58 million for
agroprocessing, and US$33 million for on-farm investment. The loan would be
used primarily for marketing, distribution and agro-processing (at least 80%)
where the needs are greater, as well as some selected on-farm investments
which can be shown to be economically viable, notwithstanding existing price
distortions. The maximum amount onlent to any single beneficiary would be
US$5 million. The loan would cover only a small part of the country's total



- 3 -
agricultural investment needs, estimated at over US$1 billlon during the
project period.
7.        Procurement under subloans financed through the project would be
through direct contracting by private borrowers for contracts of up to
US$25,000, local shopping with at least three quotations for contracts of
US$25,000 to US$200,000, international shopping with at least three quotations
and two countries for contracts of US$200,000 to US$1 million, and limited
international bidding (LIB) over US$1 million.
S.        Disbursements would be against subloan expenditures on the basis of
certified Statements of Expenditures. A Special Account would be established
covering about four months' expenditures. The loan closing date is December
31, 1997.  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
h. The procurement method, with amounts, and disbursements are shown in
Schegdle B.  A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Romania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10458-RO, dated May 18, 1992, is being
distributed separately.
9.        The Agricultural Bank (AS) and the D-erlopment (DB,, currently the
most active banks in the agricultural sector with a total of about 270
branches and 360 agencies, would be the project FIs. They have initiated a
structural reform program by undergoing independent external audits. These
will provide the basis for the strategic plans to be prepared and adopted by
each bank (para 10).
10.       Actions Areed at  eaotiations.  At negotiations agreements were
reached regarding: (a) adoption by the Flo no later than December 31, 1992 of
strategic plans for institutional strengthening of Flo (including their
capability to adequately appraise subprojects under the loan), based on the
findings and recommendptions of independent external audlcs and satisfactory
to the Bank, including a time-bound schedule for their implementationt (b)
applying agriculture investment guidelines satisfactory to the Bank; (c)
ensuring that Flo are adequately staffed to carry out subloan appraisal and
supervision in accordance with the lending guidelines; (d) provide at least
80% of the Bank loan for high priority investments in marketing, distribution
and agro-processing and no more than 20% for on-farm investments that are
economically viable; (e) eligibility criteria for subborrowers, including
demonstration of creditworthiness, financial and economic viability of
investments to be funded and, in the case of lending to companies, adequate
corporate financial ratios as well as submission of annual audited reports;
(f) terms and conditions of financing subloans, including onlending either in
lei, at a variable rate equal to the NBR rediscount rate plus spreads
determined by FIs, or in US$ at a variable interest rate linked to the six-
month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin to be determined by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Flo spread; (g) compliance
with reporizing, accounting and auditing requirements acceptable to the Bank;
and (h) compliance with laws and regulations of Romania related to
environmental protection. Furthermore agreements were obtained on the
following special conditions of effectiveness: ratification of the Project
Agreements between the Bank, and AB and DB; execution of the subsidiary loan



agreements between QOR and the corresponding Pi, and adoption of agricultural
credit guidelines by AB and DS.
11.       Smofj&s.  The main benefit of the project would be increased
private rural sector business activity and improved rural institutions. The
credit provided by the project would support primarily much needed private
investment in input distribution, agricultural services and product marketing.
Enhanced competition in the rural banking system and broader access to credit
through the support of new business entrants would contribute to creating a
competitive economic environment. The project would support the Government's
economic reform program by creating additional employment and new sources of
ineome in rural areas. Finally, because the project is expected to have a
positive overall effect on agricultural production and efficiency it would
make the country more competitive in international markets, resulting in a
favorable impact on its balance of payments.
12.       RiJks. The main project risk is that subloans would not be fully or
promptly repaid. This could occur primarily because there is little
experience with lending to private farmers and small businesses in a free
market environment, entailing higher than usual financial risk for bor:rowers
as well as financial intermediaries. To address this, the project provides
for application by the FIe of sound lending criteria. Assistance in the
preparation of the lending operations manual and associated training currently
being provided by the Bank with Japanese Trust Fund financing will help
implement this. The EC-PHAR$ program is also providing training to PIs. A
second risk is that because businesses may be reluctant to borrow for goods
which appear expensive on a historical basis, the drawdown of project funds
could be slower than anticipated and the project period would need to be
extended. This risk would be mitigated once the effects of macroeconomic
reform are seen to be working, and borrowers understand the rationale of the
new price relationships.
13.       Unvixron_ental Issues.  The proposed project has been reviewed and
placed in environmental screening category B, consistent with the provisions
of Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A, "Environmental Assessment."
Therefore, the proposed project would not be subject to the preparation of an
environmental assessment; however, a procedure for environmental screening of
individual loans in compliance with both Romanian :equirements and those of
the. Bank would be applied under the project.
14.       Re   _ntio.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
