MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt) for SDR 40 million
(US$55.5 million) i, help finance a basic education improvement project. Tne credit would be
extended at standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years.
2.           Background. In 1986, the Government of Egypt, with the assistance of USAID
and other donors, embarked on a major education reform progrptn aimed at improving the
*          quality, availability and efficiency of basic education. However, despite progress at all
educational levels, and especially at the basic level, substantial efforts are still needed to address
the unmet physical, managerial and pedagogical needs of the sector. Notably, enrollment
expansion has not caught up with population growth, and thus not met the national objective of
universal compulsory education.' This has resulted in a situation in which a sizeable proportion
of school-age children are essentially left out of the education process, thereby contributing to the
country's high rate of illiteracy, which affects approximately 38 percent of Egyptian males and
62 percent of females.
3.           Access to schools is unequal in terms of geographic location, gender and
household income, and many schools are characterized by overcrowded classrooms and school
facilities that need repair or rehabilitation. The quality of education provided has been adversely
affected by (i) deficiencies in the design and relevance of curricula that are not well integrated
within grades, nor sequenced effectively across grades; (ii) inappropriate linkages between
teacher training, curricula content and student testing, that contribute to poor achievement, high
repetition and dropout rates, and unnecessarily low inefficiency and high costs; and (iii)
weaknesses in the Ministry of Education's (MOE) institutional ability to assess, plan and allocate
resources for the physical, instructional and financial needs of the sector. Consequently, and also
due to its lack of adequate financial and staff resources, MOE requires decisive institutional
support to develop a basic education system that adequately responds to both quantitative and
qualitative demands of the labor market and reduces the main causes of illiteracy among youths,
particularly girls.
4.           Rationale for IDA Involvement. 1he Government has demonstrated a
heightened recognition of both the cross-sectoral nature of educational issues and the need for
increased financial and technical assistance to address those issues which coincide with the Bank's
overall human resources development strategy for Egypt presently under preparation and IDA's
emphasis on basic education as a critical precursor to sustainable economic and human
development.
L/In 1991, 88 percent of eligible males and 74 percent of eligible femals were enrolled in primary school. To
reach funl enrollment by the year 2000, five new schools per day would have to be constructed, assuming all existing
schools were to remain functional.

5.          The project would provide resources to the sector commencing prior to the
completion In mid-1994 of USAID's Basic Education program, and would expand the Bank's
dialogue with the Government on the issues confronting the sector, including those related to
sectoral management, planning and financing, as well as to teacher training, curricula and
pedagogical methods. The project would also act as a catalyst in training and sustaining a solid
core of competent and capable mid- and upper-level staff within MOE.
6.          Project Objectives. The proposed project is intended to be the first in a series of
projects aimed at preserving and consolidating MOE's achievements to date in its reform of the
basic education system through measures designed to: (i) enhance MOE's institutional capacity in
policy analysis, management and education planning; (ii) improve the quality of teaching and
consolidate advancements in teacher training curricula design; (iii) improve access and equity;
and (iv) help define policy options and alternatives in addressing priority education issues.
7.          Project Description. T.h.e proposed project would improve access to and increase
the efficiency of the basic education system, and would consist of the following components:
(a)  Institutional Development (ID) which would contribute, through technical
assistance, training, equipment and civil works, to consolidate MOE's physical
facilities and its capacity to collect, process and analyze performance data for the
sector. Specifically, a senior and mid-level management training program at the
center and in 15 governorates would be developed and a comprehensive EMIS put
in place to address deficiencies in planning, management and policy analysis at the
central and local levels in addition to the renovation of facilities for the EMU.
The component would strengthen MOE's managerial capacity to allocate resources
efficiently.
(b)   In-Service Teacher Training which would develop new short term training
methods and enhance MOE's capacity to upgrade the skills and teaching practices
of teachers as a step towards enhancing instructional quality. The component
would establish the capability within MOE to design, produce and effectively use
high quality teacher training materials. Toward this end, civil works, technical
assistance and training would be financed to (i) upgrade MOE's central material
production unit, (ii) produce prototype training modules, (iii) expand and improve
the delivery of teacher training at the regional level, including construction of a
regional training center (RTC) in Qena and upgrading of the six other RTCs, and
(iv) develop and introduce a pilot distance education program;
(c)   School Construction and Rehabilitation which would, within the framework of
the Government's ongoing enrollment expansion program, support (i) the
construction of approximately 130 primary and 110 preparatory schools in 7 target
governorates, (ii) the establishment of a maintenance program for these
governorates, including training for about 350 maintenance supervisors and
technicians, and (iii) the provision of equipment and technical assistance for the
agencies responsible for planing and supervising the construction work. Criteria
for the selection of sites would favor underserved areas and segments of the
population, especially girls; and



- 3 -
(d)   Related Policy-Oriented Studies which would further assist in providing guidance
to the Government on policy, structural and regi.latory measures related to two
topics of high priority: (i) teacher preparation policies and programs, including the
structure, operation, financial incentives and effectiveness of the in-service
training systems, and (ii) the identification of additional means of mobilizing
public and private sector resources to finance basic education.
8.          Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at LE 243.7
million or US$73.8 million equivalent, of which US$24.4 million equivalent, or 33 percent of the
total project cost, is the foreign exchange component. The proposed IDA credit of SDR 40
million (US$55.5 million equivalent) will finance about 80 percent of the total project cost
excluding taxes and duties. The Government will finance US$18.3 million equivalent. Project
costs and financing are presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are
shown in Schedule B. The timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Egypt are provided in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 11489-EGT, dated March 3, 1993 is attached.
9.          Project Implementation. ThIe Minister of Education would have overall authority
for project management. The coordination of project activities would be carried out by a project
implementation unit (PIU), composed of a core team of six fuall-time staff, who would manage all
aspects of the project's implementation, including the monitoring of project expenditures,
procurement and routine on-site supervision of civil works. The PTU would organize a project
launch workshop, with IDA participation, which would, inter alia, | . familiarize all relevant
project officials with IDA rules and regulations; (ii) initiate training for PIU staff in
disbursements and procurement, and specify audit guidelines and procedures; and 'iii) review in
detail with relevant project entities all project components and activities.
10.         Project Sustainability. Project components have been designed to facilitate the
project's sustainability. Specifically, a technical secretariat in the Ministry has been established
to provide technical and analytical support to the Minister to facilitate coordination among the
education sector donors and to work with the high-level counterpart team, comprising all MOE
staff at or above the rank of undersecretary, to evaluate project action plans and propose policy
changes to the Minister. Training for mid- and senior-level MOE personnel has been planned for
three of the project's components to strengthen managerial capacity and ensure efficiency in the
implementation of components. A salary supplement has been agreed to ensure retention of those
staff who receive training under the project and continuity of project objectives. A preventive
maintenance program will be instituted within the General Authority for Educational Buildings
(GAEB), which will provide a basis for adequate school building maintenance throughout the
country. The planned program of policy-oriented studies will provide a means of guiding the
Government on policy, as well as structural and regulatory measures on key aspects of the
education reform program. The project launch workshop in the early stages of project
implementation is expected to further clarify project objectives and IDA implementation and
supervision procedures. Finally, regular monitoring by IDA supervision missions, an annual
project implementation review and a mid-term review will provide continuous guidance to the
PIU team.
11.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA and USAID Involvement. Lessons
learned from ongoing and completed education projects which have been integrated into the
proposed project's design include the need: (i) for project ownership by the Egyptian Government



- 4 -
(early full participation of national counterpart teams in project design and preparation) and the
institutional development of MOE is essential for successful implementation of projects5ii) to
focus on training for project management at an early stage of impleltvoid
developing institutions outside MOE, fllly financed by donors, as a shorto bypass MOE
bureaucracies, because these proved to be nonsustainable, counterproductive and were resisted by
MOE staff; (iv) for coordination of technical assistance; (v) for n''iitoring to ensure timely
completion of civil works; (vi) for coordination of procurement of eqiuipment and furniture to
correspond with the completion of buildings; and (vii) for prior resoludon of the crucial policy
issues facing the sector.
12.          Agreements Reached. Agreement has been reached with the Government on (i)
its provision of funds, facilities, services and other resources required for the project; (ii) staffing
and functions of the PIU; (iii) criteria for selection of school sites; (iv) arrangements for
implementation of teacher in-service training; (v) adequate incentives for MOE staff to be trained
and for staff involved in projec.t implementation; (vi) establishment of a technical committee for
institutional development to oversee implementation of measures to strengthen MOE's
management, p.anning and policy analysis capacity; (vii) terms of reference for studies on basic
education financing and teacher preparation policies and programs; (viii) training programs and
procedures for school maintenance; and (ix) detailed project implementation plans. As a
condition of effectiveness, Government action is nreeded on the appointment of the full-time PIU
staff and the provision of suitable offices.
13.         Environmental Aspects. The proposed project would yield positive
environmental and social benefits by constructing new schools and providing old schools with
better sanitary facilities and safety features. In addition, curricula advances that promote health
and environmental education would be supported through the project's teacher training
component. The project has been classified under Environmental Category 'C.'
14.          Prograsn Objective Categories. This project will contribute to (i) improving the
access of poor children and girls to basic education level schooling and thereby assist in reducing
illiteracy in the country; (ii) identifying means to improve the status of teachers; and (iii)
identifying means to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector expenditures and
for further resource mobilization.
15.          Project Benefits. It is estimated that more than 500,000 basic-level children
would benefit directly from the construction of new schools in the seven governorates.
Moreover, children in those govemorates would benefit from improvements in their school
environments (i.e., facilities, equipment, and class sizes and duration) and from the positive
impacts those improvements would have on instructional quality, as multiple shifts are reduced
and as a systematic preventive maintenance program is put in place (which could also
significantly extend the durability of schools).
16.          Previously underserved segments of the population, in particular girls and poor
children, will be the principal beneficiaries of the expanded capacity and improved quality of the
system. In addition, the quality of instruction should improve nationwide as teachers are
provided with better methods of presenting the curricula (through new training modules
developed by MOE using institutional capabilities that would be strengthened under the project).
Although the enhanced capability would be utilized in training teachers in various subjects, it is



estimated that through the project, about 70 senior trainers, 3800 teacher trainers and 120,000
teachers would be trained specifically in science, mathematics and languages
17.         Combined, these improvements in !he availability and quality of basic education
should help encourage many potential dropouts to remain in school, thereby combating one of
the primary causes of illiteracy. Other benefits would include: (i) the consolidation of MOE's
institutional capacity, including its information, planning and policy analysis capabilities, sn as to
improve its management capabilities; and (ii) the conversion of current ad hoc attempts to
mobilize resources for school rehabilitation and maintenance into a systematic program.
18.         Risks. The main risk expected relates to project implementation delays caused by
bureaucratic procedures within the MOE. To reduce this risk, a national counterpart team has
been established along with a UNDP-fmanced technical secretariat to oversee the effective and
efficient execution of project activities. Another risk identified relates to MOE's distorted
incentive structure (resulting from the low salary scales and limited career mobility) which could
make it difficult to retain MOE staff who are trained under the project. To address this risk,
MOE agreed to provide salary supplements to key MOE staff to be trained during the project and
to the full-time PIU staff involved in project implementation.
19.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
