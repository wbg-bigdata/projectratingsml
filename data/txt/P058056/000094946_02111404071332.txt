3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the Pension Reform Technical Assistance Project (PERTAP) was to-support the design
and implementation of Macedonia's pension policy reforms under the Social Sector Adjustment Credit
(SSAC).



Specifically, PERTAP was to support:
(a) the design of the reformed pension policies, and the development of the necessary legislation,
and
(b) the capacity building in the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) and the Pension
Fund.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Project objectives were not revised during the life of the project implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
The social sector reform strategy supported by the SSAC included pension reforms to improve the
long-term financial viability of the public pension system and introduce a mandatory funded pension
scheme. This was consistent with the Government strategy in this sector. The PERTAP provided technical
assistance in three main areas:
1. Pension Reform Design
(a) assistance in the identification and evaluation of different design options and resolution of design
issues for the reform of the public pension scheme and for the introduction of a private funded pension
scheme;
(b) Facilitating the training of the Pension Reform Steering Committee in pension reform policy
development, and training the Actuarial Unit in forecasting the financial requirements of particular
options;
(c) support to the development of the financing plan for pension reform, and
(d) design of the public informnation campaign.
2. Legislative Framework.
(a) the development and introduction of the legislative framework to reform public system;
(b) the development of the private pension legislation and assistance to the Government in its passage;
(c) the implementation of the public information campaign, prepared under Component 1.
3. Project Management. Overall coordination of project activities and general loan administration.
3.4 Revised Comiponents:
Project components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entrv:
The QAG review was not available at the time of project preparation. This ICR rates the quality of the
project design and preparation as highly satisfactory. The Government's objective was to continue its
reform program launched in 1994, including the rationalization of social expenditures through further
reforms of the public pension system and establishment of private pension schemes. The project was
consistent with the CAS objective and provided support to the priority areas of the Government's national
- 2 -



strategy. The PERTAP was particularly effective in providing technical assistance for the implementation
of the pension reform agenda outlined in the Social Sector Reform Program supported by the SSAC.
PERTAP and SSAC were prepared at the same time to reinforce each others' objectives in the pension area.
The support provided through PERTAP was a critical factor, which led to impressive achievements in
realizing the Government pension reform agenda and to a highly satisfactory rating for the pension reform
component of the SSAC.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievenment of objective:
The project has fully achieved its objectives and all pension policy reforms envisaged to be supported by
this project were carried out despite significant political instability during the project implementation
period, particularly the Kosovo crisis in the spring of 1999 and the Macedonian crisis in the spring of
2001, which affected the passage of some of the reform legislation. The Government commitment to the
pension policy reform goals remained strong and the implementing agency has accomplished a significant
amount of work, naking critical contributions to the pension policy reform.
The two project objectives were achieved by:
(a) the support provided to design the new pension reform and to develop the necessary legislation.
The reformed Law (Framework Law) was passed through the Parliament on March 22, 2000 and included
several norms that improves the solvency of the system:
*   increase of the retirement age by half year every year to 63 for women and 65 for men;
*   age-exclusive retirement subject to a minimum number of contributing years;
*   indexation of the pension benefits (80% price and 20% wage);
*   reduction of the rate for accumulating the pension base used to determine the public pension;
*   no increase in the contribution rate.
As a result of the Framework Law, the financial sustainability of the overall pension system was improved.
In April 2002 the Law on Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance was passed. This law determines the
detailed structure of the mandatory funded privately managed pension pillar and, in addition to reducing the
financial burden on the public pension system, it will facilitate the development of the capital markets in
Macedonia.
(b) the capacity building in the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) and the Pension
Fund.
The project placed special emphasis on institutional and capacity building to ensure that the achieved
outcomes can be sustained and the future reforms are being carried out in a professional and organized
manner. The capacity building has been successful and has strengthened entities and staff who are able to
continue to design further pension policy reforms, to carry out actuarial analysis of the pension system, and
to prepare regular reports for the Government.
Given the success in designing and initiating difficult reforms in the area of pension policy and the
achievements in building the local capacity to ensure the sustainability of the reforms, this ICR assesses the
outcome of the PERTAP as highly satisfactory. The project is highly likely to have a substantial
development impact in the long-term.

4.2 Outptuts by components:
Specific outputs by components are as follows:
Pension Reform Design Component.
The main objective of this component was to support the design of the pension reform program, which will
reform a very costly pay-as-you-go pension system and establish a multi-pillar pension system in
Macedonia. This component was comprised of 4 sub-components: (i) design of the pension reform
program; (ii) develop actuarial capacity for pension reform; (iii) develop a financing plan for the transition;
and (iv) design a public information campaign.
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy team supporting pension reform efforts has been strengthened
under the PERTAP through technical assistance from a team of international experts and through training
and involvement of local consultants, including local lawyers, economists and a media specialists. The
Steering Committee played a major role in coordinating efforts in designing a new pension system and was
very effective in involving both, local and international, experts in a continuous discussion and dialogue
about different options for reforming the pension system. A significant output of the project was the
"Critical Path Analysis", which outlined the detailed steps of reform irnplementation and their
interdependancy and served a s a useful tool in organizing and communicating the implementation needs.
During the course of the project foreign consultants were able to transfer a great deal of their knowledge
about principles and options for reforming pension systems. The Borrower's staff was able to absorb this
knowledge and put it to practice. The financing plan developed by the Actuarial Unit was accepted by the
Government and the Bank, which demonstrates the increased capacity of the MOLSP and PDF staff.
Recognizing the complexity of the reform and various perspectives from different interest groups, the
project provided technical and financial support to the pension reform team in designing and implementing
a public information campaign. The project financed public opinion research activities to better understand
the concerns of the stakeholders and training ofjournalists, including a study tour to Poland. As a result,
journalists have become familiar with pension reform issues and are able to communicate the reform
professionally. The project also financed a public information campaign, video clips and brochures, which
raised awareness and helped the public to understand the need for the reform. Lastly, media training for the
pension team was alsao provided, which helped members of the team to communicate the goals and details
of the reform to the Parliament, Government, private sector, NGOs and public in general. Public support is
critical to the success of any reform program. However, it is not often easy to achieve. Close and timely
cooperation between the main reformers and those who can communicate the need for reforms, along with a
detailed program of the reforms is essential for the successful outcome of the reform agenda. Recognizing
these factors, the strides reached in the PR field are that much more imnpressive. The absence of major
resistance is one clear indicator that the campaign was successful.
This component is rated as HS.
Legislative Framework
Under the project and with the support from the SSAC, the legislative agenda of the Government related to
the pension reform passed in Parliament. The reformed Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (the
Framework Law) was passed in March 2000. It was a monumental piece of work and a great
-4 -



accomplishment of the Government and the project team. The Law on Mandatory Fully Funded Pension
insurance (the second pillar law) also passed in Parliament in April 2002, albeit after the project closing
date. Draft secondary legislation has also been supported by the PERTAP. The main pieces of the
secondary legislation include: (a) regulation on pension funds investrnent limnits; (b) regulation on fees; (c)
regulation on control of conflict of interest; (d) regulation on valuation; (e) regulation on the custody of the
pension fund; (f) regulation on organization of the public tender for licensing of pension companies; (g)
regulation on marketing and sales of the pension companies; (h) accounting standards for the private
pension funds; and (i) definition of risk rating system. The PR campaign and its targeted activities
supported MOLSP efforts to process the legislation and gain the support for the reforms.
This component is rated as HS.
Project Management
The project was managed well. The procurement, disbursement and financial status of the project was
satisfactory throughout the project period. During the project implementation, Macedonia experienced
several difficult periods of political instability and military conflicts. Many parallel reforms were ongoing,
resulting in the MOLSP having to deal with competing priorities. However, the management of the
MOLSP and the project team remained focused on the objectives of the project. There were changes in the
project staffing, but it did not affect the quality of implementation. All project audit reports provided
unqualified opinions and all were delivered on time. The cooperation between the counterpart team, the
Bank, and consultants has been exemplary throughout the course of the project.
This component is rated as S.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The objective of PERTAP was to support the design and implementation of the pension policy reforms and,
specifically, to build capacity in the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and the Pension and Disability
Fund. The capacity building started during the course of SSAC preparation, when Bank team and
consultants provided advice and support in preparing and reviewing the pension reform design and
legislation. The PERTAP placed special emphasis on institutional and capacity building to ensure that the
reforms would be sustainable and can be carried out in an organized manner.
During the project implementation the Actuarial Unit of the PDF was trained and is now capable of
independently preparing actuarial analysis of the pension system and developing regular reports to the
Government. The Steering Committee received training on various pension policy aspects; members of the
SC participated in several conferences on pension systems and, as a result, a good local team of experts has
been created that can continue to work on further developing the Macedonia pension system. The Ministry
of Labor and Social Policy and the Pension and Disability Fund are presently much better prepared to carry
out analysis of the pension system, to prepare legal acts needed to implement the reforms, and to
communicate the reforms to main stakeholders and public than they were before the inception of the
- 5 -



PERTAP. Despite these achievements, more assistance is necessary to support the pension team in the
Government, especially considering the need to implement all the policy changes. The further capacity
building will be addressed under the new SPIL.
The institutional impact of the PERTAP is assessed as substantial.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors otitside the control of government or inmplementing agency:
There were some delays in PERTAP implementation due to the Parliamentary elections in 1998 and
Presidential elections in 1999, which also delayed the implementation of the Social Sector Adjustment
Credit conditions. Due to the changes in the Government, there was a slowdown in the decision maling
regarding the pension legislation. As anticipated in the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy, there was an
escalation of violence in Kosovo, which led to increased outflows of refugees to Macedonia. The Ministry
of Labor and Social Policy was the main responsible institution for dealing with the refugee crisis and at
the same time was coordinating the PERTAP implementation. The Macedonian crisis of 2001 also affected
the project timetable and delayed the processing of the of mandatory funded private pension scheme. These
factors led to the PERTAP extension for an additional year until March 31, 2002.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Although there were delays in project implementation, mainly in progressing with the pension reform
design, the Government commitment to the project was strong . The new Minister of Labor and Social
Policy indicated his support to the pension reform commitments made by the previous Government and
agreed with the Bank on the next steps to recover the pace of the pension reform. By the end of 1999, the
design of the pension system was advanced considerably and pension legislation was essentially prepared.
The Law on Public Pensions was passed in March, 2000. Due to the Macedonian crisis in 2001, the initial
delays with the development of legislation and the fact that the MOLSP had to work in parallel on several
social policy reforms, the development of the legislation for the 2nd pillar pension scheme was slower than
expected. However, as a result of concerted efforts by the Government, Bank staff and consultants, the
legislation was prepared and passed through the Parliament in March, 2002.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy was the leading implementing agency for the PERTAP, and
worked closely and effectively with Bank staff and numerous consultants to ensure that everything was
being done to complete the design of the pension reform and the passage of the necessary legislation. An
important factor of success was the decision of the Minister to keep the core staff responsible for the
pension reform issues and his personal involvement and support during the discussion of the pension
legislation in the parliament. The Steering Comnmittee established to coordinate the work of various
agencies (MOLSP, PDF, Central Bank of Macedonia, Ministry of Finance) proved to be an efficient and
weighty mechanism to move the reform forward. The PIU established under the auspices of the MOLSP
was instrumental in coordinating project activities and, despite of the change of the Project Coordinator,
ensured good and uninterrupted project management.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Total project cost was SDR 750,000 (US$1 million equivalent). The project was fully disbursed, with only
a very marginal balance left and returned. There were no major delays in disbursement or cost overruns.
All project activities were completed on March 31, 2002.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainabilitv rating:
Sustainability of the reforms initiated under the Social Sector Adjustment Credit and supported by the
PERTAP depends on continued support from the Government of FYR Macedonia and specifically from the
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy to continue with the implementation of the broad reform agenda. In
addition to Government commitment to continue with the reform agenda, a major contributing factor to the
sustainability of the project achievements is the Bank's and donor community continued involvement.
Under the PERTAP the framework legislation outlining the overall pension reform agenda and the law
governing the fully funded pension insurance were passed through the Parliament. The project also
supported the drafting of necessary secondary legislation, which has to be adopted by the Govermnent. The
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy has shown a strong record of pursuing its reform agenda and remains
on track with the irnplementation of the actions agreed at the end of the Pension Reform Technical
Assistance Project - setting up of the Pension Supervisory Agency has started with the appointment of the
Chairmen in July of 2002. Despite this progress, some concern remain regarding the strength of the pension
team in the MOLSP, which needs to be addressed in the nearest future to ensure that the ongoing reform in
the PDF and the establishment of the supervisory agency is not interrupted. There is a clear need to further
increase not only the awareness of the implementation requirements for the pension reform but also to
strengthen the MOLSP and the PDF capacity to carry out the actual implementation of the reform, which
will be addressed under the second Bank funded project.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
To ensure a smooth implementation of the pension reform, the Govenment is preparing a follow-up
operation, the Social Protection Implementation Loan (SPIL), with the funding of PHRD grant. The
Government together with the Bank have approached the donor community and the Dutch Government has
established the PDF Grant to bridge the gap in financing of the implementation process.
7. Bank and Borrower Perfornance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The PERTAP project identification, preparation and appraisal were closely linked to the identification and
appraisal of the Social Sector Adjustment Credit. During the appraisal stage, the Government was
interested to expedite the release of the second tranche of the SSAC, but this required passage of major
pension legislation. The Bank proposed to assist the Government to speed up the preparation of the pension
reform through a technical assistance loan of US$I million, which was accepted by Government. The Bank
team was very efficient to assist the Government to prepare the new project and was responsive to
Government in selecting the right interventions to be included. Overall, the Bank's performance in the
preparation, appraisal and negotiations of the Project was fully satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance during the implementation was professional and satisfactory. The Bank's team
worked very closely with the Government counterparts and provided continuous support and policy advice
throughout the project implementation process. The cooperation and communication with the Bank was
very efficient (often occurring on a daily basis) and contributed to the establishment of mutual trust. This
- 7 -



was especially important during the difficult process of passage of legislation through the Parliament when
the Bank's timely response was crucial. The Bank showed the flexibility and understanding of the
sensitivity of the pension reforms undertaken by the Governnent and agreed to extend the project to
implement all the planned activities.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank recognized the need for urgent reforrn of the pension system in Macedonia and was able to
respond quickly with the technical assistance project, that would greatly facilitate achieving the
Governments goals of reforming the Macedonian pension system. The project objectives were met and
agreement on the continuation of the reform process reached. Providing the needed initial enabling
environment and good quality technical follow-up through its Country Office in Skopje and its HD sector
staff during implementation, the overall performance of the Bank is rated as satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The reforms assisted by the PERTAP were an integral part of the overall reform agenda agreed and
supported through the SSAC. The Government demonstrated a high level of commitment and dedication to
promote and implement a reform of public pension system to improve its long-term financial viability and
to introduce a fund private pension scheme.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance during implementation has been satisfactory. The pension reform design
and relevant legislation has been prepared and passed through the Parliament. Despite political difficulties
and changes in the Government, there were no major shifts or delays in the agreed reform measures.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy was directly responsible for the implementation of the project and
has managed the project in an exemplary way. The MOLSP led the establishment of the Steering
Committee, which ensured the necessary links among various institutions involved in the pension policy and
has become a real think-tank for the pension policy reforms. The personal involvement of the Minister of
Labor and Social Policy contributed to the passage of the legislation through the Parliament. This was
particularly impressive given the crisis situation with the massive refugee influx to Macedonia, which the
MOLSP had to deal with. The PIU established within the MOLSP was staffed with capable staff and,
despite the change of the project Coordinator, the project implementation continued successfully.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower's performance is assessed as satisfactory. Although the country was experiencing
periods of political instability, the commitment to the pension reform agenda was maintained throughout the
project period. The goals of the project were achieved and the key legislation passed.
8. Lessons Learned
A number of lessons emerged from this project that have relevance for other operations, especially as
regards the need for technical assistance to support substantial policy reforms:
-8 -



*   The pairing of a TA operation with an adjustment lending was an excellent combination and
led to a very powerful combination. It helped the counterpart to achieve the policy objectives of
adjustrnent program with much higher quality, stronger ownership, and better assurance for'
sustainability.
*   The PERTAP experience is proof that with limited resources (US$1 million) and their startegic
use, major achievements can be made in moving the policy reforms forward.
*   The Borrower's commnitment and ownership are essential for the successful implementation of
critical policy reforms. This was indicated by the Government's request to borrow for technical
assistance and support for the pension policy reforms agreed in the framework of the SSAC.
*   Well-organized, dedicated and enthusiastic counterparts are of utmost importance to ensure
successful project implementation. The way in which the pension reform was managed and
coordinated is an excellent example of being able to carry out complex and sensitive pension
policy reforms by involving all stakeholders.
*   Continuity of staff is important. There was no major change in the local counterpart staff over
the life of the project. On the Bank side, there was a change of Task Team Leader, but all
other team members remained in place, which facilitated the transition.
*   Public Relations issues must be addressed when implementing pension policy reforms. The
Bank support to the Steering Committee (established by the MOLSP) in designing and
implementing a public infornation campaign was essential for two reasons: (i) to achieve a
consensus on the need for the pension reform among major stakeholders; (ii) getting public
support for the planned policy reformns.
*   Passage of legislation almost always takes more time than planned. Even in countries with
more stable political and civil environment, the passage of legislation through the Parliament,
particularly of such a sensitive nature as pension legislation, might require much more time
than planned. Therefore, during the project preparation the team should be realistic in
assessing the project implementation time frame.
*   Implementation of the pension reform in Macedonia demonstrates that the implementation of a
major reform requires a multi-stepped process that often involves a series of varied
interventions. In similar future operations, programmatic lending would appear to offer the
right lending instrument to carry this out. An APL with the reform design, legislative
development and capacity building in the first phase of the project and investment to support
the actual implementation of the policy changes in the second phase would ensure the
continuous support from the reform design phase to the implementation and will also allow foi
an adjustment in case of delays in the first phase of the project.

The project The Pension Reform Technical Assistance Project ( PERTAP ) was approved by the World

Bank as an integral part of ( SSAC ) Social Sector Adjustment Credit on July 9,1998 in the amount of
SDR 750,000 equivalent, was signed on July 13, 1998 and became effective on August 15, 1998.
The Project and the Government Strategy
The reform of this program is an integral part of the SSAC- Social Sector Adjustmnent Credit between
World Bank and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The measures from the program are
promotion of sustainable long term pension system. The objectives of the PERTAP are: (i) the design of
the pension policy reforms under the Social Sector Adjustment Program, and the development of the
necessary legislation to this effect; and (ii) build capacity in the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection
(MOLSP) and the Pension Fund.
Positive results
This project has enabled to reform the public pension system to improve its long run financial viability and
to introduce a funded private pension pillar to ensure the sustainability of pension benefits. This reform
would, in the long run, allow contributions to be closely linked to pension benefits, reducing labor market
distortions, allow a long term balance in the public pension system, and deepen capital markets in the
country.
Weaknesses in the PERTAP implementation and lessons learned
The legislation regarding the pension reform consists of dates that identify the start of the reform
implementation. These dates were slightly postponed due to the overall circumstances in which the reform
was carried out and this can be a useful experience for creating future realistic assumptions on projects'
implementation dates.
Quality of the World Bank's contribution in the project
We can estimate the operation of the World Bank during the course of the project realization as efficient,
useful and very supportive for all institutions that participated in the realization of the project, particularly
MOLSP, who was directly responsible for PERTAP implementation. It refers to all phases in the
designing, carrying out, monitoring, supporting and the overall implementation of the project. The objective
of this component is to improve the long term financial viability of the public pension scheme and to
introduce privately managed funded pension system, while providing basic protection for aged and
disabled. During the implementation of the project there was a need for the credit to be extended (the
reasons were more objective ones), thus when accepting the deadlines have to be realized, it will be more
useful for greater flexibility to be achieved when arranging these deadlines. During the implementation, the
project was regularly monitored by the World Bank, registering all current problems together with the
Macedonian team and they were continuously agreeing, harmonizing and finding solutions for unplanned
circumstances. The World Bank, through its team, made regular missions to the project and as a result of it
prepared Aide Memoires, summarizing the status of the project components together with all themes and
agreements achieved within each of them. This document also included the recommendations as for the
opened questions as well as determination of the next steps. This way of working by the Bank had a great
contribution with respect to the successful completion of the project as a whole.
