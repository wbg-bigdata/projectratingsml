A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key perfornmance indicators (see Annex 1).
The objective of the Project is to support the design and implementation of the Borrower's pension pollicy
reforms under the Borrower's Social Sector Adjustment Program. Specifically, the Pension Reform
Technical Assistance Project (PERTAP) would support: (a) the design of the pension policy reforms
under the EBorrower's Social Sector Adjustment Program, and the development of the necessary
legislation to this effect; and (b) build capacity in the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP)
and the Pension Fund.
2. Key Performance Indicators.
The key performance indicators of the project include the preparation of legislation for a reformed public
system and the framework legislation for a private funded pension system. Related indicators are a
financing plan for pension reform, well trained personnel capable of administering the transition to a
funded private pension pillar; a public information campaign to involve and inform the public and other
stakeholders about the needs, goals and objectives of the pension reform program.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 14379-MK   Date of latest CAS discussion: April 19, 1995
The reform of social sector programs is an integral part of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) agreed
between the World Bank and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and are also in line with the
draft CAS to be discussed by the Board in August, 1998. The broad goals of this strategy are to stimulate
economic activity through a consolidation of fiscal gains and the promotion of private sector
development. A reforn of social sector programs, particularly pension reform, that would improve the
long term financial viability of the pension fund, and would allow a move to a funded private pension
pillar is identified in the CAS as critical for achieving these objectives. The objectives of the PERTAP,
which supports the implementation of the Social Sector Adjustment Credit, and are identified above, are
therefore exactly those of the Government's social sector reform program identified in the CAS.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The key sector issues are high payroll tax rates required to support the existing public pension prograim
which raise labor costs in the country, and, unless reformed, increasing deficits in the public pension
fund. The financial problems of the pension fund would ensue as a result of (i) benefit/eligibility
provisions which are high relative to what the country can afford under current economic conditions; and
(ii) a gradual aging of the population. The Government strategy is to reform the public pension system to
improve its long run financial viability and to introduce a funded private pension pillar to ensure the
sustainability of pension benefits. This reform would, in the long run, allow contributions to be closely
linked to pension benefits, reducing labor market distortions, allow a long term balance in the public
pension system, and deepen capital markets in the country
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed technical assistance project addresses two key issues that are a pre-requisite for pension
reform. These are (i) the design of the pension reform program, including the actuarial forecasting and
economic planning of the reform; and (ii) the legislation required to underpin the reform. These issues are



Page 3
the essential building blocks of the reform process.
C: Project Description Suimmary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost
breakdown):
1. Pension Reform Design: This Institutional       0.66       47      0.49        49
component would: (a) assist in the Development
identification and evaluation of
different options and resolution of
design issues for the reform of the
public pension scheme and For the
introduction of a private funded
scheme; (b) facilitate the training of
the  Pension   Reform   Steering
Committee to design the reiformed
public pension and the privately
funded pension systems, and train
the Actuarial Unit in forecasting the
financial requirements of particular
options; (c) support the development
of the financing plan for pension
reform, and (d) design the public
information    campaign.    This
component would finance consultant
services,   including   technical
assistance and training of trainers.
2. Legislative Framework:  This Institutional      0.54       39       0.40        40
component would support: (a) the Development
development and introduction of the
legislative framework to reform the
public system; (b) in addition the
project   would   support  the
development of the private pension
legislation    and    assist   the
Government in its passage; and (c)
the implementation of the public
information campaign prepared in
component 1, including training
seminars. This component would
finance consultant services including
technical assistance, training of
trainers, and training seminars.

3. Project Management   This Project              0.20        14      0.11        11
component would provide overall Management
coordination of project activities and
general loan administration. This
component would finance consultant
services,  project  audits,  and
equipment. PC director salary and
operating costs would be financed by
the Government.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The PERTAP provides technical assistance support critical for the implementation of pension policy
reforms. These reforms form an essential component of the Social Sector Adjustment Program being
supported by the proposed Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SSAC).
3. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project would be managed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. Establishment of a P'roject
Coordinating Unit (PCU), appointment of a Project Director, and hiring a Project Coordinator are
conditions of effectiveness. The Project Director (PD) would report directly to the Minister of Labor and
Social Policy and would be appointed under terms of reference, experience and qualifications satisfactory
to IDA. The PD would be the main counterpart for the purposes of the PERTAP and would be
responsible for ensuring the technical quality of the proposed project outputs. A PCU would be
established and a Project Coordinator (PC) hired as a consultant to head the PCU. The PC would be
appointed under terms of reference, and qualifications satisfactory to IDA. The PC would report directly
to the Project Director and would be responsible for administering and coordinating the project activities.
It is expected that the PC may need some training in project management, implementation, procurement,
disbursement, accounting and auditing procedures. Arrangements for in-country training or study tours
have been proposed. In addition as needed a short term staff could be appointed. Salaries of the PD, short
term staff and Operating Costs of the PCU would be financed by the Government. PC fees and some
equipment would be financed by the credit.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The alternatives considered were (i) to proceed without a technical assistance credit or (ii) increase the
amount of the technical assistance credit. The first alternative was rejected because the Government
considers it too risky to proceed with pension reform without technical assistance to support an important
and complicated reform of the pension system. Additional technical assistance, particularly in developing
regulatory agencies, specifying the regulatory process, implementation of the legislative reforms, and
complementary reforms in financial markets would be required. However, as the credit amount is not
sufficient for fully supporting the government's pension reform program, IDA will make every effort to
assist the Government in obtaining resources to implement its reform program (through its own

instruments or through other donors).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The key lesson learned and reflected in the project design is that support of proposed policy reform
(under the SSAC) and their ownership by the Government require technical assistance, institutional
capacity building, and training ojfpolicy makers.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The indications of borrower commitment are the completion of the key first tranche conditions of the
Social Sector Adjustment Credit, and satisfactory progress on the on-going Social Reform and Technical
Assistance Project. The borrower commitment and ownership is also indicated by the urgent request for
technical assistance and support for the pension reform process, and the Government's willingness to
trade limited IDA resources for technical assistance instead of balance of payments support.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Government and IDA have been engaged in pension policy dialogue since 1993. IDA has therefore
been an active supporter, both in terms of financial resources, as well as policy advice in the country's
pension reform process. IDA therefore has considerable value added in supporting this next phase of
pension reform of the Government. IDA would, however, liaise with other donors, such as USAID, in
assisting the Government design and implement its pension reform program.

b. Project management: Project Management would be provided by a Project Coordination Unit.
3. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category     []A   []B    [x] C
4. Participatory approach:
The project is the result of an intense consultation process carried out through the on-going Social
Reform Technical Assistance Project, the preparation of the SSAC, and USAID financed Technical
Assistance for pension reform. These projects have provided ample opportunities for discussion of the
issues and the requirements of pension reform with pensioners and workers unions and parliamentarians.
Most recently, parliamentarians participated with MOLSP officials in a study tour of pension reforrn in
other Eastern European countries. Public opinion polls have also been initiated in the Social Reform
Technical Assistance Project to gauge public reaction to social sector reforms. This project would, by
developing pubic information campaigns around stakeholder concerns, create a more participatory
process for pension reform.
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The Working Age population and new entrants to the labor force would benefit the most by the reform
program.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Government, parliamentarians, the private sector and population at large

Annex 2
PENSION REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Project Description
Project Component 1 - USSO.66million (total cost of component)
Pension Reform Design. The objective of this component is to support the design of the pension reform program
This involves, given the choice already made by the Government to move to a funded private pension system, (i)
developing the exact design of the pension reform program; (ii) developing the actuarial capacity to inform the
selection of the pension reform design; (iii) developing a financing plan for the transition; and (iv) developing a
public information campaign to inform the public about the objectives and goals of the reform program.
Specifically, the design of the new pension system would involve the following actions:
(i) Design of the pension reform program. This sub-component would assist the Steering Committee for
Pension Reform to develop alternate pension reform options and decide on the ultimate design of the
reformed pension system. This would involve identifying the steps that need to be taken towards a full
reform of the pension system and find solutions to issues that arise at each one of these steps. For the public
system design issues involve retirement age, age exclusive retirement, penalties for early retirement,
separation of disability system, "bend point" for accrual rates, and indexation. For the privately managed
scheme the issues involve eligibility, contributions, retirement benefit options, retirement age, guarantees,
and taxation. The activities required for the reform would include at least the issues regarding the impact on
different kind of beneficiaries of the system, the financing issues involved in various options, required
changes to other laws, restructuring of pension institutions, the role of inter-connected institutions, such as
the bankinig and insurance industry, private pension funds, regulatory and supervisory agencies and other
pre-requisites, such as a public information campaign.
(ii) Develop Actuarial Capacity for Pension Reform. This sub-component would support the development of
actuarial capacity to model/simulate financial costs of the transition to a Private Pension Pillar. The actuarial
model for simulating the financial implications of alternate options for the transition to a private funded
pension system under particular demographic and economic scenarios would need to be developed and
tested. The Unit would also be trained further in actuarial methods, probability and statistics and regression
techniques required for actuarial modeling. In addition, the Actuarial Unit would receive training in program
based modeling techniques that would enhance the quality and flexibility of actuarial modeling and reduce
computational errors.
(iii) Develop a financing plan for the transition. This sub-component would support the development of
financing options for the transition to a funded system, including, but not limited to taxation options,
borrowing, or Government bond finance of the transition. This would involve, inter alia, a full assessment of
the financial and insurance industry, an evaluation of the potential for Government debt finance of the
pension reform  process, and amount of pension fund surplus that could potentially be .received under
alternate scenarios of economic growth.
(iv) Design a Public Information Campaign Mobilizing public support for pension reform would be an
essential part of the reform strategy. This sub-component would support the designing, testing and
implementing of a public information campaign, with stakeholder involvement as needed, to garner public
inputs and support for the pension reform process. T he objective of the public information campaign would
be to address public concerns: how particular groups would be affected, howi reforms would be phased in,
etc.; explain the overall benefits of the reform process, and the overall need, objectives and implications of
the pension reform program.



Project Component 2 - US$O.54million (total cost of component)
Legislative Framework. This component would support the revision of the pension law and develop legislation
for private funded pension system to underpin the pension reform program. These laws would be developed in
parallel to ensure their internal consistency as well as consistency with other laws. The Government would also
have to develop consensus among stakeholders to pass the legislation through parliament. Specifically this
component would support (i) the reform of the public pension regulation; (ii) development of the law for private
funded pension system; and (iii) develop support for this legislation.
i) Reform the legislation of the public pension system. This sub-component would support the reform of
public pension legislation in accordance with the overall pension reform program. The public pension law
would have to be revised to incorporate measures to ensure the long term financial solvency of the pension
fund (specified in the SSAC documents) such as more restrictive eligibility for retirement, disability and
survivor pensions, increases in retirement age, changes in the benefit formula, and less costly long run
indexation measures. Changes in the financing of public pensions and tax treatment of pensions would also
have to be addressed. Potential conflicts with other laws and with reforms of the public pension legislation
would have to be resolved. The legislative reform of the public pension system would have to be consistent
with the private pension program proposed by the Government.
ii) Develop the liaw for private pensions. This sub-component would support the development of the ilaw for
private pensions including the resolution of potential conflicts with other laws. The law would outline the
goals of the pension reform program and specify, inter alia, the eligibility, benefit structure, switching
options, taxation, asset management, financing provisions, guarantees, and the contribution rates for the
private pension pillar.
iii) Develop Support for Passage of Legislation. This subcomponent would build capacity within the
Government to implement the public information campaign (prepared under Component 1, Subcomponent
(iv)) in order to build concensus, through participatory approaches, on the pension reforn program. In
addition to the executive and legislative branches, it would be necessary to collaborate and inform political
parties, representatives of business, labor, pensioners, lawyers and insurance companies during the
development, enaction, and implementation of the pension reform process.
Project Component 3 - USSO.20million (total cost of component)
Project Management. The overall coordination of project activities and general loan administration would be the
responsibility of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) under the responsibility of the Ministry of Labor and Social
Policy. The Ministry would appoilt a Project Director who would be the main counterpart for purposes of this
credit and would report directly to the Minister. The project would be administered by a project coordinator who
would report directly to the Project Director and would be responsible for undertaking procurement, preparing
applications for disbursement, maintaining project accounts, and arranging for their timely audit, and monitoring
overall credit implemenitationi. If necessary short term staff could be appointed to assist as and wheni requaired.
The project coordinator would prepare Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports and the Project Mid-Term Review
Report (scheduled for August, 1999). On the basis of the ilformation from the various agencies involved in the
implementation of this credit, the project coordinator would prepare the Borrower's contribution to the Project
Completion Report within six monthls of the closing date.

PENSION REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
A. Procurement
1. Procuirement methods (see Table A)
The procurement of goods and services of IDA financed activities would be procured in accordance with
IDA procurement guidelines. Those project activities not financed by the IDA would be procured in accordance
with the regulations of the financing entity, it is expected that counterpart staff time, PCU director salary, and
PCU operating costs, financed by the Government, estimated to cost about US$ 390,000 would be procured using
this method. The Government would also finance taxes on the procurement of goods estimated to cost US$
10,000. Foreign technical assistance would be exempt from all local taxes. A detailed procurement schedule for
these activities is presented in Table C.
(a)    Procurement of Goods (USS 60,000):   Goods would be procured in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January, 1995 and Revised January and
August, 1996 and September, 1997. Since this is a technical assistance credit only a small amount of equipment
would be procured, the following method is proposed:
(i)    National Shopping: these procedures could be used for contracts upto US$ 50,000 equivalent
for an aggregate total of US$ 60,000, for the purchase of computers, office equipment, supplies and materials.
Prudent National Shopping would be followed, by comparing price quotations obtained from at least three
independent local suppliers, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.
(b)    Procurement of Consultant Services (US$ 950,000): The technical assistance requirements of the
Project include consulting services, training of trainers, in-country training for pensions sector staff, and a project
audit. All of these packages will be financed by IDA and will be procured in accordance with the guidelines:
Selection and Employnment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January. 1997 and Revised
September, 1997.
(i)    Procurement of Technical Assistance: There are twelve short-term  specialized, services
technical assistance packages to be procured under the project for a total estimated cost of US$ 900,000. These
packages will iinclude management of related training as well. Either firms or individuals could be contracted,
however, since there would be a need for short-term highly specialized services we expect most to be awarded to
individual consultants for this assignment. Highly specialized individual consultants would be selected on a
competitive basis based on their qualifications. Individuals will be hired as per provisions in Section V of the
guidelines. All consulting services will be procured in keeping with the terms of reference as agreed by IDA and
the Government. The Project Director would coordinate the activities of the individual consultants. The Project
Director would review and comment on consultant reports, based on these reports the PD would draft related
sections of the Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports for submission to the Government and IDA. Table Al
shows the procurement packages for technical assistance.
(ii)    Project Audit: There would be one package with a phased delivery schedule to be procured
uLnder the project for a total estimated cost of US$ 50,000. Least-Cost Selection method would be used, per
IDA's guidelines. Terms of Reference and Winning Proposal of the Audit Firm would be reviewed by IDA.
Audit reports would be submitted to IDA no later than six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year, that
is by June 30 of each subsequent calendar year. It is expected that this project would be audited three times during
the course of implemenitationi.



2.     Prior review threshtolds (Table B)
IDA's standard prior review thresholds would be used, for Goods US$50,000 and for Services US$
100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for individuals. However, since this would be anew PCU and the capacity is
unknown all documents, including terms of reference, related to the procurement of goods and services would be
subject to IDA prior review.

I Selection based on Consultant's Qualifications (CQ) would be used to procure short-term highly specialized consulting services (US$ 390,000) in
accordance with Bank Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January, 1997 and Revised September,
1997.
2 Individual consultants would be contracted on a competitive basis (US$ 510,000) all packages would be for short-term specialized services and
would be procured in accordance with Banik Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January, 1997 and
Revised September, 1997.
3 Least Cost Selection (LCS) would be used to procure project auditors (US$ 50,000) in accordance with Bank Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Banik Borrowers, January, 1997 and Revised September, 1997.



B. Disbursement
The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed in accordance with the guidelines in the "Disbursement
Handbook". The credit would be disbursed over a period of two and a half years. The project completion date
would be September 30, 2000 with a credit closing date of March 31, 2001. The disbursement categories and
amounts and percentages to be financed under each category are presented in Table D. Table E presents the
Annual ancl Cumulative Disbursement estimates.
Table D: Allocation of Credit Proceeds
1. Goods                                           45,000       100% of foreign
expenditures and
100% of local
expenditures (ex
factory cost) and
85% of local
expenditures for
other items procured
locally.
2. Consultant Services and Training               855,000               100%
3. Unallocated1                                   100,000
Total      1,000,000
The following Disbursement methods could be used:
1.     Use of statements of expenses (SOEs): SOE procedures could be used for (i) for goods costing less than
US$ 50,000 equivalent; (ii) for services of consulting firms costing less than $100,000; and (iii) for services of
individual consultants costing less than $50,000; and (iv) training, under such terms and conditions as the
Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
2.    Special account: To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower would establish, maintain and
operate, under conditions acceptable to the IDA, a Special Account in US dollars in a commercial bank
acceptable to IDA or the Central Bank. The selection process and criteria for selection of the bank would follow
IDA standard selection procedures. The authorized allocation is US$100,000 which may be withdrawn from the
Credit Account by submitting the relevant Application of Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be
submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate
supporting documents.
3.    Direct Payment: This method may be used to facilitate payments to international consultants. Direct
deposits to foreign Bank accounts can be requested by submitting the appropriate withdrawal application
supported by a contract copy and original invoices.
we expect that the majority of unallocated funds would be used to finance consulting services.
