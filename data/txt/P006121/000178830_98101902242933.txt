REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
NATIONAL RAILWAY ENTERPRISE OF BOLIVIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA FOR A
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Railway Enterprise of Bolivia (ENFE) with the Guarantee
of the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent of US$32 million to help finance
a program for the technical and financial rehabilitation of ENFE. The loan
would have a term of 25 years, including five years of grace, with interest
at 8.5% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Bolivia" (WH-213a) dated November 9, 1972 was distributed to the Executive
Directors in 1972. A new economic report is near completion and will be dis-
Lributed to the Executive Directors in the near future. Country data sheets
are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Despite the increasing importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains the poorest
country in South America. The majority of the population is engaged in trad-
itional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force participates in
salaried activities in the modern sectors. The infrastructure is still very
primitive and the road and rail networks cover only a fraction of the country.
The combination of strong traditional ties within the Indian communities and
geographic, health and educational obstacles to population mobility has per-
petuated the demographic concentration on the barren, windswept and dry 10-15
thousand feet plateau lands of Bolivia known as the Altiplano. About half of
Bolivia's population lives a physically, culturally and economically isolated
subsistence existence in this inhospitable region of limited agricultural
potential.
4.        The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual economic
structure which had characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times and
to deprive the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This
objective was only partially achieved. Progress was made in eradicating



- 2 -
feudal relations, distributing the land and eliminating obstacles to social
mobility.  Tkhe agrarian reform and the nationalization of large mines, how-
ever, were followed by declines in agricultural, mining and manufacturing
production. GDP declined in the 1950s and did not recover to its pre-1952
level until 1961.   During the subsequent decade, output increased steadily
at an average annual rate of around 5%, providing for average annual per
capita income increases of 2.5%. As a result, GNP per capita which had
fallen by 24% in the 1952-60 period had recovered, by 1970, to the 1952
level and was better distributed.
5.        In 1971, the momentum of economic growth was again lost because
of political instability and deteriorating public finances. Private invest-
ment fell and public investment was unable to fill the shortfall due to lack
of financial resources. The deterioration of public finances reflected a
structural flaw in the economy. Since the expropriations of 1952, Bolivia's
public sector became proportionately one of the largest in South America and
a source of livelihood for a sizeable segment of the population. With the
scarcity of employment opportunities in the private sector, pressures to
expand the ranks of public servants proved difficult to resist.     Increased
expenditures on wages and salaries, combined with a weak tax system, left
few resources for investment.   Moreover, the inability of the public sector
to generate adequate savings limited its capacitv to utilize external assist-
ance.
6.        On coming to power in 1971, President Banzer faced the need to
provide jobs for the unemployed and to set the basis for investment growth.
This need was faced in the conitext of a sharp deterioration in Bolivia's
terms of trade which declined by about 20% in 1971.    In late 1971, the
Governa,ent put into effect an "Emergency Program" aimed at creating jobs in
public works.   To establish a ml.ore favorable climate for private investment,
new laws offering guarantees and incentives to private investors were promul-
gated. In addition, the Government settled claims arising from earlier
nationalizations. At the same time, the Government also improved public
admninistration, and the pricing policies of some public undertakings. These
policies were successful in increasing private investment and in bolstering
the rate of growth.   They also resulted, however, in a large budgetary deficit
and losses of international reserves.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        The most important event affecting recent econ6mic performance has
been the substantial improvement in the terms of trade in 1974 caused by the
increases in petroleum and mineral prices. Although GDP growth slowed down
to about 5% in 1974--due to slower agricultural growth, stagnant hydrocarbon
output and a fall in mining output--the substantial gain in the terms of trade
has allowed a simultaneous an' large expansion of both consumption and invest-
ment.



- 3 -
8.        There has been a significant improvement in Central Government
revenue and in overall public savings. The increase in Central Government
current revenue in 1974 was close to 20% in real terms. Over one-half of
this increase was due to higher export prices.    Current expenditures increased
only bv about 5%. Thie Central Government achieved a current surplus--after
running current ,eficits during 1971-73--equivalent to nearly 50% of its
capital expenditures, which were about 17% above the 1973 level. Savings of
the public sector as a whole in 1974 increased to nearly 10% of GDP, exceeding
the sector's capital expenditures and producing an overall surplus. In contrast
to previous years when borrowing from the domestic banking system financed
close to 40% of the public sector deficit, outstanding net credit to the public
sector has been reduced by one-half between the end of 1973 and August 1974,
and public sector deposits with the banking system increased by about $b2.4
billion for the whole of 1974.
9.        The strong balance of payments performance in 1974 was the result
of sharp price increases for Bolivia's principal export commodities. On
average, export prices nearly doubled in 1974, following an increase of 25%
during the previous year. The average price of Bolivia's light crude low
sulphur petroleum was about US$15 per barrel in 1974 compared to US$4.13 in
1973. Prices of minerals and sugar also nearly doubled in 1974. Natural gas
prices increased less. However, a new long-term contract has been negctiated
with Argentina, still Bolivia's sole natural gas customer, which will provide
substantially ihigher prices from 1975 onwards. On the other hand, import
price rises approached 30-35% with much higher increases for mining and
petroleum drilling equipment, items which are becoming an increasingly
important component of Bolivia's imports. Nevertheless, the terms of trade
gain in 1974 was equivalent'to about 9% of GDP and the trade surplus reached
about US$180 million. In spite of the deficit on service account because
of higher transport costs and larger factor service payments abroad, there
was a current account surplus of nearly US$80 million. It is estimated that
net capital inflows approached US$65 million, nearly four times their 1973
level, primarily as a result of substantially higher disbursements of loans
to the public sector. The gain in net foreign reserves in 1974 was US$145
million. This brought total reserves to US$176 million, representing over
four months of imports.
10.       The growth of the Bolivian economy was accompanied by continuing
wage-price pressures during 1973-74. As a result, in part, of the openness
of the economy, Bolivia in the 1960s enjoyed relatively low rates of inflation.
The substantial devaluation at the end of 1972, however, unleashed inflationary
pressures. These pressures were accentuated by sharply rising international
prices during 1973/74, the spillover of excessive credit expansion of past
years, and the acceleration of wage increases following the 1972 devaluation.
The retail price index for La Paz (the only price index available in Bolivia)
rose 31.5% in 1973 and nearly 30% during the first two months of 1974 as
prices of basic commodities were sharply increased by the Government in an
effort to bring them into line with international prices. In addition, some
public service tariffs, such as those for railways and electricity, were
increased by the Government. Since then price rises have slowed to a monthly
average of 1-1.5%. The increase in retail prices for 1974 was about 45%.



- 4-
Debt Service and Creditworthiness
11.       Bolivia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed at end-
1974 amounted to US$723 million, equivalent to over 41% of that year's GNP.
Service on external public debt amounted to 12.9% of exports of goods and
non-factor services net of investment income abroad. This represents a
considerable reduction from Lhe debt burden of previous years which frequently
absorbed 15-20% of net export receipts. Akverage terms of the external debt
outstanding have remained soft, reflecting the high proportion of concessionary
aid channelled to Bolivia. Average interest in 1973 was 4.4% and average
maturity about 26 years.
12.       This position is bound to change, however, as it can be expected
that lending terms will become harder and the share of loans on conventional
terms will increase. Of new loans attracted during 1974, nearly one-half
were from commercial banking sources. With substantial disbursements envi-
saged during the next six years, external public debt outstanding by 1980
might be as high as US$1.9 billion (in current prices) the service of which
would absorb some 19% of net export receipts. In view of these heavy commit-
ments, prudence in choosing external capital sources and insistence on utiliz-
ing external capital for high priority purposes will have to become an essen-
tial element of Bolivia's external debt management.
13.       Bolivia enjoys a substantial resource base in agriculture, minerals
and hydrocarbons which has to be developed to sustain rapid economic growth
and, in particular, rapid expansion of export earnings in the foreseeable
future. If production in the export sectors can be increased as planned and
prices for the country's major export products (oil, gas, minerals) stay
relatively firm, Bolivia can be considered creditworthy for substantially
increased amounts of external lending on conventional terms.     Even under the
best circumstances, the country will require substantial external financing
of investment to supplement the domestic savings effort at least until the
early 1980s. Although substantially increased supplier and financial credits
will probably become available, they will at the most meet 45% of the public
capital inflow required during 1975-80 for meeting projected growth targets.
To finance the remaining gap of almost US$650 million, Bolivia will also
require international development financing, including an expanded Bank
lending program.



-5-
PART II - THE BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
14.       Bolivia is an original member of the Bank but did not receive Bank
Group resources until 1964. Bank Group assistance to Bolivia has been limited
by the country's tight budgetary situation and its limited capacity to service
external debt. Except for a Bank loan to help finance an "enclave" project,
lending to Bolivia has been in the form of IDA credits. Moreover, with the
exception of the previous credit to the Railways and the Mining Credit, Bank
Group financing has been to projects requiring no contribution from the
Government. Because of the narrow scope for private investment, the first
IFC investment, amounting to US$400,000 in a cable and plastic products enter-
prise, was not made until 1973.
15.       Annex II contains a summary statement of the Bank loan, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of March 31,-1975, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.   IDA has made a previous credit to the Railway for US$8
million, four credits for power generation and distribution (US$28.4 million),
three for livestock development (US$10.2 million) and one for mining (US$6.2
million).   The Bank made a loan (US$23.5 million) to help finance an "enclave"
project for the construction of a pipeline to transport natural gas to
Argentina.
16.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's second and the twelfth Bank
Group operation in Bolivia. Net of undisbursed balances, Bolivia's debt to
the Bank and IDA now represents 8.3% of its external public indebtedness.
This ratio might increase to 9.3% by 1980. The share of the Bank Group in
total debt service is now about 4% and is expected to increase marginally
to about 4.3% in 1980. Although the Bank Group has ranked below the US
Government and the IDB as a source of financial assistance to Bolivia, its
role has been expanding. In the period 1964-68, the first five years of
Bank/IDA lending to Bolivia, IDA credits of US$17 million were made. Addi-
tional Bank/IDA loans and credits of US$59.1 million, or more than three times
the credits made during the first five years, have been made to Bolivia since
then.
17.       Bolivia's substantial resource base in hydrocarbons, minerals and
agriculture gives promise for expanded export earnings in the foreseeable
future and provide a sufficient basis for creditworthiness to justify a shift
from IDA to Bank financing (see para. 13). We expect, however, to recommend
one more IDA credit to Bolivia for an agricultural credit project which should
be presented for your consideration in the near future.
18.       Future Bank Group activities will give emphasis to supporting Govern-
ment efforts to remedy imbalances in the distribution of the benefits of
economic growth. About half of future Bank lending is planned for agriculture,
where priority will be given to the needs of poor farmers. The Bank Group's
assistance to infrastructure projects will be concentrated in transportation,
where we have selected specific areas in which we believe serious constraints
to development exist and Bank assistance could be most effectively utilized.



- 6 -
Thus, in addition to the proposed project, we are contemplating an eventual
third project to complete the planned rehabilitation of the railway. We are
also contemplating an airport and air navigation aids equipment project
which will permit access to isolated areas of economic activity, where
transportation needs are not now adequately served. In the power sector, we
contemplate participating in the financing of a national interconnection
project, once the difficult issue of tariffs has been resolved.
19.       A common element of constraint in most development activities in
Bolivia is institutional capacity. We plan to finance projects in rural
development, small scale agro-industries, forestry, fisheries, water supply
and rural education which will contain significant elements for technical
assistance and focus on developing institutional capacity. We also hope
to be able to continue lending in the mining sector, where the existing IDA
credit provides for technical assistance. Our future financing to the sector
will furnish credit assistance to small and medium producers.
20.        In addition to the agricultural credit project, project preparation
is well advanced for two other projects. One is an integrated rural develop-
ment project with poor farmers in the Altiplano. The project is expected to
assist 4,000 families. The second is a project designed to meet the pressing
credit needs of medium size mining enterprises. It is also possible that this
project might contain a component for industrial credit, if the industrial
credit needs of the development bank handling mining credit are not adequately
met by other external lenders, such as the IDB.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
21.       The topography and geographic location of Bolivia, with three
distinct and separate regions, its rugged mountainous terrain and its distance
from the sea, makes the provision of transport facilities a difficult and
costly task. The problem is aggravated by the sparse population and large
size of the country, wqhich requires land transport to cover long distances
to serve small volumes of traffic.
Highways
22.       The present road system, consists of 28,000 km of roadway, of which
1,104 km are asphalted. Highway development was prompted and financed by
AID in the 1960s and is now a major segment of Inter-American Development
Bank financing in Bolivia. Most of the highway system is located in the
southwestern portion of the country and serves domestic transport needs.
The trucking industry has gr:own rapidly in the last decade and now carries
over 60% of domestic freight. It does so, however, at high cost. The
lack of direct access to the ports and the relative advantage of the railways
on heavy and long hauls, has meant that the role of road transport in external
trade has been negligible.



-7-
Waterways
23.       The potential of inland water transport has not yet been exploited
in Bolivia. The two major rivers, the Beni and Mamore, are isolated and
lightly travelled. Traffic on the Paraguay River is also relatively insig-
nificant. The most important waterborne traffic is by steamer across Lake
Titicaca.
Air
24.        In view of Bolivia's difficult terrain, air transport has special
importance. There is scheduled air service between 30 of the approximately
300 airports within the country. Many of these airports serve cities and
towns with no land connections.    Only three of the airports in the country
have paved runways. Despite this limitation, passenger traffic has grown
12% a year for national traffic and 10% a year for international traffic since
1968. The tonnage of international air freight has increased sharply from
approximately 2,200 tons in 1971 to 11,500 in 1973, an indication of the
lack of capacity and delays in alternate transport modes.
Pipelines
25.       Bolivia has over 2,600 km of oil pipelines and 640 km of gas pipe-
lines operated by state-owned companies. The petroleum pipelines allow
access from the major production fields to the Pacific seaport of Arica and
the Argentine border. The Bank-financed natural gas pipeline conveys gas to
Argentina. Depending on the' success of intensive exploration efforts now
underway and the proving of known reserves, significant new pipeline construc-
tion may be undertaken.
Railways
26.       The 13olivian economy relies primarily on the railway system to carry
its external trade, and a significant part of its domestic freight and passenger
traffic. The system consists of about 3,500 km of railway line. The only line
not operated by ENFE is operated by the Government mining company, COMIBOL,
over 105 km of track. The railways form two separate systems: the Western
and Eastern systems, linked only by a long detour through Argentina.
27.       The Western system was built in the period between 1870 and 1920,
largely in response to the need of the mining industry to transport its products
to the Pacific ports. These lines were built with private capital, albeit often
backed by Government guarantees. This system consists of 2,300 km of meter-
gauge railway, linking the main towns in the southwestern part of the country
and providing access to the port of Matarani in Peru, to those of Arica and
Antofagasta in Chile, and (via Villazon) to the Argentine ports. About 71%
of the freight traffic in the Western system consists of export/import
traffic.



-8-
28.       The Eastern system consists of two major lines operating over
1,200 km and was built after 1937.   One connects Corumba on the Brazilian
border to Santa Cruz, and the other connects Santa Cruz with Yacuiba on the
Argentine border. A third line, extending northeastwards from Santa Cruz,
is presently under construction. Its construction is financed by Argentina
and the line will provide access to the unexploited Beni region. The rail-
ways are the only significant mode of transport in Eastern Bolivia, the
region where most of the new exports (cotton, timber and fruits) originate.
About 80% of the traffic on the Eastern system consists of export/import
traffic.
29.       Comparisons of railway marginal costs with those estimated for
roads in the West (excluding road infrastructure) indicate that road costs
are considerably higher. Analysis of ENFE's freight traffic shows that a
large proportion consists of bulky, relatively low value products with long
hauls, for which transportation cost is a prime factor.
Planning and Coordination
30.       Transport planning and coordination in Bolivia have historically
been weak. A unit for formulating, directing and executing transport policy
now exists in the Ministry of Transportation. In a country where substantial
new investments in transport are required and where many new projects are
being considered and where there are growing intermodal relationships and
conflicts, the lack of an adequate planning unit could be a serious short-
coming which might result in costly errors. A UNDP technical assistance
program to strengthen the planning unit in the Ministry of Transportation is
now underway.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The Government of Bolivia has requested a Bank loan to help finance
the second phase of a program to rehabilitate the national railway. The
project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Bolivia in November
1974. A report, entitled "Appraisal of a Second Railway Project," No. 741-BO
dated May 9, 1975 is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A loan and project summary is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took
place in Washington from April 21 to April 25. The Government of Bolivia was
represented by Messrs. Mario Antezana and Jorge Balcazer and ENFE was repre-
sented by Messrs. Armando Murillo, Moises Ramos, and Jose Aramayo.
The First Project
32.       In the years foilowing its creation in 1964, ENFE suffered from
many of the managerial, financial and technical problems that have frequently
been experienced by railroads in developing countries. The operating and
financial difficulties of ENFE were caused by badly maintained and overaged
equipment, lack of experienced management, inadequate staff training, excess



staff and an inad-equate rate structure. To help solve these problems the
UNDP began financing a program of technical assistance to the railways
administered by the Bank in 1969. Under this program a team of French con-
sultants prepared a five-year (1973-77) investment and rehabilitation program
to modernize the railway. The Bank Group undertook to finance the foreign
exchange component of the program through an US$8 million credit made in
1972, which covered the purchase of rolling stock, diesel shunting locomotives,
spare parts, machine tools and materials for track rehabilitation. In addi-
tion to the physical works and purchases, the program for the rehabilitation
of the railways includes restoring the railways to financial health and in-
troducing modern engineering, commercial and managerial methods. Due to sharp
increases in costs, about half the items planned for purchase under the IDA
credit had to be eliminated and deferred for financing until the proposed
loan could be made. Although all of the funds under the first project have
heon committed, matcrials, te^-éls and >auipnf'-t ordered under the project did
not begin to arrive in Bolivia until the last quarter of 1974. It is there-
fore premature to measure physical progress under the first project. However,
as a result of the UNDP-financed technical assistance program, significant
improvements have been made in the management and operations of the railway.
ENFE has been reorganized in accordance with the recommendations of the
consultant and positions filled with technically competent and able personnel.
In the last year 487 employees have been retired and the railway has taken
advantage of these retirements to reduce its total number of employees
wherever possible by not hiring replacements. This program resulted in a
net reduction of 123 employees in 1973/1974. In January 1974, the railway
placed a mechanized accounting and warehousing system in operation. Construc-
tion and equipment of repair shops is proceeding satisfactorily, as well as
the program for car rehabilitation. Track repair and rehabilitation work on
lines damaged in the 1974 floods has been done and operations on these lines
restored. A new railway General Manager was appointed in January 1975 and all
indications are that he will accelerate the good work that was begun under the
first project.
Tariffs
33.       An important goal of the first project was, as indicated above,
the restoration of the financial health of the railway. The intrduction in
1972 of a rational tariff structure and an increase in the general level of
tariffs were central to the achievement of that goal. Late in 1973, and
again early in 1974, ENFE raised its tariffs on general cargo (not including
basic food products), and on passenger traffic. Although the resulting
increases in revenues were substantial, 21% in 1973 over 1972 and 48% in
1974 over 1973, they were insufficient to counterbalance rapidly increasing
costs. As a result of this and because of the expenses incurred and revenues
lost as a consequence of the heavy damage caused the railway by the severe
1974 floods, ENFE was unable to meet the financial targets established in the
first project for working and operating ratios in 1974, even though it showed
some improvement in its financial position over 1973. In January 1975,
ENFE was granted rate increases which have enhanced its financial prospects.
General cargo and mineral rates were increased 68% and basic food commodity



- 10 -
rates were increased 156%. These increases should result in profitable
operations for 1975. In subsequent years, profitable operations may require
increasing tariffs sufficiently to offset rising costs caused by inflation.
To assure that satisfactory rates will be maintained the proposed legal
documents provide (Section 3.02(d) of the Guarantee Agreement and Section
5.06 of the Loan Agreement) that, whenever the railway's costs rise substan-
tially, the Government will allow ENFE to increase its tariffs in amounts
sufficient to attain the financial targets established in Exhibit B to
Schedule 2 of the proposed Loan Agreement. The financial targets in Exhibit B
have lower ratios than those contained in the first project as a result of the
favorable impact of the January 1975 rate increases.
Project Description and Cost
34.       In 1974, the railway, with the assistance of the consultant,
revised and updated the five-year investment and rehabilitation program,
extending it to cover the period 1975-79. It is estimated that this five-
year program will cost the equivalent of US$97.6 million. The proposed
project includes the first two years of the investment program, 1975 and
1976. The estimated cost of the project is US$41.0 million of which the
US$32.0 million foreign exchange component would be financed by the proposed
loan. It will have the same general objectives as the first project which
were to technically and financially rehabilitate ENFE, and to develop the
railway system in such a way that it can efficiently meet the future trans-
port needs of the economy. The project's emphasis is on improving the
quality of ENFE's operations, and it contains the minimum investment required
to allow better use of existing facilities and to cope with prospective
increases in traffic. The acquisition of additional motive power and rolling
stock has, therefore, been kept at a moderate level.
35.       The major expenditures in the project (for a breakdown of project
costs, see Annex III) will be for rehabilitating track, building related
civil works, procuring and installing telecommunication equipment, and
purchasing rolling stock and motive power. Although expenditure for workshops,
rehabilitation of equipment and technical assistance are relatively small,
they are no less important than the major expenditures to the success of the
project. Approximately US$7.0 million of projects costs represent deferred
equipment and material purchases from the first project.
36.       The first project contained a comprehensive Program of Action,
which established time phased targets for the rehabilitation of ENFE. This
Program has been modified and appears in Schedule 2 of the proposed Loan
Agreement. The principal changes in operating targets are as results of
the delays imposed by the disastrous 1972 floods and the postponement in the
procurement of equipment and saterials due to cost overruns in the first
project.



Project Execution
37.       The Project would be carried out by ENFE.   The Board of ENFE is
chaired by the Minister of Transport, Communications and Civil Aviation and
consists of six members, including the General Manager of ENFE. Although most
policy decisions are referred to the Board, day-to-day operating decisions
are made by the railway management. As noted in paragraph 32, significant
technical assistance has been provided ENFE since 1969. Technical assistance
to ENFE will be financed by the proposed loan and should provide further
training for the staff and support for the management to help ensure the
satisfactory execution of the project.
Financing Plan
38.       The proposed Bank loan of US$32 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of the project. The borrower is, however, attempting to secure
bilateral financing for six diesel locomotives, which are estimated to cost
$3.3 million. In the event the Borrower is successful in securing such
financing, the $3.3 million reserved for locomotive financing will be can-
celled, reducing the total loan amount to $28.7 million. The proposed Loan
Agreement provides (paragraph 2(d) of Schedule 1) that withdrawals of Loan
funds will not be permitted for locomotive financing unless the Borrower has
demonstrated that it has not been able to secure bilateral financing on
reasonable terms. UNDP financing would fund the work of consultants foi-
ENFE until Bank financing became available. The balance of the required
funds for the project would come from ENFE's internal cash generation (the
equivalent of US$5.0 million) and Government financial assistance (the equi-
valent of US$4.0 million).
Economic Evaluation
39.       The project will improve the operating efficiency of the railway
system and expand its capacity to meet the future demands of traffic. If
the project were not to be implemented, the decline in the quality of service
and the reduced capability to move traffic would result in a massive diversion
to more expensive road traffic. The economic rate of return for the project,
which takes into consideration the higher cost of transport by road, has been
estimated at 24%.
Procurement
40.       Equipment financed by the proposed loan will, in general, be
procured through international competitive bidding. Exceptions will be
permitted in instances where international competitive bidding would be
clearly inappropriate or inefficient. For example, it will be necessary to
purchase spare parts that are compatible with ENFE's existing equipment.
Negotiated procurement would be permitted for these items, whose cost is
expected to total $2.8 million. A restricted international bidding procedure
would be permitted for purchasing the six main line diesel electric locomotives.
if the Borrower has been unsuccessful in securing bilateral financing. Under
this procedure bids would be taken from manufacturers of locomotives now in



- 12
ENFE's fleet of diesel locomotives or from manufacturers whose locomotives are
in current use in neighboring countries. Such procurement would permit
standardization of ENFE's small fleet of diesel locomotives, and/or facilitate
the interchanges of equipment and the use of repair facilities in neighboring
countries. In the case of contracts of less than $100,000, a simplified
bidding procedure, permitting bids to be solicited from not less than three
suppliers without newspaper publication, will be permitted. Civil works
contracts will not be financed by the proposed loan.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and ENFE, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the Bank and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
42.       A condition of loan effectiveness would be the submission of ENFE's
1973 audit report. Besides the specific features mentioned elsewhere in this
Report, the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements conform to the usual pattern
in loans for railway projects.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 148 - Second ENDE Power Project, US$7.4 million, April 28, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project has been successfully completed. The undisbursed
balance represents contractor payments that will be made upon termination
of the guarantee period.
Credit 261 - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million, June 25,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project implementation was delayed in 1974 for several reasons.
Extensive areas in the Beni were flooded during early 1974 causing serious
losses in cattle and pasture; the politically powerful Beni Ranchers Asso-
ciation resisted the introduction of indexing of sub-loans; and the financial
position of the agricultural Bank of Bolivia (BAB) deteriorated. In July
1974, IDA suggested to the Government that BAB refrain from submitting with-
drawal applications until the sub-loans for cattle were indexed and BAB
received a Government transfer of $b20.O million to complete disbursements.
After some initial delays, the Government undertook the suggested actions.
IDA has agreed with the Government on the introduction of an acceptable
indexing system for the livestock component and the Government has contributed
$b20 million to BAB. It is anticipated that IDA disbursements will be resumed
in the near future and that the credit will be fully disbursed by the closing
date of June 30, 1977.
Credit 346 - Railway Project, US$8 million, December 1, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Status of the project is discussed in Part III of this Report.
Credit 433 - Third ENDE Power Project, US$6 million, October 17, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Santa Cruz gas turbine was put into service in December 1974.
Because of delays in preparing bid documents and possible future delays in
equipment delivery, completion of the various transmission line and sub-
station equipment components is expected to be six months to two years behind
the appraisal estimate. The project's foreign and total costs are expected
to be 40-50 percent above appraisal estimates. Although the beneficiary's
recent financial performance has been satisfactory, it needs tariff increases
to maintain its agreed upon 9% rate of return in 1975 and future years.



ANNEX II

Credit 455 - Mining Credit Project, US$6.2 million, January 18, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is proceeding as scheduled and the credit should be
fully committed by the second quarter of 1976. Largely because of increased
costs, the average size of mining projects are double the US$200,000 original
estimate. A second project for additional lending to medium miners.is planned
for FY76.

Procurement:              Most of the contracts to be financed by the proposed
loan would be through international competitive bid-
ding. Negotiated procurement will be permitted to
permit the acquisition of spare parts or equipment
that are compatible with ENDE's existing equipment.
A restricted international competitive bidding
procedure would be permitted for the acquisition of
six main line diesel locomotives. This procedure
would allow bids to be taken from manufacturers of
locomotives now in ENDE's fleet, or from manufac-
turers whose locomotives are in current use in
neighboring countries. Such procurement would permit
standardization of ENDE's small fleet of diesel
locomotives, and/or facilitate the interchange of
equipment and the use of repair facilities in
neighboring countries. A simplified procurement
procedure will be permitted for contracts of
