INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR
THE FOURTH KARACHI PORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent
of US$16.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for
the development of the Port of Karachi. The proceeds of the Credit would
be relent to Karachi Port Trust (KPT) for 25 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 % per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Economic Situation and Prospects
of Pakistan" (392-PAK, dated Aprll 1, 1974) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on April 19, 1974. A cotntry data sheet is attached as Annex I.
l
3.        The economy of Pakistan (the former West Pakistan) grew rapidly
during the Second Plan (1960-65), with GDP increasing at 6.7% per annum.
This high growth was spearheaded by an industrial growth of 13.1% per annum.
However, agriculture grew by only 3.7% per annum.   West Pakistan's overall
economic growth slowed down somewhat during the Third Plan (1965-70) to about
6% per annum. The industrial growth rate fell to 7.6%, but agricultural out-
put grew at 5.6% annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties, reducing, but not eliminating, the food deficit.
4.        Though it is hardly apparent in these figures, Pakistan's econo-
mic development began to encounter a number;of difficulties after 1965.
Import restrictions and other direct controls introduced at that time be-
came permanent as the shortage of foreign exchange and budget resources
persisted, owing to higher defense expenditure, rising foreign debt service,
and decreased nonproject foreign aid. Both net capital inflow and domestic
savings declined, and investment fell from about 22% of GDP in 1964/65
to about 17% in 1969/70, and to only 11% in 1971/72. The slowdown in
industrial growth, along with urban population growth rates of more than
5%, led to a rapid rise in urban unemployment. In rural areas, it was the
larger farmers of West Pakistan who got most of the benefits from the new
"green revolution".
5.        The economy un(lerwent severe strains during 1970/71 and 1971/72,
reflecting both political events and a prolonged drought which virtually
halted the increase in agricultural output.   In 1972/73, however, the eco-
nomy showed signs of revival. With a recovery in industrial production and
a record wheat crop of 7.4 million tons, GDP is estimated to have grown by
about 6%. Devaluation in May 1972 has been successful in making Pakistani
exports more competitive in international markets, in increasing incentives
to produce for the local market, and in bringing about a much more liberal
system of import control.   In 1972/73, exports rose by 36%, and the State



Bank's foreign exchange reserves, net of IMF position, doub:Led to US$360
million in the year ended June 1973, although they declined to US$331 million
at the end of February 1974. For 1973/74 exports are projected to rise by
at least 30 percent in current prices, although the volumes of th'e principal
export commodities (cotton, cotton yarn, cotton textiles and rice, are all
expected to decline.   The trade gap is expected to widen considertbly and
net foreign exchange reserves to decline by $100-150 million.    Ilowever,
this worsening of the balance of payments reflects particularly the ravages
of last August's floods on agricultural production and inventories, and the
trade deficit is projected to be as much as $250 million less in 1974/75
than in 1973/74.
6.        The floods which occurred after the monsoon last year were a
set-back for the reviving economy, which the Government expected to grow
by 83Z in 1973/74.  The floods caused damage to standing crops of cotton,
rice, sugar and animal fodder. There were also substantial losses of
wheat stocks and cattle, and damage, in some areas, to farm equipment,
h3mes, transDort, telecommunications and canal networks. Nevertheless,
intensive efforts to repair flood damage, replant damaged acreage, and
otherwise maiimize output are expected to result in a 5 to 6% growth rate.
A mission from tile Bank and the United Nations visited Pakistan last October
to assess the flood damage and the need for external aid. Based on its
report, a credit for flood rehabilitation was approved on March 12 this year.
7.        The major problems now facing Pakistan are to stimulate output
and employment, to control inflation, to in,rease public and private saving
and investment, and to improve the distribution of income. Despite reason-
ably rapid growth in 1972/73, the domestic supply of essential consumption
goods is still inadequate. Together with the increased income resulting
from the strong rise in exports, this has been an important factor behind
the rapid rise in prices. Wholesale and consumer prices increased 20% or
more in 1972/73 reflecting both these domestic pressures and sharp in-
creases in international prices for Pakista:a's principal exports (cotton,
cotton textiles, and rice) and imports. Since attempts to contain infla-
tion througlh increased subsidies and price controls were having but limited
success, the Government last summer took strong measures to curb demand.
The flood caused a sharp increase in prices in August and September but
since then the cost of living index has been rising at considerably less
than the pre-flood rate.
8.        The present high prices of Pakistan's major exports may well de-
cline, with adverse effects on the balance of payments and plublic finances.
Recorded investment in real terms has not increased in the current year, but
there is evidence that unrecorded investment in small-scale Industry and
agriculture has been substantial. If the necessary saving and investment
are forthcoming, Pakcistan's growth prospects are good. Exports seem limited
more by supply constaints rather than lack of demand.
9.        Water from Tarbela Dam will probably be available from the end
of 1974 and the increasing participation of small and medium--scale farmers
in the 'green revolution" could mean that agricultural growth in the next



-3-
5 years will at least match the 5.6% annual rate of the 1965-70 Third
Plan period. Capital goods, light engineering goods, and agro-based indus-
tries also have good growth prospects. The recent rise in the oil price
will obviously be a constraint on Pakistan's growth but the economy does have
certain strengths which make it less vulnerable to the oil shortage than most
developing countries. Electric power production is derived roughly equally
from hydro resources and natural gas, with only a very small proportion based
on oil. Furthermore, new hydro-power will soon become available; by 1976,
hydro-electric power generation is expected to be double its 1973 level,
w%-ich will add about 50% to total output.  Pakistan's exports are expected
to increase in 1974/75 by more than the added costs of petroleum imports.
Provided the-:efore that Pakistan can obtain foreign capital and generate
sufficient domestic savings to finance the necessary investment, there are
reasonable prospects that economic growth could average about 7% annually
over the next several years.
10.       Pakistan's external public debt at the end of December 1972
amounted to US$4.8 billion equivalent, of which US$870 million was undis-
bursed. Pakistan's debt service, as present:ly scheduled, would rise from
US$180 million in 1972/73 to about US$400 million by 1975/76. This rapid
increase reflects the debt rescheduling operations which were arranged in
May 1972 and June 1973; it would mean a rise in the debt service ratio from
18% in 1972/73 to around 30% in 1975/76. However, it is not likely that
Pakistan will be called upon to repay as much as this; countries which are
members of the Pakistan Consortium have agreed that, after July 1, 1974,
Pakistan will not be asked to service debts,on account of projects visibly
located in Bangladesh. Moreover, Consortium countries have agreed to con-
sider providing further debt relief to Pakistan on a long-term basis. The
Bank has prepared a study on this subject and the matter is now under con-
sideration by the Consortium.
11.       While such relief would certainly ease Pakistan's debt burden,
it will still be desirable for assistance to Pakistan to be on terms as
concessional as possible. For this reason, the major part of the Bank
Group aid to Pakistan is provided by IDA. However, some Bank lending to
Pakistan is justified. Until December 1973, when the Bank approved a
$25 million loan for industrial investment, no Bank loans had been made
since June 1970, and consequently, the volume of Bank loans disbursed
and outstanding has been declining over the past few years. On March 31,
1974, it amounted to $296 million equivalent, or less than 8% of Pakistan's
total external public debt. Including undisbursed balances, Pakistan's debt
to the Bank and IDA now represents about 22% of its external public indebt-
edness; by 1980 this ratio might increase to about 24%. The share of the
Bank Group in total debt service is now about 17% and is expected to decrease
to about 10% in 1980.



-4-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
12.       The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for East and West) between the start of operations in 1952
and June 30, 1971. The Bank and IDA had committed $1.2 billion to the
country, about one-half of which was provided by the Bank ancL one-half by
IDA. Of this amounc, one loan and 19 development credits, totalling US$4.7
million and US$168.1 million, respectively (net of cancellation), were for
projects located wholly within what was thet. East Pakistan arnd another 10
loans and 8 development credits involved expenditures in both East and West
Pakistan.
13.       In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the Biank and IDA,
and it was agreed that Bangladesh would take over liability for credits
made for all projects in its territory, which were not completted. Accord-
ingly, 11 such credits in an aggregate amount of US$151.4 million have
since been made to Bangladesh. Of this amount, US$44.1 million has been
used for the notional repayment of amounts disbursed under the correspond-
ing previous credit agreements with Pakistan. Bangladesh has recently
agreed to enter discussions with all members of the Pakistan Consortium
concerning tne assumption of liability for debts on account of projects
visibly located in Bangladesh. The Bank, too, has started discussions
with Bangladesh with a view to the taking over by Bangladesh of liability
for the remaining amounts which were fully disbursed for the benefit of what
is now Bangladesh under Bank loans and IDA credits to Pakistan.
14.       Of the US$1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East and West), West
Pakistan received about 72%. During its long association with Pakistan,
the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the economy. Until
1972, 38% of the total commitments were for the public services, 29% for
agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for industrial imports, and 1% for educa-
tion. Lending for public services amounted to some US$325 million and in-
cluded loans and credits for railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi
Port, highwavs, telecommunications and water supplies. A large part of the
lending for agriculture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for in-
dustry hias been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation (PICIC). For all the projects for which loans and credits are
now being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactorily. The
principal problems being encountered are that the rates charged by the public
services have not kept pace with the inflation and hence some utilities are
not earning the returns which they need, and that some borrowing agencies
have financial problems arising from the loss of assets in the former East
Pakistan. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of March 31, 1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Lending operations will in future have two main objectives.    The
first is to continue to improve the institutions which are responsible for
the principal public services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending
in the past, namely, the Port of Karachi, the Telegraph and Telephone Depart-
ment, the Water and Power Development Authority, the Pakistan Railways, and



- 5 -
the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company. In most of these, institutional
improvements are being made with technical assistance financed by the Bank
and in some cases, major reforms are likely in the near future. The second
objective is to expand lending operations in other fields and, for this
purpose, a number of missions have visited Pakistan, or will shortly do so,
in order to examine the problems and possibilities of preparing projects in
other sectors.   A mission to review the drainage and irrigation sector has
just returned and has identified a number of projects in the field of irri-
gation, salinity control and land reclamation. Another mission has been
studying the results of a UNDP-sponsored technical assistance project for a
master plan for the city of Karachi. Other missions which will visit Pakistan
in the next few months will study the Government's plans for rural development
and for the encouragement of small industries. Bank Group assistance will
also be continued for the industrial sector by financial assistance for the
Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC) and the Indus-
trial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP).
16.       For the current fiscal year, two operations have alread) been
approved, a Bank loan of US$25 million for industrial investment to be
administered by PICIC, and a credit of US$35 million for rehabilitation after
the flood of August 1973. A loan of US$35 million for the Multan Fertilizer
project is scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors on May 7.
The proposed credit will complete the lending program for this fiscal year.
A project for telecommunications is under consideration for FY 1975, and
projects for highway improvement, for the expansion of the natural gas
transmission system and for seed multiplication are being prepared.    Over
the longer term, the Bank Group's lending program for Pakistan will include
increasing emphasis in the area of irrigation and drainage, livestock, rural
development and credit in the agricultural sector; assistance to the new
National Development Finance Corporation, as well as continued support for
PICIC and IDBP; and urban projects with emphasis in Karachi and Lahore.
17.       In addition to its lending operations, the Bank will continue
to serve as Chairman of the Pakistaa Consortium. The next meeting of the
Consortium will be held in Paris on May 14 and 15, at which the new economic
report prepared by the Bank will be considered.
18.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 millioa by
equity participations. (They are shown in Annex II.) About US$14 million
remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the
field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - T1E TRANSPORT SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
r
19.       The main traffic flows in Pakistan connect the thickly populated
area around Lahore with the port and industrial area of Karachi some 700
miles to the south, with the industrial and agricultural areas around
Lyallpur, Sargodha and Kushab to the west and with the administrative center



- 6 -
of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to the northwest.   All these main routes are
served by rail, road and air transport and by a natural gas p:ipeline system
based on the Sui and Mari fields.
20.       Pakistan Western Railways (PWR) is Government-owned and operated
and constitutes one of the largest organizations in the country.    For many
years the railways provided the main means of mechanized transport; however,
ar. increasing proportion of transport is being carried by road, and railway
traffic has shown little overall growth. Freight traffic in t:on-miles is
now divided about equally between road and rail. PWR's operations have been
studied in 1970/71 by consultants, financed under a Bank loan,, who have made
recommendations for improvements in management and operations which PWR in-
tends to implement with the consultant's assistance.
21.       Motorized road traffic is growing at about 10% a year and is the
principal means of transport in urban areas. While truck transport has been
free of significant Government regulations for more than a decade, bus
regulation was liberalized only in 1970. Since then, there has been an
increase in the number of buses in operation and a substantial improvement
in service. Animal-drawn traffic remains important in rural areas. The
overall condition of the road system ranges from fair to poor:; total length
is about 48,000 miles, of which about 33,000 miles are unimproved.
22.       Air transport is provided by the Government-owned Pakistan Interna-
tional Airlines which operates international and domestic services. The
number of passengers carried on West Pakistan domestic routes showed an
average annual growth rate of 11% from 1962-71.
23.       Pakistan's merchant marine in 1972 consisted of some 57 vessels,
about 600,000 dwt, which carried about 8% of the country's overseas trade
(15% if petroleum is excluded); the National Shipping Corporat:ion accounted
for about half the ships and 75% of the goods carried; except in 1971-72,
its operations have been profitable.
24.       This basic structure of the domestic transport system has not been
changed by the events of the past two years, but important chatnges are taking
place in the pattern of Pakistan's international aviation and shipping oper-
ations which are developing new route patterns. Also, overlarLd traffic to
the Middle East and Europe is beginning to develop.
25.       Public development expenditures for transport reflect the increased
emphasis being given to highways, which were allocated 42% of such expenditures
in 1972/73, and, according to the recommendations of a Bank-assisted Transport
Coordination Study, this pattern should continue for at least the next five
years. The study also indicates that the railway system operates inefficiently.
The railways have received a substantial amount of external aid (Rs. 1,200
million over the past ten years) for capital expansion, but the growth of
traffic has been slower than expected. Improvements in railway operational
efficiency have a higher priority than additional investments in the near
future.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The Bank Group has been associated with the development of
Karachi Port for almost 20 years. Bank loans of US$14.8 million and
US$17.0 million were made in 1955 and 1964 to assist earlier development
programs. The loan for the first project was fully disbursed in 1962. The
second project was delayed by difficult foundation conditions and later by
the Indo-Pakistan wars and labor troubles. The difficulties have now been
brought under control and the berths are in use, although a transit shed and
some ancillary works remain to be completed. All foreign currency expendi-
tures are expected to be made before the revised Closing Date of June 1974.
An engineering credit of US$1.0 million was made in 1970 for studies in
preparation for the Third Karachi Port Project, for which a credit was
approved on June 28, 1973 (Credit 422-PAK) and became effective on
December 14, 1973.
27.       The total of imports and exports passing through the Port of
Karachi has grown from 5.8 million tons in 1964 to 10.3 million tons in
1973. The port is intensively used, with a berth occupancy of almost 100%,
made possible, in part, through double-banking of ships and at the expense
of substantial ship waiting time. The Third Karachi Port Project consists
of the construction of four additional general cargo berths and the re-
construction of a road bridge in the port area and will complete the devel-
opment of the general cargo berths in the present port area. However,
additional general cargo berths required by 1979 will require development
of the so-called "Western Backwater" of Karachi Port. A feasibility study
undertaken with UNDP financing indicated that the Western Backwater could
a:.so be used for deep-drafted bulk carriers. However, the Government is
also consideting the desirability of developing additional port factlities
for bulk materials, such as oil and iron ore, at Phitti Creek, ten miles to
the east of Karachi. A prefeasibility study of this site has been made by
a Japanese technical assistance team; but, since the cost of developing a
wholly new port will be substantial, a proper evaluation of relevant tech-
nical and economic factors is needed before such a major decision is taken.
The Government is undertaking the necessary studies.
28.       The port has three oil berths.   One berth built in 1910 is very
dilapidated, and all three have very limited alongside depths of water, so
that imports of crude oil tend to be carried in small, old tankers with low
discharge rates. The proposed project will provide a new oil berth to
replace the dilapidated pier and to meet the expected future growth in oil
traffic until about 1981; it is based largely on the recommendations of
consultants appointed under the 1970 engineering credit. It was appraised
in August 1973, and negotiations took place in Washington in March 1974.
The Government of Pakistan was represented by Mr. A.M. Mufti, Economic
Minister of the Pakistan Embassy and the Karachi Port Trust by Admiral
Hasnain, Chairman of the Board, Mr. Aftab Alam, Engineer-in-Chief, and
Mr. Z. Zaidi, Chief Accounts Officer.



= 8 -
29.       The Appraisal Report (No. 303-a-PAK) on the proposed project
is being distributed to Executive Directors separately. A project summary
is attached as Annex III.
30.       The Port of Karachi is managed by a body corporate known as the
Trustees of the Port of Karachi (KPT) - a Board consisting of eleven trustees
representing shipowners, shippers, labor, and the Government, including a
chairman appointed by the Government. The chairman is respor,sible for day-
to-day port operations. The KPT is a generally efficient organization, with
adequate authority to carry out its responsibilities. Some improvements in
its organizational structure and its accounting system were suggested by
mtnagement consultants retained under the 1970 Engineering Credit and KPT
is expected to implement a new management and cost accounting system, and to
make changes in the organizational structure, by June 1975.
Project Description
31.       The project consists of the construction of an oil berth capable
of accommodating 75,000 dwt oil tankers, complete with oil handling facili-
ties, and equipment for fire-fighting and for containing and removing any
spillage occurring during the unloading process. The berth will initially
be dredged to 44 ft. alongside to accommodate 45,000 dwt tankers at all
stages of the tide; the project includes the purchase of a trailing-suction
hopper dredger. In addition, the present 29 ft. deep approach channel will
be deepened in two stages, first to 37 ft. (35/40,000 dwt tankers) by
contract dredging and, when this is completed, KPT will further deepen it
to 40 ft. (45,000 dwt tankers) using the trailing-suction hopiper dredger,
the purchase of which forms part of the proect. KPT will also deepen
alongside one of the existing berths so that it can handle 35,000 dwt tankers.
A sectLion of the approach channel will be dredged to 45 ft. (75,000 dwt
tankers) to study the feasibility of maintaining the channel at that depth.
Appropriate navigational aids are included in the project, whtich also
provides for technical assistance for operating and maintaining the new
dredger and assessing results of the test dredging. Consultants will super-
vise the civil works, contract dredging and dredger construction. To ensure
the utilization of the expanded port oil berth facilities, Patkistan has agreed
to guarantee the proposed expansion by the oil companies of t:heir respective
tankage and pipeline facilities (Section 3.04 of the Development Credit Agree-
ment).
Cost andl Financing of the Project
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs. 236.5 million
(US$23.9 million equivalent), and the foreign exchange component is about
Rs. 162.0 million (US$16.4 million equivalent) of which Rs. 158.4 million
(US$16.n million equivalent) would be financed by the proposed credit; the
balance of foreign exchange, Rs. 3.6 million (US$0.36 milliorn equivalent)
incurred by KPT in operating the new dredger for the maintenance and further
dredging of the approach channel from 37 to 40 ft. under the Project will be
met by KPT. The estimates for civil works, which include a 10% allowance
for physical contingencies and an allowance for price increases of 20% on



foreign currency costs and 29% on local currency costs, are based on final
engineering studies. All contracts for civil works, equipment and dredging,
together with procurement of the dredger, will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Evaluation of bids for civil works will
include a 7-1/2% preference for eligible domestic contractors. Details of
the cost estimates, which include customs duties, and estimated disbursements
are shown in Annex III.
33.       The project is a part of KPT's investment program through 1983,
which amounts to US$155.3 million equivalent and includes the ongoing and
proposed Bank Group projects, the construction of six berths in the Western
Backwater estimated to cost US$70.0 million, and other capital expenditure
amounting to US$23.2 million. About 42% of the funds required for this pro-
gram will be met from KPT's own resources, 2% from grants, and the remaining
56% from borrowing.
34.       The financial position of KPT is sound and, provided port charges
are maintained at adequate levels, it should have no difficulty in meeting
all operating expenses and debt service requirements, and in providing its
required contribution to the financing of the investment program. To this
end, KPT has agreed to maintain a rate of return of not less than 4% on net
fixed assets from 1976 through 1981 and 7% from 1982 onwards, and has under-
taken to adjust its tariff structure by July, 1975, so as to include the
introduction of charges related to berth occupancy time (Project Agreement,
Sections 4.05 and 4.06).
35.       The proposed IDA credit would be made to Pakistan which would
relend the proceeds to KPT for a term of 25 years, including a 5-year
grace period, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum.
Economic Justification
36.       The dilapidated condition of the existing 25,000 dwt capacity Oil
Pier No. 3 makes its replacement a matter of urgency. A berthing accident
could, at any time, destroy the pier, thus depriving the port of one-third
of its present capacity for berthing oil tankers. This could result in
serious ship delays and a rapidly escalating cost to the Pakistan economy
in the form of demurrage fees and higher freight charges, as well as a
shortage of petroleum products, which would have far-reaching effects on
the economy. The proposed project, therefore, would have very great, although
unquantifiable, benefits in the form of assured capacity to handle forecast
oil traffic until about 1981. In the absence of any significant new discov-
eries in the domestic oilfields, the proportion of crude oil requirements
supplied by imports will continue to increase with the demand for petroleum
products. Consumption of middle distillates, the most important of the re-
fined products, is forecast to increase at 8% per annum. The forecast as-
sumes that the escalating cost of crude oil will have only a limited impact
on consumption and that balance of payments considerations will not result
in Government action to restrict imports.



- 10 -
37.       In addition to the foregoing unquantifiable benefits, the project
would yield substantial benefits in the form of lower ocean freight costs
by permitting the use of larger tankers for petroleum imports and exports;
it would also avoid the capital cost of two smaller oil piers (for 25,000 dwt
tankers) which would otherwise be necessary before 1978 and, possibly, of a
third by 1983. These benefits yield a return of 23% on the total project
cost. Port services will be priced so as to recover the project costs and
to earn a reasonable return on invested capital, thereby ensuring that an
adequate proportion of the project's benefits accrue to Pakistan rather than
to foreign shipowners.
Ecology
38.       The dredging spoil resulting from deepening the entrance channel
will be dumped in an approved area which has been used for this purpose
by KPT over a considerable period without detrimental effects on the ecology.
The provision of floating collars for containing any spillage and means of
removing it are included in the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Repub-
lic of Pakistan and the International Development Association, the draft
Project Agreement between KPT and the Association, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement and of the Project
Agreement of special interest concerning the expansion of private oil hand-
ling facilities and the financial undertakings of KPT are referred to in
paragraphs 31 and 34, respectively, of this report.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.        1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution
Loan No. 266        Indus Basin:  US$90 Million Loan of September 19,
1960; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completed.
Some minor remedial works have still to be finished and settlement remains
to be made on a number of claims. Further disbursement of this Loan (main-
ly for Tarbela Dam), which was interrupted in 1971 by agreement with the
United States in order to disburse first the loan contribution of the
United States to the Indus Basin Development Fund, has now resumed. Work
on the Tarbela Dam project is proceeding on schedule. The original Closing
Date of September 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 50          Education: US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964:
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project suffered initial delays due to administre.tive
difficulties, shortages of building materials, lack of local funds, the
1971 war and, more recently, extensive floods. The pace of implementation
has i:nproved but problems of equipment procurement and shortages of building
materials remain. All construction contracts have been awarded, of which
about 76% are completed. Equipment installed at the agricultural university
represents about 80% of the total allocated. The project is expected to be
completed by the new Closing Date.
Loan No. 376        Karachi Port:  US$17.0 Million Loan of March 14, 1964;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially. The
total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate of US$37.5
million to US$47.0 million but there has been no change in the foreign
exchange component of US$17.0 million. This increase has not materially
affected the economic justification of the project. The project was first
delayed by difficulties with the original design of the wharves. In 1967
work had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned. Later, it was found
that more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant further
delay. The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the delay.
The difficulties now appear to have been brought under control and the
works are now approaching completion. The dredging operations, although
more than 90;% complete, are still behind schedule but are now being expedited.
The original Closing Date of March 31, 1969, was extended first to June 30,
1972, and then to June 30, 1974, the current date.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that t'.ey do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 548        Tarbela Dam; US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disburse-
ments are expected until FY 1976. Good progress is being maintained on
the project. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted through
tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage - the construction of the
closure section of the dam - to be undertaken. The main civ:il works
contractors have submitted substantial claims on account of 'Labor costs,
inflation and the 1972 devaluation of the Rupee which are being considered
by a special Government committee.
Cr. Nio. 145         Telecommunications; US$16.0 Million Credit of
March 6, 1969 Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Cr. No. 186          Telecommunications;_SU$15.0 Million Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Th,ere have been delays in implementing both these credits. The
original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the two credits of
about US$11.3 million in the former East Wing and US$19.7 million in the
West. US$5.2 million of the undisbursed balance of Credit 145-PAK was
cancelled in November, 1972 after a telecommunications project to Bangladesh
was approved. The Closing Date of 145-PAK was extended from the original
date of December 31, 1972 to December 31, 1974. The Closing Date of Credit
186-PAK has been extended from December 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975; and
the credit proceeds have been reallocated to reflect the increased costs
of imports resulting from the realignment of currencies. This will also
allow GOP more time for the reorganization of the Pakistan Telephone and
'lelegraph Department, the introduction of an effective accounting system
and the completion of installation of equipment under the Credits.
Loan No. 590         Development Finance Compan   - PICICL US$40.0
Million Loan of March 21, 1969; Clos:ingDate:
September 30   1975
This Loan has been fully committed.   The original C:Losing Date
of March 31, 1974, has been extended to Septenber 30, 1975, to enable
disbursements to be made for the last sub-project.
Loan so. 621         Railways; US$14.5 Million Loan of Jurte 26, 1969:
Closing Date: December 31 1975
Progress on (a) tile renewal ancd improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) relhabilitation and improvement for workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. tiowever, the proposal for the expansion of the marshalling
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead.   The change was based on a
feasibility study conducted by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France), who indicated
that a new yard at Pipri would be economically and operationally preferable.
The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has been extended by three

years to December 31, 1975, to allow time for Pipri yard to be built and
the balance of the loan has been reallocated. PWR has also reappointed the
consultants for a period of 18 months.
Cr.. No. 157        Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969j Closing Date:
December 31, 1974
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the original
schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in lending for
tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical connections were
originally responsible for this delay. The original Closing Date of
June 30, 1972, was first extended to June 30, 1974 and then to December 31,
1974.
Cr. No. 177          Development Finance Company- IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11,_970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Altlhough IDBP has restored its organizational effectiveness, the
loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching repercussions on its
financial position. Pending a satisfactory solution of this problem, and
to enable IDBP to resume lending to industry, the unwithdrawn amount of the
credit has been converted into a Government owned fund administered by
IDBP as an agent of the Government. The original Closing Date of
Decerber 31, 1974, has been postponed to December 31, 1977.
Loan No. 696        Gas Transmission:   US$19.2 Million Loan of June 29,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also
caused a small increase in its cost (less than 3%). The project was
substantially completed in July 1973, but to enable disbursements to be
made for retention payments and some equipment procurement, the original
Closing Date of June 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 206         En ineering Education: US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Construction of the College started in February, 1974. Civil
works and equipment procurement will probably be completed before the
Closing Date but the staff development program has been slow to start and
may extend beyond that time. The cost of the civil works is expected to
increase from Rs 16 million to Rs 31 million. But due to the devaluation
of the rupee, the credit amount will be sufficient to meet IDA's share of
this increase. However, the Government will need to provide an additional
Rs 6.7 million to make up its share.

Implementation of the project is ncw proceeding much more
satisfactorily.   Contracts to the value of about US$17.0 million equivalent
have been placed. Orders for remaining equipment are expected to be placed
soon. The first consignments of equipment are beginning to arrive in
Pakistan. Some difficulty has been experienced in acquiring the necessary
sites for substations and the delivery of six 30MVA transformers has had
to be delayed. WAPDA is making every effort to speed up acquisition pro-
ceedings. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 has been postponed
to December 31, 1975.
