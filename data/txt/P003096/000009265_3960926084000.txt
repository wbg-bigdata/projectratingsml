NoRANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE FOR AN
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development 'redit to the Republic of Zaire
for SDR 9.2 million (US$12.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms and would assist in financing a project which,
within the framework of GOZ's structural adjustment program, aims at improving
Government's economic management capacity in the short and long terms.
2.       Backaround.  Zaire's economic difficulties, beginning in the mid-70's, stem
largely from ill-conceived policies and poor investment decisions. In 1983, Government
embarked on a comprehensive stabilization-cum-liberalization program with IMF support.
Resumption of economic growth remained slow due to continued rapid deterioration in
Zaire's terms-of-trade and heavy burden of external debt. While resource constraints
were a major cause leading to underfunding of investment, public management deficiencies
were another, resulting in uneven asplication of major policy changes. In 1985,
Government requested Bank assistance to tackle these deficiencies, by strengthening its
capacity to monitor and coordinate economic policies, and to remove critical policy and
institutional constraints. Preparatory work to define an institutional strengthening
program for core ministries started in early 1986 financed under a PPF; soon afterwards
came the preparation of a structural adjustment program. The analyses show that except
in the area of investment programming and budgeting, where no permanent structure exists
and therefore one should be created, relevant structures do exist. The critical
weaknesses, however, lie in the absence of well-established management systems, lack of
effective ^,ontrol, and the low motivation and competence of civil servants. Government
is now committed to carrying out a structural adjustment program, to be supported by an
IDA/SFA Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC), which includes measures to address these
critical weaknesses, and sets the parameters for a public management rehabilitation
program.
3.       Prolect Obiectives.  The  project is designed to help Government implement the
SAC measures in the short term, and at the same time, initiate long-term efforts to build
up its capability in planning and financial management: (a) in the short-term, it would
support the establishment of a mechanism in the Planning Ministry to handle the
disbursement of Government budget contributions to projects included in the core 1987-89
Public Investment Program (PIP) and of a system to monitor implementation of policy
reforms including fiscal measures and their economic impact; and (b) as the first phase
of a longer term institutional development program, it would assist GOZ in developing a
permanent capacity in the core institutions to prepare and implement a rational public
investment/public expenditure program, through : (i) strengthening the Planning
Ministry's capacity to coordinate investment programming; (ii) improving the Budget
Ministry's capacity to program and implement public expenditures; and (iii) increasing
the Finance Ministry's capacity to mobilize resources, improve tax administration and
organization, and monitor public accounts. The project would also support improvement of
Government's capacity to monitor public enterprise (PE) management and to launch a pilot
effort to improve civil service employment conditions, consistent with the civil service
reform objectives and structure agreed under the SAL credits.
4.       Prolect Description.  Financing w',uld be provided for services of national and
international consultants, training activities, equipment and vehicles, studies and
impact analyses, and incremental operatirg costs to strengthen the core economic
ministries focusing on the following critical areas:
I. Investment irotrammina an#. budactina. The project would assist in (a)
establishing within the Planning Ministry a Directorate with overall responsibility for
investment programming and budgeting aud developing methodologies and procedures to help
selected ministries and agencies carry out this function at the sectoral and regional



- 2 -
levels; (b) improving the capacity of the Macro-Economic Directorate to develop medium-
term projections and monitor macro-economic indicators; and (c) refining the
organizational structure, management systems, and staffing pattern of the Planning
Ministry. Expected results would be : itl the short-term : quick disbursement of funds to
projects included in the 1987-39 core PIP; in the long-term t sustained capability to
produce : a 3-year revolving PIP updated annually; annual reports on the implementation
of the core PIP; an annual macro-ec-onomic framework as basis for investment programing;
and improved quarterly newsletter on economic indicators.
II. Budgetint and Financial Manatement.  The project would assist the Budget and
Finance Ministries in improving (a) the Budgeting mechanism for investment and recurrent
expenditures through adoption of (i) an improved budget classification framework, (ii)
better methods of revenues and expenditures estimation, (iii) centralized reporting of
expenditures of all sources and at various stages; and (iv) improved procurement
practices and legislation; and (b) Revenue Generation and cost control through
improvement of (i) tax administration and organization to implement various SAC measures
aimed at improving the tax base and tax laws; (ii) monitoring of public accounts; and
(iii) organizational structures, management systems and staffing pattern of both Budget
and Finance Ministries. Expected results would be :(i) better implementation of the
investment budget through improved estimation of budgetary resources and monitoring of
budget situation, (ii) increased tax collection through clearer definition of
responsibility, improved tax code, and better staff performance; and (iii) improved
capability to monitor public accounts and increased efficiency in budget execution.
III. Public Enterprise Management. The project would assist in improving
Government capacity to monitor the economic and financial performance of PE's by (a)
improving the performance in investment and expenditure programming and monitoring of the
Planning, Budget, Finance, and key sectoral ministries (sec. I and II above) and by
training national staff in methods to audit PE's; and (b) increasing the Portfolio
Ministry's capacity to (i) collect and process data necessary to oversee PE performance
and identify patterns of issues; (ii) develop a privatization strategy to implement the
PE reform measures agreed under SAC; and (iII) carry out additional analyses as needed to
implement reform measures.
IV. Other support would be provided to fund (a) SAC-related studies and policy
impact analyses, including statistical surveys to obtain up-to-date and reliable data on
economic conditions, (b) studies to set up a pilot program for improving civil service
conditions with emphasis on the economic management institutions within the agreed civil
service reform program under the Structural Adjustment Program; and (c) additional data-
processing equipment for the Debt agency and the Central Bank.
V. Training. The project would stress staff training under each component and
support: (a) in-country and overseas courses; (b) study tours to countries with relevant
experiences in specific methodologies or reforms; (c) recruitment of experts with
coaching ability and responsability for on-the-job training; (d) seminars and workshops
to discuss and disseminate proposed reform measures or methodologies; and (e) contractual
arrangements with local training institutions.
5.       The total project cost is estimated at US$14.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$10.0 million (72Z). The break-down of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Details on procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key process$ng events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map of Zaire is attached. Since there is no Staff Appraisal Report, the
detailed project description, and the project administration and implementation
arrangements are given in the Technical Annex.
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's involvement stems primarily from our
involvement In structural adjustment lending and is intended to ensure consistency of



- 3 -
project actions w.Lth SAC objectives. Also, since IDA has been heavily involved in
defining a broad policy reform strategy, it is uniquely positioned to help design and
support an overall institutional development program to implement SAC measures with a
longer term perspective within which Government can coordinate technical assistance from
other donors.
7.       ALreed Actions.  During negotiations, Government confirmed (a) the designation
of the Planning Minister as the Chairman of the Project Coordination Committee; (b) the
appointment of the Project Administrator; and (c) the creation of the Progranding
Directorate in the Planning Ministry with a mandate acceptable to IDA. Agreement was
reached with IDA on (a) the TORs of long-term TA and major studies; (b) a training master
plan, and (c) the first-year work programs for the Planning, Budget and Finance
Ministries. Conditions of effectiveness: (a) creation in the Planning Ministry of a
Prugrauming and Budgeting Directorate with mandate, organization, and staffing
satisfactory to IDA; (b) adoption of acceptable operating procedures for project
coordination; and (c) establishment of a counterpart fund with initial deposit of at
least US$ 10,000. Condition of disbursement for computer equipment: receipt of an
acceptable master plan. Dated covenants: (a) by February 29, 1988: submission of a staff
incentive proposal for review by IDA consistent with the civil service reforms supported
by the SAL credits; (b) by October 30. 1988: adoption of satisfactory organizational
improvements and preparation of manpower development and staff rationalization programs
by the three core economic Ministries, and establishement of a 3-year PIP mechanism with
acceptable procedures and implementation plan; and (c) by March 1989: implementation of
manpower development and staff rationalization programs. Assurances were obtained from
Government to (a) coordinate project execution with the Technical Secretariat of the
Interministerial Committee responsible for implementation of the Structural Adjustment
Progr,Am and SAL Credits; (b) set up appropriate coordination arrangements between the
Budget and Finance Ministries; and (c) conduct reviews of core ministries' work programs
with IDA and other donors at least once every year.
B.       Justification. Unless Governement re-assesses and re-defines the mandate,
organization, and staffing patterns of central ministries, especially core economic
ministries, and builds up its own capability to design and implement economic reforms, it
will not be able to play its role as principal agent of development and provider of basic
public services and to utilize resources made available by external donors. This project
is a first step towards achieving these long-term institutional development objectives,
while supporting at the same time immediate assistance needs related to the SAC.
9.       Risk.  A major risk is the difficulty to ensure project implementation and
sustained project actions because of poor civil service conditions. This should be
minimized by project support to the civil service reforms under the SAL Credits through
the development of improved civil service compensation and employment polilies for
critical skills and activities, and their pilot application in the Planning, Budget, and
Finance Ministries consistent with the revisions in civil service salary structure and
incentives to be introduced under the Structural Adjustment Program. Measures have also
been taken to avoid the pitfalls encountered by a previous UNDP-financed IDA-executed
planning project and other donor-supported TA projects, by (a) fitting the project design
into an overall reform strategy supported by SAC; (b) strengthening all the core
institutions involved in the planning function rather than assisting one or two in
isolation from the rest; and (c) covering organizational and procedural aspects as well
as technical aspects, and emphasizing staff training. Finally, project actions have been
designed with considerable participation of key officials at both political and
administrative levels from all ministries and agencies concerned.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Institutional Framework
1.       Zaire's economic difficulties, beginning in the mid-70s, st,=.
largely from ill-conceived policies and poor investment decisions. Since
1983, Government has made considerable efforts to implement a
stabilization-cum-liberalization program, and to improve the technical
content of its investment programs. The resumption of growth has been
slow, due in part to the continued rapid deterioration in the terms of
trade and the increasing burden of external debt service. Mhile resource
constraints were a major cause, public management deficiencies,
particularly weaknesses in the area of economic planning and financial
management, were another, leading to uneven application of policy reforms
and under-implementation of investment programs. To overcome these
weaknesses, several institutional measures have been taken, including the
reorganization of the Planning Ministry, (and upgrading of its status), the
establishment of planting units in sectoral ministries and regional
administrations, and the creation of national and regional planning
councils, as well as of a joint Plan-Finance Committee to monitor
implementation of the investment budget. These measures have brought some
positive results: a five-year development strategy was completed in 1986, a
newsletter on economic indicators has been periodically published, and for
the past four years, annual preparations for the Consultative Group
meetings have increasingly involved active participation of concerned
ministries.
2.       Despite the fact that relevant planning and financial structures
generally exist, the lack of well-defined procedures and methods, the
absence of effective control, and the conditions of employment of civil
servants are major constraints to the improvement of public sector
performance and to the formulation and pursuit of basic development
policies.
Rationale and Issues Addressed
3.       Under the SAC, Government is committed to a program of economic
policy changes and institutional reforms which include measures to improve
(i) the economic impact of tax measures and tax administration, by reducing
distortions and improving the distribution of fiscal and parafiscal
charges; (ii) public investment programming, budgeting and financial
management; (iii) the management of the public enterprise sectorg and (iv)
civil service compensation and employment conditions. The proposed Project
aims at supporting the implementation of these measures and initiating a
long-term program of institutional development, focusing on core ministries
(Plan, Finance, Budget, Portfolio).
Details of Project Components
4.       Financing would be provided under the Project for the services of
international and national consultants (long and short term), staff



- II -
training, equipment, studies and impact analyses, and incremental operating
costs to strengthen the capacity of the Planning, Budget, Finance, and
Portfolio ministries in the areas of : (a) investment programming; (b)
budgeting and financial management including the implementation of new
fiscal measures adopted under the SAC; (c) public enterprise sector
management; and (d) civil service reform, SAC-related studies ad surveys,
and monitoring of SAC implementation.
S.       Investment Proarammng anad Budgeting. Constraints to
implementation of past PIPs include (besides lack of funds): (a) the lack
of a permanent structure within the Planning Ministry responsible for
conceptualizing and coordinating the implemention of the program; and (b)
the lack of proper methodologies for developing an annual three-year
rolling PIP, including mechanisms to monitor the implementation of on-going
projects and criteria for selecting new investments. The project would
support: (a) creation of a Directorate of Programming and Budgeting in the
Planning Ministry responsible for coordinating the preparation of the
investment budget; (b) development of appropriate methodologies, training
of central, regional and sectoral staff, and setting up a three-year
rolling mechanism for PIP with procedures and time-tables; and (c)
application of these methodologies, by the Planning Ministry and key
sectoral ministries (agriculture, education, health). The proposed project
would also assist the Planning Ministry in improving: (a) macro-economic
projections and capacity to monitor economic indicators, to provide a
systematic framework for investment evaluation and selection; and (b)
internal procedures, management systems, staffing pattern, and its
coordination with other ministries and regional administration. About 36
month, of a macro-economist, 30 months of an economist with experience in
sectoral policy analysis, 16 months of a financial analyst with long
experience in investment programming, 18 months of an organization
specialist, and about 12 months of short term consultant services would be
provided. The strengthening of the Planning Ministry in data processing,
project evaluation, aid coordination and regional planning would be mainly
supported by UNDP. Efforts to improve the monitoring capacity of the
Planning and sectoral ministries would be assisted by ADB. During appraisal
of SAC, Government agreed to create the Directorate of Programuing and
Budgeting. At negotiations for this project, Government confirmed its
agreement to create the Directorate of Pro¢ramming and Budgeting with
mandate, oratnization and staffing acceptable to IDA, which would be a
condition of credit effectiveness. Since Government already provided IDA
with a satisfactory Arrete creating and organizing the Directorate,
appointment of its Director and Division Chiefs with TOR's satisfactory to
IDA is the only action remaining to meet that condition. A three-year
public investment programming mechanism together with procedures and an
implementation plan, would be agreed with IDA and adopted by October 30,
1988. Organizational improvements, (e.g. clear definitions of
responsibilities, existence of working procedures) would also be adopted by
the same date.
6.       Budaeting and Financial Management.  Besides the intrinsic
difficulty caused by the high uncertainty of Governement revenues,
underfunding of investment projects is due to, inter alia: (a) the lack of
a budget classification framework which (i) clearly distinguishes between
investment, recurrent, and operating expenditures; (ii) allow proper
monitoring and accounting of all resources and expenditures of the
Government; (iii) provides information on investment projects and their
funding from internal and external sources; (b) poor estimation of revenues
and expenditures, (c) inadequate knowledge of the status of budget



- 12 -
exe'mstion, of public accounts and liquidity situation, (d) shortfall in
buabetary resources due to poor tax collection, and (e) cumbersome and
lengthy procurement and disbursement procedures and inefficient utilization
of public funds. The project would support the Budget Ministry's efforts to
(a) develop an improved budget classification framework for both investment
and recurrent expenditures, and initiate its implementation in key sectoral
ministries; (b) apply improved methods of revenue and expenditure
estimation; (c) rationalize spending and procurement procedures; (d) refine
the organization establish administrative procedures and develop staff
capabilities and appropriate staffing plan; and (e) formulate a manpower
development and incentive program for Ministry staff within the framework
of civil service reform measures defined under SAC. About 30 months of a
budget specialist, 30 months of an organization specialist, 30 months of a
computer information specialist and 12 months of short-term consultants
would be provided.
7.       The project would also help the Finance Ministry to (a)
rationalize the internal organization of the Accounting Directorate through
merging two sections to ensure faster information on budget execution and
liquidity situation , (b) establish an information system for monitoring
public accounts, (c) reorganize regional tax units, review tax regulations
and procedures, and improve the indexing and presentation of tax law; (d)
strengthen the analytical capacity of the Tax Department; (e) apply other
measures provided under SAC to improve the tax base; and (f) refine the
organization, establish administrative procedures (including coordination
with the Budget Ministry in the area of budget preparation and execution),
develop staff capabilities and appropriate staffing plans and incentives.
About 32 months of short-term consultants in the areas of government
accounting, fiscal policy, tax administration, and information system would
be financed by the project. Long-term specialists in these areas would be
provided by the French Technical Cooperation. Assurances were obtained and
during negotiations that Governement would set up satisfactory arrangements
for (a) coordination between the Ministries of Finance and Budget; and (b)
coordination of assistance of all donors to the Budget and Finance
Ministries, and to the other core economic Ministries (see also paras. 5
and 8 and Appendix 2).
8.       Public Enterprise (PE) Sector Manaaement. Part of the poor
performance of public enterprises lies in the overall policy framework
governing PEs and in the consequent poor quality of entreprise
management.The current policy and institutional framework is deficient in
many respects; with the exception of several of the larger enterprises,
internal accounts either do not exist or fail to accurately reflect the
enterprises' true financial position. As part of SAC preparation,
Government has undertaken a study, carried out by consultants (financed by
UNDP and executed by the Bank) which would recommend inter alia, a
classification of enterprises and an action plan. These actions would
include a fundamental reform of the policy environment, the liquidation and
privatization of certain enterprises, and the reorganization of oversight
and control systems, in particular the relationships between the central
government and the enterprises, to ensure effective autonomy and
accountability.



- 13-
9.       The project would assist the Government to (a) improve its
capacity to monitor PE performance through the provision of data processing
equipment to the Portfolio Ministry, training of national staff in
enterprise auditing, and strengthening the investment evaluation and
monitoring of the Planning, Budget, and Finance Ministries (paras.5-7).
About 20 months of short-term consultant services would be funded to help
the Portfolio Ministry develop a PE information monitoring system and a
privatisation strategy. An additional US$200,000 would also be provided to
finance the development of follow-up programs on the basis of
recommendations from the UNDP-financed study (para. 8). Review of policy
constraints to PE performance would be financed under SAC-related studies
(para. 12).
10.      Civil Service Reform and Other SAC-related Activities.  Under the
structural adjustment program, the Government agreed to adopt a number of
short-term and medium term actions to streamline the civil service and
improve the compensation system without significantly adding to the burden
of the real public wage bill. These actions include : voluntary retirement,
resignation or separation, adoption of salary differentials within levels
and pay steps within salary levels; review of the structure and
distribution of fringe benefits, introduction of a system for setting
priority objectivesitasks in each ministry, review of the manpower
allocation system and design of a training program to meet identified
manpower needs.
11.      The project would support the development of a pilot effort within
the core ministries (Plan, Budget, Finance) to implement the above short
and medium term actions. About 12 months of short-term consultants would be
provided to study and set up the staff incentive systems, and Government
would finance the salary supplements and performance bonuses as needed.
Durins negotiations, Government agreed to (a)  prevare a staff incentive
Prosram for review with IDA by February 29, 1988; (b) adopt ortanizational
improvements and complete preparation of a manpower development and staff
rationalization program for the core Ministries by October 30. 1988 ; and
(c) adopt such programs by March 1989.
12.      Other Activities.  The project would also include (a) SAC-related
studies and three statistical surveys, of household budget, enterprises in
the modern sector, and enterprises in the traditional sector, to develop
SAC-follow-up action programs and obtain basic economic data; (b) some data
processing equipment for the Debt agency and the Central Bank; (c) selected
sectorLl and regional studies, and analyses of policy impacts. Assistance
to Cour des Comptes to carry out an organlzational study and for staff
training would be provided. Terms of reference for maior studies were
agreed at negotiations.
13.      Prolect Costs.  The total project cost is estimated at US$14.0
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.0 million
(722). The break-down of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. About 180 months of long-term specialists and 220 months of short-term
consultants would be provided. About 50 months of overseas fellowships
would also be provided. Equipment would consist of micro-computers
(including peripherals and appropriate software), vehicles and office
machines. Price contingencies assume increases in foreign currency costs
of 3 percent for 1987, 1 percent per annum for 1988-90, and 3.5 percent
thereafter. No local price contingency or physical contingencies have been
provided.

SECTION B. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
14.      Project Implementation.   Responsibility for implementing project
actions would rest with the ministry under which they fall : the Planning
Ministry for the investment programming component, the Budget Ministry for
the budgeting component, the Finance Ministry for the financial management
component, and the Portfolio Ministry for the public enterprise management
component. Within each ministry, supervision of project implementation
would be the responsibility of the Secretary-General, who would report
periodically, and whenever necessary, to the Minister on implementation
progress. To facilitate project implementation and monitoring and create
good permanent administration practices, annual work programs would be
established by each ministry concerned for the project actions under its
responsibility and would be reviewed with IDA before the end of the
preceding year. Agreement was reached at negotiations (a) on the first-
year work program of each ministry, which includes plans for TA
recruitment, staff training, and major studies, and (b) on annual review of
kroposed work programs by IDA during project implementation.  A timetable
oF key activities is provided in Attachment 1 and a training plan in
Attachment 2.
15.      Proiect Coordination. The Project Coordination Committee
essentially consists of the same agencies as the SAC Coordination
Committee. It is chaired by the Planning Minister and consists of
representatives from the ministries and agencies responsible for
implementing the Project. The Committee would meet once a year to approve
individual agencies' annual work programs and at least once every three
months to review their implementation, coordinate project actions and take
appropriate corrective measures; all this in accordance with operating
procedures acceptable to IDA. The Planning Ministry would provide
technical support to the committee through the Technical Secretariat of the
SAC and assure close coordination between this Secretariat and the
Committee. Appointment of the Committee Chairman was confirmed at
negotiations. Adoption of the Committee Operating Procedures would be a
condition of credit effectiveness.
16.      Project Administration. A small project unit, headed by a Project
Administrator, would be established to provide overall administrative
support for Project activities. The Project Administrator would be
assisted by an administrative assistant, an accountant, a secretary/typist,
a driver and a messenger. The Unit's main responsibilities would be to
handle the administrative aspects of (i) recruitment and employment of
resident experts and short-term consultants; (ii) procurement of goods and
services above US$30,000 (procurement up to this amount would be handled by
the ministry concerned); and (iii) preparation and presentation of
withdrawal applications from the credit proceeds. The Project
Administrator would be the Administrative Secretary of the Project
Coordination Committee, and would liaise with IDA concerning project
administration. Appointment of the Proiect Administrator was confirmed at
negotiations.



- 15 _
17.      Special Account and Project Fund.   Government would establish a
Special Account in a commercial bank to expedite disbursements with terms
and conditions of operations acceptable to IDA. Upon credit effectiveness
and receipt of withdrawal application the Association would make an advance
deposit of US$ 500,000 corresponding to six-months' expenditures. The
special account would be replenished upon receipt and approval of
satisfactory documented evidence of expenditures to be provided by the
Project Administrator. Should any disbursements be made from the special
account which are not acceptable to IDA, the Government would deposit the
corresponding amount in the special account. Such a system has been used
satisfactorily to finance project preparatory activities under PPF.
18.      Government Counterpart Funds.  To ensure that Government budgetary
contributions to the project would be made available when needed, the
Government would establish a Counterpart Fund Account within the Bank of
Zaire to finance expenditures incurred by the project. Government would
deposit at the beginning of each quarter the amount necessary to finance
GOZ1s share of local expenditures incurred under the Project. The
establishment of such account and the first Government deposit of at least
US$10,000 equivalent would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
19.      Procurement.   Services - Government would recruit directly under
individual contracts or through consulting firms the specialists to be
funded under the project for technical assistance and for studies. The
qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment of all
specialists and consultants would be satisfactory to the Association and in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines for use of consultants. The short
list of firms and the letter of invitation would be cleared with IDA before
inviting proposals. Goods - Vehicles and equipment grouped in lots for
US$100,000 equivalent would be procured through international competitive
bidding. Vehicles and equipment grouped in lots equal or over US$30,000 but
under US$100,000 would be procured through local competitive bidding as
provided in paragraph 3.3 of the Procurement guidelines and in accordance
with the principles applied to ICB as described in Section II of the
guidelines. Vehicles, equipment and furniture in lots costing less than
US$30,000 would be acquired through local shopping. In the case of computer
equipment for the Budget and Finance Ministries, procurement would be by
ICB except if recommended otherwise under the computer master plan--the
preparation of which would be a condition of disbursement for such
equipment. However,computer equipment and materials which would be needed
for staff training or personal use by resident experts, including those of
the Debt agency and the Central Bank, would be acquired through local
shopping. Items would be grouped to the extent possible to encourage
competitive bidding (Schedule B).



- 16 -
20.      Disbursement.  Disbursements from the credit (Schedule B) would be
made on the following basis : (a) 100 percent of total expenditures for
services of consultants;and (b) 1002 of foreign and 60% of local
expenditures for training, vehicles, equipment and furniture, studies and
incremental operating costs. All disbursements would be fully documented
except those for local training and payments against contracts of less than
US$30,000 equivalent, which would be made against statements of
expenditure, and for which documentation would not be submitted for review.
However, Government would make this documentation available for review by
IDA project supervision missions and independent auditors. While project
implementation is scheduled for three years, an eight-year disbursement
period is retained in accordance with the regional disbursement profile for
similar projects.
21.      Accounts and Audits.  Separate accounts would be kept for all
expenditures made under the Project. The Project Administrator would
maintain records and accounts for all project activities. The accounts and
statements of expenditures would be audited each year by external auditors
acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA no later than six months after the
close of the financial year. Agreement to this effect was obtained at
negotiations.
22.      Project Lnglementation Schedule and Project Readiness.  The
proposed credit is expected to become effective by mid September, 1987 at
the same time as the SAC. A candidate for one of the four long-term TA
positions for the Planning Ministry has been identified. Others would be
identified prior to credit effectiveness with the intention of posting them
within the following six months. The training program would start in
September 1987. Project completion is scheduled for June 30, 1995. The
closing date is December 31, 1995.
23.      Reporting, Monitoring and Accountabilitv. Reports on project
implementation, summarizing progress achieved, difficulties encountered,
and changes or adjustments to be made, would be submitted quarterly by each
Ministry concerned to the Chairman of Project Coordination Comeittee. The
Committee would meet at least every three months to review progress, take
appropriate actions, and assign responsibility for follow-up. The agenda
and minutes of Commlttee meetings would be prepared by the Project
Administrator, and transmitted to IDA to facilitate project supervision.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that draft procedures concerning
these aspects would be included in the operating procedures of the Prolect
Coordinating Committee.
