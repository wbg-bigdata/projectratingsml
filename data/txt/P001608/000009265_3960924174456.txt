PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MAIAWI
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 910-MAI)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Malawi Third
Education Project, whose estimated cost of US$26.62 million equivalent was
financed in part by the International Development Association (IDA) Credit
910-MAI of US$14.5 million equivalent (approved o-n May 17, 1979), and co-
financed by the European Economic Community (EEC) Special Action Account,
Credit 12-MAI (signed on June 19, 1979), of US$7.5 million equivalent. The
balance of US$4.62 million equivalent was financed by the Government of
Malawi.  The actual cost was US$25.85 million equivalent, about 3% below
the appraisal estimate.    The total amount disbursed from the IDA Credit
was US$13.98 million equivalent, and an undisbursed balance of about
US$524,000 was cancelled on February 12, 1988 when the credit account was
wound up, although the Closing Date was December 1985.  The EEC Credit was
closed in August 1982, four months ahead of the scheduled Closing Date of
December 31, 1982.   The total EEC Credit disbursed was US$6.78 million
equivalent, leaving an undisbursed sum of about US$716,000.
The PCR was prepared, with the agreement of the Government of
Malawi, by UNESCO under the Bank-UNESCO Cooperative Program. It is based
on (i) a draft PCR prepared by IDA staff; (ii) evaluation and completion
reports prepared by the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Project
Implementation Unit; (iii) a UNESCO field mission in February-March 1988;
and (iv) information from IDA files and interviews with Government
officials involved in the project.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department.   The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment on
August 14, 1989. Comments received are reproduced as Attachment I.

-THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 910-MAI)
EVALUATI.J SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Third Education Project in Mala-4 was first discussed with the
Government du_.ng an IDA Education Sector Rex ew mission in November 1977.
In April 1978 the Government requestti projec financing from IDA. An IDA
appraisal mission in July 1978 was followed by a post-appraisal mission in
December 1978. The Government also requested financial assistance from the
EEC. The IDA Credit Agreement and the EEC Special Action Credit Agreement,
both signed on June 19, 1979, provided the equivalent of US$14.5 million
and US$7.5 million respectively to help finance the total estimated project
cost of US$26.62 million.   The Credit Agreements became effective on
September 19, 1979.   The Closing Date was postponed from Jure 1984 to
December 1985, but the project was completed only at the end of 1986 and
disbursements continued through February 1988 when an undisbursed balance
of about US$524,000 was cancelled and the credit account closed.   The
actual project cost was US$25.85 million equivalent, about 3% below
appraisal estimate.
Obiectives and Proiect Content
2.       The major objectives were to improve efficiency and access to
primary and secondary education, to assist in the provision of key manpower
needed for development, and to improve curriculum development, in-service
training and educational management.   The major components included the
following:
(a) For Primary Education: (i) construction of about 1,000 classrooms
for 50,000 student places and 500 teachers' houses; (ii) purchas-
ing and distributing about 2.2 million textbooks; and (iii) expan-
sion of the Mzuzu Primary Teacher Training College by 120 places.
(b) For Secondary Education: (i) constructing, furnishing and equip-
ping 30 centers for the Malawi College of Distance Education
(MCDE, previously known as the Malawi Correspondence College) to
enroll about 2,700 students, and providing new equipment for the
MCDE headquarters at Blantyre; (ii) constructing boarding facili-
ties for about 280 students at five day schools; (iii) construct-
ing, furnishing and equipping facilities to enroll 120 full-time



- vii -
and 240 part-time students in commercial education in three tech-
nical schools; (iv) construction of staff houses and provision of
furniture and equipment to Colby Collego of Agriculture which
enrolled 60 students; and (v) expansion of Chancellor College to
increase the enrollment from 105 to 330 for training secondary
teachers.
(c)  For Education Services:  establishment of the Institute of
Education through the expansion and improvement of facilities at
the Domasi teacher in-service center to accommodate 150 students
and 30 staff and the provision of 50 vehicles for school
inspection.
(d) For Educational Management: carrying out a number of studies on
teacher training, school mapping, costs and financing of text-
books, and future educational development.
lmplementation Experience
3.       The project was executed under the direction of the PIU staffed by
a manager, a senior procurement officer, an accountant, a quantity sur-
veyor, three architects and three architectural assistants, two supervising
engineers and several support staff.   The project relied heavily on the
expatriate architects and engineers, with the result that there has been
very little accumulation of technical experience in the PIU.   The PIU
carried out all procurement of furniture and equipment: 57% through ICB,
40% direct contracting and 3% through local tender. Overall, about 20% of
furniture and equipment was supplied by foreign firms and 80% by local or
locally registered firms. The project was adversely affected by transport
problems from 1982 when the Mozambique ports of Nacala and Beira, through
which imports to Malawi were shipped, became inoperative because of the
ongoing civil strife in Mozambique.   Imported equipment and materials had
to be transported through Dar-es-Salaam or Durban which were longer, more
time-consuming and expensive routes.   It was unclear, however,  to what
extent this transport problem increased the cost of the project. Technical
assistance comprised 38.5 man-years of specialist services financed by
UNDP, DANIDA, ODA and Japanese Aid, and a fellowship program which provided
12 persons with a total of 10.5 years of training as instructors for secre-
tarial and commercial courses.  Overall project implementation was satis-
factory and all project items were implemented, except the construction of
boarding facilities in the five secondary schools and some studies, which
were transferred to the Fourth Education Project.   Both the Bank and the
Government underestimated the complexity of organizing and coordinating the
self-help primary school construction program which extended project imple-
mentation by 18 months.



- viii -
Results
4.       Although the project's physical objectives were achieved, there
were significant qualitative shortfalls.   First, the project was unsuc-
cessful in its efforts to provide more equitable access to primary educa-
tion.   Inter- and intra-regional disparities with respect to access to
primary schooling have persisted.  The Northern region, already with high
enrollment rates, received a higher proportion of classrooms than the
Central and Southern regions which have much lower enrollment rates. The
experience demonstrated that under the self-help system the better endowed
communities are better able to take advantage of the opportunities offered.
Another aspect of disparity affecting the whole system was the unbalanced
distribution of textbooks. Apparently Grades 1 and 2 were better provided
with books than the higher grades.  Secondly, measures to ensure that the
books to be purchased and distributed were up-to-date and in accord with
the curriculum were not taken during preparation, inidicating that this
matter was overlooked at appraisal. Thirdly, the complexity of implement-
ing the primary self-help school construction program was under-estimated
at appraisal, so that the resultant organizational and logistical problems
caused a delay of 18 months.
5.       The commercial courses in the technical schools started in 1986
were fully enrolled for the evening clesses but under-enrolled in the
regular day classes.  The Colby Agricultural College, however, was closed
in 1983, only four years after Credit signing, and the students were trans-
ferred to the National Resources College as part of a Government effort to
centralize the training of technical assistants.  The classroom furniture
provided by the project was loaned to a nearby primary school and the
minibus, also provided by the project, was taken over by the Ministry of
Agriculture.   The Malawi Institute of Education (MIE) was duly established
in 1979, and generally good work has been done in producing educational
materials.   However,  given the limited staff, physical facilities and
recurrent budget, the MIE clearly could not meet the objective of providing
annually six-week in-service training courses to 600 primary teachers and
shorter courses to another 200 inspectors, district education officers,
secondary teachers, and others. Instead, it has modified the objective to
training the trainers who would carry out the training of primary teachers
at the local and district level.
Sustainabilitv
6.       The main primary and secondary school components, as integral
parts of the general educational system, are likely to be sustained. The
level of sustainability, however, will depend on the proportion of recur-
rent funding allocated to qualitative aspects of the schooling process,
specifically textbooks and teaching materials.   As there have been early
signs of a serious shortage of these essential educational inputs, it is
therefore unlikely that sustainability will be at a high level while
Government recurrent expenditures are inadequate to cover essential
supplies and replacement of books and materials.

Findings and Lessons
7.       Despite some of the design and implementation problems noted
above, overall IDA performance was satisfactory, taking into account the
composition of the 14 supervision missions during the project implementa-
tion period. However, IDA performance could have been better. Evidently
the quantitative aspects of the project absorbed a disproportionate amount
of tha Bank Group's attention, and insufficient concern was show-,. for the
location of primary schools and building up the Borrower's project planning
and management capability. Thus, the experience with this project suggests
the need for designing and undertaking special measures directed towards
institution building, specifically by providing the PIU with local
architects and engineers, and for indepth sector knowledge before embarking
on any investment in agricultural education and training.   Other lessons
include the following:
(a) During project generation, more care should be given to the
project's recurrent costs and the Government's ability to meet
them, to ensure that the investments made can be sustained;
(b) A school textbook program should be based on a careful review of
existing materials to ensure they are suitable to the curriculum;
and
(c) Nonformal secondary education programs, such as those offered
through the MCDE, require systematic development that includes
physical facilities, equipment, learning materials, and trained
personnel to manage them, if they are to be effective.



PROJE-'T COMPLE,TION REPORT
MA&LAWI THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 910-MAl)
I. PROJECT BACRGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01  Malawi, a land-locked country in South Eastern Africa, has an area of about
118,500 square kilometers - 94,300 square kilometers of land area and 24,200
square kilometers of lake surface. The 1977 population was about 5.6 million,
with an annual growth rate of 2.9 per cent. The average annual growth rate of
the GDP, in real terms, had been about 6.5 per cent between 1964 and 1973, partly
as a result of the Government's careful economic management. The agricultural
sector accounted for about 60 per cent of the GDP. In 1977 GNP per capita was
US$140 equivalent. Unlike many other developing countries, the revenue account
in Malawi had surpluses between 1972 and 1974. This fiscal position changed during
the period 1975 to 1977 when recurrent expenditures increased because (a) new
development projects had come into operation and (b) the rate of growth of tax
revenues had decreased. In order to increase economic growth the Government
pursued a policy of investing ; rincipally in what were considered directly productive
sectors, such as smallholder agriculture, infrastructure and public utilities - leading
to the emergence of labour intensive import substitution industries - rather than
in the social sectors.
1.02 The shortage of suitably trained Melawians was a serious constraint to
development. Employers relied heavily on expatriates to fill managerial and some
professional and technical posts. The supply of agricultural workers, in particular,
was inadequate to m.t the demands of the private estates and rural development
projects. It was e:ident that high priority had to be given to the education and
training of Malawians in order to reduce the dependency on expatriate skills.
Education and Training Sector
1.03  In Malawi, education lagged behind that of other countries of comparable
income level in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1978, only 25 per cent of the adult population
were estimated to be literate. Enrolment in Standards I-V (Grades 1-5) was only
68 per cent of the age group 6-10 years and in Standards I-VIII (Grades 1-8) 56
per cent of the age group 6-13 years. Less than five per cent of the school age
population was in full-time secondary education (including general secondary,
technical, vocational, teacher training and correspondence courses) - a figure
which was the lowest in Africa. The output of agricultural, industrial and
commercial technicians from specialized secondary and higher institutions fell
short of manpower demand.
1.04 The main issues in the education and training sector in the late 1970s were
those related to the (i) low quality of primary education, (ii) limited access to
primary schools, (iii) small size of the secondary school system and (iv) the
insufficient number of trained secondary teachers.
1.05 Primary Education. Primary school construction, furnishing and equipping
had traditionally been the responsibility of local communities. This policy had
undergone a significant change and under the Second Education Project (Credit
590-MAI), the Government constructed 23 prototype primary schools. Subsequently,
with bilateral assistance and internal resources, the Government began providing
about MK3,000 per classroom and technical assistance to assist communities with
construction. The quality of school construction undertaken on this basis was
generally higher and more durable, but more costly, than schools constructed



-2-
by communities without such assistance; nevertheless, it was of an adequate
standard to provide a satisfactory classroom for between 50 and 60 pupils.
Consequently, the Government decided to increase the expenditure per classroom
even further.
1.06 Although school location was normally approved by. MOEC, such approval
had been on a pro forma basis, following community initiatives. As a result, in
many instances, classroom construction was not undertaken in the areas of greatest
need. In view of this problem, MOEC, with IDA assistance, initiated a school
mapping survey to help determine school construction needs and rationalize school
location to accord with population distribution, geographic features and equity
considerations.
1.07  Provision of educational materials and equipment was the responsibility
of local authoriti;?s. These authorities annually utilized the school fees for this
purpose. In 1979 the fees were MK2.00 per student in rural areas, and MK3.50
in urban areas for Standards I to V (Grades 1 to 5), MK4.00 for pupils in Standard
VI (Grade 6), and MK6.5 for pupils in Standards VII and VIII (Grades 7-8). These
fees, however, covered only one-third to one-half of overall textbook requirements,
depending on the durability of the books. Because of financial constraints, local
authorities were able to provide only some basic instructional materials and
textbooks to pupils in Standard VIII (Grade 8); for the other classes, there were
sometimes one book for every seven pupils. Most books were published and printed
privately in Malawi, and the Malawi Book Service (MBS) purchased, distributed
and sold the school books at reasonable prices to local authorities. When the Project
was being appraised, a major policy decision was taken - the Central Government
took over the responsibility for financing a large portion of the costs of textbooks,
beginning with the basic English, Chichewa and arithmetic textbooks.
1.08 Secondary Education. Government policy at the secondary level was to
restrain annual enrolment increase to three per cent. However, at appraisal ,t
had become clear that the output from secondary schools was far below the level
required to supply the needs of the labour market. Low enrolment at secondary
schools was also adversely affecting the entire school system. Secondary school
places were available for only nine per cent of the students who passed the PSLC.
In an effort to obtain secondary school places, many students were repeating
Standard VIII, with the result that about 50 per cent of the pupils at this level
were repeaters. Secondary schools were boarding institutions and the availability
of boarding places ensured that at least some rural boys and girls who were
successful in the PSLC were able to attend secondary school.
1.09 Internal efficiency of secondary schools was relatively high but there was
r       scope for improvement. Examination pass rates were 69 per cent for students
who sat the Junior Certificate (JC) examination and about 62 per cent in the case
of the Malawi Certificate of Education Examination. The student:teacher ratio
averaged 21:1 and 87 per cent of the secondary school teachers were qualified
at the degree or diploma level. However, 32 per cent of all secondary school
teachers were expatriates, and 100 teaching positions (about 10 per cent) in
secondary schools were unfilled. Enrolment growth was estimated to require
an average of 90 new teachers per year from 1977 to 1990.
1.10 The output of secondary school teachers from Chancellor College, was
only about 30 per year. The Government proposed to increase this output to 90
per year, equally divided between the three-year diploma programme and the



-3 -
four-year degree programme. Boarding, academic and staff facilities were required
to increase the College enrolment from 600 to 825 students, but particularly in
the teacher education programme, from 105 to 330.
1.11  In response to social pressure to expand secondary education, the MOEC
developed an alternative junior secondary education system which offered education
through radio and correspondence courses under the control of the Malawi
Correspondence College (MCC). Originally, MCC junior secondary school
equivalency centres were intended for part-time students who were working during
the day. By 1977, these centres were charging a fee of MK22 per year and operating
as full-time schools, offering accommodation for students with the Primary School
Leaving Certificate up to six hours a day. MCC centers enrolled about 3,000
(compared to the regular junior secondary schools' enrolment of 9,000) while only
about 21 per cent of MCC candidates passed the JC Examination and these
comprised only 10 per cent of the total number of JC examination passes.
1.12 Commercial education. Courses were offered for typists, secretaries and
book-keepers in correspondence schools and in poorly equipped, expensive, private
schools. Some general secondary schools provided training in commercial skills,
but this was inadequate.
Project Generation
1.13 ihe idea of a Third Education Project was discussed initially with the
Malawian Government by IDA staff, during an IDA Education Sector Review Mission
in November 1977. In January 1978, the Bank Group confirmed that a project
was possible to: (a) rehabilitate five existing day secondary schools, (b) finance
facilities for commercial education in existing three technical schools, (c) expand
secondary teacher training at Chancellor College, (d) finance school mapping
activities (e) improve and expand Correspondence education, (f) establish the
Malawi Institute of Education and Curriculum Development Center at Domasi,
(g) supply primary school textbooks, (h) upgrade facilities at Malawi Central
Examination and Testing Board (MCETB), (i) supply basic primary school
construction materials for the self-help school construction programme, (j) provide
means of transport for 70 inspectors and (k) support management, training and
educational studies. In February 1978, a school mapping specialist went to Malawi
to conduct a workshop on school location planning techniques for MOEC staff
in preparation for the project and in April 1978, the Government formally requested
project financing from IDA.
1.14 During appraisal, the proposed project content was modified to add minor
improvements to existing facilities and increase staffing levels at the Colby College
of Agriculture. Assistance to the MCETB was added to the ongoing Second
Education Project instead and therefore deleted from the proposal for the Third
Education Project. Negotiations were held in April 1979 and Board approval was
given on 17 May 1979. The Development Credit Agreement and the Special Action
Credit Agreement Iigned 19 June 1979, provided for the sums of US$14.5 million
and US$7.5 million- respectively.

ProJect Objectives and Description
1.15 The Project was designed to assist the Government of Malawi improve
efficiency in and access to primary and secondary education, to assist in the
provision of key manpower needed for development, and to improve curriculum
development, in-service training and management of education. The Project content
is shown in Table 1.1.
1.16 The primary school construction programme in rural areas was expected
to be carried out on a self-help basis with the local communities providing fired
bricks, sand, stone and unskilled labour. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
in co-operation with the Development Division of the Office of the President
and Cabinet, was expected to procure and deliver other construction materials
to the sites and furniture and equipment to project schools. The primary school
construction programme in urban areas was to be fully Government financed,
with pupils in urban primary schools paying higher fees than those in rural primary
schools. Guidelines for the implementation of the primary school component,
including procedures and responsibilites of respective ministries, were to be
prepared by the Government. The Government was expected to prepare and send
to the Bank a plan for the provision of primary school textbooks beyond the period
of project implementation.
1.17  Benefits and Risks. The Project was expected to: (i) increase access to
primary education, particularly, in rural areas, (ii) improve equity by locating
primary schools in educationally disadvantaged areas, (iii) increase access to
secondary education by expanding the MCC (out-of-school) secondary education
programme, (iv) fill specific manpower needs by providing training opportunities
for primary and secondary school teachers, typists, secretaries, book-keepers
and agricultural technicians, (v) assist the education of women through its
commercial education component and the provision of dormitories at secondary
schools, and (vi) improve the management of the education system as a whole,
through its support for improved curriculum development, in-service training
and school supervision.
1.18 According to the Staff Appraisal Report, only the minimum risks and
uncertainties with respect to most of the project components were envisaged,
since the Government agencies involved were capable of implementing major
educational programmes. The following steps were taken to minimize the risks
associated with certain components: (a) for the self-help community construction
programme, which required co-ordination among several agencies, the Government
was requested to establish preliminary guidelines for the coordination of these
agencies; (b) as the establishment of Malawi Institute of Education (MIE) was
a major innovation, the Government gave its commitment to staff the Institute
adequately; and (c) the introduction of the commercial education programme
at the technical schools - also an innovation for Malawi - was supported by technical
assistance for staff training and curriculum development.

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENtATION
Overview
2.01 The Credit Agreement was declared effective on 19 September 1979 accordlng
to schedule.  The Project as a whole was satisfactorily implemented by December
1985 although the complexity of organizing and coordinating the primary school
self-help component, had not been fully appreciated at the outset. Logistic and
organizational problems which occurred during the implementation of the self-help
component led to the extension of the Closing Date by two years from the original
30 June 1984 to 23 June 1986 when final disbursement was made and the undisbursed
sum of US$524,000 (MK970,000) remaining in the Credit account was cancelled.
Although the civil works were delayed by 18 months, 1,008 primary school classrooms
were constructed - eight more than envisaged (Annex 1). The objectives of the
Project were achieved, except for deletion of five secondary schools and various
studies which were not done. The final cost of the Project was MK 26.5 million
(US$25.9 million) compared to MK 22.1 million (US$26.6 million) at appraisal.
Project Administration
2.02 The Project was executed under the direction of the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) established within MOEC. For most of the project implementation period,
the PIU staff comprised one manager, a senior architect, two architects and two
supervising engineers, a senior procurement officer, an accountant, a quantity surveyor
(for  --- years), three architectural assistants and a number of support staff. DANIDA
provided the architects and engineers. Two Japanese volunteer architects also worked
on the Project for a period of two years each. There was also an assistant project
manager during the last 1.5 years of project implementation. The overall performance
of the PIU has been good. The Unit implemented a complicated project with effective
control of time, quality and cost (paragraphs 2.07 and 3.02). Its semi-annual progress
reports were sent to IDA according to the schedule.
2.03 Although the PIU has implemented three education projects between 1967
and 1985, it has not employed the services of Malawian architects. Because of the
dependency on foreign consultants who leave at the end of their contract, the
experience gained through project implementation has not been accumulated in
Malawi. Neither the PIU nor Malawi can afford the heavy loss incurred by the
continued dependence on foreign staff. As a matter of priority, the Government
needs to sponsor the training of project management specialists and employ them
under conditions that would retain them.
Civil Works
(a) Post-Primary Institutions
2.04 Almost all the construction work involved the extension and/or upgrading
of existing institutions, consequently, selection of sites was not a problem. At most
of the sites, adequate land was already available for the proposed developments.
It was necessary to acquire land only at Chancellor College in Zomba and at the
urban MCC Centres of Mzuzu, Zomba and Blantyre.
(b) Primary School Classrooms and Teachers' Houses
2.05 The design for the classrooms is simple and the rooms are suitable for
accommodating 50 pupils. The design for the teachers' houses is spatially adequate



-7 -
but the siting of the open pit latrine adjacent to the kitchen is unsanitary. These
latrines need to be condemned immediately as a health hazard and be re-built further
away from the cooking area.
*            2.06  Primary school classrooms and teachers' houses were, in most cases, built
at existing schools where land was already available free of charge. The location
of about 40 per cent of the classrooms and teachers! houses was determined by District
Development Committees (DDCs), the main criterion for siting being that communities
were willing to fulfil their obligations. The remaining 60 per cent of the classrooms
were to be distribufqd on the basis of equity. A 1983 evaluation study of the self-help
project component- showed that this approach had its problems in that classrooms
were proposed for areas where:
(i)  there were other self-help projects (e.g. health) in close proximity,
and therefore the local community was unable to provide bricks and
labour on schedule;
(ii) local materials were available only at some considerable distance from
the site;
(iii) access to sites was poor or very difficult.
These, and such other problems as inadequate management, shortage of materials
and deficiencies in the distribution and transportation of materials, necessitated
the extension of the project implementation period from four to five and a half
years. The Evaluation Study conducted under the Project found that the Project
was delayed mainly because (i) it was over ambitious, with 490 sites scattered over
the country; (ii) conflicts existed between self-help and equity concepts (paragraph
4.05); and (iii) the number of agencies involved (PIU, MOEC, OPC, DDCs, REOs,
DEOs and local communities) was large and the respective responsibilities of these
agencies were not clear. After half the implementation period had elapsed, the
construction of classrooms accelereted. Some classrooms were shifted to communities
willing to participate in the self-help programme; transportation and distribution
of building materials were improved by providing Regional Educational Offices with
additional trucks and warehouses; and management arrangements were streamlined.
Clearly, therefore, the major problems with this component were not inherent in
the self-help concept, but stemmed from weaknesses in planning and implementation.
2.07 The design and supervision of the construction of primary schools and Malawi
Correspondence College (MCC) Centres were undertaken by the PIU, while a local
architectural firm, contracted by the PIU, carried out the design and supervision
of the construction of the Malawi Institute of Education (MIE) at Domasi. A UK
based firm, with a local office in Malawi, designed and supervised work at Chancellor
College under a contract with the College. The Ministry of Works and Supplies (MOW)
designed and supervised the construction of the commercial wings at Mzuzu, Lilongwe
and Soche Technical Colleges. All firms performed well. MOW needed more time
because their original plans did not follow the architectural working papers and
therefore had to be redone. Civil works contractors also performed well. Works
were executed on schedule (Annex 2). The physical components that were directly
or indirectly handled by the PIU were completed in 1982, before the scheduled
completion date of December 1983. The expansion at the Technical Colleges and
Chancellor College were completed one to two years later than scheduled. The
primary school classrooms handled by many Government agencies (paragraph 2.06)
were completed two to four years later.

2.08  The quality of the construction was fair to satisfactory, in the case of the
p imary classrooms, and satisfactory in the case of the other buildings.
Furniture, Materials and Equipment
2.09  AU procurement of furniture and equipment was done by the PIU. About 57
per cent of the procurement of furniture and equipment was done through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), 40 per cent through direct contracting and three per
cent through local tender. Overall, about 20 per cent of the furniture and equipment
was supplied by foreign firms and 80 per cent by local or locally registered firms,
although most of these firms imported raw materials for local manufacture or
assembly of the items or even imported finished items.
(a) Direct Contracting
2.10 Direct Contracting was used in the procurement of vehicles in order to ensure
compatibility with the existing fleet of Government vehicles. Some 30 per cent
of the door and window frames, required for the self-help primary school classrooms
construction component, were procured through a negotiated contract with a local
metal products company to enable the project to get off the ground quickly. Direct
contracting was also used in the procurement of primary school textbooks. The
contract for this procurement was negotiated with a local firm which held the
copyright.
(b) Transport Problems
2.11  In 1982, the traditional transport routes for Malawi through Mozambique
to the ports of Nacala and Beira became inoperative. Imported equipment and
materials were then transported through the longer more time consuming and
expensive routes, using the ports of Dar-es-Salaam or Durban. However, the
transportation problem was not a major hindrance to project implementation, since
the PIU imported equipment and material well ahead of the time when they would
be required.
(c) Furniture design
2.12 The PIU adopted a standard design for the primary school furniture, which
was later revised, to make it less complicated and expensive.
Area Allocations
2.13  There were differences between the actual areas constructed and the appraisa
estimates for Malawi Institute of Education, Mzuzu Teachers' College, Chancellor
College, MCC and the Technical Colleges (Annex 3). At the MCC Centres there
were substantial increases in the size of the administration and toilet blocks. The
building program ne of the Chancellor College was changed after the appraisal of
the Malawi Fourth Education Project - the construction and equipping of science
laboratories were transferred to the Fourth Project, while the area of the library
was enlarged from the originally planned 1,632 m2 to a total of about 2,700 m2 in
order to provide an adequate number of reader places (590) for the student body.
Project Modifications
2.14 During implementation, a secondary school (Salima) was deleted from the
Project because of site flooding problems. The rehabilitation of four secondary
schools was transferred to the Fourth Education Project (Credit 1123-MAI) because
the Third Education Project did not have sufficient funds. (paragraph 4.11)

Technloil Asistance
2.15 The Project was supported by 38.5 man-years of specialist services financed
by agencies other than IDA (Table 2.1). Although provision was made for acquiring
engineeering and architectural services,neither the Staff Appraisal Report nor the
Credit Agreement included an estimate of the number of years of technical assistance
which would be required.

The technical assistance programme has oeen successful in establishing commercial
streams at the technical colleges and in assisting the PIU to perform well in planning,
contracting and execution-of civil works. Overall, the consultants performed
satisfactorily.
2.16     Under the fellowship programme, 12 persons received training for a total
of 10.5 years as instructors for secretarial and commercial courses (Annex 4). Four
years of training were provided in Kenya and the remainder in the UK. Of the 12
persons who received fellowships, nine are working at the technical colleges and
principals have expressed satisfaction witli their performance so far.
Fulfilment of Covenants

11L PROJECT COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
Capita Costs and Finang
3.01 A comparison of appraisal estimates and actual project costs is shown in
Tables 3.1 and 3.2. Total estimated cost of the Project, including contingencies,
at appraisal was MK 22.1 million or US$26.6 million equivalent. The IDA financing
of US$14.5 million equivalent and an EEC Special Action Credit of US$7.5 million
equivalent, were intended to cover 86 per cent of the total Projeet cost net of taxes.
The actual cost of the Project was MK 26.5 million or US$25.9 million equivalent
in dollar terms, about three per cent lower than the appraisal estimate but about
20 per cent higher in MK terms. External financing covered about 83 per cent of
project cost including taxes, and about 86 per cent of project cost excluding taxes.
The US$1.6 million reduction in total cost was partly a result of the transfer of
components (studies and pre-investment and rehabilitation of four secondary schools)
(US$0.9 million) to the Fourth Project (paragraph 4.26) and partly the result of the
strengthening of the US dollar vis-a-vis the MK during project implementation.

,/ Actual costs in Kwacha in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 provided by PIU differ by MK 321,900.
PIU has been asked to check these figures.
3.02    Most project components had cost underruns in US dollars. The four per cent
cost overrun in US dollars or the Mzuzu Teachers' Training College is mainly because
of its early completion in November 1980, before the time of depreciation of the
Malawi Kwacha in relation to the US dollar. Increased costs for goods and services
during project implementation contributed to the cost overruns for civil works,
consultant services and project administration (Table 3.2).
Disbursements
3.03    As shown in disbursement schedules (Annex 6), the disbursement rate was
satisfactory, over most of the implementation period. It tapered off at the end of
the project period in part because of delays in the primary school programme and
partly because of the local currency devaluation. The EEC Credit was fully disbursed
by August 1982. Because of the strengthening of the US dollar during the early 1980s,
the EEC Credit, which was equivalent to US$7.5million at the time of appraisal,
decreased by about ten per cent to US$6.8 million equivalent at the closing of the
EEC Credit.

Reeurent Costs
3.04   At appraisal, it was estimated that recurrent cnosts generated by the Project
would amount to about US$1.6 million equivalent at 1979 prices, excluding the
annualized cost of the capital investment, or about one per cent of the total recurrent
budget of 1985/86, and that textbooks would account for 60 per cent of this figure.
3.05   Exact recurrent cost figures generated by the Project are not yet available,
because some major project institutions are not yet fully staffed. However, it is
estimated that when aWl institutions are in full operation, incremental recurrent costs
(excluding the annualized cost of the capital investment) would remain below the
sum of US$1.6 million estimated at appraisal, partly because of the devaluation of
Malawi Kwacha in terms of the US dollar and the freezing of teachers' salaries.

IV. PROJECT OPERATIONAL OUTCOMES
Overview
4.01  In general, the PRoject objectives were achieved and in some instances the
results were in excess of the staff Appraisal Report estimates. The Project provided
1,008 primary school classrooms, thus creating 50,400 new school places. However,
this number of places was well below the national growth in pupil enrolment of 162,863
between 1979/80 and 1985/86. Of the 500 staff houses included in the Project, 487
were provided. Improved equity in access to primary education was a major objective
of the Project, but achievement of these aims was compromised by the criterion
of self-help in constructing these classrooms (paragraph 2.06). The supply of learning
materials to primary schools was increased by the distribution of 2.7 million textbooks,
500,000 more than the originally agreed number. Through the expansion programme,
the Mzuzu teacher training college increased its trained teacher output from about
140 in 1979 to 240 in 1987.
4.02 In regard to secondary education, approximately 2,800 places were provided
through the construction of 30 MCC centres and it is expected that the quality of
professional support for these centres will improve as a result of the renovation
and upgrading of the MCC headquarters. Chancellor College is now better equipped
to train 168 more students in academic and technical fields through the expansion
of its facilities, including the library, classrooms and hostels. The MIE was established
in 1979 and has since prepared and made available 33 publications, including teachers'
guides, and textbooks for primary schools and primary teacher training, and has
held in-service training workshops annually for senior education personnel and for
the least qualified teachers.
4.03 As planned under the Project, 50 vehicles were provided, mainly to facilitate
increased supervision of schools. The School Mapping Study, intended to identify
the location of schools was completed, but in most cases the location of the primary
schools was determined by considerations.
Primary Education : hnptored Access and Efficiency
4.04 The 50,400 primary school places provided under the Project represented
about 31 per cent of the overall increase (162,863) in primary enrolment which grew
from 779,676 in 1979/80 when the Project was appraised to 942,539 in 1985/86 when
the Project was completed. In some Project schools there were classes of over 100
pupils and four children sat on benches made to accommodate two and others sat
on the floor. The teachers were unable to move around the classrooms and teaching
was limited to lecturing. Thus the conditions for improvement in the quality of
primary education have not generally been established, although some increased
access was provided.
4.05 Although the Staff Appraisal Report pointed to equity as an important aspect
in identifying the location of schools, ther were some major problems. Some
communities were  reluctant to  participate  in  self-help  school construction
programmes. There was a shortage of suitable clay for brick-making and an
inadequate supply of sand and stone in certain areas. Some sites were inaccessible
and as a result, the Central Region, which has the lowest enrolment rate, did not
receive a fair share of the schools. This is one of the hazards of self-help schemes
- generally the better-off communities take fuller advantage of the opportunities
offered (Table 4.1).

See Annex I for details.
4.06    Efficiency of primary education has improved, but only marginaly. At the
time of appraisal, the number of pupil-years of a cohort divided by the number of
graduates produced a figure of 16.9; however, in 1987, according to the Appraisal
Repart for the First Sector Credit this figure had been reduced to 16, by comparison
with the appraisal target of 13.2.
Textbook DLstrition Progrmme
4.07    Compared to the appraisal target of 2.2 milion textbooks, primary school3
received 2.7 milion textbooks, in English (0.8 million), Chichewa (0.9 million) and
arithmetic (1.0 million) (Annex 7). The Project was supposed to provide a set of three
textbooks for each primary school pupil. Although primary school enrolment had
increased from 740,000 at appraisal to 899,460 in 1984/85 when the book distribution
was completed, the amount of books supplied overall was sufficient for three books
to be supplied to each child.
4.08    FuU information was not available on the actual distribution of the books
by region or district. It appeared however, that the Project succeeded in improving
the student:book ratio from about 5:1 at appraisal to about 5:4. The student:book
ratio per subject ranged, accomding to the particular book, from 10:1 to 10:37 (Annex
8). Furthermore, there was unequal distribution of books. The studentAjook ratio
was lower for Grades 1 and 2 than for Grades 3 to 8. This was due to two factom
(i) because the upper grade pupils were allowed to take the books home and the teaching
and learning process at this level depended upon the books more than at the lower
level, the books were more rapidly worn out and their replacement by the Government
was slow; and (ii) in supplying the books, no allowance was made for the high drop-
out of pupils from Grades 1 and 2 which resulted in a generous net provision of books.
4.09    The inclusion of a textbook component in the Project was a positive move
towards upgrading the quality of primary education. However, the quality of the
books provided is a source of concern. In order to meet the project schedule, MOEC
did not spend the necessary time reviewing the books and the English textbook, for
example, had been written in the mid-1960s and not revised thereafter. Consequently,
it has a teacher centered approach and its concepts are generally unrelated to the
present Malawian society. This has posed problems for MIE staff who prepared the
teachers' guides on the basis of the school textbooks and were therefore constrained
by their shortcomings. When such a large investment is to be made in textbooks,
steps are needed to ensure that they are in keeping with the school curriculum. Despite
the shortcomings, the books filled a gap and MOEC can, through its subject
conimittees, revise them in a continuing basis, especially in the context of the planned
revision of the primary school curriculum.

Improving Access to Seconday Education
(a) MCC Centres
4.10    The MCC centres were designed to provide mainly out-of-school secondary
education in response to the growing social demand for secondary education. The
Third Education Project provided 30 additional centres and equipment for the
headquarters at Blantyre; however, this input of equipment only is insufficient to
effect substantial improvement in the quality of the education offered. The
correspondence programme has the potential to provide secondary education of a
reasonable standard; however, it is at a disadvantage because of (i) inadequacy of
the supply of resource books, printed instructional materials and functioning radios
at the centres, (ii) the shortage of trained personnel in secondary education both
to supervise the centres and to be tutors at the central office and (iii) the overcrowding
at the centres. Some of the problems are being addressed under the Fifth Education
Project and a review undertaken after the completion of that Project should throw
more light on how to improve the efficiency of the programme.
(b) Secondary Schools
4.11    The secondary school component was transferred to the Fourth Education
Project because, during the appraisal of the latter project in June 1980, substantial
increase in enrolment in secondary schools became a priority and it Vas estimated
that the Third Project did not include sufficient financing for expansion on the required
scale. Two of the secondary schools that were to be upgraded under the Third Project
(Balaka and Mitundu) were therefore transferred to the Fourth Project in June 1982,
under which they were to be extended to double their enrolments from 240 to 480,
in addition to being upgraded. Two other secondary schools, Nkhotakota and Likoma
Island, were similarly transferred in March 1984. A fifth secondary school, Salima,
was deleted from the Project because the site was liable to flooding.
Manpower Training for Business, Agriculture and Education Sectors
(a) Commercial Studies
4.12    Because of the delay in providing the technical expertise for preparation
of the syllabi, the commercial programme was started in 1986, three years behind
schedule. It is too early in the programme to assess its relevance to the business
sector. Some trained commercial teachers have expressed concern that they had
little or no participation in preparing the programme and some books which they
requested were not supplied, while they received other less useful books.
4.13    The technical colleges offer day and evening courses. The evening courses
are fully enrolled, but day courses are under-enrolled, mainly because of the late
start of courses. At Mzuzu College, about 113 students were enrolled ir. '1988 in evening
classes (two nights a week), but only 19 enrolled in the day course - 15 in the basic
business stream for the nine-month course which began in September 1986 and four
in the secretarial stream for the 18-month course which began in January 1987.
4.14    The Ministry of Labour and Personnel Management and Training does not
assist commercial graduates, most of whom are female, in their search for employment,
although such assistance is provided for all other technical fields. Clearly, this anomaly
needs to be corrected.



-16 -
(b) The Colby Agriculture College
4.15    The Project provided Colby College with four of the six staff houses that
were planned, dormitory furniture for 60 students, desks and chairs and a 12-seater
minibus. In 1983, only four years after Credit Signature, Colby College was closed
and students were transferred to the National Resources College as part of a
Government effort to centralize the training of technical assistants. The desks and
chairs are on loan to a nearby primary school and the minibus is being utilized by
the Ministry of Agriculture.
(c) Mzuzu Teacher Training College
4.16    Under-enrolment has oeen a problem at Mzuzu since the completion of the
extension in 1980. In 1987/88 there were 312 males in the 330 available places and
148 females in the 210 available places - a total of 80 vacancies. The low enrolment
has been attributed to the failure of females to take up all of the 210 places allocated
to them. The principal should be responsible for raising the issue with MOEC and
exploring possible solutions, but so far, with the frequent transfer of principals, this
has not happened.
(d) Chancellor College
4.17    The Project objective of increasing the enrolment of Chancellor College
from 600 to 825 students was achieved in 1983/84. Because of assistance continued
under the Fourth Project, the enrolment further increased to 1,023. About 461 of
these students were enrolled in education courses, well above the appraisal target
of 330. In line with the Project objectives, about 31 per cent of the students in
education programmes are enrolled in science/mathematics programmes (Annex 9).
The library expansion at Chancellor College, proposed under both the Third and Fourth
Education Projects, was consolidated and implemented under the Third Project, hence
the large increase in area noted above (paragrf.ph 2.13).
(e) The Malawi Institute
4.18    Malawi Institute of Education (MIE) was established in 1979 to replace the
Domasi Teaching In-Service Training Centre. It received (a) physical facilities under
the Project to accommodate 150 trainees and 30 staff and (b) technical assistance
from UK and UNDP. The Institute was given responsibility for curriculum development,
materials preparation and in-service training for the entire primary and secondary
system. (Staff Appraisal Report paragraph 4.18).
4.19    MIE was intended to provide support for both the primary and secondary
levels. It has so far concentrated its efforts on developing teaching materials and
in-service training for primary school personnel. Between 1982/83 and 1986/87, MIE
produced 18 teachers' guides in science, history, arithmetic, civics, agriculture and
English, three textbooks in health education, three in primary science, one in
agriculture, and eight in various aspects of teacher training (Annex 10).
4.20    Generally, the teachers' guides have been well thought out and prepared'
and well received by principals and most teacher training institutions. There are,
however, a few problems. Some teachers' guides were prepared for school textbooks
that were out-of-date and, as a result, they are teacher dominated and include few
activities aimed at stimulating the creative abilities of the pupils. There is little
evidence of the problem solving approach to teaching and learning, especially in the
noh-science subject areas. The teachers' guides were written for individual courses
and are too compartmentalized; they do not sufficiently promote mutual reinforcement



- 17 -
end knowledge transfer between subjects. Among the Teachers' Training Colleges
(ITCs) the advantage taken of these MIE materials varied and there is no MOEC
policy on their utilization. There is more extensive use of MIE materials in the recently
established TTCs than in the older ones, the reason being that the latter received
insufficient supplies of materials.
4.21    One Project objective was that MIE would annually provide training courses
for about 600 primary school teachers and short courses for about 60 inspectors and
District Education Officers, 100 primary school headmasters and 40 secondary school
teachers and others. The objective of training 600 teachers annually was not achieved.
The administrator at the Institute felt that, since training programmes could not
be provided by MIE for the approximately 15,000 teachers who needed training, they
should seek a multiplier effect of training mainly Education Officers, school inspectors
and headteachers who could in turn hold training sessions in their respective districts
and regions for teachers. In the period 1985 to 1987, MIE held 25 such training sessions
to train over 1,200 education personnel in the use of new teaching materials and other
aspects of education.
4.22    With regard to curriculum development, MIE has proposed to MOEC changes
in the objectives of primary education and, at the time of the completion mission,
was awaiting a response. MIE conducts three major curriculum development workshops
annually for about 120 participants each and 12 curriculum evaluation workshops
of about one to two weeks each.
4.23   In 1988, MIE had a staff of 151 comprising 19 professionals, five administrators
and 127 support staff. Because of the inadequate provision of staff housing, MIE
is unable to increase its professional and administrative staff to the appraisal estimate
of 30. The buildings were provided more or less according to the details agreed at
appraisal, except that the area for library, language and visual aids was increased
by 75 per cent from 320m2 to 561m2.
4.24    The physical facilities of MIE are not being utilized exactly as planned because
(a) the change in strategy noted above (paragraph 4.21) has reduced the numbers to
be trained in MIE and (b) for even the limited number of workshops planned for
teachers, funding by MOEC has not always been made available. Some intended
classrooms are being utilized as materials production and administrative offices.
The utility of the library has been increased with the establishment of Domasi TTC,
since Domasi students have access to it. The language laboratory is being utilized
as an administrative office and parts of the equipment have been taken out to replace
worn out parts in language laboratories in other institutions. Steps should be taken
to make the language laboratory operable so that it can be utilized by Domasi TTC
which has only one language laboratory for the training of over 500 trainees.
4.25    Between 1982/83 and 1986/87 the total recurrent expenditure increased
from K284,800 to K718,675 and income increased from K290,929 to K866,501 over
the same period (Annex 11). On the average, approximately 68 per cent of the total
Income was provided through Government subvention and the remaining 32 per cent
has been earned mainly from staff house rents, catering sales and printing and
duplicating services.
Studies
4.26    The only study carried out under the Project was the school mapping study.
In consultation with IDA. All other studies (Table 1.1,10) were transferred to the
Fourth Education Project. The school mapping study was completed somewhat late
in 1983, and its recommendations were supposed to guide the allocation and siting



- 18 -
of primary classrooms among districts to improve equity. However its impact on
equity was almost nil because, in the provision of primary classrooms under the Project,
considerations regarding self-help potential, accessibility of sites and availability
of building materials often overrode the concern for equity.
Improving School StVevision
4.27    Fifty vehicles were supplied (as planned) by the Project: (a) 43 all-terrain
vehicles for REOs (3), DEOs (28), MCC (3), MOEC (4), MIE (1), Mzuzu TTC (1) and
PIU (3); (b) two buses: one 36-seater for MIE and one 10-seater for MOA; and (c)
five trucks for the PIU (Annex 12).
4.28    The vehicles facilitated improved operations of REOs and DEOs and the
educational institutions. School inspection has been intensified, but it is not clear
whether this is as a result of the increased number of school inspectors of the vehicles
provided to educational offices. School inspectors expressed preference for using
public transportation (buses), walking, or using small vehicles (motorbikes aad small
cars) to carry out inspection because of the difficulties in co-ordinating pool
transportation for individual inspectors. They indicated that the vehicles supplied
by the Project were suitable for team visits. Under the First Education Sector Credit,
motorbikes will be provided to inspectors.

V. IDA PERFORMANCE
5.01 Project generation was not protracted. About one year elapsed between
Credit Application and Board presentation and four months from Board Approval
to Credit Effectiveness. About 36 staff weeks were spent in the field on project
generation missions. Attention should, however, be drawn to two questions in
project design - firstly, whether it was wise to have included Colby College of
Agriculture in the absence of a long term comprehensive plan for the development
of agricultural education and training and secondly, whether a prior study of self-
help potential in the construction of primary schools would not have been useful,
especially in the light of the equity objectives which were to be pursued.
5.02 Although the PIU had implemented two education projects prior to
implementing the Third Project, there was no use of local staff at the professional
level in architecture and engineering. A shortcoming in the design of the Third
Education Project therefore was the absence of arrangements for providing such
personnel in the PIU.
5.03 The Project was supervised by 14 IDA education missions 25 staff weeks,
excludipg the completion missions and several visits from the Controllers'
Department of the Bank. AR supervision missions combined supervision of this
Project with generating subsequent projects or with supervising other projects.
The interval between missions ranged from three to eleven months, averaging
4.7 months. A broad mix of staff participated in these missions - architects
participated in 14 missions, economists in 10, education planners in six, general
educators in two, and two technical educators and operations specialist in one
mission each. Although much attentioni was given to the quantitative aspects,
the location of primary school classrooms and the development of the MIE should
have been better monitored. On the whole, however, IDA staff supervision has
been effective and has established and maintained good re'ationships with
Government officials.
5.04 IDA was reasonably flexible during project implementation and approved
two amendments to the Credit Agreement involving transfer of secondary schools
to the Fourth Project (paragraph 4.11), and adjusting and re-phasing the assistance
programme to Chancellor College over the Third and Fourth Projects (paragraph

VI. LESSONS DRAWN FROM THE PROJECT EXPERIENCE
6.01 The Project concept and design were in accordance with the educational
needs of Malawi. Primary education enrolment increased by about 162,863 (21
per cent) between 1979/80 and 1985/86 and the Project contributed about 31 per
cent of the additional places. The population growth, however, reduced the impact
of the Project and enrolment ratios have not improved substantially.
6.02 In order for the PIU to reduce its dependence on expatriate services, special
measures are required to provide local professional staff, particularly architects
and engineers.
6.03 In regard to equity of access to primary education, special attention needs
to be given to the problems of disadvantaged rural communities where (a) a co-
ordinated approach to the provision of services such as access roads, water supply
and health care would be most effective in parallel with efforts at providing school
places, and (b) the assistance provided to communities under self-help programmes
needs to be somewhat more generous than in less disadvantaged communities.
A school mapping exercise is clearly not an answer in itself.
6.04 A self-help construction programme requires detailed planning including
special attention to the availability of labour and raw materials in the quality
and quantities required. Although the Project provided some raw materials and
some effort was made towards the co-ordination of the multiplicity of agencies
which were involved, the support system to ensure timely implementation of the
Project was not adequately identified.
6.05 During project generation more precise consideration should have been given
to the recurrent cost implications of the Project and the ability of the Govemment
to meet these costs, particulary to the cost of textbook replacement and of the
in-service teacher training programmes.
6.06 In respect of the primary school textbook programme, time was needed
to undertake a review of the textbooks which were being utilized in the primary
schools in order to determine their suitability for the primary school curriculum,
and an adequate primary school textbook programme prepared on the basis of
the findings of the review.
6.07 The MCC programme offers an alternative to regular secondary education
for over 10,000 students. The Project provided physical plant and some learning
m1.aterials, but not enough attention was given to the institutional (organization
and management) aspects and to software needed for the programme. The
effectiveness of the programme was hampered inter alia by the shortage of trained
personnel and the inadequacy in the proportion and distribution of the learning
materials. These problems are being addressed in the First Education Sector Credit.
