CHAPTER I
THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Romania's Energy Sector
Energy Resources
1.01      Romania was one of the world's first oil producers and still meets
more than 80% of its energy needs from indigenous oil and gas resources;
however, production is declining despite intensive secondary and tertiary
recovery efforts. By 1985, 50% of Romania's commercial energy needs may have
to be imported, mostly in the form of oil. This situation has led to inten-
sive efforts to develop all other indigenous energy resources, including
hydropower, coal, lignite, and bituminous shales.
1.02      The published guidelines for the preparation of the 1981-85 Plan
dictate continued enforcement and improvement of conservation and efficiency
measures in the energy-consumptive sectors. These were initiated in 1973 and
are implemented through a highly-structured program consisting of reviews of
all industrial and chemical processes and production plans by special commit-
tees seeking conservation opportunities, in accordance with the directive by
the State Planning Commission to reduce oil imports and use imported oil only
for petro-chemicals (see Economic Report, No. 1601-RO, March 31, 1978).
1.03      The guidelines indicate also large investments in resource explora-
tion development e.g. "drilling to great depths", but details are lacking.
Although expensive, this is not to imply that these developments are neces-
sarily uneconomic--the studies for the proposed bituminous shale based power
plant at Anina, for instance, indicate that the cost is competitive with other
power resources being developed in Romania, which themselves are competitive
with generation based on imported oil.
1.04      Wood is still quite widely used in Romania as a domestic fuel for
cooking purposes. It is assumed that the availability of wood as fuel is
limited and that it will stabilize at somewhat over 3 million tons annually
on a sustainable yield basis. Other materials such as maize stalks and
corncobs are used for domestic fuel in rural areas but no estimate of the
quantities involved is available.  Romania does possess some peat deposits
but these are apparently not considered to be economically exploitable.
1.05      More detailed information on the power/energy sector is given in
previous appraisal reports (Turceni Thermal, Loan 1028-RO; Riul Mare-Retezat
Hydro, Loan 1242-RO), and an energy sector survey undertaken in connection
with the basic economic mission in October/November 1976.
Organization of the Energy Sector
1.06      No single entity is responsible for energy in Romania.  Responsi-
bility for the sector rests with the Ministries of (i) Mines, Petroleum and
Geology; (ii) Electrical Energy; (iii) Chemical Industries; (iv) Metallurgical
Industries; and (v) Forestry Economy and Construction Materials. The State



Planning Committee is responsible for coordinating energy planning in addition
to arbitrating differences between Government Ministries.
Past Growth of Energy Consumption
1.07      Energy demand including wood and other "non-commercial" fuels in
Romania has risen dramatically over the last three decades as a result of the
policy of rapid industrialization; from about 6.8 million tons oil equivalent
(toe) 1/ in 1950 to about 52.1 million toe in 1975. (No statistics are avail-
ab:Le for 1976 and 1977, but best estimates are 56 million toe and 61 million
toe respectively.)
1.08      Prior to 1950, oil and oil products supplied most energy needs.
The development of heavy metallurgical industries, primarily iron and steel
increased consumption of coke and coking coal and prompted rising imports of
the!se fuels starting in 1955. Natural gas from the Transylvanian Basin became
increasingly important starting in 1960 and by 1965 became the largest single
source of energy in the Romanian economy.  Current consumption of natural gas
is about 36 billion cubic meters/a. The changing structure in the primary
energy supply is brought out in Table 1.1.
National Energy Policy
1.09      The national energy policy contained in 1976-1980 Plan can be
summarized as follows:
(a) maximum reliance on domestic production of primary energy
resources;
(b) priority in the development of coal, hydroelectric and
nuclear power, while utilizing hydrocarbons preferably as
raw materials for the chemical industry; and
(c) greatly increased utilization of indigenous solid fuels
having low calorific value (lignite and bituminous shales).
Forecast Energy Supply and Demand
1.10      The 1976-1980 Plan specific production targets for the four prin-
cipal forms of energy show that electricity and coal are the fastest growing
during the five years (Table 1.2).
1.11      Energy consumption is expected to increase to 78 million toe by
1980. Plans for massive expansion of metallurgical and petrochemicals indus-
tries will increase consumption substantially. Consumption estimates are
conservative as they include planned savings through higher efficiencies in
the industrial sector (about 8 million toe) and increased waste heat recovery
(about 5 million toe).
1/   One ton oil equivalent, toe = 10.6 million kilocalories.



B. Romania's Power Subsector
Organization
1.12      Romania's power subsector is effectively managed by the Ministry of
Electrical Energy (MEE) through a board comprising the Minister, three Deputy
Ministers and the various directors of subordinated organizations. Up to
October 1, 1977, all MEE generation, transmission, and distribution facili-
ties were the responsibility of a single entity, the Industrial Central for
Electric Power and Heat (CIEET). Under the present organization, CIEET has
been replaced by two entities; Industrial Central for Production of Power &
Heat (CIPEET) in charge of power generation and district heating stations,
and Industrial Central for Transmission and Distribution of Power (CIRE), in
charge of bulk transmission and distribution. Figure 1.1 shows MEE's latest
organization chart and Figures 1.2 and 1.3 CIPEET's and CIRE's respectively.
1.13      Another recent development, also affecting the power subsector, is
the general restructuring of Romania's economic and financial system announced
by the President of Romania in February 1978. Among other reforms, enter-
prises would have a greater responsibility for their own financial and operat-
ing performance, production planning, and marketing at home and abroad. State
funds would still be available to the enterprises. These changes will be put
into effect beginning January 1, 1979. At the moment, it is unclear how much
decentralization will actually take place and because of the uncertainties
this appraisal does not take the proposed changes into account.
Tariffs
1.14      Tariffs are approved by the Council of Ministers and are uniform
throughout the country. Until January 1, 1977 they had been virtually
unchanged since 1963 except for some restructuring in 1974 to introduce dif-
ferential tariffs for low, medium and high voltage consumers. However, from
January 1977, electricity prices were reduced 28-30% and thermal energy rates
about 7% (para. 3.02). This reduction was part of a general restructuring of
the prices to the manufacturing sector of inputs from the basic industries
(e.g. power, mining, petroleum, metallurgy, chemicals, etc.). The purpose of
this restructuring was to increase the profitability of end users, i.e., manu-
facturers. The effect of this change has been to reduce average revenue per
kWh sold from about 0.321 lei or US 1.6 cents equivalent to 0.237 lei or US 1.3
cents equivalent. This price restructuring has not significantly altered the
electricity consumption pattern. Large industrial consumers increased their
usage slightly from 70% of total consumption to 71% between 1976 and 1977.  On
the other hand domestic consumers increased their proportion from about 9% to
10% in the same period, even though the domestic price of electricity was not
changed.
1.15      In recent years, rates have adequately covered operating and admin-
istration costs and provided a reasonable portion of future investment needs.
The tariff structure includes time-of-day rates, differential peak and off-
peak demand and energy charges and other elements of marginal cost pricing



- 4 -
conducive to efficient allocation of resources but it has not been possible
to confirm positively that the rate structure reflects the marginal costs of
supply in the absence of a comprehensive study of actual and planned system
costs in Romania. However, the elements of the tariffs and penalties imposed
for excessive use (para. 3.05) give the tariffs a strong marginal-cost based
flavor. Illustrative of the span of tariffs, the average cost of electricity
to domestic consumers is about 80% above that paid by large industrial con-
sumers who utilize about 50% of electricity sold in Romania and who benefit
from the most favorable tariff rates. No future increases in rates are
planned but they are likely to be necessary during the 1981-85 Five-Year Plan
because of the higher cost and newer technology of the plant planned for
construction in this period.
Planning
1.16      Mathematical models to evaluate and compare alternative power sys-
tem development patterns have been used by MEE for more than 10 years.  A
paper describing the Romanian planning models was presented at the June 1969
Power System Computation Conference in Rome, under the title "Models for the
Study of Power System Development by Means of Digital Computers". The paper
described a linear program to determine the least-cost development plan. The
plan is updated from time to time to supply current information to the overall
national planning process conducted by the State Planning Committee. A least-
cost development study was received by the Bank in July 1977. Subsequent
review revealed the study was highly constrained by resource availability and
technical alternatives. All solutions selected lignite capacity up to the
maximum available and kept nuclear capacity to a reasonable minimum. The net
effect of the study was, then, to make only marginal determinations, in this
case the division between hydro and nuclear 1/ capacity. However the deficien-
cies pointed out by the Bank were clarified after detailed discussions with
the Romanians and the resulting development program has been recognized by the
Bank as the least-cost option within the context of Romanian economic policy.
Nevertheless, further work is being done to improve planning by (i) incorporat-
ing in the model benefits other than power, and (ii) reviewing carefully cost
estimates and technical proposals for the marginal hydro projects.
Existing System and Development Program
1.17      In 1977, Romania's interconnected generating capacity 2/ was 13,184
MW; 2,951 MW consisted of hydro and 9,487 MW of thermal plants belonging to
MEE.  The rest, 746 MW, were mostly thermal captive plants operated by auto-
prcducers (Table 1.3). System peak was 9,360 MW and total gross generation
1/   Romania is actively negotiating for a nuclear plant based on Canadian
technology, but the construction schedule has not yet been determined.
However, given the growing energy deficit it is likely that nuclear power
will figure prominently in Romania's long-range energy program.
2/   97% of Romania's total installed capacity is interconnected.



and purchases 61,595 GWh. MEE plants generated 56,551 GWh, auto-producers
3,306 GWh and imports amounted to 1,738 GWh. Exports were 1,882 GWh.
1.18      Sales in 1977 were 49,690 GWh, an increase of only 4.4% over 1976,
compared to an average annual growth of sales of 10.0%/a for 1970-1976 (Table
1.4). This marked drop in the rate of load growth was probably caused mostly
by the simultaneous occurrence of (i) a slowdown in construction activities
as a consequence of the March 1977 earthquake; (ii) reduced consumption in
irrigation pumping due to favorable rainfall; and (iii) impact of strong con-
servation efforts (para 1.02). Table 1.4 also shows the marked reduction in
transmission and distribution losses obtained through energy conservation
measures since 1973.
1.19      The projected consumption figures prepared by the mission are based
on national planning targets and imply average annual load growth of 6.1%/a
for 1978-85 (Table 1.5). The estimate reflects slower industrial load growth
(5.3%/a in 1978-1985 against 11.3%/a in 1970-1977) in line with an expected
slowdown in the industrial production growth rate and planned strong conser-
vation measures by Government throughout the economy.
1.20      Power system expansion plans follow a least-cost development program
within national energy policy objectives (para. 1.09) and take into account
adequate system reserve planning and performance criteria (para. 1.16).  Table
1.6 shows MEE's generation expansion plan for 1978-1985.  Total estimated
subsector investment for 1978-1985 shown in Table 1.7 is 141,424 million lei
(US$7,857 million), not including investment in distribution facilities at the
local level in municipalities--total distribution investment could be esti-
mated at about twice the figure shown for distribution in the table. Distribu-
tion construction in the municipalities is carried out by construction units
within each distribution enterprise. These units are self-accounting and
financed from local funds. Of the invesment shown, 36%, 51,483 million lei
(US$2,860 million), would be for 8,490 MW of thermal plants (Table 1.8); 42%,
59,483 million lei (US$3,305 million), would for 4,066 MW of hydro plants and
the other 21%, 30,200 million lei (US$1,678 million), would be for bulk trans-
mission and distribution, dispatching and other sector investments under MEE.
1.21      The large amounts shown for generation expansion reflect the current
emphasis being given to accelerated construction of high cost, multipurpose
hydro installations under the development program entrusted to MEE.
Role of the Bank
1.22      The Bank has made two loans for power in Romania.  Loan 1028-RO ($60
million) in 1974 for the first stage of the Turceni Thermal Power Project
(1,320 MW) and associated transmission, and Loan 1242-RO ($50 million) in 1976
for the Riul Mare-Retezat Hydro Power Project (355 MW at Retezat plus 14 MW at
Clopotiva, downstream). In addition to providing needed base load generation
to the system, the first loan contributed to the transfer of up-to-date indus-
trial technology. Manufacture of the boilers, turbines and generators is
taking place in Romania using modern, proven designs acquired through licensing
agreements with foreign manufacturers. The second loan helped finance a key



- 6 -
component of a cascade development designed to supply hydro peaking power to
the system.
1.23      Progress on the first Turceni stage can be considered good in spite
of an overall nine months' delay to date. Construction problems are well
under control. No major additional delays are foreseen and the last of the
four units is expected to start up in December 1979.
1.24      The Riul Mare-Retezat Hydro-Power Project, on the other hand, has
been plagued by recurrent shortages of tunneling manpower. Start-up of the
first unit in the Retezat station is likely to be 10-12 months late. To
prevent further slippage manpower deficiencies are expected to be offset by
introduction of a tunnel boring machine starting in early 1979.
The Borrower
1.25      The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Investment Bank,
which is the specialized agency, under the Ministry of Finance, for investment
projects in all sectors of the economy except agriculture (including water
resources) and food processing. It has a large technical and economic staff
with branch offices in all districts of the country. The Investment Bank's
involvement in investment projects commences in the preparation phase of a
project; its staff appraises all major investment projects technically and
financially and recommends approval or otherwise of their financing to the
Council of Ministers. When a particular project and its financial plan has
been approved by the Council of Ministers, all major funds are channeled
through the Investment Bank in accordance with the approved financial plan.
All payments for the execution of a project have to be authorized by the
Investment Bank which keeps separate accounts for each category in the finan-
cial plan for every enterprise. It is the Investment Bank's obligation to
ensure that a project is executed according to the financial and technical
data included in the final technical and economic study approved by the
Council of Ministers. Its inspectors check whether the project is proceeding
according to the schedule approved in the Plan.
The Project Entity
1.26      Turceni enterprise, one of the generating enterprises reporting to
CIPEET (para. 1.12) will be responsible for Project implementation. This
enterprise was established in 1973 by decree of the Council of Ministers
specifically for the Turceni Thermal Power Plant Project and is currently
carrying out the first stage of construction (4x330 MW) under Bank financing
(para. 1.22).
1.27      The manager of the Turceni enterprise is responsible for the admin-
istration, recruitment and training of future plant operating personnel.

CHAPTER II
THE PROJECT
Description
2.01      The Second Turceni (Turceni II) Thermal Power Project comprises:
(a) a thermal power station with four 330-MW lignite-fired
units delivering 7,920 GWh/a to the interconnected sys-
tem at a plant factor of 74%, as an extension to the first
4x330-MW Turceni stage (Turceni I) under construction in
southwestern Romania with Bank financing (Loan 1028-RO).
(b) about 288 km of 400-kV transmission lines connecting
Turceni with Cluj via Rovinari (Map IBRD 10830R).
2.02      Fuel supply and site facilities (railroad, river diversion, ash
handling, etc.) will be as provided for in Turceni I (Map IBRD 10831R), but
will involve opening of additional new mines both open cast and underground
(para. 2.03).
Fuel Supply
2.03      In addition to lignite, the basic fuel, Turceni plant will also burn
fuel oil for start-up and stabilization of lignite burning at partial load.
Tuarceni II will require about 11 million tons/a of lignite and 0.8 million
tons/a of fuel oil. Adequacy of lignite supplies for the life of the station
was ascertained as detailed in the report from Mr. P.W. Rickes, lignite con-
sultant to the appraisal mission. A summary of the report is included as
Aninex 2.1.
2.04      Total annual lignite consumption is estimated at 55 million tons/a
starting in 1984/1985 for all existing and presently planned lignite-fired
stations--Turceni I and II (8x330 MW), Rovinari (1,770 MW), Craiova (1,035
MW)--and a number of small industrial plants and other minor consumers.
Lignite production from existing known deposits would be capable of supplying
the total estimated consumption for at least 60 years. The Government and
the Borrower confirmed that they will provide semi-annually lignite production
figures for the preceeding 6 months and estimated production for the 6 months
iimmediately following. The first of these statements would be expected by
August 31, 1979.

The estimated foreign exchange requirement, US$117 million, 1/ covers the cost
of direct imports and foreign exchange costs of local supplies. The proposed
loan (US$70 million) would finance about 60% of this cost. Local costs are
based on existing contract prices which are not subject to escalation. There-
fore, no local cost price contingency is included. Escalation of foreign cur-
rency costs was taken as 9% for 1977, 7% for 1978, 6.5% for 1979 and 6.0% for
1980 through 1984 and applied to direct import items and imported materials
and components for locally supplied goods. A 10% physical contingency was
applied to both local and for ign currency costs in line with experience in
the first stage of Turceni. Details of the development of the Project cost
estimate are given in Annex 2.2. At negotiations, the Government clarified
1/   The foreign exchange Project cost estimate is made up of direct import
assemblies (10.0% of total foreign exchange cost), imported components
for incorporating into Romanian-made equipment (63.9%), indirect foreign
exchange expenditure for depreciation of manufacturing and construction
equipment (2.6%), imported automotive fuel and lubricants (2.3%), and
reinforcing and structural steel (21.2%).

that import duties have been imposed on equipment and machinery imports since
19)74. Accordingly, taxes and duties are included in the local currency portion
of the Project cost estimate based on the approved ceiling for direct imports
(US$8.9 million, para. 2.15) and applicable import taxes and duties 1/. On
the other hand, local turnover taxes are not applicable to transactions
between state-ow ied enterprises and are therefore omitted.
2.06       The generating component of the Project is estimated to cost 7,914.2
million lei (about (US$440 million) or about 5,996 lei/kW (US$333/kW). Given
the circumstances in Romania, this cost is reasonable.
Piroject Financing Plan
2.07       The Project represents about 8% of the MEE's investment program
which is expected to cost about 112 billion lei (US$6.2 billion equivalent)
during the construction period of the Project through 1984. It will be
financed principally from State Budget allocations. The MEE expects that the
Turceni enterprise will also provide part of the financing for this Project
from its internal funds (i.e. benefits and depreciation). These internal
sources are planned to become available beginning late in 1978 or earlier
in 1979 after commissioning of the first unit of Turceni I but no specific
amounts have been provided in Romania's current 5-Year Plan 1976-80. The
decision of the Council of State (Decree No. 239 dated July 26, 1977), which
inicludes the technical and economic indicators for the Project (Annex 2.3),
constitutes the Government's authorization for the Project's construction
and the expenditures to be incurred. Submission of an official copy of this
decision to the Bank is a condition of loan effectiveness.
2.08       The proposed Bank loan of US$70 million is expected to finance about
14% of the estimated cost of the Project. The loan would be made to the
Inivestment Bank which would make the proceeds available to the Turceni enter-
prise on the same terms. It has been assumed that the Bank loan would be for
15 years including a 3-year period of grace. As was the case under the first
two power loans, the Investment Bank would meet the debt service up to the
time the project enterprise begins producing revenues and has further agreed
that the sum of the annual benefits and provisions for depreciation of the
Turceni enterprise would, after 1981, be sufficient to cover the debt service
payments on both Bank loans for Turceni.
2.09       No cost overrun is expected.  However, should additional funds
be required, they would be provided in the first instance from resources of
the MEE or, if they proved to be insufficient, from the State Budget. Any
foreign exchange risk related to the Bank loan would be borne by the Invest-
ment Bank.
1/ An average of 15% ad valorem. Import duties range from zero to 35% for
thermal power plant components, with most values falling between 11%
and 17%.

Environmental Considerations
2.10      Remedial measures to minimize undesirable consequences of large
scale mining and lignite-fired power generation are being undertaken. Follow-
ing established practices, mine overburden is to be dumped in worked-out areas
and the land leveled and replanted. Station design includes high stacks
equipped with electrostatic precipitators to comply with Romanian clean air
standards. These standards prescribe a maximum daily average concentration of
sulphur dioxide of 0.25 mg/m3, the maximum momentary SO2 concentration is not
to exceed 0.75 mg/m3, non-toxic suspended powder should not exceed 0.15 mg/m3
and surface deposition of ash emitted with flue gases should not exceed 200
tons/km2/a. Slag and ash will be pumped in fluid suspension to the nearby,
barren Ceplea Valley (about 5 km away) capable of accepting dumpings from the
2,640 MW station for about 30 years.
Implementation
2.11      Design engineering is complete and construction of the second
Turceni stage is proceeding immediately following the first stage. Building
extension and foundations for the second stage are approximately 25% complete.
Work is progressing satisfactorily and the first unit (No. 5 unit not financed
by the Bank) is expected to start up in June 1980. Civil works and instal-
lation and erection are under the Thermal Construction Trust and Electro-
Mechanical Construction Trust respectively. Project management is under the
Turceni enterprise assisted by the Design Institute for Thermal Studies (ISPE)
acting as consultants; and the Investment Bank also monitors performance
during construction. In addition, ISPE provides overall project supervision
and start-up engineering. Figure 2.1 shows the estimated Project construction
schedule.
2.12      Romania's construction industry is highly efficient and no delays
are foreseen. Development of new mines should present no problems (para.
2.03). Open-cast mining employs large, electric powered bucket-wheel exca-
vators manufactured in Romania to German designs. No problems in meeting
delivery dates for these key items are foreseen. The above implementation
arrangements are the same as were made for Turceni I. In view of the rela-
tively good progress of Turceni I (para 1.23) they are considered to be
satisfactory for this Project.
Procurement
2.13      Contracts for civil works--not being financed by the Bank--have been
negotiated with the Thermal Construction Trust as an extension of ;he work in
progress for Turceni I. Installation and erection will be carried out by the
Electro-Mechanical Construction Trust under similar conditions. Both trusts
are specialized contractors with a wealth of experience in similar work in
Romania. These arrangements have been proven effective in the past and are
considered satisfactory for the Project.



- 22 -
2.14      Contracts for three (3) complete turbine-generator sets and minor
electrical and mechanical equipment (valves, instrumentation and controls,
hydraulic couplings etc.) to be financed from the proposed loan would be
awarded through international competitive bidding (i.c.b.) under the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. Due to the competitiveness of the Romanian
thermal power equipment manufacturers, it is expected that the contract to
supply the turbine-generator sets will be awarded to Romanian suppiiers.
On the other hand, the contracts for the balance of i.c.b. items totalling
about $8.9 million (Annex 2.4) are expected to go to foreign manufacturers.
Fcir bid evaluation, a domestic preference of 15% or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is the lesser, would be granted to participating Romanian
manufacturers. Bidding documents for all items were reviewed by the mission
before being issued. Bid openings were scheduled between September 18 and
October 3 for the minor items, and October 4 for the turbine-generators.
Turbine-generator bids were opened on schedule. Three bidders participated.
Bid evaluation is expected to take 3-4 months and contract award made about
mid-February 1979. To help maintain the proposed implementation schedule
(para. 2.11) advance contracting of the minor items (not to exceed US$8.9
million) has been allowed.  Delivery schedule for the three (3) turbine-
generator sets is not as critical (para 2.11), however, and no advance con-
tracting would be required in their case.
2.15      Decree No. 239 of the Council of State approving the Project (para.
2.07) sets the limit on the amount of foreign exchange to be expended by MEE
on direct imports of goods from convertible currency countries at US$8.9 mil-
lion. This limit may be exceeded should the cost of imported equipment prove
to be higher than estimated for the minor components and also in the event
that a foreign supplier wins the contract for the three turbine-generators.
Under such circumstances, MEE is expected to apply promptly to the higher
authorities for removal of the US$8.9 million limit as required to ensure
Project implementation within the conditions set out in the Loan Agreement
specifying the eligibility of funds for disbursements. The Investment Bank
has undertaken to take measures for increasing the US$8.9 million limit if
it becomes necessary.
Disbursement
2.16      Disbursement of the proceeds of the loan would be for (a) 72% of for-
eign expenditures and 72% of ex-factory cost of locally manufactured items
in the case of the three turbine-generators, and (b) 100% of foreign expendi-
tures in the case of other equipment for the thermal power station. The
expected disbursement schedule is shown in Table 2.1. Unused portions of the
proposed loan, if any, due to project cost savings would be cancelled.  The
closing date would be December 31, 1982.
Risks
2.17      No special risks are foreseen.  The borrower (Investment Bank) and
executing agencies (Turceni Enterprise and ROMENERGO) have performed well
under the previous loan for the first stage of Turceni (Loan 1028-RO).  No
difficulties are expected in fuel supply or other operation aspects.

ROMANIA
SECOND TURCENI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Summary of Lignite Mining Consultant's Report
The following summarizes the situation of lignite supply for Turceni
thermal power plant:
(a)  lignite deposits comprise sufficient, economically and tech-
nically mineable reserves for the supply of all power plants
in Oltenia region in operation or planned, for their total
expected useful life;
(b)  the coal demand of all consumers will amount to approximately
55 million tons/a from 1984/1985 onwards;
(c) the planning and development of the number of mines correspond
to an annual output of 55 million tons coal/a;
(d)  installation and erection work in progress as well as the
planned date of completion of the equipment correspond to
the required capacity increase;
(e)  construction of mining equipment is mainly effected under the
management of Krupp (Federal Republic of Germany) and similar
firms from the German Democratic Republic. Adequate instruc-
tion and training of Romanian engineering personnel is being
carried out by Krupp and future production on their own seems
feasible;
(f) the solution of problems still existing in the open-cast mines
could lead to cost reductions. Special attention should be
directed to the mixture of coal rich in ash or coal poor in
ash, in order to supply the boilers with a fuel having a
calorific value as constant as possible;
(g)  mining techniques both for the open-cast operation and for the
deep mining are in line with the latest technical developments;
(h) additional investment to supply the second stage of Turceni
power plant amounting to approximately 11 billion lei, seems
to be very high. Nevertheless, provision for these funds is
included in the national budget;
(i) production costs will rise from approximately 84 lei/ton in
1978 to approximately 126 lei/ton in 1980, and later decrease
to approximately 92 lei/ton with increasing production. These
figures are relatively low;



- 25 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 2
(j) the sale price is determined by the State and remains unchanged
at 107 lei/ton; and
(k) freight costs amount to 12 lei/ton between the Jilt basin and
the power plant Turceni by railway. They are paid by the power
plant.
In sum, it can be concluded that the fuel supply for the Turceni
power plant, both for the first and second extension stages, can be regarded
as secured. No special risks on account of fuel supply are acknowledged.

CHAPTER III
FINANCE
Past Performance and Present Position of the Sector
3.01      Under the first two loans for power, the financial performance of
the electricity sector in Romania has been remarkably stable despite the
energy crisis; one of the principal reasons being the introduction in 1973 of
strict controls on the consumption of electricity and other forms of energy.
Although sales growth was sluggish at 4.7%/a in 1973, it picked up to 9.1%/a
in 1974. The rate of return on average net fixed assets in 1973 and 1974 was
between 8% and 9%. Despite the disastrous floods of 1975, these trends in
the rate of return and sales growth were maintained in 1975 and 1976 as the
rate of return remained within the 8-9% range and sales increased 12.1% and
9.6% respectively.
3.02      However, there were problems within the economy which led the
Romanian authorities to introduce radical changes effective January 1, 1977.
Firstly, the tax on invested funds which had been introduced in 1974, was
becoming an increasing burden on all capital intensive sectors. In the case
of the power sector, it amounted to about 4%/a of net fixed assets and work-
ing capital. At the same time the comprehensive review and re-structuring of
prices which had been carried out over the previous 2-3 years had apparently
not been fully effective in reducing distortions in certain sections of the
economy. Accordingly strong measures were taken which have substantially
changed the financial performance of the electricity sector:
(a) electricity rates were reduced about 28% and rates for the
sale of thermal energy by about 7%. The average revenue per
kWh sold fell from 0.322 lei in 1976 to 0.237 lei in 1977;
(b) depreciation rates were reduced by increasing the average
life of depreciable assets. This reduced the average depre-
ciation rate from 3.4% in 1976 to 2.5% in 1977; and
(c) the tax on invested funds was abolished.
3.03      The result of these changes in terms of net income to the electric-
ity sector was small since the reduction in tariffs was more than offset by
the reduced depreciation charges and the repeal of the tax on invested funds.
These changes were not confined to electricity enterprises; similar measures
wiere taken in all basic industry sectors: mining, machine building, metal-
lurgy, chemicals and petroleum. However, for the electricity Central,

they produced only a 2.1% rate of return in 1977. 1/ On the other hand the
level of cash generation from internal sources rose to 40% compared to only
35% in 1976. This increased contribution to investment was achieved because
of lower investment expenditures, largely delays in installing new plant to
which the 1977 earthquake would have contributed, and the reduction in the
annual contribution from net income to the State Budget.
3.04      Since the last power loan was approved in April 1976 (Loan 1242-RO),
there has been no significant change in the financial position of the sector.
It has no long-term debt other than the Bank's two previous loans. Sales
growth in 1977 did fall off somewhat (to 4.4%/a) following the severe earth-
quake in March as restoration work delayed completion of new irrigation and
industrial plants. Fixed assets continue to be valued at historical costs.
This valuation is appropriate given the continuing low level of inflation in
Romania. The State Budget still provides 50-60% of investment needs, the Bank
loans now represent about 5% and, as previously mentioned, internal sources
provide about 35-40%.
3.05      The financial performance and position of the electricity Centrals
is considered satisfactory, despite the 1977 reforms. Contributions to the
State Budget were reduced by the elimination of the tax on invested funds and
the lower distribution from net income, but these have more than matched the
reduction in revenues from the sale of electricity and thermal energy. The
net result has been a small but significant improvement in the levbl of self-
financing (para. 3.03). The low rate of return performance should be ignored
since prices in Romania do not nor are they intended to reflect more than the
cost of supply plus a small margin of profit for specified purposes. Power
prices have been trimmed by removal of taxes and contributions to the budget
but are still expected to yield a mark-up on cost of 8-10% per year to cover
bonus payments to the workers, and to provide funds for housing, repayment
of loans, social and cultural activities. Any surplus is available for
financing new works. Power prices represent a resource transfer price which
has no relationship to the normal demand and supply mechanism or role in the
allocation of resources. In practice, costs are tightly controlled and have
been virtually unchanged in terms of cost per unit sold since 1974. Savings
through increased efficiency, although not directly identifiable in the
income statements, are a significant factor in holding cost increases in
check. Continuing emphasis is being placed on reduction of losses in power
plants, in the transmission and distribution systems and on the reduction of
energy waste in industrial processes (Tables 1.4, and 1.5). Penalties amount-
ing to as much as 200% of the cost of electricity are imposed on consumers who
exceed their planned electricity allocation. All these factors point to the
growing efficiency of the electric power industry in Romania. It also is
important to keep in mind that the electricity sector is an integral part of
1/   The large change in the rate of return accompanying the small movement
in net income occurred because the tax on invested funds was previously
treated not as an operating expense but as an interest charge. There-
fore, the net effect of the January 1, 1977 measures was to reduce operat-
ing income and, hence, rate of return while net income changed little.

Romania's centrally planned economy under which all enterprises conform to
national development plans which are financed from the State Budget. Since
1977, power prices have been set to minimize the contributions by power sector
enterprises to the budget in the form of taxes and payments from surplus
income.  This was done to allow the industrial, agricultural and manufacturing
enterprises to increase their profits but at the same time to transfer the
point of collection of revenues from the state to the industrial and manufac-
turing enterprises since they will be subjected to a new and progressively
heavier rate of taxation on surplus income. In essence, part of the former
earnings of the power sector are being transferred to the industrial and
manufacturing sectors. For this reason, the performance of the power sector
cannot be reviewed in isolation from the rest of the economy, but a review of
the entire Romanian productive sector is beyond the scope of this report.

3.07      The financing plan is almost identical with the one presented in the
appraisal report for the last power loan; the "Appraisal of the Riul Mare-
Retezat Hydropower Project (Report No. 1103-RO). It will require about 112
billion lei (US$6.2 billion equivalent) for financing construction require-
ments and be financed 33% from own sources of the electricity sector, 64% from
the State Budget, 2% from IBRD loans and 1% from Investment Bank credits.
3.08      The financing plan for 1978 through 1980 is based on the MEE's
latest estimates made during the appraisal (June 1978) and reflects the 1978
annual plan and the revised outlook for the two remaining years of the 1976-80
5-Year Plan period. For the period 1981-85 for which no formal 5-Year Plan
forecasts have been prepared, the plan is based on the NEE estimates but duly
modified to reflect the Bank's lower expectation with respect to growth of the
power market through 1985.
3.09      The availability of internal sources of funds for meeting 33% of
investment needs through 1984 is doubtful. The source of this uncertainty is
the planned introduction of new procedures for increasing the role and auton-
omy of enterprises in Romania especially with respect to planning and manage-
ment, including allocation of their internal sources of funds and the distri-
bution of net income. These procedures were first announced by President
Ceausescu in February of 1978 and are planned to become effective in 1979.
Under the present system the enterprise has little control over these matters
with plans being set and approved by the State. However, under the new system,
the worker's councils will be given greater responsibility for planning and
distribution of income. Instead of paying depreciation and a pre-planned
portion of net income to the State, 1/ depreciation will be retained by the
enterprises and a tax on net output will be paid to the Republican budget and
to the local administration budgets. Net income will be used firstly for
repayment of loans and then for payments of workers' bonuses. Increases in
working capital funds, housing, social and cultural activities will be met
according to each enterprise's plan from net income. The remainder of net
income will be available for financing new investment. The Romanians never-
theless expect the level of self-financing to be more or less unchanged since
all that is being changed is that taxes and payments to the State are being
reduced to meet expenditures formerly financed from the central budget but
which will now be financed instead by each enterprise. However, whether this
will be so or not is not yet clear. Until the laws putting into force the
various changes are enacted and the 1981-85 plan is drawn up, it will not be
possible to determine clearly their full impact. From the point of view of
the Bank and its concern for sound financial planning in the power sector, it
would be expected that any reduction in the availability of the enterprises'
own sources of funds would be made up from the State Budget.  Since this is
the only recourse to the Romanians, no specific undertaking to this effect
has been sought.
1/   Enterprises in Romania have customarily paid monthly to the Investment
Bank a twelfth of the planned annual depreciation expense.

Future Financial Position
3.10      The financial forecasts 1978-1985 and the assumptions on which they
have been based are given in Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and Annex 3.1. Elec-
tricity prices and operating costs through 1985 are not expected to change
significantly. The income statements show that the rate of return on average
net fixed assets and working capital funds will be 2.3% in 1978 gradually
declining to 1% in 1985. The operating ratio will be 89% in 1978 rising to
94% in 1985 and the profit margin will exceed the 8-10% rarnge set by Romania's
planners, except in 1985 when it is only expected to be 6.3%. At the same
time, the MEE is expected to finance 42% of its investment needs in 1978
gradually reducing to 31% in 1985.
3.11      Although the rate of return performance is low, it is not considered
to be a relevant measure of the efficiency or the financial performance of the
Romanian power sector (see para 3.05). Efficiency is better measured by the
indicators which the Romanians now use for monitoring performance. In the
future, there are plans to improve the economic and financial indicators used
by all sectors as part of the general process of increasing the autonomy
of enterprises. Financial performance is best looked at in terms of cash
generation. As in the case of previous loans where it was established that
the Bank's conventional financial covenants were unnecessary, no specific
financial covenants have been sought. Instead the Bank has obtained the same
undertakings relating to cash generation as were given for the previous power
loan (Loan 1242-RO). These confirm that the Government plans for the power
sector to generate 30% of its own investment capital up to 1985. Despite the
planned changes in the role of power enterprises, this is still a realistic
planning objective. However, the Government and the Investment Bank have
confirmed that information on the planned and actual performance measured by
indicators which are used or planned for adoption by the MEE will be furnished
to the Bank as part of the Project information requirements to be included in
the Investment Bank's annual financial report to the Bank. The indicators are
expected to provide additional data on the sector's operating performance and
efficiency. A list of these indicators is given in Annex 3.2.
Accounts and Audit
3.12      Although there was a delay in the submission of the audit reports
for 1977, the auditing provisions for the previous power loans have been
retained, excep, that the time for submission has been extended to six months
in accordance with other recent Bank loan agreements with the Investment Bank.
These provisions require that the financial statements of the Central, the Proj-
ect enterprise and the Investment Bank be audited each year by the Ministry of
Finance and furnished to the Bank within 4 months of the end of each fiscal
year. However, since there are now two centrals (para 1.12) the Government
and the Investment Bank have agreed that the audit report will be based on
the consolidated accounts of the two power centrals.

ROMANIA
SECOND TURCENI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A.   Income Statement
1.        Electricity Sales are based on forecast growth in electricity sales
of 6.1% in 1978, 8.6% in 1979, 5.6% in 1980, 6.5% in 1981, 6.2% in 1982, 6.2%
in 1983 and 3.5% in 1984, 6.4% in 1985. Details of forecast generation and
sales are shown in Table 1.5. Electricity tariffs are assumed to be constant
through 1981 and in 1982 the average revenue per kWh sold is planned by the
Romanians to be increased from 0.238 lei per kWh in 1981 to 0.247 per kWh in
1982, an increase of 3.8%.
2.         Sales of Heat were assumed to be at constant prices (i.e. 37 lei per
gigacalorie) Romania's sales estimates are:
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985
46.3    50.9    55.4    57.5    62.1    67.0    72.3    77.6
3.         Other operating revenues include:
(a)  Income from sales of steam, industrial water and ash; and
(b)  Revenues from the manufacturing/repair enterprises.
4.         Other Income includes net income of the distribution construction
units (Santier Constructu Montaj - SCM) which are self-accounting and inde-
pendent from the enterprises.
5.         Operating Expenses
(a)  Operation, maintenance and administration expenses are based on
the average cost per unit sold estimated by the MEE as follows
(in lei per kWh);
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985
.076    .074    .075    .090    .085    .083    .083    .082
No escalation in costs has been provided for since prices are
fixed. Savings expected to be achieved through reduction of
losses and increased efficiency will be passed on in the former
of higher benefits to workers.

ANNEX 3.1

(b) Purchased power comes from three distinct sources:
(i) imports from neighboring countries with whom trans-
mission lines are interconnected;
(ii)  surplus power from auto-producers largely that of the
Ministries of Chemical Industry and Heavy Machinery
which generate power for heating purposes; and
(iii)  electricity generated during the commissioning of new
plant (operating costs are capitalized after off-
setting revenues received).
(c)  Fuel costs are based on MEE estimates as follows (in lei per
kWh sold).
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985
.136    .140    .141    .147    .148    .148    .146    .145
No escalation in costs has been provided for since prices are
fixed.  Fuel prices used by the MEE are:
(i) lignite, 103-109 lei per ton;
(ii) brown coal, 122-146 lei per ton;
(iii) coal, 264-396 lei per ton;
(iv) bituminous shale, 101 lei per ton;
(v) crude oil, 414 lei per ton; and
(vi) natural gas, 200 lei per thousand cubic meters.
(d)  Depreciation is calculated using the conventional straight-line
method. The following annual average percentage rates of depre-
ciation which were based on MEE's estimates, have been used:
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985
2.41%   2.45%   2.43%   2.44%   2.39%   2.36%   2.32%   2.34%
The above figures include depreciation on the assets of the
manufacturing/repair enterprises, but not on the distribution
construction units. Depreciation on assets used by the dis-
tribution construction units which operate within each distri-
bution enterprise is not included since these units are self-
accounting.

ANNEX 3.1
Page 3 of 4
6.   Interest
Interest and commitment fees on the existing IBRD loans have been
provided for acc.rding to the terms of the loans. In the case of the pro-
posed loan, a rate of 7-1/2% has been assumed. Interest has been charged to
work-in-progress up to the commissioning dates for the Bank financed projects.
There exists the possibility that interest and commitment fees on IBRD loans
will be financed from Investment Bank credits until the plants are commis-
sioned. These credits would be on the same terms as the Bank loans. After
commissioning they would be repaid from income earned by the Projects. How-
ever, since these arrangements have not been confirmed all interest charges
are assumed to be financed by the MEE. This was the procedure adopted for
earlier Bank loans for power.
B.   Balance Sheet
7.   Fixed Assets
Assets are valued in respect of their foreign content when financed
from the proceeds of a Bank loan at the existing agreed conversion rate for
traded goods plus the duty applicable except where items manufactured or
similar to those manufactured in Romania are imported in which case they will
be valued according to the Romanian catalogue price (internal prices) plus
duty. However, they no longer use the Romanian internal price for goods manu-
factured in Romania which are financed from the loan but the foreign trade
price converted at the current conversion rate for traded goods. All other
fixed assets are valued at construction cost. Investments made by other
Ministries and vice versa, as they are generally not known, have been ignored.
It is expected they would largely offset each other. Net fixed assets in
service correspond to the total of equity and borrowings.
8.   Work in Progress
Finance for capital work in progress comes from three sources:
internal cash generation, state budget allocations and investment creditors.
The sum of these sources is equal to the work-in-progress figure in each year
of the forecasts.
9.   Current Assets and Current Liabilities
Forecasts are based on estimates projected by the MEE. Undistri-
buted benefits at year end have been included under accounts payable -
operations and enterprise current balances are included under accounts
receivable.
10. Sources of Working Capital
Funds are provided to each enterprise by the National Bank for work-
ing capital to meet costs of production. They take two forms; a working
capital fund which is fixed annually based on the minimum "normal" working



- 45 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 4 of 4
capital required during the year and short-term loans which are drawn as
required to meet any excess. Short-term loans are made available from the
National Bank at rates of interest around 2-5% for periods up to a maximum
of one year.  They are repaid from benefits.
C.   Sources and Applications of Funds
11.       Benefits reinvested is the balance remaining to meet debt service
and internal requirements after deducting benefits distributed from operating
and other income. Benefits distributed comprise: state budget allocations,
annual bonus distribution to workers, increase in working capital funds, pay-
ments for modernization of plant, social welfare and the reserve fund. New
procedures for the distribution of benefits have been outlined but their
impact is not reflected in these forecasts.
12. Depreciation
Similarly, with depreciation, an assumption was made that all depre-
ciation moneys paid to the Investment Bank by the enterprises of the Indus-
trial Central would be reinvested in the sector. It is expected that depre-
ciation will, in future, be retained by the enterprises and distributed accor-
ding to the new procedures for distribution of benefits. However, in the case
of fixed assets that have reached the end of their useful life, depreciation
charges are no longer made. This is in accordance with revised procedures and
rates introduced from January 1, 1977.
13.       Sales of Scrap are derived chiefly from materials used on investment
projects. These funds are paid directly to the National Bank and are not
treated as income in the income statement.
14.       The construction requirements and sources of funds included in the
sources and applications of funds statement relate only to centrally planned
investments. Movements in working capital are not planned beyond one year
and decentralized investments (for example: most distribution construction)
are excluded since the MEE has no reliable means of determining their extent.

CHAPTER IV
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Least-Cost Alternative
4.01      The Project is the next step of generation in MEE's least-cost
development program in line with Romania's aims to maximize utilization of
available lignite and keep nuclear capacity to a reasonable minimium (para
1.16).
Economic Rate of Return
4.02       The incremental supplies of electricity to consumers represent the
main benefits of the Project, but in the first few years of operation there are
also fuel savings through substitution of Project output for generation from
older, less efficient plants (Annex 4.1). The reduced electricity rates intro-
duced by Government decree in 1977 understate the value of the incremental
sales, since prior to 1977 consumers had demonstrated that they were willing
to pay the higher rates then in effect for comparable quantities of elec-
tricity. The 1976 average revenue of 0.322 lei/kWh is therefore regarded as
a more adequate measure of consumers' willingness to pay than the current aver-
age revenue of 0.237 lei/KWh resulting from the lower rates in effect since
January 1, 1977. The resulting economic rate of return is at least 6.4%.
This figure is comparable to the base case economic rate of return calculated
for the previous power loans for Romania: (i) Riul Mare-Retezat, 6.5%, and
(ii) Turceni I, 8.6%. For Turceni II, the rate of return is sensitive to
changes in average revenue. A 10% decrease in average revenue drops the rate
of return from 6.4% to 2.5%. On the other hand, a 10% increase in Project
capital costs drops the rate of return only from 6.4% to 5.4%.
4.03      The return on investment for the Project calculated in accordance
with the above methods cannot be used to judge the efficiency of resource
allocation in Romania nor the extent to which tariff levels succeed in convey-
ing to power consumers the value of the resource inputs used for production of
electricity. Allocation of resources in Romania is not based on prices that
reflect market scarcities but is based on a material balance technique.
Available resources are allocated in accordance with the production needs to
meet the objectives of the development plan. Prices in Romania are set by
the Government's Committee for Prices and are used to measure performance of
productive enterprises and the degree to which they achieve plan targets.

ROMANIA
SECOND TURCENI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Assumptions Used for Calculation Economic Rate of Return
1.   Measurable Benefits
These refer to the segment of the Project benefits that are measure-
able in money terms. Two streams of measurable benefits are used in the
analysis: (a) the revenue accruing from the sale of output, and (b) the
economic value of the fuel saved (Table 4.1).
(a)  Revenue Accruing from Sales of Output:  The average revenue
(ratio of revenue from sales and net electricity sold) calculated
at pre-1977 rates is used as a proxy for the consumers' willing-
ness to pay. The reduced electricity rates introduced by Govern-
ment decree in 1977 understate the value of these benefits, since
prior to 1977 consumers had demonstrated their willingness to pay
the higher rates then in effect for comparable quantities of elec-
tricity.
(b)  Fuel Savings:  While the Project is intended primarily to help
meet system load growth, Turceni II capacity will be added in
blocks of generation larger than required just for that purpose
during the first three years of Project operation (1981-1983).
Therefore, during that period some of the Turceni II output will
result in displacement of generation from older, less-efficient
plants (Table 4.2) as determined through economic dispatch of
available system generation, with corresponding savings in fuel
costs. These savings would be the difference between the cost of
the additional lignite required by Turceni (0.154 lei/kWh) and
the value of the reduction in fuel consumption at the displaced
plant (0.316 lei/kWh).
2.   Measuraele Costs
The measurable costs consist of two categories: fixed costs and
variable costs. The former does include the capital cost and the cost of
replacing the capital equipment. The latter encompasses all costs that vary
with the level of output such as lubricants, fuel, operation and maintenance
costs, etc.



- 51 -
ANNEX 4.1
Page 2 of 2
(a) Fixed Costs: These include two streams, the costs of construct-
ing the power plant and the costs of erecting the segment of the
transmission network that would connect the power plant to the
national power system.
(b) Variable Costs: These include three streams: the operation and
maintenance costs, the fuel costs, and the costs of transmission
and distribution.
(i) Operation and Maintenance Costs: The cost of operation
and maintenance per unit of output (kWh) used is 0.04
lei (US$0.0022/kWh). This is based on the historically
observed operation and maintenance costs for the entire
thermal generating system in Romania.
(ii) Fuel Costs: The Project would be fueled by domestically
produced lignite. The location and quality of Romania's
lignite deposits render their development for export un-
economic. However, these deposits are sufficient to meet
Romania's future lignite requirements (power secto and
other industries) for approximately the next 60 years.
For the analysis, the price of lignite is set equal to
the incremental cost of extracting and delivering an addi-
tional ton of lignite to the power plant (107 lei/ton,
based on 1977 Romanian internal prices which were provided
by Mr. P. Rickes, consultant to the Bank).
(iii) Cost of Transmission and Distribution: The cost of trans-
mission and distribution at each voltage level was not
readily available, consequently, a proxy for that cost was
derived for the analysis. A fixed cost for transmission
and distribution of 0.0246 lei (US$0.00137) was attributed
to each unit of output (kWh) produced by the power plant.
(iv) Transmission and Distribution Losses: 6% of net MEE deliv-
eries to the system.

CHAPTER V
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following prin-
cipal issues:
(a) the Government and the Investment Bank confirmed that they
will provide semi-annually lignite production figures for
the preceeding 6 months and estimated production for the
6 months immediately following (para 2.04);
(b) the Investment Bank has undertaken to take measures for
increasing the US$8.9 million ceiling on foreign exchange
expenditures for the Project if it becomes necessary
(para 2.15);
(c) the Government clarified that the Project cost estimate
includes import duties and taxes (para 2.05);
(d) the Government confirmed that it plans for the power
sector to generate 30% of its own investment capital
up to 1985 (para 3.11);
(e) the Government and the Investment Bank have confirmed
that they will furnish to the Bank additional indicators
on the sector's operating performance and efficiency
(para 3.11); and
(f) the Government and the Investment Bank have confirmed that
the audit report for the power sector will be based on
the consolidated accounts of the two power centrals
(para 3.12).
5.02      Submission to the Bank of a copy of the technical and economic
indicators for the Project would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.03      Agreement having been reached on the principal issues, the Project
is suitable for a Bank loan of U$$70 million to the Investment Bank with
the guarantee of the Republic of Romania. An appropriate term for the loan
is 15 years, including 3 years of grace. The loan is expected to become
effective within 3 months of loan signing.
