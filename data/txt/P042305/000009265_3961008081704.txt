MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
MALAWI
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1. I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation for a proposed
Develo pment Credit to the Republic of Malawi for SDR15.1 million, the equivalent of US$22.5
million , on standard International Development Association (IDA) terms with a maturity of 40
years. The Credit will help to finance urgently needed primary school activities under the overall
umbrella of the Government's Education Sector Policy and Investment Framework Paper.
Government and Beneficiaries will contribute US$1.2 million equivalent and US$1.6 million
equivalent respectively.
2. Background. The Government of Malawi has made significant progress in developing the
education system since Malawi gained its independence in 1964. The World Bank has been
actively involved in assisting Malawi's education sector, with the first project approved in 1967.
Six projects have been completed so far; one project (the Second Education Sector Project) is
ongoing. These projects primarily focused on expanding primary and secondary education,
teacher tTaining, and strengthening management and planning. Although Malawi's education
system has benefited considerably from the assistance of the Bank and other donors in the past,
that support has not produced the desired impact because a well-conceived and comprehensive
policy framework and coordination has not been in place.
3. In 1994 the Bank began preparing a new operation, the Third Education Sector Credit (TESC),
which will pursue an integrated sector approach to support the Government's program for the
development and improvement of the sector as a whole. The approach is outlined in the Sector
Policy and Investment Framework Paper which emphasizes primary education and improvement
in school quality and girls' participation. Its ambitious targets include achieving a 90% primary
school net enrollment for every district; reduction of primary teacher:pupil ratio from 1:70 at
present to 1:45 by 2005; and provision of one textbook per primary pupil for each of the three
main subjects (Mathematics, English and General Studies). The principal measures for achieving
these targets are higher budgetary allocations to education in general and to the primary sub-sector
in particular, greater community and private sector participation in construction and operation of
schools, and increased construction and focus on community schools (Grades 1-4) combined with
a social mobilization campaign aimed at girls and their parents. For post-primary education, the
Government envisages more day schooling and increased cost recovery.
4. Project Rationale. While the TESC was being prepared, the new democratically-elected
Government announced that all primary school fees would be abolished in October, 1994. While
this action was consistent with the Government's overall goal of poverty reduction through
economic growth and investment in human capital, it led to an education crisis caused by an influx
of over one million additional students into the primary system and the hiring of nearly 20,000
new teachers from among secondary school leavers. These hastily recruited young people were
given only three weeks of "induction" training before being posted to schools. Retired teachers
were called back to help with the crisis. Government has estimated that about 38,000 additional
classrooms will be required to accommodate this influx of children if they do not drop out from
'Total cost includes US$1.4 million allocated to Project Preparation Facility (PPF)

the system. At present classrooms are grossly overcrowded and thousands of children take their
lessons in various temporary facilities and in the open air. While access to schooling has
increased, the quality of education has fallen: many young students have virtually no learning
materials and only a few young untrained teachers to guide them. Unless these pressing needs are
quickly addressed, there is a risk of losing the public's enthusiastic support for primary education.
5. At the request of the Government, the Bank agreed to 'fast-track' urgently needed primary
school activities of the TESC under the overall umbrella of the Government's Education Sector
Policy and Investment Framework. The Malawi Primary Education Project (PEP), amounting to
approximately $US25.2 million, will have three major components: construction of classrooms,
provision of teaching and learning materials, and implementation of selected activities for
strengthening teacher skills. These urgently needed components are well-focused, simple, ready,
and capable of being delivered quickly. The Government is highly committed and enthusiastic as
shown by its sector policy, and the increase in the share of education of its total budget (from
about 8% in 1988 to about 24% in 1995 for the recurrent budget). The share of recurrent
education expenditure allocated to primary education increased from 45% in 1990/91 to 71% in
1994/95.
6. Project Objectives. The objectives of this fast-track operation are to: (i) ensure that the
quantitative gains in enrollments are maintained through retaining newly-enrolled children in the
system; and (ii) improve the quality of primary education through providing teaching and learning
materials and pedagogical support to, and in-service training for, teachers so that the education
provided will produce real learning gains.
7. Project Description. The three main project components, all focused on primary education,
are: (i) primary classroom construction; (ii) pedagogical support and in-service teacher training;
and (iii) provision of teaching and learning materials.
8. Primary Classroom  Construction (US$11.8 million).  The project would finance the
construction and provision of furniture for 1,600 primary classrooms. Six hundred of these will be
in 75 new sites (new primary schools) mainly in rural areas; the remainder will expand especially
overcrowded schools. PEP will finance the construction of an administration block, two teacher
houses, two pit latrines and a borehole in each new school, as well as the planting of sapling shade
trees at all new sites to provide shade for the many hot months. Classroom construction will
follow the shell model, a low-cost high-quality construction design. Though new to Malawi, the
model has proved successful in other parts of Africa (e.g. Ghana). MOE, through a private and
independent construction management organization (PICMO), will put up shells (foundation, steel
columns, and roof), which communities will complete with in-fills using blocks made with
hydraform machines, or other local materials. This shell can be constructed very quickly,
permitting school-children to move from their "classroom" in the open air, to the shade and shelter
of a classroom shell, even before the in-fill is completed. District officials and NGOs will help to
mobilize the community in completing the classroom shells. To ensure that this is attainable,
orientation sessions of 2-3 days are being held for key officials from each district, and community
leaders to encourage a sense of ownership by the communities.
9. Pedagogical Support and In-service Teacher Training (US$4.7 million). The long-term goal
of this component is to improve the learning in Malawi's primary schools by establishing a teacher
support system that provides regular, sustained assistance to every school and to every teacher.
This component will provide support to: (a) the Malawi Integrated In-service Teacher Education



3
Program (MIITEP) for certification of untrained teachers, and (b) pedagogical support for all
primary teachers. MOE has involved ODA, GTZ/KfW and the Bank in planning this program.
These other donors have agreed to provide parallel financing for activities to supplement those
being supported by the Bank. The activities being financed by these other donors include: training
and support for Regional Education Office staff, District and Deputy-district Education Officers,
Primary Education Advisers, head-teachers and deputy heads; construction of resource centers;
strengthening of MIE; and the provision of technical assistance. PEP would finance:
*  Preparatory activities for implementing the Teacher Development Program (TDP) including:
(i) setting-up an apex coordinating body for the primary education TDP; (ii) designing a
curriculum; (iii) developing training manuals, modules and handbooks; (iv) training trainers;
and (v) staff development. A campaign to inform all key players about the program and their
responsibilities has been launched with PPF financing.
*  Planning and preparation of course materials and the implementation of the MIITEP aimed at
about 20,000 untrained teachers. MIITEP will start in January, 1997 with 3,000 students on a
three-month residential course. Thereafter, the students will be deployed to schools and
continue their training for 21 months through sub-zonal seminars and supervised teaching in
their schools. A formative evaluation will be conducted after three consecutive residential
courses. To be certified, students will be required to write a final examination in addition to
writing a specified number of projects and assignments.
*  School and sub-zonal in-service training for all primary teachers. Each resource center and
school will be provided with packages of teaching and learning materials.
*  Provision of motorcycles for all the 315 primary education advisers to increase their mobility
in visiting schools and providing assistance to teachers.
10. Learning Materials and Textbook-related Activities (US$3.1 million). The ongoing Bank-
financed Second Education Sector Credit has a major component for the development, production
and distribution of textbooks to all primary school grades, with a planned target of one textbook
for two students and one guide per teacher in four subjects - Mathematics, Chichewa, English, and
General Studies. Additional needs for textbooks resulting from the massive influx of children into
the system in 1994 are being covered by parallel support from CIDA. PEP would concentrate on:
a) acquiring and distributing basic learning materials, including exercise books, pencils, slates,
chalk and boards; b) furnishing book storage rooms in new primary schools; c) strengthening the
Supplies Unit of MOE including the computerization of book-distribution operations and
provision of associated training and technical assistance; d) training teachers and primary
education advisers on the effective use of textbooks; and e) evaluating the content and durability
of textbooks developed under the IDA-financed Second Education Sector Credit for possible
revision under TESC.
11. Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at US$25.2 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at 48% (US$12.4 million)
of the total cost. The IDA Credit would finance 89.0% of the total project cost (US$22.5 million);
Government and communities would finance about 4.8% and 6.2%, respectively (approximately
US$1.2 million and US$1.6 million equivalent, respectively). Parallel financing totaling about
US$27.0 million equivalent is being provided by KfW, ODA, CIDA and GTZ for the financing of
urgently needed supplementary activities under the three main components of PEP. A summary of



4
the project costs and financing plan is provided in Schedule A. Procurement arrangements and
the disbursement schedule are summarized in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing steps
and the status of Bank group operations in Malawi are provided in Schedule C and Schedule D,
respectively. Staff Appraisal Report No. 15127-MAI and Map IBRD No. 27693 are attached.
12. Project Management and Implementation. Day-to-day management and implementation of
the project will be carried out by the relevant units of the Ministry of Education. The Education
Development Management Unit (EDMU), recently created under the direct responsibility of the
Permanent Secretary, will coordinate project activities, administrative, procurement, and financial
matters, contacts with IDA and inter-agency coordination. Management of the civil works
program and related furniture and equipment needs will be delegated to PICMO, under contract
to MOE, and following a procedural manual acceptable to IDA. The provision of teaching and
learning materials will be handled and coordinated by the Supplies Unit in the Ministry of
Education; the implementation of the Pedagogical Support and In-service Teacher Training
Program will be undertaken by MOE's newly established Coordinating Unit for the Primary
Education Teacher Development Program.
13. Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. Unlike previous projects which provided ad-hoc
interventions, and thus resulted in a limited impact, this project, and the TESC will share in the
financing of a time-slice of the Government's overall program as specified in MOE's draft SPFP.
Given this framework, the projects should be more effective in improving the sector. Lessons
learnt from past projects have been incorporated in designing this operation. The design of
classroom construction has been modified to reduce construction time and cost and maximize
community participation. The school designs will consist of a shell, which communities will
complete with in-fills. This process is expected to generate a strong sense of school ownership by
the local communities. Given that communities did not participate as fully as expected under the
First Education Sector Credit, as reported in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR),
community participation under PEP will not be taken for granted. A vigorous public awareness
campaign and community mobilization activities as well as training for district and community
leaders, are planned. An incentive mechanism for communities to participate fully has been built
into the project by making the provision and delivery of furniture and learning materials
conditional on the completion of the in-fills. Project implementation will be expedited by
modifying the contracting arrangements so that contracts are awarded through a private and
independent construction management organization (PICMO) rather than via the existing Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) which is being phased-out. Textbook distribution will also be
privatized rather than being undertaken expensively by the PIU.
14. Rationale for IDA Support. Poverty alleviation and human resource development are at the
core of IDA's strategy in Malawi because both are essential elements of the country's
development approach. This project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) in Malawi, presented to the Board on June 9, 1994 (Report No. P6236-MAI). The major
objective of the CAS is sustainable poverty reduction through economic growth with equity. To
attain this objective the strategy focuses on: (i) human capital development through improved
education, health and other social services; (ii) expanding employment opportunities through a
liberal environment for private sector entrepreneurship and initiative, expanded access to financial
capital, and policies and programs that encourage labor-intensive activities and participation of
women; (iii) enhancing agricultural productivity for poor, small farmers and ensuring sustainable
use of land resources; and (iv) introduction of an integrated family-planning strategy to curb
population growth and reduce fertility rates. Education is central to all four dimensions of the



5
strategy and primary education is among the factors most critical for poverty reduction. IDA has
been associated with Malawi's education system for the last thirty years. IDA has incorporated
lessons learned in project preparation and implementation during those years and is now well
positioned to assist the implementation of the Government's sector development plan. PEP will
provide timely assistance to alleviate the extreme pressure the primary education system faces at
present.
15. Agreed Actions. Key issues critical for project implementation and sustainability have been
identified, and appropriate actions to deal with them have been agreed with GOM. These include:
(i) Limited implementation capacity: To deal with implementation capacity constraints, a
completely new arrangement involving the private sector is envisaged, along with MOE's newly
created EDMU to ensure quality control and oversight. GOM has selected a private and
independent construction management organization (PICMO) to manage and supervise the PEP
construction program. PICMO's selection was a condition of Board presentation. In addition,
during negotiations, GOM gave assurances that it will: maintain EDMU with adequate
professional and support staff under terms of reference acceptable to IDA and consult with IDA on
any changes in EDMU staffing or responsibilities; and submit semi-annual progress reports,
annual audit reports, and an implementation completion report within four months of completing
the project. A mid-term review will be scheduled during the second year of implementation.
Furthermore, MOE is preparing a Project Implementation Manual to assist the various
implementing units in preparing their tasks. As a condition of Credit Effectiveness, GOM has
agreed to submit a copy of the completed Project Implementation Manual to IDA; (ii) Inadequate
procurement planning and processes: Implementation may slow down unless satisfactory
procurement planning and processes are in place.  During appraisal, EDMU  prepared a
procurement plan which identifies each procurement package with its estimated value,
procurement method, and time schedule. The plan will be used by PICMO in monitoring actual
procurement performance, and will be updated on a quarterly basis and included in a written
progress report to IDA. Standard IDA bidding documents will be used for ICB, while GOM
prepared NCB bidding documents, which the appraisal mission reviewed and found satisfactory;
(iii) Need to use transparent and poverty-focused criteria for classroom and school site
selection: During negotiations, MOE provided a list of districts in which new classrooms will be
constructed and the total number of classrooms to be constructed in each. These were selected on
the basis of a ranking of the districts using a formula that combined poverty level, enrollment
ratios, gender disparities and pupil:classroom ratios across the districts. The Government has
submitted to IDA, as a condition of Board presentation, the list of sites selected in consultation
with communities (within each district) where new schools will be constructed as well as the
names of the existing schools to be expanded, ensuring that these list contains at least 80% of the
total number of classrooms to be constructed under PEP; and (iv) Severe financial constraints
coupled with the problem of financing the recurrent costs of GOM's educational development
program: Some measures envisaged in the SPFP include increased cost recovery at post-primary
education levels, increased community involvement, cost-saving measures such as more secondary
day schooling and double-shifting, encouragement of the private sector, and the choice of least-
cost alternatives in project design. It will also be necessary to improve the efficiency of
expenditures and of delivery systems. The Government has submitted to IDA, as a condition of
Board presentation, a prioritized summary of its policies in the sector as a whole in a manner that
demonstrates that a critical assessment of trade-offs and policy options has been considered to
arrive at programs and targets that are affordable and sustainable. Meanwhile, donor financing of
recurrent expenditures (on an increasing or constant basis) in the short-run will provide some
respite until Malawi's growth is more sustainable.

16. Poverty Category. The project is part of the core poverty program for Malawi and is
included in the program of targeted interventions. Poverty in Malawi is widespread and severe.
Reducing poverty is a central policy objective of the new Government which in 1994 initiated the
Poverty Alleviation Program. The Bank is assisting the Government's poverty alleviation efforts.
The major objective of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi is sustainable
poverty reduction through economic growth with equity. This project would contribute to poverty
reduction by improving access to and quality of primary education.  In the selection of
communities and districts where classrooms will be constructed under this project, the level of
poverty was prominent among the five major criteria used. The main beneficiaries of this project
will be primarily children in poor communities in mainly rural and peri-urban areas.
17. Environmental Impact. The project's environmental category is C. Minimal environmental
risks are foreseen. The 75 new schools to be constructed will be small and will be dispersed in
rural areas; most of the new classrooms will be provided by expanding existing schools, with little
detrimental environmental effect. The use of blocks made with hydraform machines (which apply
pressure on cement-soil mixtures) and not burnt bricks would reduce the need for firewood and
would also not be detrimental to the environment. The planting of sapling shade trees at all new
schools will have positive effects on the environment.
18. Program Objective Category. PEP will expand access to and improve the quality of primary
education, a cornerstone of poverty reduction and the foundation for human resource development.
Through its specific targeting of the poor, PEP constitutes a program of targeted interventions
(PTI).
19. Participatory Approach. In developing and implementing the Bank's education strategy a
feedback from systematic client consultation (SCC) has been playing an important role. As the
findings in a 1995 SCC exercise carried out in the country show,2 the need for schools was ranked
by the communities as one of two top priorities (the other was credit). Many communities have
been participating in the implementation of school construction, through labor and monetary
contribution, and some have generated, managed and implemented their projects without
assistance from outside. Communities consistently ranked school committees as organizations
valued for their ability to deliver the needed services. This seems to validate the contention that
communities have the provision of schools as their top priority and that with some facilitation,
they will be enthusiastic participants. PEP is combining a supply orientation (to provide a quick
response to this high demand for education by the communities and to facilitate their involvement)
with a demand-driven approach (through the active involvement of the communities). An
information, education, and communication (IEC) campaign and community mobilization are
planned while some training for community members and leaders, and district officials has
already begun.
20. NGO Involvement. Non-governmental organizations have increasingly become active in
Malawi recently, due largely to the newly-instituted democratic environment which has opened
doors for NGO activities. Most NGOs have a comparative advantage in the social sectors, given
their proximity to grassroots levels, and also have existing capacity (though not nationwide) to
deal with community-based assignments. NGOs will be increasingly called upon to play a major

communities in all three regions were surveyed.

role in the implementation of PEP especially in the areas of community mobilization,
sensitization, capacity building and training for leadership and transformation, selecting good
caliber people, and putting into place monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. This project will
finance some of these activities through NGO technical assistance and the participation of NGOs
as resource persons for training and capacity building efforts at the community level. NGOs will
be encouraged to bid for construction contracts, preferably on a joint venture basis with local
contractors, particularly in areas where they may have comparative advantage such as the
construction of boreholes, pit latrines, landscaping and external works.
21. Project Benefits. The major benefits of the project would be increased coverage and
improved quality of primary education. Over a three-year period, the project would increase
effective access to education (as distinct from simply access to a school) through the construction
of classrooms to provide shelter and adequate learning conditions for about 100,000 children
currently taking their lessons in the open air. Most of these classrooms will be built in rural and
underserved peri-urban areas. Qualitative improvements, through better-trained teachers and
adequate supply of teaching and learning materials, would improve learning for all primary school
children (around 3 million children) and reduce repetition and drop-out rates. Efficiency gains
attributable to reductions in repetition and drop-out rates should result in a reduction of
education's share of the GOM total recurrent budget. If average repetition rates drop from their
present level of over 15% to 5% over the next decade, then all other things being equal efficiency
gains will reduce education's annual share of GOM's total recurrent budget by an average of 3 to 4
percentage points.  The project would support innovative measures such as school-based
supervision and delegation of pedagogical support from the central ministry to regional and
departmental levels to make the system more responsive to local needs. Local communities would
be required to participate financially and in-kind in primary school construction and maintenance,
so reducing the burden on the Government budget and increasing ownership and sustainability.
Furthermore, a cost-benefit study using the Malawi 1990/91 household survey data, illustrates that
the private and social rates of return to primary education in Malawi are quite high, estimated at
about 23% and 20%, respectively3.
22. Project Sustainability. Donor support in the education sector is critical until a sustainable
growth path has been established. In the long-run, sustainability of the sector needs to be
enhanced. The sector program will develop a strategy - with quantifiable benchmarks - to lower
recurrent expenditures to more sustainable levels. Government commitment and the involvement
of communities and the private sector in financing and implementation of the project, will enhance
the project's sustainability in the long run. Efficiency gains as a result of quality improvements,
and the expansion of day schooling (instead of government-subsidized boarding) as well as
increased cost-recovery at post-primary education levels will lead to substantial savings and
mobilization of increased resources, and will make the system more affordable and sustainable.
23. Project Risks. The main risks the project faces are four-fold. First, the Government's
capacity to rapidly implement the fast track activities and the overall sector program is not
assured.  For the civil works components, this risk would be addressed by transferring
responsibility for implementing construction from the MOE to PICMO and communities, and
limiting the Government's role to overseeing and quality control. Second, the capacity of the
construction industry in Malawi to build a relatively large number of classrooms quickly is not
assured. To counter this risk, an analysis was undertaken to assist the Government to assess this

8
capacity. It became clear that the traditional way of building (small contractors using bricks and
mortar, and managed by PIU) put a serious cap on the number of classrooms that could be built in
a year. This led to the shell classroom scheme, which has been discussed and analyzed with
construction practitioners (architects and builders) and has been successfully piloted under PPF
financing. Third, the innovative programs proposed under the project, in particular those to
enhance decentralized school-based supervision, may not fully reach their objectives. These risks
would be addressed by careful monitoring and annual reviews of progress, expecting that these
programs may need to be modified during implementation. Finally, there are macro-economic
4
risks. The loss in revenues from the abolition of fees and the rapid increases in education
expenditures (caused by the massive influx of students and the hiring of teachers) have
exacerbated an already difficult macro-economic situation. The Government is committed to
human resource development as a means to achieve its objective of poverty reduction. The major
challenge now is how to do more with less resources. GOM has put the emphasis on prudent
fiscal management at the economy-wide level, better prioritization, and the need for efficiency and
financial sustainability measures at the sector level. In the Bank's dialogue with GOM, the
challenge for fiscal sustainability is being discussed in the context of a Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) which is coordinated by the Ministry of Finance. Under the MTEF, fiscal
policies involving expenditure restraint, prioritization and revenue mobilization are being
explored. At the sectoral level, a simulation model for education has been developed. This will
assist MOE to assess the viability of alternative efficiency, cost-saving and resource mobilization
options. We expect that economic growth will increase in the next couple of years. There is some
risk, however, that if economic growth prospects are not achieved, poor economic performance
may make it difficult to achieve sustainability with regard to financing the necessary recurrent
expenditures. To mitigate this risk, donor financing of some recurrent costs on a constant or
increasing basis for about five years under TESC is being considered. After that period, we expect
financing on a declining basis to be possible.
24. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

wage data are not available.
Main Beneficiaries and Nature of Benefits
The main beneficiaries would be rural and urban households with primary students. There would be an
overall improvement in the quality of primary education through wider distribution of teaching and learning
materials, better trained teachers, improved teacher support and supervision, and increased number of
classrooms. In the selection of districts and communities to locate new schools and for expansion of existing
schools, transparent criteria have been used, with a particular focus on the poor, and gender disparities in
primary school enrollment. These criteria include: poverty levels, enrollment ratios, girls' enrollment ratios,
student:classroom ratios, and classroom construction activities already underway.

PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Disbursement Performance
The Bank's portfolio in Malawi includes 17 ongoing operations. While some improvement in
project implementation has been recorded, the Government's limited capacity to implement projects remains
a major constraint. One issue observed in project implementation is disbursement, slower than originally
anticipated in the SAR. The overall disbursements (as of November 28, 1995) were about 35% of the
approved credits. The major generic problems in disbursements are (a) procedures; (b) frequent turnover of
disbursement staff in implementing agencies; (c) lack of counterpart funds; and (d) lack of staff incentives.
On the Bank's side, disbursements are slowed by: (a) staff delays in procurement approval; and (b) project
budget issues not being resolved at project negotiations. To remedy these problems, several disbursement
workshops have been held. In addition, the following actions were taken beginning in FY93: (i)
disbursement workshops were conducted in Malawi (and will continue to be held yearly) for disbursement
officers working in Government and in parastatals; (ii) Bank disbursement officers have visited Malawi
periodically to assist ministries/agencies in resolving pending disbursement issues and clearing the backlog;
and (iii) departmental procurement specialists have provided significant assistance to local procurement
authorities to speed the procurement process.
