 MAINSTREAMING MARKET-BASED INSTRUMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
                   MANAGEMENT PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed changes extend the closing date of both the loan and the grant
“Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management? from July
31, 2012, to March 31, 2014, and reallocate funds from components 1a and 3 to
components 1b and 2 of the GEF grant TF056666 as per the request submitted by the
Government of Costa Rica on the 14th of June, 2012. The extension of the closing date
seeks to accommodate the project’s two-year delay in effectiveness to allow for the
sustainable and regular capitalization of Costa Rica’s Payment for Environmental
Services (PSA) program and Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS). The restructuring will
allow the project to complete outstanding studies and finance administrative costs for the
FBS not foreseen at project appraisal. There are no changes in the components. The
extension will allow the project’s PDO and GEO to be achieved.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project loan and grant were approved by the Board of Directors on June 8,
2006, and became effective only on July 31, 2008, the delay caused by a bottleneck in the
National Assembly resulting from debate of the DR-CAFTA Free Trade Treaty with the
United States. Moreover, the timing of the effectiveness date relative to the executing
agency’s (FONAFIFO) fiscal year then precluded use of project resources for most of the
first year.

3.      Despite this two-year delay, the project is making excellent progress towards its
development objectives, which are expected to be met by the proposed closing date of the
project. The national PSA program, operational since 1997, has already achieved many of
the project indicators, despite only having disbursed approximately 54% of the IBRD
loan. The project has also successfully capitalized the FBS, which will finance protected
areas with high levels of biodiversity that cannot be covered under other modalities.

4.      The outstanding challenge for the program is a combination of ensuring the
sustainability and continuity of the area under conservation contracts and improving the
efficiency of the program. A challenge for the PSA program is ensuring that a consistent
and sufficient flow of resources is available to make conservation payments, since each
new contract implies a five-year financial commitment. This complicates the budgeting
process for FONAFIFO as their budget depends on revenues from the gasoline and water
taxes, and those revenues received must be spent each fiscal year. By extending the
project, FONAFIFO will be able to use project financing to help stabilize the number of
contracts and hectares of land under administration, reducing the dramatic annual swings

in area under conservation and administrative burdens that have characterized the
program to date due to uncertainties regarding budgeting. Furthermore, four studies are
being contracted (with drafted TORs) that cannot be contracted unless the closing date of
the project is extended.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

      Results/indicators

5.     Recognizing that many project indicators have been successfully met, the Bank
has revised and raised the targets expected at project closing for indicators one and four,
GEF indicator one, and intermediate indicators two and three of component two. These
changes and the progress to date are elaborated in Annex 1.

6.      As was also found in other countries (e.g. Mexico, Brazil), tracking the ‘improved
efficiency of the environmental services program, as measured by indices of services
generated per dollar spent’ (PDO Indicator 3) is extremely difficult. This is primarily due
to the technical difficulty of quantifying the changes in the level of environmental service
provision. The lack of an M&E system makes it even more challenging to track this.
Therefore this indicator will be dropped.

7.      Likewise, GEF Indicator 1, ‘effective biodiversity conservation in globally
significant areas measured by vegetation cover and indicator species of conservation
interest’, has also proven difficult to measure and will be removed as a project indicator.
Given that the FBS will continue to finance biodiversity initiatives after project closure, a
study financed by the GEF grant will be carried out by the country’s premier biodiversity
research institution, INBio. The study will establish a baseline allowing FONAFIFO to
better calculate its biodiversity going forward, but this will not be measurable before
project closure.

8.      PDO indicator two (‘at least half of the newly-contracted area is financed by
funding from service users’ by the end of the project) needs to be revised downward from
its original target of 50%, in part because generating financing from service users has
proven much more challenging than expected (particularly so in the case of carbon
financing), but primarily because fuel tax revenues have increased dramatically due to the
increase in traffic, resulting in an automatic increase in government funding to the PSA
program. Thus user financing has covered only about 25% of new areas in the last two
years, despite having quadrupled since project implementation began. The changes in
government financing also suggest that an indicator based on share of total area is not the
most appropriate. The revised indicator will therefore be that ‘conservation of at least
35,000 ha is financed annually by financing from service users’ by the end of the project.
The target reflects a 10% increase over current levels (the average has been about 32,000
ha in the last two years), and a more than quadrupling of the area financed by funding
from service users since the start of the project (about 7,400 ha in 2008).

      Reallocation
                                             5
9.      The requested reallocation of funds to Category (2) will cover administrative fees
unforeseen at project appraisal which would otherwise need to be paid for by FBS
revenues. the administrative arrangements of the FBS were determined after project
approval and the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR) now manages the fund. The
BNCR charges a US$4,000/month commission for the fund’s administration, which the
reallocation of the grant proposes to finance. As reflected in the legal agreement
establishing the FBS, the BNCR, recognizing the importance of the capitalization of the
Fund and in the spirit of contributing to its biodiversity efforts, allowed for a two-year
grace period for administrative fees, which ended in May 2012. Now that the grace
period has ended, a request has been made to reallocate funds among categories of
expenditure to cover the $100,000 of administrative costs of the Fiduciary Agent
managing the Fund. It is expected that as the Fund capitalizes it will be able to generate
sufficient revenues from interest that it will be able to pay for these fees. The possibility
of hiring an asset manager is being explored.
10.     Category 2 will finance “Capitalization Payments?, including the administrative
costs of the fiduciary agent of the FBS. Additionally, considering the positive results
achieved under Component 1, which were achieved to a large extent with counterpart
funds, it is proposed that funds be reallocated to other activities under Component 1 and
2. These activities are to: (1) cover the operating costs for the Biodiversity Trust Fund;
(2) increase the capitalization of the FBS; and (3) complete proposed studies under
Component 2.

       Closing date

11.      The proposed extension is necessary in order to support FONAFIFO in stabilizing
the annual area under conservation at its target of 310,000 ha. The extension would also
make it much likelier that a large portion of the US$30 million loan would be disbursed
(which would be impossible under a shorter extension, except by exacerbating even
further the imbalance in area enrolled). Under reasonable assumptions of contract mixes,
it is likely that the entire loan would be disbursed.

                                               6
12.     The justification for this extension originates in the fluctuation of areas
conservation contracts due to the variation in the budget available to FONAFIFO year to
year. FONAFIFO receives an annual budget that corresponds to 3.5% of fuel tax
revenues and 25% of water tariff revenues in each given year; however most of its
conservation contracts have a duration of five years. Variations in funding levels from
one year to the next thus affect the ability to enroll new areas in subsequent years. Higher
than average funding in one year results in a large enrolled area which then consumes a
greater portion of the available budget in the subsequent four years of the contract and
when revenues fall, it reduces the amount of new area enrolled. This has meant that the
new area contracted has varied substantially from year to year (from as little as 25,000 ha
to as many as 75,000 ha). From a conservation perspective this is not ideal as there is no
assurance that the most valuable contracts can be renewed when they expire. This
fluctuation also results in a highly variable administrative and monitoring burden for
FONAFIFO.

      Implementation schedule

13.    The revised implementation schedule for the IBRD loan (see below) reviews the
revised disbursement schedule into the PSA fund.

      Safeguards

14.    The restructuring will not change any Project activities and therefore will not alter
the environmental or social safeguards category.

D. RECOMMENDATION
15.      Upon review of the proposed changes we feel confident that with the requested
extension the project will fully disburse and that the Action Plan laid forward will be
followed through. The team therefore recommends that the extension be granted in order
for this innovative project to be able to fully accomplish its objective.

Project Development Objective (PDO):
The Project Development Objective is to enhance the provision of environmental services of a national and global significance and secure their long-term sustainability through a scaled-up
payment for environmental services system in Costa Rica.

The Project Global Environmental Objective is to enhance the conservation of globally significant biodiversity and ensure its long-term sustainability by supporting the development and
implementation of market-based instruments to promote forest conservation in buffer zones of protected areas and biological corridors connecting them.

16.     Proceeds for Costa Rica, GEF Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for
Environmental Management Project, [TF 56666. 7388], P093384 will be reallocated as
follow:

    (including      audits),      non-

    operating costs under component
    two.

    non-consulting services, and
    training under Component 3


17.     The project was approved by the Board of Directors on June 8, 2006 and became
effective on July 31, 2008. Despite this two year delay, the project is making excellent
progress towards its development objectives, which are expected to be met by the
proposed closing date of the project. The national payment for environmental services
program, operational since 1997, has already seen the achievement of many of the project
indicators, despite only having an approximately 54% disbursement rate of the IBRD
loan. The project has also successfully capitalized the National Biodiversity Fund, which
will finance protected areas with high levels of biodiversity that cannot be covered under
other modalities.
18.     The outstanding challenge for the program is a combination of ensuring the
sustainability and continuity of hectares of PES contracts financed by the project and
improving the efficiency of the program. A challenge of the fund is ensuring that a
consistent and sufficient flow of resources is available to capitalize the fund seeing as
each new contract implies a five year financial commitment. By extending the project,
the PES fund will ideally be able to maintain a more regular number of contracts and
hectares of land under administration. Furthermore, a number of studies are being
contracted (with drafted TOR) but that cannot be processed unless the closing date of the
project is extended.
19.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to contract consulting services for 2012
and 2013, which are already foreseen in the project’s procurement plan but for which
more funds are needed to assess important studies related to FONAFIFO’s future. These
studies include a study on the Socioeconomic Impact of the Payment for Environmental
Service program, analytics related to the operation of the Sustainable Biodiversity Fund
and changes to the differentiated payment system.
20.     Given the costs assumed by FONAFIFO for the two years before the loan and
accompanying grant became effective, resources are reassigned to component 1b to
further capitalize the Sustainable Biodiversity Fund.
21.     Furthermore, the Banco de Costa Rica, the fiduciary agent for the FBS has
assessed a new fee structure since appraisal of the project and therefore funds are
reallocated to component 1a to cover approximately $100,000 of administrative fees
charged for the administration of the fund. The newly defined Category 2 will finance
“Capitalization Payments?, including the administrative costs of the fiduciary agent of the
FBS.

22.     The closing date for the Costa Rica Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for
Environmental Management Project, [Loan 7388 and Grant TF56666] P093384, will be
extended from July 31, 2012 until March 31, 2014. This will be the first extension of the
project.
23.     The project was approved by the Board of Directors on June 8, 2006 and became
effective on July 31, 2008. Despite this two year delay, the project is making excellent
progress towards its development objectives, which are expected to be met by the
proposed closing date of the project. The national payment for environmental services
program, operational since 1997, has already seen the achievement of many of the project
indicators, despite only having an approximately 54% disbursement rate of the IBRD
loan. The project has also successfully capitalized the National Biodiversity Fund, which
will finance protected areas that characterized by high levels of biodiversity but which
cannot be covered under other financing modalities.
24.     The proposed extension is necessary to ensure the fiscal sustainability of the
national Payment for Environmental Services project. One of the challenges facing
FONAFIFO is the trend of peaks and troughs in payments to beneficiaries (see annex
one). Each new PES contract signed implies a five year period of payments; however,
financing from the fuel and water tariffs is somewhat irregular and resources transferred
must be committed each fiscal year. A steady flow of financing from the IBRD loan will
ensure a steady disbursement schedule and the ability to continue adding hectares of land
to the project. It will also provide confidence in the sustainability of the PES fund in light
of the country’s fiscal crisis.
25.      The extension of the GEF grant will enable three pieces of analytical work to be
prepared. Their terms of reference have been drafted; however, they cannot be submitted
for ratification by the Comptroller’s office, until the project is extended, as they exceed
the current life of the project.
26.    The undisbursed balance for Loan 7388 was $13,824,447.25 and the undisbursed
balance of TF 56666 was $ 1,655,642.00 as of May 21, 2012. The revised schedule of
disbursements is:
