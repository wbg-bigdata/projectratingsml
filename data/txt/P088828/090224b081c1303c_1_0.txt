                         remains moderately satisfactory because of low level of irrigation rehabilitation. Before this closing date of September 30, 2012, an additional financing was approved in August 2012
                         to improve availability of critical agricultural inputs and food staples for targeted beneficiaries within the context of the severe drought that affected the country. The corresponding two
                         grants (IDA and GFRP) were signed on September 12, 2012 and the additional financing became effective in December 2012. Active project components now only reflect the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It was agreed with the Government to keep this ISR as an official use only. Before the closing date of the original PDIAIM 2, the project completed the remaining civil works that
                         straddled the rainy season and started preliminary studies for the rehabilitation of the irrigation perimeter of Wandama (APS). The government also completed the new Mauritania
                         rural development strategy which preparation was financed by the project. Since the additional financing was approved, the new closing date is February 28, 2014 to implement
                         activities related to the additional financing for the purchase of fertilizers, veterinary products and cereals. It is also expected that a new long term agriculture sector investment
                         operation will be ready by the time of project closing.
