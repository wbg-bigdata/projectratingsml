1. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT AND REFORM
A. HIGHWAY STRATEGY AND POLICY
1.1   At the central level, the basic strategy is to develop a National Trunk Highway
System (NTHS). The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is in charge of planning the
NTHS, consisting of 12 interprovincial trunk expressways, with a total length of some
35,000 km and connecting 95 major Chinese cities. While immediate priority is being
given to two north-south and two east-west corridors ("two verticals and two
horizontals") and three other major transport corridors (Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-
Shenyang, Chengdu-Beihai), the Beijing-Zhuhai (Jingzhu) Expressway, which is one of
the "two verticals," constitutes the highest priority corridor in this program. This
expressway crosses the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong over a
distance of approximately 2,500 km and will connect, once completed, Beijing with
Guangdong's fast-growing Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong. It is designed as a high-
grade, high-performance facility, at a minimum four-lane standard, fully access-
controlled, and will be operated throughout as a toll highway. Jingzhu is scheduled for
substantial completion by the year 2000. At the provincial/regional level, the strategy is
to concentrate on network maintenance and the expansion and improvement of provincial
and rural road networks currently totaling more than 1 million km, to provide greater
mobility and to stimulate socioeconomic development, particularly in less developed
areas.
1.2  In terms of highway and road transport policy, growing attention is being paid to
removing administrative barriers to interprovincial trade and to redefining the Central
Government's role in transport, in light of rapid administrative decentralization and
growing private sector involvement in highway development and road transport services.
Provincial and municipal governments are expected to continue mobilizing most
investment resources required, including access to private investment and capital markets,
and to seek greater expenditure efficiency through improved highway planning and
investment strategies, as well as to modernize maintenance management and improve
cost recovery from road users. Local governments are also expected to further the
development of road transport services and the road construction industry through
deregulation and promotion of competition, access to modern technology and improved
management. The Bank has prepared a report (No. 11819-CHA dated February 1994),
CHINA: Highway Development and Management-Issues, Options and Strategies, which
serves as the basis for the Bank Group sector assistance strategy.
B. LINKAGE TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
1.3  In highways, the key problem facing China is its comparative neglect of the sector
over several decades. Accordingly, China's road network ranks among the sparsest in the



- 2 -
world relative to geographic area or population and is quite unsafe. The Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China, presented to the Board on June 1, 1995, and the
Progress Report on March 26, 1996, support China's needs to rapidly modernize and
expand its highway system. To achieve this, the Government of China (GOC), with Bank
and other multi- and bilateral assistance, is giving high priority to developing the system
of expressways leading to the NTHS. Among other priority corridors, the Bank is already
heavily involved in the construction of substantial sections of Jingzhu expressway,
between Beijing and Guangzhou. Under the ongoing National Highway (NHl) Project,
two important sections are presently being built in Hebei and Henan. Under the proposed
Second National Highway (NH2) Project, two priority sections in Guangdong and Hunan
would be undertaken. Under a future Third National Highway (NH3) Project, which is
under preparation, several important expressway sections as well as a major Wuhan
Yangtze River bridge under an agreed Build-Operate-Transfer (B-O-T) arrangement
would be undertaken in Hubei Province. A newly proposed Fourth National Highway IV
(NH4) Project would cover two important expressway sections in Hunan and Hubei,
which will be linked to the Yangtze bridge B-O-T scheme. These four National Highway
Projects constitute a well thought-out and well-balanced series of investment operations
that assist GOC and the concerned provinces in the timely completion of China's highest
priority expressway corridor. In general, the Bank's program of support in the highway
sector will continue to assist China in the foreseeable future in the financing,
development and management of its priority expressway system.
C. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION
1.4   The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Government in the transport
sector through loans and credits totaling $5.6 billion for 33 projects. The dialogue
between the Government and the Bank Group on transport sector strategy and policies
has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways, highways and
ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed studies
as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The most
recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector, besides Highway Development and
Management: Issues, Options and Strategies also include China 's Railway Strategy (No.
10592-CHA) issued in February 1993, and Strategies for Road Freight Development (No.
12600-CHA) issued in January 1995. In addition, studies on the trucking industry and on
highway finance have been completed. Studies on the road construction industry,
interprovincial traffic facilitation, highway capacity, intercity passenger transport, and
improved prioritization of highway investments and highway feasibility methodology are
presently being undertaken. On the basis of its strong project and sector work, the Bank is
deepening its involvement and assisting the Government in the design and implementation
of institutional and sectoral reforms in areas such as strategy formulation and investment
planning; policy, legal, and regulatory framework for private transport provision; sector
financing; deregulation of transport services, and transfer of advanced technology through
training and equipment. Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently preparing a
transport sector strategy paper to help guide sector development in a consistent and
cohesive framework.

D. LESSONS FROM PREvIous BANK OPERATIONS
1.5   Previous highway projects in China emphasize the importance of rigorous, early
preparation for major civil and traffic engineering works and for procurement processes,
where tendering often takes longer than expected. Advance preparation of bidding
documentation and independent design reviews have also fostered smooth
implementation and have helped reduce variations during the implementation period.
The design of traffic-engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications,
tolling and lighting) must be advanced so that these works would be finished shortly after
completion of the civil works for high-grade highways.
1.6   Land acquisition and resettlement of affected people has also led to
implementation difficulties, including delays, in Chinese highway projects. A large
number of people are typically affected by resettlement in China, particularly along
important economic corridors where highways are being upgraded and constructed. The
institutional requirements for resettlement of these numbers of people are significant.
Under the proposed NH2 project, resettlement has received considerable attention to
ensure institutional capability to provide adequate compensation and to implement
Resettlement Action Plans.
1.7   Experience in the environmental area in China has generally been favorable.
However, more attention should be paid to environmental supervision during
construction, training of environmental personnel, and environmental monitoring during
both the construction and operation phases.
1.8   Bank experience emphasizes the importance of adequate construction quality of
roads. Poorly constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle-operating cost
savings. Higher costs also result from premature deterioration, where corrective actions
in the form of increased maintenance and/or rehabilitation are required. Effective
remedial actions include stringent contractor prequalification, careful formulation of
supervision arrangements, including engagement of foreign experts, training of local
supervision staff and equipping the supervision teams.
1.9   Project design must put more emphasis on highway management and operation,
especially in the context of toll expressways. There is also a growing concern that
adequate funding for highway maintenance is not now being generated to cover an
expanding and more expensive highway system. Previously, this was not an issue since
adequate funds were being set aside for this purpose.
1.10  Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway
projects, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity of Bank
supervision are important for positive, sustainable outcomes. Institutional components
that are implemented early in the project period tend to have a greater impact, as
compared with free-standing studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project.

2. THE EVOLVING FRAMEWORK FOR PRIVATE TOLL
HIGHWAY FINANCE
A. CURRENT STATUS OF PRIVATE PROJECT FINANCE
2.1   In response to an estimated $600 billion capital requirement for infrastructure
from 1995 to 2004, China is moving steadily to open certain sectors, mainly highway
development and power generation, to foreign equity investors and debt financing. Some
$300 billion, or half the country's near-term infrastructure needs, are in the transport
sector.
2.2   To date, China has used $2 billion in foreign capital to construct 7,000 km of
highways and expects to do more in the future. Through the year 2000, in fact, China
expects to construct a total of 14,160 km of new limited access highways, of which nearly
2,500 km will be fully access-controlled urban or intercity expressways. The size of this
program, in terms of distance and cost, well exceeds any similar toll road program now
underway in the world, outstripping by far the country's public revenues and access to bi-
and multilateral bank funds.
2.3   The alternative for China is to raise the needed capital in the external credit
markets, with the commercial involvement of qualified private firms and international
investors, and minimal government guarantees. The participation of private firms in
B-O-T highway projects has been explored, and the issuance of project company
securities has been tried in offshore capital markets to fund the construction of quasi-
public projects.
2.4   By accessing new equity investment and debt capital in global markets, China is
seeking to accomplish at least three near-term objectives:
(a)   Reduce Sovereign Debt Exposure to Infrastructure. Private capital,
including user charges and project debt from domestic and international
sources, can supplement limited public resources available to the central
government and provinces. This can minimize the need for using the
government's credit capacity to fund infrastructure projects;
(b)   Improvement in Efficiency and Productivity. Private financing assists
the country in improving management efficiency and quality of
infrastructure services because of the for-profit, commercial orientation of
private investors and lenders; and
(c)   Offloading Construction and Commercial Risks. If properly structured,
privately financed projects, unlike publicly funded infrastructure, allow



-5 -
government to pass on the completion and commercial risks to those best
able to handle them, the private sponsors.
2.5    China, like most developing countries, continues efforts to build a workable
structure for attracting private capital to infrastructure projects.  The process of
accommodating the needs of private investors while finding a cost-effective way to
develop expressways is not an overnight task in China, but a process of trial and error.
The country's experience with privately supported highway projects is evolving and the
transition from traditional public funding to project financing will occur as the result of
specific projects, with lessons learned, and a regulatory framework built largely on
experience.
2.6   Nearly all of the projects involving foreign investors have been structured as Sino-
foreign joint ventures rather than concessions that are owned outright by the sponsors. In
this way, the Chinese agencies retain a degree of control as equity partners. Foreign
sponsors look to their local counterparts to obtain governmental approvals and assurances
at various levels.
2.7    Concession arrangements to construct and operate a highway under a B-O-T
scheme have been constrained by the absence of a well-developed legal framework and
limitations in the joint venture agreement. The public authorities whose decisions
influence the financial aspects of the project (State Council, State Planning Commission,
State Administration for Exchange Control) are generally not contractual parties to the
joint venture agreement. Separate assurances and acknowledgments that have been
sought from these entities are often difficult to secure.
2.8   The result is that foreign commercial banks and financial markets are reluctant to
accept project risk in China, making limited-recourse financing extremely difficult for
project sponsors to mobilize. This situation applies to all infrastructure sectors, and the
highway sector is no exception. In cases where external-debt financing of project
companies has occurred, lenders have relied on guarantees and assurances of creditworthy
governmental agencies, banks, and financial institutions, such as provincial international
trust and investment corporations (ITICs).
2.9   As in new toll highway projects worldwide, private investors in China are
concerned over revenue loss from a shortfall in traffic volume and/or the inability to
secure adjustments in the tariff structure on a timely basis. To mitigate such risks and to
attract foreign investment, minimum revenue guarantees by local partners/governmental
agencies and preferential profit distribution for foreign investors are common in Sino-
foreign joint venture highway projects. To enhance toll revenues, foreign investors have
received land development concessions along the right-of-way and at interchanges and/or
revenues from operating highways.
2.10 There have been a few major highway projects accomplished in China with
private capital in recent years. The following two are particularly notable:



- 6 -
(a)   Shenzhen-Guangzhou Superhighway (123 km). This facility opened in
1994 and is the first phase of the Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Zhuhai
Superhighway.  The $1.2 billion project is sponsored by Hopewell
Holdings of Hong Kong, responsible also for design, construction and
financing. The developer has also taken extensive risks including land
acquisition in return for profit-sharing and rights for commercial
development at interchanges. One third of the original project cost was
funded by equity and shareholder loans provided by the foreign sponsor
and subordinated domestic loans arranged by a Guangdong provincial
joint-venture partner. The remaining $800 million was financed with
syndicated foreign bank loans, chiefly supported by a cash-flow deficiency
guarantee by the Guangdong ITIC.
(b)   Chengdu-Mianyang Expressway (90 km). This toll road was financed
as a joint venture between a Sichuan provincial partner and the New China
Hong Kong Group, which has a number of China-affiliated shareholders.
The provincial partner was responsible for land acquisition and
construction of the expressway for a fixed fee. The foreign sponsor
handled private placement of approximately $100 million equity shares
with offshore investors including private infrastructure funds to finance
such construction. Minimum toll revenue guarantees and preferential
profit distribution were offered to attract foreign equity investors to
Sichuan Province, and obligations of the local partner were guaranteed by
the provincial ITIC.
2.11  The foregoing examples illustrate innovative and pragmatic ways to raise capital,
but the question to be asked is how should China proceed to develop a workable project
fmance model for highway development. Whether through startup toll road projects or
securitized financing of existing, high-volume roadways, the answer will depend largely
on the appetite investors and lenders have for project risk and China's willingness to
address financing constraints, both in an institutional sense and in the context of its
regulatory system.
B. ISSUES IN PROJECT FINANCE IN CHINA
2.12  In response to China's substantial demand for infrastructure capital, the results of
the country's efforts to attract private funds have lagged behind reasonable expectations.
China's success in attracting foreign direct investment to manufacturing, real estate, and
service industries, now at a level of $30 billion annually, has not translated to
infrastructure. Despite a high level of interest among foreign developers and investors,
unacceptable project risks have limited the number of deals that were closed. Likewise,
the country's solid record as a sovereign borrower of long-term funds in the international
bond markets is not yet reflected in the critical, but unaccomplished, goal of bringing
long-term debt financing to its infrastructure sectors.



- 7 -
2.13  In B-O-T projects, a project sponsor is generally responsible for design,
construction, financing and operation for a specified concession period, at the end of
which ownership of the project is transferred to the host country. When the projects are
properly structured, long-term lenders, rather than equity investors, provide the bulk of
the financing on a limited-recourse basis to the sponsors. Since export credits are
relatively limited in civil-work-intensive highway projects, the mobilization of long-term
commercial debt at favorable rates is essential to a successful financing package.
2.14  For commercial banks, limited recourse project finance is different from
conventional sovereign or corporate lending, in that project revenues and rights under
various project agreements are security for repayment, rather than the borrower's
diversified assets and ability to repay. The return to these lenders is limited compared
with equity investors since there is no possibility of an up-side gain from earnings. These
institutions are more risk-averse in their credit decisions and to date have demonstrated
considerable reluctance to support China's B-O-T projects with limited-recourse funds.
2.15  Project developers and lenders require a stable policy and regulatory environment
to assess and properly manage project risks. A commitment is needed by the host
government to manage country or political risks, namely related to policy and regulations
and the performance of public agencies. Most B-O-T projects allocate commercial and
political risks among the parties to the transaction. For the public sector, such risk
sharing mechanisms in the concession agreement enable the government to transfer these
substantial commercial risks during project construction and operation to the private
developer and lenders.
2.16 The common difficulties in B-O-T projects in China, as perceived by foreign
investors and lenders, are related to various policy, legal, regulatory and institutional
issues that affect the investment climate. The principal concerns are as follows:
(a)   Regulatory Uncertainty.  Unclear lines of authority between the
provinces and central government, a complex approval process, and
ambiguous criteria and policies, lead to lengthy and costly project delays.
(b)   Convertibility and Availability of Hard Currency.  Investors and
lenders share concern over the absence of legal convertibility of the
renminbi, timely availability of hard currency through swap centers, and
impact on payment of foreign denominated debt and repatriation of profit.
(c)   Unclear Toll Policy.   Automatic tariff adjustment provisions in
concessions are not available, leaving project sponsors and lenders with no
assurance that operating and financial costs can be recovered on a current
basis, or over the life of the concession.
(d)   Inadequate Legal Framework. China's legal system has not developed
enough to accommodate complex B-O-T transactions, raising concerns



-8 -
among lenders on security-related financial and legal issues, including the
enforceability of contracts and agreements.
(e)   Creditworthiness  of Public Entities.   Uncertain  or insufficient
creditworthiness of provincial/municipal contracting parties and concern
for their ability of honoring financial obligations under contracts.
(f)    Lack of Transaction Experience. Most provincial/municipal authorities
have no direct experience with project finance or B-O-T transactions,
causing foreign companies to commit expensive resources to time-
consuming negotiation and on-the-job training of public sector
counterparts.
2.17  In those project financings that have reached closure in China, public and private
parties to the transaction have settled their concerns through negotiation and risk-sharing
arrangements. This informal arrangement may be sufficient in many coastal provinces,
where foreign banks and developers are more experienced and have reached a reasonable
level of comfort with the credit of local agencies.
2.18  Even in the developed provinces, however, most foreign institutions do assess a
risk premium over the uncertainty of China's policies and regulations, and this can inflate
the cost and pricing of projects. In the country's interior, provincial credit concerns and
lack of a track record with the private sector are major obstacles in closing project finance
transactions with international firms and lenders.
2.19  The ordinary concerns of project finance lenders are generally multiplied by toll
road projects, which have complex and generic demand-related risks. In this case, a
transport service is sold to the discretionary user, whereas power purchase agreements,
for example, tend to provide power projects with a clear, defined source of income. The
primary risks in China's toll road projects are:
(a)   Uncertain traffic volume, especially in the inner provinces where future
traffic growth will depend heavily on economic development and
associated government policies;
(b)   Absence of arterial road systems and networks to support toll highways;
and
(c)   Competition from parallel free roads and other modes of transport that are
developed in the future.
2.20 As in virtually all countries, a limited number of highway projects in China will
have the traffic and revenue potential to attract private capital, and the process by which
these are identified and packaged will be the most important factor in their success. Since
toll revenues alone in China may not be adequate to support most privately financed
highway projects, other mechanisms may also be necessary. These may include cross-



- 9 -
subsidies from existing toll roads and other sources, such as a fuel tax and/or land
development incentives and tax concessions.
C. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT
2.21  China's State Planning Commission (SPC) is formulating a provisional regulatory
framework for foreign-owned pilot B-O-T projects in various infrastructure sectors,
including highways up to 80 km long, major bridges and tunnels, power stations, and
urban sewage and water supply. SPC intends to promulgate the Provisional Decree for
Concession Projects with Foreign Investment governing these projects and is now
drafting model procurement documents for toll road and power projects. Private sponsors
of pilot B-O-T projects are to be selected through competitive bidding. A power project
(Guangxi Laibin B Power Plant Project) has already been selected as the first pilot B-O-T
project, with procurement that was launched in December 1995.
2.22  The Bank supports GOC's efforts to establish a regulatory framework for
privately financed infrastructure and has encouraged the development of a transparent
procurement procedure where sponsors would be selected through competitive bidding.
Through Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant funds
available to SPC, the Bank is supporting the initial feasibility analysis of a pilot B-O-T
project, known as the Junshan Yangtze River Bridge, and the preparation of model
procurement documents and a concession agreement for this and future toll highway
projects.
2.23 Under the proposed National Highway III (Hubei) Project, which would be a
Bank-financed highway operation, the Borrower and the Bank have agreed to develop the
Yangtze River Bridge under a B-O-T arrangement with the central government and Hubei
Province. At a project cost of $200 million, the six-lane bridge would be located at the
intersection of two National Trunk Highways, the Beijing-Zhuhai North-South
Expressway and the Shanghai-Chengdu East-West Expressway. The latter projects will
be partially be financed by the Bank and operated as publicly owned toll roads.
2.24  The implementing agency for the National Highway III Project is the Hubei
Provincial Communications Department, which has applied for designation of the
Yangtze River Bridge as a pilot B-O-T project. As the approving agency, SPC has
expressed interest in this project as an opportunity, with the new policy framework, to
test the international market for private investment in highway infrastructure.
2.25  Several pilot B-O-T projects will enable China to experiment with new policy
initiatives to attract private capital and to gain valuable experience from the results. It is
important at this stage for the public sector to remain flexible with the provisional decree
and concession documents. Adjustments may be necessary to fulfill the requirements of
investors and lenders in order to make the first few projects bankable. Successful closure
of these projects will provide China with a track record and base of experience, thereby
contributing to future B-O-T projects that can be financed in the external financial
markets.



- 10-
2.26  In the longer term, China's success in capturing offshore capital for highway
infrastructure will require continued development of the regulatory framework and
investment environment in several specific areas:
(a)   Transparent Policy and Regulatory Framework. SPC's initial decree
governing foreign-owned B-O-T projects should be expanded as a policy
instrument, given the fact that most of China's experience with toll road/
bridge/tunnel projects is limited to joint ventures.
(b)   Development of Legal System. The regulatory framework for privately
financed infrastructure should be fully integrated with relevant national
and provincial laws, so as to address various aspects (design, ownership,
financing, construction, operation, maintenance, taxation) of B-O-T-type
infrastructure projects.
(c)   Institutional Development of Agencies. Functions and relationships of
central and provincial authorities should be clearly defined, along with the
legal status, authority, and financial condition of prospective sponsors of
private projects.   For example, national and provincial highway
corporations could be developed as commercial toll road operators with
the capacity to raise capital in the international markets.
(d)   Growth of Domestic Capital Markets. For China to meet its near-term
capital requirements for infrastructure, the country must have access to a
supply of long-term debt capital. China's financial markets, which benefit
from a high per capita savings rate, lack the structure and financial
instruments to convert domestic savings to requirements for long-term
funding of infrastructure.
D. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
2.27  The Bank will continue to assist China in developing the policy and regulatory
framework needed to mobilize private financing for infrastructure. Movement in this
direction will enable the borrower to leverage limited Bank funds with public and private
resources to undertake a greater number of projects and to attract long-term debt capital
from the financial markets.
2.28  World Bank support for China will include institutional development and sectoral
reforms as well as the development of the NTHS and other priority investments through
direct loans to public projects. Through a series of National Highway II, III, and IV
Projects, the Bank will play an expanded role in encouraging the growth of private
finance in this sector.
2.29 Technical Assistance. SPC, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOC have
given the Bank a mandate to support them in the establishment of the framework for
private highway finance in China. The Bank's assistance through PHRD funds under the



- 11 -
National Highway II, III, and IV Projects is the major first step in this effort. At China's
request, the Bank has also indicated that it is willing to permit the use of IDA technical
assistance to fund legal and financial advisory fees for pilot B-O-T infrastructure projects
that reach the negotiation stage.
2.30  Partial Guarantee. The Bank's partial guarantees would enable private projects
to obtain longer-term limited-recourse debt financing at lower cost than the sponsors or
sovereign might obtain. These require a counterguarantee by the host government and so
far China has rejected financial guarantees for privately financed infrastructure. Limited
guarantees for selected policy-related risks, such as contractual compliance or
performance risks of public agencies, may be required to make projects, especially those
in the interior provinces, commercially financeable.
2.31  IFC and FIAS. IFC and the Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) are
assisting China in the development of a policy framework for private projects. IFC is
also discussing the possibility of supporting demonstration projects in key infrastructure
sectors including transportation, which are based on sound principles of limited-recourse
financing. This participation could be in the form of equity investment, A loans and
B loans, and/or investment-related advisory services.
2.32  MIGA. MIGA offers long-term coverage for specific political risks, i.e., currency
transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract (in a narrowly
defined manner), with a focus on risk coverage of equity investments and associated
shareholder loans or loans by commercial banks so long as equity in the project is also
insured by the agency. In China, the absence of a convertibility law precludes coverage
by MIGA of hard currency exchange.
2.33   Coordination among the Bank Group. As to policy dialogue, the Bank will
continue to collaborate with China to help develop a policy and regulatory framework
and a transparent procurement process for privately financed highway projects. As
regards credit support, because neither IFC nor MIGA requires counter guarantees, these
organizations would likely be included in the initial discussion on private projects. The
Bank, through its lending and guarantee programs, could play a significant,
complementary financing role for large private highway projects that require resources
beyond the limited capacity of IFC and MIGA.

3. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN GUANGDONG AND HUNAN
A. GEOGRAPHY AND TRANSPORT
3.1   Guangdong Province is located on the South China Sea at the southeastern
corner of China. As of 1995, Guangdong had a population of 66.9 million covering an
2~~~~~~~
area of 178,000 km2. Excluding the many small islands along the coastline, the
population density was 376 people per km . Topographically, Guangdong is high in the
north and low in the south, with wide areas of hills and low mountains. Almost 75
percent of the total area is mountainous and hilly. The coastline is long and winding,
measuring more than 4,300 km along the mainland area. The province, with Guangzhou
as its capital, includes 3 economic zones, 21 provincial administered cities, 30 cities at
the county level, 45 counties and 3 autonomous counties. The economy of Guangdong
has grown by about 20 percent annually since 1980. Gross Output Value of Agriculture
and Industry (GOVAI) per capita in the project area was by 1994 at 1.73 times the
national average and the growth has also averaged nearly 20 percent per year since 1980.
3.2   Hunan Province is situated in the middle reaches of the Changjiang River in
south-central China. Stretching 900 km from east to west and 800 km from south to
north, Hunan has a total area of 210,000 km2. With mountains in the east, south and
west, the land generally slopes from south toward the north. The most common land
form in this region are hills that occupy about 50 percent of the total area. At the end of
1995, Hunan had a population of 63.0 million and its population density averaged
298 people per km2.  The province, with Changsha as its capital, is divided into
4 prefectures, 1 autonomous prefecture, 9 provincial administrated counties, 21 cities at
the county level, 69 counties and 7 autonomous counties. The economy of Hunan has
grown by about 9 percent annually since 1980. GOVAI per capita in the project area was
by 1994 at half the national average and the growth has averaged about 11 percent per
year since 1980.
3.3   Transport Networks. The strategic location of both Guangdong and Hunan
provinces at the crossroads of major North-South and East-West expressway, waterway
and railway corridors attracts large amounts of traffic. Transport demand has grown
substantially over the last five years, in view of sustained economic growth in the
provinces and the rest of the country.
3.4  In Guangdong, roads and inland waterways are the principal modes for short-haul
transport; and railways and coastal shipping are the principal modes for interprovincial
transport. Guangdong Province has intersecting waterways open to navigation in all four
seasons. The province has 19 seaports, of which 5 are classified as major. Inland
transportation is based on the Pearl River system, which has three main navigable



- 13 -
tributaries. The length of inland waterways in 1994 amounted to 10,808 km. The
railway network is relatively limited, compared to that of neighboring provinces such as
Hunan. The five main lines connect the ports of Huangpu, Guangzhou and Zhanjiang
with the rest of the country, and also serve as an export link to Hong Kong. At the end of
1994, the total mileage open to traffic amounted to 1,725 km.
3.5   Historically railways and inland waterways are the main transport modes in
Hunan province. Hunan is served by five main railways: Beijing-Guangzhou, Zhejiang-
Jiangxi, Hunan-Guinzhou, Hunan-Guangxi, and Zhicheng-Liuzhou, the operational
length of which at the end of 1994 was 2,600 km. Four tributaries of the Yangtze River
system flow into Dongting Lake in the north of Hunan, from where they enter the
Yangtze.  Hunan has a total of 10,010 km of inland waterways.  The principal
commodities transported by railroads and inland waterways are coal, grain, mineral stone
and construction material.
3.6   The highway network in Guangdong comprises some 83,000 km, of which only
about 7,400 km (about 10 percent of the total) include expressways, and class I and II
roads. Between 1981 and 1994, the road network in Guangdong grew in length by about
3 percent per year. The highway network in Hunan comprises some 58,800 km, of which
only 1,747 km (about 3 percent of the total) are class I and II roads. The roads with
bituminous and cement pavements amount to only 12,408 km (21 percent of total). The
administrative classification of the road network in both provinces at the end of 1994 was
as follows:
Guangdong Province           Hunan Province
Road Classification      km       Percent           km         Percent
National                4,180         5           4,041           7
Provincial              9,048        11           6,014          10
County                 14,673        18          22,187          38
Villager               55,053        66          25,434          43
Special                   102         0           1,127           2
Total               83,055       100           58,803        100
3.7   As in the rest of the country, most of the highways in Guangdong and Hunan were
built in the 1960s and 1970s, and their design standards were suitable for the light
vehicles and low traffic levels prevailing in China at the time. Due to the substantial
growth in traffic levels and steady rise in the use of heavy vehicles, these roads have
increasingly become inadequate to meet present and future needs.
3.8   Vehicle Fleet. The vehicle fleet in Guangdong grew more than five times in nine
years between 1986 and 1994, on an average of 20 percent per year. The fleet of large
trucks, buses and agricultural tractors grew between 9 and 17 percent per year. The fleet



- 14-
of passenger cars, light vans and pickups grew at 22 percent per year, reflecting the
growth in prosperity as well as the light-vehicle needs of the growing number of smaller
enterprises in the evolving socialist market economy. The most rapid growth occurred in
the motorcycle fleet at 32 percent per year, reflecting the desire for personal mobility now
made affordable through growing prosperity. The vehicle fleets in Hunan have expanded
more than four times between 1980 and 1994, at an average growth rate of 11 percent per
year. Similar to Guangdong, the fastest growth rate occurred in the motorcycle fleet at 30
percent per year.
B. TRAFFIC GROWTH AND ROAD SAFETY
3.9   Traffic. In Hunan freight and passenger traffic from 1985 to 1994 grow at about
4 and 3 percent per year, respectively (Table 3.1). In freight and passenger traffic, the
fastest growing mode during this period was air transport, which grew at 29 and
49 percent per year, respectively. The highway mode followed at about an annual
4-5 percent. By the year 1994, about 90 percent of all passenger movements were
undertaken by road transport. However, around 52 percent of all passenger-km occurred
by rail while about 48 percent of passenger-km occurred by road.
3. 1 0 In Guangdong, traffic growth from 1985 to 1994 was strong. Freight traffic grew
at over 9 percent per year, with the strongest growth in road and water transport (Table
3.1). Water and air transport dominate freight transport, with rail carrying a much
smaller proportion of traffic than elsewhere in China. Passenger transport also grew at
well over 6 percent per year, with the strongest growth in air transport at 18 percent per
year, following by rail transport at 8 percent and highway transport at almost 7 percent
per year. Similar to Hunan, by 1994, highways accounted for 90 percent of all passenger
movements, and 75 percent of passenger-km.
3.11  Safety. Road safety is a serious problem in Guangdong and Hunan Provinces, as
elsewhere in China. Generally, the number of traffic accidents has increased less rapidly
than the growth in traffic volume or vehicle registration. In Hunan, while the absolute
number of accidents and injuries has declined since 1990, as has the fatality rate per
10,000 vehicles, the proportion of fatalities has been increasing, suggesting more serious
accidents with higher frequency of death. Further, despite recent declines, the fatality
rates for both Hunan and Guangdong, like those for China as a whole, remain higher than
rates in many developed and developing countries. International comparisons of the
number of people killed in traffic accidents per 10,000 vehicles show a rate from 20 times
higher in Hunan and 5 times higher in Guangdong than that in Western industrial
countries (41.4 for Hunan, 10.0 for Guangdong, 46.0 for China, 2.0 and 2.4 for the United
States and Germany, respectively).
3.12  Primary responsibility for road safety now lies with the Traffic Police of the
Public Security Bureau (PSB), including that for vehicle testing and inspection, licensing,
propaganda on safety, enforcement of traffic laws, including imposition of fines,
operation of traffic signals, highway patrols, and all aspects of accident reporting,



- 15 -
investigation and research.   However, the Guangdong and Hunan Provincial
Communications Departments (GPCD and HPCD) retain responsibility for all matters
concerning safe highway design and traffic signs and markings and driver training. In
Guangdong, GPCD and the Traffic Police would work together under the project to
develop an expressway safety program to reduce the growing numbers of expressway
accidents. In Hunan, HPCD would launch a road safety program primarily dealing with
the matters within the HPCD's jurisdiction.
C. HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION, PLANNING AND FINANCING
3.13  Administration.  The Provincial Communication Departments (PCD) of
Guangdong and Hunan administer most of the highway and waterway transport activities
in their provinces, and are responsible to their respective provincial governments for
highway planning, budgeting, and financing. The PCDs adhere to the general transport
policy and technical guidelines issued by MOC.
3.14  The administration of the road network in the two project provinces takes place at
the levels of: (a) the PCDs, (b) the municipal and prefecture highway bureaus, and (c) the
local highway units of the county highway bureaus. The PCDs administer the provincial
highways through their Provincial Highway Administration Bureaus while the municipal
and county transport bureaus administer local highways and village roads. The provincial
bureaus are responsible for all highway matters (apart from the high-grade highway
program, as described below), including construction and maintenance, and these bureaus
receive professional and technical guidance from the Highway Administration
Department of MOC. They have a staff of 382 and 252 at the Guangdong and the Hunan
headquarters, respectively. The 21 municipal and prefectural highway bureaus and the 78
county bureaus in Guangdong Province have a total staff of about 63,000, of which
technical personnel comprises about 15 percent. In Hunan Province, the municipal and
prefectural highway bureaus number 14, and the county bureaus 105, with a total staff of
about 49,000, of which technical personnel comprise about 18 percent.
3.15 The Guangdong Provincial Freeway Company (GPFC) is a department-level
institution that reports directly to GPCD and is responsible for the organization,
direction, coordination, planning, design, construction, supervision, traffic surveillance
and control, telecommunication, operation and maintenance of all expressway projects in
the province, as well as for counterpart business service for expressways, such as
refueling, rescue, spare parts supply and real estate management. Also, it is partially
responsible for mobilizing construction funds, including the collection of tolls on all
expressways. It currently has a staff of 1,213 people, of which 377 are technicians.
There are 14 companies and 2 preparation offices controlled by GPFC (8 expressway
companies, I environmental protection division, 2 bridge companies, 2 traffic and
highway engineering companies, 1 development company, and 1 highway equipment
rental company). In Hunan Province, Hunan Provincial Expressway Construction and
Development Corporation (HPECDC) is in charge of construction, operation and



-16-
management of high-grade toll roads in the province. HPECDC is a department-level
institution that reports directly to HPCD. HPECDC's staff currently numbers 456.
3.16 Planning. The Hunan and Guangdong PCDs have overall responsibility for
planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the provincial highway networks.
The highway administration units at the prefecture, county and village levels have
considerable autonomy in planning smaller investments, which are nonetheless subject to
approval by the PCDs. Each administrative group prepares investment plans for the
highway network under its jurisdiction and submits these to the planning divisions of the
PCDs each year for the next year's plan. The PCDs approve the yearly plans for each
county or local authority concerned. Similarly, using inputs forn the lower-level
administrative groups, the PCDs prepare their five-year road development plans,
reflecting national and provincial development policy guidelines and objectives for the
planed period. The current Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP) (1996-2000) for highway
investment and maintenance in Hunan and Guangdong require a total of Y 95.3 billion
(Y 23.8 billion in Hunan, Y 72.5 billion in Guangdong).
3.17 Financing. Funding for highway construction and maintenance comes from
several sources, but by far the two largest sources are the Road Maintenance Fee, used for
maintenance needs and that provided about 39 percent and 47 percent of all highway
funding in Hunan and Guangdong during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (8FYP) (1990-95),
respectively, and the Highway Key Construction Fund for new construction and that
provided about 20 percent and 37 percent, respectively. Highway funding sources and
expenditures are summarized in Table 3.2a for Hunan Province and Table 3.2b for
Guangdong Province. The Road Maintenance Fee is collected from all motor vehicles.
The total amount collected from cars, vans and trucks is retained by the PCDs, while the
amount collected from tractors and other agricultural vehicles is managed by prefectures,
cities and counties. Such vehicles as military and police cars, fire trucks, city buses and
city garbage trucks are exempted from highway maintenance fees, also the party and
government vehicles are partly exempted. Since 1996, the balance of the revenues from
road maintenance fees is generally distributed as follows: 2.63 percent to the Public
Security Bureaus in both provinces and about 4 percent to the transport fees collection
sector in Hunan. The road maintenance fee retained by Hunan Province increased from
Y 3,070 million for the 8FYP to Y 5,410 million for the 9FYP and from Y 13,832 million
in 8FYP to Y 25,524 million in 9FYP in Guangdong Province.
3.18  The Highway Key Construction Fund was established by the provincial
governments for the construction of high-grade highways and bridges and its sources are:
(a) fees being collected from vehicles owned by the provinces and operated in highway
passenger and freight transportation (the standard fees are: Y 20 per month for trucks and
Y 0.02 per person-km for buses), (b) the car purchasing fee (collected as 3 percent of the
total transaction), and (c) the highway and bridge toll revenues. Revenues from the
Highway Key Construction Fund increased from Y 1,580 million during the 8FYP to
Y 3,022 million during the 9FYP in Hunan and from Y 10,907 million to Y 13,911
million in Guangdong. Other sources of revenue for highways include: (a) subsidies

from MOC, calculated as Y 4 million per km of new construction; (b) local funds from
governments at prefecture, city and county levels; (c) Aid-poverty Fund; and (d) loans
from foreign and local banks (for details on highway financing see Tables 3.2a and 3.2b).
Subsidies from MOC and local governments also substantially increased from Y 1,710
million for the 8FYP to Y 4,350 million for the 9FYP in Hunan and from Y 3,620 million
for the 8FYP to Y 23,881 million for the 9FYP in Guangdong. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show
the distribution of highway revenues and expenditures for Hunan and Guangdong,
respectively, for 9FYP.

3.19   The highway network in Guangdong expanded between 1985 and 1995 from
64,100 km to 83,100 km and in Hunan from about 56,000 km to about 59,000 km.
During the 7FYP and 8FYP (1986-95), expenditures required for this expansion,
including highway construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance totaled Y 44,600



- 18 -
million, of which Y 9,600 million were spent in Hunan, and Y 35,000 million in
Guangdong. Of this total, construction of new highways and highway improvement
amounted to Y 33,352 million during the 8FYP, or about 85 percent of total highway
expenditures in Hunan and Guangdong (Tables 3.2a and 3.2b)
D. ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE
3.20  Engineering. Road and bridge projects are engineered by the planning and
design institutes at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. The provincial planning
and design institutes are responsible for designing all major road, bridge, and tunnel
projects in the province. These design institutes are, in general, competent and have on
staff experienced personnel for carrying out highway design tasks. Various national and
provincial planning and design institutes designed sections of the Jingzhu Expressway
under the project.
3.21  Construction. Small-scale roads and bridges in the provinces are constructed by
the construction units of the highway department of each city or county. The Highway
Administration Bureaus of the PCDs are responsible for the construction of large- and
medium-size highways and bridges. GPFC in Guangdong and HPECDC in Hunan are
responsible for the construction of high-grade highways. Since SPC directed that all
major civil works are to be awarded after competitive bidding, many of the larger
construction divisions are being reorganized into financially independent contracting
companies and have been awarded contracts either individually or as partners in joint
ventures on previous Bank-financed highway projects.
3.22  Maintenance. Highway maintenance is carried out by county highway bureaus
under the control of municipal authorities. Maintenance is generally well organized and
carried out, mainly through labor-intensive operations. Expenditures for periodic and
routine maintenance in Guangdong and Hunan increased about 132 percent and
74 percent from the 7FYP to the 8FYP, respectively. However, as a percentage of total
expenditures for the highway sector, they decreased from about 35 percent during the
7FYP to about 21 percent during 8FYP in Hunan (Table 3.2a). In Guangdong, routine
and periodic maintenance expenditures as a percentage of total highway expenditures also
declined during the same period but at a smaller rate, from about 16 percent to 13 percent
(Table 3.2b).
E. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 1996-2000
3.23  9FYP for Hunan Highway Sector. The 9FYP comprises a total expenditure
volume of Y 23.7 billion (about $2.9 billion equivalent), of which Y 16.8 billion
(70 percent) would be for new road construction and Y 5.8 billion (24 percent) for road
maintenance and upgrading (Table 3.3a).
3.24 The 9FYP financing volume when compared with the 8FYP highway
expenditures would increase by a factor of 3.0. While the construction investments in
absolute terms would increase by a factor of 3.0, and the maintenance expenditures in



- 19 -
absolute terms would grow by a factor of 3.5. The relative share of maintenance would
increase from 21 percent to 24 percent, and the relative proportion of new construction
would remain unchanged at 70 percent.
3.25  Highway sector funding for the 9FYP will come from the following five principal
sources:
(a)   Y 6.0 billion from Road Maintenance Fund;
(b)   Y 5.5 billion from the Highway Key Construction Fund;
(c)   Y 2.9 billion financed by prefectures and counties;
(d)   Y 3.4 billion in subsidies from MOC and MOF; and
(e)   Y 5.8 billion from World Bank loans and other foreign loans.
3.26 The proposed 9FYP (Table 3.4a) contains as the principal investment completion
of the 532 km Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway crossing Hunan from north (Hubei border) to
south (Guangdong Border) and costing Y 12.3 billion (about $1.46 billion equivalent), of
which Y 0.7 billion has been invested during the 8FYP and Y 11.6 billion will be
invested during the 9FYP. The Tucheng-Yizhan Expressway will absorb 54 percent of
highway sector funds for the 9FYP.
3.27  Other important investments of the 9FYP comprise:  (a) Y 1.6 billion for
construction of Changsha-Changde class I auto only national highway; (b) Y 3.5 billion
for eight main provincial highways and two major bridges that are located in the west and
north of Hunan province; and (c) Y 0.75 billion for construction and upgrading of
2,015 km of rural access roads in poverty areas.
3.28 Counterpart Funding. In Hunan, the total project investment for NH2 amounts
to Y 4.2 billion ($0.51 billion), out of which the Bank will finance Y 1.7 billion ($0.2
billion), Y 0.4 billion ($0.05 billion) will be a grant from MOC and the remaining Y 1.7
billion ($0.2 billion) will come from the 9FYP and constitute about 10 percent of the new
construction expenditures for the 9FYP. The Province places the highest priority on this
project providing the necessary financing.
3.29 Maintenance Funding. The total expenditures for the road maintenance in 9FYP
are projected to total Y 5.8 billion, which amounts to 30 percent of total highway
expenditures. The main road maintenance source is the road maintenance fee (RMF) that
provides about 80 percent of the total expenditure for the road maintenance, the
remaining 20 percent is provided in the form of subsidies from MOC and local
governments. Routine and periodic maintenance and road upgrading expenditures would
be two times that of the 8FYP.



- 20 -
3.30  9FYP for Guangdong Highway Sector.  The 9FYP comprises a total
expenditure volume of Y72,464 million (about $8,731 million equivalent), of which
Y 49,983 million (69 percent) would be for new road construction and upgrading or
improvement and Y 16,621 million (23 percent) for road maintenance (Table 3.3b).
3.31  Highway sector funding for the 9FYP will come from the following principal
sources:
(a)   Y 25.5 billion from Road Maintenance Fund;
(b)   Y 13.9 billion from the Highway Key Construction Fund;
(c)   Y 21.1 billion financed by prefectures and counties;
(d)   Y 2.8 billion in subsidies from MOC;
(e)   Y 5.4 billion domestic loans; and
(f)   Y 3.7 billion from World Bank loans and other foreign loans.
3.32 The 9FYP financing volume, when compared with the 8FYP highway
expenditures, would increase by a factor of 2.4. While the construction investments in
absolute terms would increase by a factor of 7.0, the maintenance expenditures in
absolute terms would grow by a factor of 4.0. The relative share of maintenance would
increase from 13 percent to 23 percent, and the relative proportion of new construction
would increase from 24 percent to 69 percent.
3.33  The estimated amount of Y 49,983 million will include the implementation of
major expressway projects:  the construction of the Kaiping-Zhanjiang, Xiaotang-
Gangtang and Gangtag-Taihe sections of expressways estimated at Y 20,699 million; the
class I auto-only and class II highways estimated at Y 27,239 million; and the
construction of local highways and aid-poverty roads at Y 2,045 million (Table 3.4b).
3.34  The investment program is divided into (a) expressway and (b) class I and II
highway subprograms.
(a)   The expressway subprogram comprises 671 km of new construction and
382 km of ongoing construction, at an estimated cost of Y 25.5 billion;
(b)   The class I and II highway subprogram comprises construction and
upgrading of 1,426 km of class I highways at a cost of Y 12.3 billion; and
some 3,735 km of class II highways at a cost of some Y 14.94 billion.
3.35  Counterpart Funding. In Guangdong, the total project investment for NH2
amounts to Y 5.2 billion ($0.63 billion), out of which the Bank will finance Y 1.7 billion
($0.2 billion), Y 0.4 billion ($0.05 billion) will be a grant from MOC, and the remaining
Y 3.1 billion ($0.4 billion) will come from the 9FYP and constitute about 6 percent of the



-21 -
new construction expenditures for the 9FYP. The Province places the highest priority on
this project providing the necessary financing.
3.36 Maintenance Funding. Funding for maintenance comes from the RMF, which is
projected to total Y 25,524 million in 9FYP and provides about 35 percent of all highway
funding in Guangdong. About 65 percent of the RMF is allocated for routine and
periodic maintenance, 12 percent for new construction and road improvement or
upgrading of the national road classes I and II, 9 percent for repayment of loan interest
and the rest (14 percent) for overhead and others. Routine and periodic maintenance
expenditures would increase by about 26 percent over the 8FYP level. At the present time,
GPCD is in the process of adopting the maintenance management systems, such as road
data bank (RDB), pavement management system (PMS) and bridge maintenance system
(BMS) to improve the long-term planning in highway maintenance and management, the
estimation of future funding needs for highway upgrading and maintenance and the
allocation of funds.

4. THE PROJECT
A. ORIGIN AND FORMULATION
4.1   China's 9FYP (1996-2000) emphasizes a reduction in transport bottlenecks that
are now being recognized as a growing constraint to rapid economic development. The
diversification and structural transformation of the economy, toward more light and
agroindustry and more interprovincial trade, coupled with severe capacity constraints of
the railways, are causing an accelerating demand for road transport. This national pattern
also applies to the two project provinces of Guangdong and Hunan, and in particular to
the heavily traveled north-south transport corridor along National Highway 107, the spine
of the densely populated and economically dynamic eastern part of China. This corridor,
the location of the new Beijing-Zhuhai (Jingzhu) Expressway, linking the north and south
of China, crosses the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong over a
distance of approximately 2,500 km and has the highest priority among the 12 national
trunk routes in the NTHS. Once completed, it will connect Beijing with Guangdong's
fast growing Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong. It is designed as a high-grade, high-
performance facility, at a minimum four-lane standard, fully access-controlled, and will
be operated throughout as a toll highway.  Jingzhu is scheduled for substantial
completion by the year 2000.
4.2   The Bank is already heavily involved in the construction of substantial sections of
Jingzhu expressway, between Beijing and Guangzhou (see IBRD map 27558). Under the
ongoing National Highway (NH1) Project, two important sections are presently being
built in Hebei and Henan provinces and are progressing well. Under the Second National
Highway (NH2) Project, two priority sections in northern Guangdong and southern
Hunan will be undertaken. Under a future Third National Highway (NH3) Project that is
at an advanced preparation stage, several important expressway sections as well as a
major Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge under a B-O-T arrangement will be undertaken in
Hubei province. Finally, the newly proposed Fourth National Highway (NH4) Project
will cover two important expressway sections in Hunan and Hubei that will be linked to
the Yangtze bridge B-O-T scheme. These four National Highway Projects constitute a
well thought-out and well balanced series of investment operations, which assist GOC
and the concerned provinces in the timely completion of China's highest-priority
expressway corridor.
B. OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
4.3   Project Objectives. The project is the second in the series of NHI-NH2-NH3-
NH4 projects of Jingzhu expressway in Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Hebei
provinces. It builds on its predecessor NHI and precedes NH3 by about one year and



- 23 -
NH4 by about two years. All four projects in the series would support an integrated
approach to expressway corridor development, with each of the four operations
contributing selected priority sections that will gradually develop into a full corridor
system.
4.4   The specific objectives of the NH2 project are to:
(a)   relieve road transport congestion and improve the integration of
interregional trade and commerce between Hunan and Guangdong by
assisting in the development of two key sections of the NTHS in the
principal North-South transport corridor;
(b)   strengthen institutional capacity at the Hunan and Guangdong Provincial
Communications Departments and related institutions, through provision
of training, technical assistance and equipment, in planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenance of Hunan's and Guangdong's
highway networks;
(c)   develop a policy dialogue in the areas of the commercialization and
corporatization  of  provincial  expressway  companies,  highway
maintenance management, and transport and economic integration; and
(d)   improve the safety of road transport.
4.5   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's program of support in the
highway sector will continue to assist China in the foreseeable future in the financing,
development, and management of this priority expressway system. By helping GOC to
plan and build the NTHS, of which the new Jingzhu Expressway is a key element, the
Bank supports this essential long-term solution to the serious transport problems facing
China, removing bottlenecks, facilitating interprovincial traffic, and promoting long-
distance and transit traffic. This in turn would help arrest a growing regionalism while
furthering the liberalization, facilitation, and cost reduction of transport, key requirements
for market-oriented reforms to succeed. Early completion of the expressway corridor
between Changsha and Guangzhou is vital to rapid future economic development of the
affected regions and would help realize the full economic benefits from large-scale
expressway development. The transport and economic integration study for the Hong
Kong-Guangzhou-Changsha corridor, by focusing on northern Guangdong and southern
Hunan, would help integrate these yet underdeveloped rural areas into the fast-growing
economies of the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong.
4.6   Bank support is also justified by project assistance to institutional development,
which, besides the provision of training and equipment, would include studies on
expressway commercialization and corporatization, and highway maintenance
management. This would facilitate the introduction of market principles and mechanisms
in highway operation, management and maintenance. Bank involvement is also expected
to benefit the design and quality of construction of expressways as well as the



- 24 -
improvement of road traffic safety. NH2 would additionally foster improved practices in
the areas of environment and resettlement of project-affected people, thus supporting the
Bank's country and sector assistance strategies.
C. PROJECT MONITORING
4.7   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the project objectives (PO).
The key indicators are as follows.
PO (a):  (i) reduced congestion levels on roads parallel to the proposed new road
(traffic volume);
(ii) increased average travel speeds on roads parallel to the proposed new
road (km/hr);
PO (b):  (i) enhanced institutional capacity of HPCD and GPCD for specifically
defined areas [technical assistance (TA) person-months];
PO (c):  (i) improved  policy  framework  for highway  commercialization,
maintenance, and economic integration (in each policy area establishment
of action plan and its implementation); and
PO (d):  (i) reduced numbers of traffic accidents (number of fatalities and injuries
on existing roads).
In Annex , the following are delineated:
(a)   More specific description of performance indicators;
(b)   Baseline values;
(c)   Mid-term benchmarks;
(d)   Interim benchmark; and
(e)   Targets for each value.
Parameters, baselines and targeted values were developed by HPCD and GPCD for
review by the Bank and confirmed at negotiations.
4.8   The achievement of project output would be tracked by monitoring indicators,
listed below. Project output can be defined as immediate project targets and initial flows
of services, such as physical quantity (percent of the length of road constructed);
institutional strengthening (training achieved), and quality (safety initiatives,
environmental requirements). The following monitoring indicators were set up for some
of the key project components. There are time-bound monitorable targets that would be



- 25 -
described either as actual physical outputs or as a percentage of components
implemented.
Monitoring Indicators:
(a)   Percentage of the length of XLE (out of 169 km) and XGE constructed
(out of 109 km);
(b)   progress made in the implementation of the training component for HPCD
and GPCD and its affiliated institutions (person-months);
(c)   number of black spots of the highway safety program completed (out of
identified black spots);
(d)   progress made in purchasing equipment for HPCD and GPCD and its
affiliated institutions (as a percentage of its dollar value); and
(e)   progress made on the studies.
The proposed monitorable targets are shown in Annex 1.
D. PROJECT COMPONENTS
4.9   The project comprises the following components:
(a)   Construction of: (i) Xiangtan to Leiyang Expressway (XLE), a 169-km
divided, four-lane, access-controlled toll highway in southern Hunan; and
(ii) Xiaotang to Gantang Expressway (XGE), a 109-km divided, four-lane,
access-controlled toll highway in northern Guangdong. The works would
include construction of administration, service and maintenance facilities
as well as the supply and installation of electrical, electronic and
mechanical (E&M) equipment for tolling, telecommunication, traffic
monitoring, and lighting of interchanges, toll plazas and service areas;
(b)   Interconnecting roads programs in (i) Hunan, consisting of new
construction and upgrading of four roads, with a total length of 39 km,
including a new 16-km divided, four-lane, class I, Xiangtan-Zhuzhou
Highway (XZH), and in (ii) Guangdong, consisting of new construction
and upgrading of 10 short roads, with a total length of 2 km;
(c)   Construction of Loudi-Lianyuan Highway (LLH), an auto-only, access-
controlled, class II, connecting road of 60 km length;
(d)   Construction supervision services for XLE, XGE, the interconnecting
roads programs in Hunan and Guangdong including XZH, and LLH;



- 26 -
(e)   Studies/technical assistance in (i) highway maintenance management in
Hunan, (ii) expressway commercialization and corporatization in Hunan;
(iii) transport  and  economic  integration  in  Guangdong;  and
(iv) expressway safety in Guangdong and Hunan;
(f)   Staff training programs in Hunan and Guangdong, covering all aspects of
highway planning, design, construction, operation, finance and
maintenance; and
(g)   Equipment for: (i) control of construction quality and monitoring of the
environment; (ii) operation and maintenance of XLE and XGE after their
completion; (iii) maintenance of the provincial road network and RDB and
PMS in Hunan.
E. CIVIL WORKS CONSTRUCTION AND SUPERVISION
4.10  Construction of Xiangtan-Leiyang Expressway (XLE). The existing National
Road (NR) 107 between Xiangtan and Leiyang in Hunan is 196 km long and traverses
densely populated and industrial areas, with particularly heavy concentrations in the cities
of Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, Hengyang and Leiyang. The existing road was recently upgraded
to class II standard with a subgrade width of 12 m. The pavement is generally 9 m wide,
with some bridges remaining only 7 m wide. These widths do not allow for separation of
fast- and slow-moving vehicles and result in low travel speeds. Moreover, the pavement
structure is generally weak. Recent large increases in traffic and expected future traffic
growth cannot be accommodated by the existing road beyond 1997 at an acceptable level
of service. Between 1993 and 1994, the average daily traffic (ADT) volume for the
whole road, converted to medium-size trucks, increased from 5,036 to 6,276, a growth of
25 percent. The widening of the existing road is not feasible along most of its length, due
to extensive frontage development and the high number of people that would need to be
resettled.
4.11  To establish the feasibility of XLE along a new alignment, several alternatives
were compared. The chosen alignment is located to the east of the existing NR 107, with
a maximum distance between NR 107 and the expressway alignment of about 20 km in
Hengyang. The alignment was chosen since it optimizes XLE's technical characteristics
and minimizes cost and the number of people to be resettled. It also provides sufficient
space for city development. XLE would be about 169 km long, consisting of four paved
lanes, each 3.75 m wide, with two shoulders at 3.5 m width and a medium at 3.0 m width,
in accordance with MOC's highway design standards. The width of the subgrade is
28.0 m. The width of the shoulders was increased from 2.5 m to 3.5 m to improve traffic
safety, in view of the large number of heavy trucks that will use XLE. The main
technical difficulties of the chosen alignment are (a) the crossing of the Xiangjiang and
the Mishui Rivers, requiring three larle bridges of 938 m, 832 m, and 513 m; and
(b) large earthworks of about 125,000 m /km, with about 50 percent in stonework. About
5 km of the expressway are to be built on soft soils and about 17 km in flood-prone areas



- 27 -
require special treatment. The three largest bridges would allow for extension to six lanes
at a later stage, if the emergency lanes were to be used for this purpose. The expressway
would be operated as a closed toll road and also includes 3 long bridges, 14 medium-size
bridges, 7 small bridges, 843 culverts and 155,900 m3 of retaining walls. One railway
bridge, 21 overpasses and 407 mixed underpasses would be constructed.
4.12  XLE would also include: (a) construction of nine interchanges, (b) three service
areas providing facilities for refueling and vehicle repair, restaurants, parking and resting,
(c) three additional rest areas providing facilities for refueling, parking and resting,
(d) three facilities for expressway administration and maintenance, and (e) electrical and
mechanical installations for toll collection, traffic monitoring, telecommunications and
lighting of all interchanges and annex areas. The preliminary and detailed engineering
designs for the expressway were undertaken and have been completed by the Hunan
Provincial Design Institute of Planning and Survey (HPDIPS) for all civil works. MOC's
Highway Engineering Consulting Corporation in Beijing is designing the electrical and
mechanical works. Preliminary designs were reviewed and approved by MOC. A
detailed description of the technical characteristics of XLE is presented in the project
files. The detailed engineering designs and bidding documents were completed in June.
They were reviewed by a team of Swedish consultants under trust-funding during June/
July 1996 and were found satisfactory.
4.13 Interconnecting Roads Program (IRP) for XLE. Given the high population
density and rapid growth of road transport in the Xiangtan-Zhuzhou-Hengyan-Leiyang
corridor, the opening of XLE would bring significant traffic increases to the existing road
system. While some of these roads have recently been upgraded, HPCD plans to improve
the remaining ones by 2000, the year of the planned opening of XLE. On the basis of a
comprehensive review of all existing and planned roads that would interconnect with
XLE at its nine interchanges, an IRP comprising four longer roads and several shorter
ones, with a total length of 39 km was developed and would be financed under the
project. This IRP is shown in Table 4.1a. Among these 4 roads, the Xiangtan-Zhuzhou
Highway (XZH) is the most important and largest investment. It is a 16-km long, 2x2-
lane, class I road that would link two important cities in Hunan with each other and to the
expressway. This interconnecting road would substantially reduce the distance between
these two cities and support two new development zones. XZH was designed by the
Design Department of the Changsha Communications Institute (CCI) while all other
interconnecting roads were designed by HPDIPS. The technical characteristics of XZH
are presented in the project files. The appraisal mission reviewed the proposed IRP and
confirmed its appropriateness.
4.14 Loudi to Lianyuan Highway (LLH) in Hunan. Construction of an auto-only,
access-controlled class II highway between Loudi and Lianyuan, with a length of 57 km,
has high priority under Hunan's 9FYP. This road would link two important industrial
cities presently lacking appropriate connection and forms part of a new route from
Changsha to Lianyuan, to be extended in future to western Hunan. It would cross the
Changsha-Xiangtan expressway section that is presently under construction with Asian



- 28 -
Development Bank (ADB) financing, pass through the Xiangtan-to-Dashiqiao
subsection of XLE and the proposed XZH between Dashiqiao and Xiangtan, and would
link to a new class I/class II highway between Xiangtan and Loudi where construction is
already ongoing. This new road would improve accessibility to Loudi and Lianyuan
from XLE and would therefore be an important complementary investment to Jingzhu.
The road comprises three interchanges including a 3-km long interconnecting road and
three junctions.  The chosen alignment does not encounter any major technical
difficulties. Engineering design was undertaken and has been completed by the design
department of CCI. The technical characteristics of LLH are presented in the project
files. All works-related cost estimates for LLH were reviewed and finalized by the
appraisal mission.
4.15 Construction of Xiaotang-Gantang Expressway (XGE). The existing NR 107
between Xiaotang (Hunan border) and Guangzhou is 395 km long and traverses mostly
rural areas. The road was recently upgraded to class II with a subgrade width of 12 m in
the south and 8.5 m in the north. This narrow pavement is due to the complex
topography in northern Guangdong. The main technical difficulty for NR 107 is the
crossing of the cities of Lianxian, Yangshan and Qingyuan. Overtaking along the
existing alignment is difficult and dangerous since strong longitudinal slopes slow down
most vehicles. In 1993, ADT for the whole line, converted to medium-size trucks, was
7,500 vehicles. There are two other important north-south roads, NR 106 and NR 105, at
class III or IV standards, and there exists Provincial Road (PR) 1947. These roads are
presently being upgraded, largely under the Bank-supported Guangdong Provincial
Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA). There is also a new 10-km long class I highway in
the north of Pingshi at the Hunan border and a new class II highway between Pingshi and
Ruyuan. Widening of the existing roads is not feasible along most of their lengths, due to
extensive frontage development and the high numbers of people that would need to be
resettled.
4.16 To establish the feasibility of Xiaotang-Gantang-Taihe Expressway along a new
alignment, several alternatives were compared. Any new alignment would have to cross
mountainous areas in the northern part and other topographical barriers in the south. The
chosen alignment differs substantially from the alignment of the existing NR 107,
enabling a large reduction in distance between the Hunan border and Guangzhou, and
giving much improved access to the industrial city of Shaoguan, the largest city in
northern Guangdong with a population of around 3 million inhabitants. While the
existing NR 107, from the Hunan border, takes a southwestern direction, the new
expressway goes to the southeast, in parallel to the existing PR 1947 between Pingshi and
Ruyuan and to the existing NR 323 between Ruyuan and Gantang. The distance between
NR 107 and XGE reaches a maximum of about 70 km in Gantang. The feasibility study
investigated two separate expressway sections, the northern section between the Hunan
border and Shaoguan (Xiaotang-Gantang), and the southern section between Shaoguan
and Guangzhou (Gantang-Taihe).

4.17 The Chinese authorities have requested Bank funding of the northern section,
under the NH2 Project, while the southern section that would be constructed
simultaneously with the northern section, will be financed through Guangdong's own
resources. The southern section between Gantang and Taihe, a distance of 199 km,
would be built as a 2x2-lane expressway in a first stage, to be extended to 2x3 lanes at a
later stage as traffic increases. The feasibility study compared several alternatives and
recommended an alignment passing near Pingshi and Ruyuan. The chosen alignment
optimizes the expressway's technical characteristics, minimizes cost and the number of
people to be resettled. A detailed procurement and implementation schedule for the
northern and southern sections is presented in Annex 2.
4.18  XGE would be about 110 km long and is being designed in accordance with
MOC's highway design standards. Some 73 km, between Lingshi Ba and Ruyuan, are
located in mountainous terrain, while some 37 km between Xiaotang to Lingshi Ba,
Ruyuan and Gantang are located in heavy rolling terrain. In mountainous terrain, the
design speed is 80 km/h, and the cross-section consists of four paved lanes, each 3.75 m
wide, two emergency lanes 2 m wide, two berms at 0.75 m and a median at 2.5 m. The
width of the subgrade is 23 m. In heavy rolling terrain, the design speed is 100 km/h and
the cross-section consists of four paved lanes, each 3.75 m wide, two emergency lanes at
2.5 m wide, two berms at 1 m and a median at 2.5 m. The width of the subgrade is
24.5 m. The main technical difficulties are: (a) the very mountainous topography
resulting in many tunnels (14 two-lane tubes totaling about 14 km, with 6 more than
1,000 m length, the longest being 2,100 m), many bridges and viaducts (3 very large
bridges of, respectively, 1,593 m, 1,122 m and 648/2 m; 30 long bridges totaling
8,214 m); and (b) substantially more earthworks than usual, about 200,000 m3/km, with
about two thirds in stonework, very deep cuts reaching 50 m and high fills reaching 30 m,
and many retaining walls (about 640,000 m3). The expressway would be operated as a
closed toll road and would also comprise 2 medium-size bridges, 7 small bridges, 270
culverts and 642,000 m3 of retaining walls.  In addition, 25 grade separations, 6
interchanges, 29 pedestrian underpasses, and 22 mixed underpasses would be
constructed.
4.19  XGE would also include construction of: (a) six interchanges, (b) two service
areas providing facilities for refueling, restaurants, hotels, parking and resting, (c) two
rest areas providing facilities for parking and resting, (d) two facilities for administration
and maintenance of XGE, (e) electrical and mechanical installations for toll collection,
traffic monitoring, telecommunications and lighting of toll plazas and all annex areas.
The preliminary and detailed engineering designs for the expressway (northern and
southern sections) were undertaken and have been completed by MOC's Second
Highway Survey and Design Institute (SHSDI) in Wuhan. MOC's HRI is in charge of
the electrical and mechanical works. Preliminary designs were reviewecl and approved by
MOC. The detailed engineering designs and bidding documents will be reviewed by a
team of Austrian consultants under trust funding during March/April 1997. All works
related cost estimates for XGE were reviewed and finalized by the appraisal mission.

4.20 Interconnecting Roads Program (IRP) for XGE. The Guangdong Provincial
Highway Administration Bureau (GPHAB) under GPCD is presently implementing a
substantial Interconnecting Road Program (IRP) in the influence area of XGE,
comprising the upgrading and improvement of 10 national, provincial and county roads,
with a total length of some 240 km. This IRP is in part financed by the Bank-supported
Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA) and in part funded through
Guangdong's own highway resources. The 10 IRP roads are already being linked to the
six interchanges on XGE through a second IRP to be funded under the project, consisting
of 10 short access roads, with a total length of about 2 km. This IRP is shown in Table
4. lb. The appraisal mission reviewed the second IRP and confirmed its appropriateness.
4.21  Construction Supervision. Training programs in construction supervision for
local staff in Hunan and Guangdong would be completed prior to the mobilization of
contractors. This training would be conducted by the two international supervision
consultants that will be selected. The first phase of the training program, prior to the
beginning of construction, would include lecture courses and site visits while the second
phase would comprise on-the-job training to take place during construction of XLE and
XGE.
4.22  In Hunan, the construction supervision organization for XLE would consist of a
joint foreign/local core supervision team to be established around three foreign engineers
(with a total of 108 person-months), with expertise in project/contract management, earth
and pavement works, and bridge construction. The core team would also include four
local engineers and would be located at HPECDC's General Supervisor's Office in
Hengyang where it would be supported by a central laboratory to be staffed with
10 qualified local experts. For field supervision of 11 ICB civil works contracts, four
resident engineer's offices (REO) would be established in Zhuzhou, Hengdong,
Hengyang and Leiyang, staffed with 121 persons. There would also be a logistics staff
comprising 34 persons. A total of 169 local supervisors would be engaged corresponding
to one person per km of expressway construction. Domestic supervising engineers would
provide some 6,500 person-months. Supervision of civil works for XZH and LLH would
be carried out by qualified local supervision teams acceptable to the Bank.  These
supervision arrangements were reviewed and confirmed during negotiations. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province would maintain construction
supervision teams with qualified staff in adequate numbers to ensure that works are
carried out in accordance with technical specifications and that strict quality controls
are exercised on site. Construction quality would also be monitored through routine
project supervision and monthly and quarterly progress reports.
4.23  In Guangdong, the supervision organization for construction of XGE would
consist of a joint foreign/local core supervision team to be established around three
foreign engineers (with a total of 120 person-months) with expertise in project/contract
management, earth and pavement works, and traffic engineering, as well as tunnel and
bridge construction. This core team will be located at GPFC's Supervisor's Office in
Shaoguan and will be supported by a central laboratory to be staffed with 12 qualified



- 31 -
local experts. For field supervision of 13 ICB civil works contracts, 10 REOs will be
established.  They will be staffed with 110 local engineers for field supervision
corresponding to about one engineer per km of expressway construction. Domestic
supervising engineers will provide some 5,000 person-months.  These supervision
arrangements were reviewed and confirmed during negotiations. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province would maintain construction
supervision teams with qualified staff in adequate numbers to ensure that works are
carried out in accordance with technical specifications and that strict quality controls
are exercised on site. Construction quality would also be monitored through routine
project supervision and monthly and quarterly progress reports.
F. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING
4.24 Highway Maintenance Management in Hunan. To improve and modernize
maintenance management in Hunan, HPCD would proceed with a highway maintenance
management study. The overall objective would be to create an efficient maintenance
organization, adjusted to modem management philosophy and using modem technology.
The study will be managed by a Leading Group established in 1996. The Leading Group
will be in charge of the studies and the road safety activities in Hunan Province. The
study will commence in January 1997 and finish before the end of 1998. The study
would: (a) review the institutional arrangements, policies and procedures for highway
maintenance, consistent with the economic reform process; (b) identify expenditures
required to maintain the existing road network, taking budget constraints into
consideration; and (c) formulate and prioritize a multiyear highway maintenance program
for the later part of the 9FYP period. The outcome of the study would include
recommendations on (a) organizational changes; (b) equipment needs; (c) training of
personnel; (d) a model to estimate medium-term maintenance needs; (e) strengthening of
Hunan's RDB and PMS; and (f) development of a BMS. Final terms of reference (TOR)
are available in the project file.  Final TOR were reviewed and agreed during
negotiations. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province shall: (a)
by June 30, 1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the
concerned provincial agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the
results and recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in
accordance with TOR satisfactory to the Bank and furnish a draft final report thereof to
the said Leading Group and the Bank for review and comments; (c) furnish the final
report of said study, taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the
Bank, to the Bank not later than six months following receipt of comments made by the
Bank on said draft final report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to
implement the recommendations set out in saidfinal report.
4.25  In addition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province shall,
by June 30 of each year commencing in 1997 and ending in 2001, furnish an annual
highway condition report for the Bank's review and comments for the previous year,
which would: (a) show the length of each class of highway by condition (excellent, good,
fair and bad) as of December 31 of the previous year; (b) show the completed physical



- 32 -
works and actual expenditures of the previous year against the planned physical targets
and budgeted funds of that year, for new construction, upgrading/improvement,
rehabilitation, periodic maintenance, and routine maintenance; and (c) show the targets
of the highway program for the current year, including new construction, upgrading/
improvement, rehabilitation, periodic maintenance, and routine maintenance, in terms of
planned physical works and planned expenditures.
4.26 Expressway Commercialization and Corporatization in Hunan. This study
would assist HPCD in developing modern thinking in how to finance and manage its new
expressways and would analyze the longer-term options available in financing, managing
and organizing its high-grade highway corporation(s). It would help design a modem
organization in compliance with international standards of financial management, would
ensure that toll revenues are properly collected and managed and that expenditures (both
for investment and for adequate maintenance) are well planned. The study will be
managed by a Leading Group established in 1996. The Leading Group will be in charge
of the studies and the road safety activities in Hunan Province. Final TOR are available
in the project file.  Final TOR were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province shall: (a) by June 30,
1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the concerned provincial
agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the results and
recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in accordance with
TOR satisfactory to the Bank and furnish a draft final report thereof to the said Leading
Group and the Bank for review and comments, (c) furnish the final report of said study,
taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the Bank, to the Bank not
later than six months following receipt of comments made by the Bank on said draft final
report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to implement the recommendations
set out in saidfinal report.
4.27 Road Safety in Hunan. Four road safety components would be undertaken,
concentrating on institutional improvements, training, accident data collection and
analysis, and the identification and implementation of physical measures. The safety
components will be managed by a Leading Group established in 1996. The Leading
Group will be in charge of the studies and the road safety activities in Hunan Province.
The road safety activities should be initiated under the NH2 project and continued under
the NH4 project. First, Hunan's Traffic Engineering Society (TES), during its annual
meetings, would start incorporating road safety issues in its agenda. This would form a
basis toward a developed road safety seminar arrangement that would become an annual
event. The basic concept for the seminar would be to create a better understanding of
road safety, and to learn lessons from other countries about road safety work. Domestic
and international experts would be invited to attend the annual seminar. Second, HPCD
would develop, through TA, a manual on safety at roadworks, enabling the organization
of roadworks under conditions tolerable to road users and workers, and requiring
solutions for, inter alia, comprehensive schemes for work zones and temporary traffic
operations, technological innovations, and monitoring users behavior and traffic. The
overall aim of this effort would be to develop a guideline suitable for roadworks in



- 33 -
Hunan. Different types of roadworks would be examined, from mobile and short-
duration to long-duration roadworks. Equipment and accessories used for temporary
signing, traffic guidance and the protection of workers would be examined. Third, HPCD
would develop, through TA, a safety audit manual, consisting of a series of checklists and
guidelines enabling systematic checking of highway engineering designs to ensure that
they do not contribute to but help reduce accidents. A start was already made through
various design improvements on XLE, for example, on the shapes of its interchanges, the
connections of annex areas to the expressway, or the locations of the maintenance centers.
Fourth, HPCD would undertake through TA the in-house development of a black-spot
analysis and improvement system, comprising the identification of black-spots; design,
funding, implementation of remedial measures; and conducting before and after studies.
The entire length of NR 107 in Hunan would be used to develop and test this system.
Final TOR are available in the project file. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
Hunan Province shall. (a) establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the
concerned provincial agencies to associate with TES and to incorporate road safety
issues into the agenda of its annual meetings, starting in 1997, and organize an annual
road safety seminar in Hunan starting 1998; (b) develop, through TA, a manual on safety
during roadworks, a safety audit schedule, and a program of selected black-spot analysis
and improvement along NR 107, and by June 30, 1999, complete the said three TA
components in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, (c) furnish
the TA results to the Leading Group and the Bank for review and comments; and
(d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to implement the recommendations of the said
TA components, taking into account the comments thereon of the said Leading Group and
the Bank.
4.28 Transport and Economic Integration in Guangdong. This study would
examine the long-term transport and economic integration effects of the transport corridor
between Hong Kong-Macao-Guangzhou-Changsha connecting several inland provinces
to the highly economically active Pearl River Delta. The movement of freight and people
will no longer be dependent on the much overloaded railway link. The completion of the
expressway would help to foster faster economic growth in northern Guangdong and
southern Hunan and promote economic integration of areas along the expressway
corridor. The study would also analyze the advantages of the various transport modes in
an intermodal transport framework and their impact on regional economics. Guangdong
Provincial Economic Research Institute, Xian Highway Transport University and
Guangdong Provincial Transport Association would be responsible for execution of the
study, while coordination would be undertaken by GPCD, with joint involvement of the
World Bank Finance Office and Research Institute under GPCD. Final TOR are
available in the project file. Final TOR were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province shall: (a) by June
30, 1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the concerned
provincial agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the results and
recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in accordance with
TOR satisfactory to the Bank and furnish a draft final report thereof to the said Leading
Group and the Bank for review and comments; (c) furnish the final report of said study,



- 34 -
taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the Bank, to the Bank not
later than six months following receipt of comments made by the Bank on said draftfinal
report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to implement the recommendations
set out in saidfinal report.
4.29 Expressway Safety in Guangdong. With the rapid expansion of the expressway
network in Guangdong, there is an increasing need to review the issue of road safety. Of
particular importance are the treatment and application of road safety knowledge and
techniques in the areas of traffic engineering design and in the operation and management
of expressways. The proposed TA would address the practical aspects of expressway
safety, with a view to develop implementable recommendations. In the course of this
work, standards, manuals, handbooks and operational procedures for incident
management, guarding and lighting of road works, expressway signing, marking and
lighting, traffic control and surveillance provisions, traffic management procedures, and
preferred organizational structure for expressway safety management would be
developed. Standards and manuals that are to be produced under the study would be
adjusted to the situation in Guangdong, in accordance with guidelines from MOC. Final
TOR are available in the project file. Final TOR for this TA were reviewed and agreed
during negotiations. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province
shall: (a) by June 30, 1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the
concerned provincial agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the
results and recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in
accordance with TOR satisfactory to the Bank andfurnish a draftfinal report thereof to
the said Leading Group and the Bank for review and comments; (c) furnish the final
report of said study, taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the
Bank to the Bank not later than six months following receipt of comments made by the
Bank on said draft final report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to
implement the recommendations set out in saidfinal report.
4.30 Training in Hunan. The training program would mainly focus on highway
planning and engineering design, construction and its supervision, maintenance and
operations management, including, but not limited to quality control, budget planning,
engineering economics, and road safety. The program would aim at training of
personnel needed for the project to guarantee its smooth implementation and progress. It
would also cover professional training on the part of personnel in the transport sector and
professional training for trainers. A training program has been prepared, which will
include the training of 80 people to be trained overseas for 110 person-months while 721
people will be trained in China. Three foreign experts will be engaged for about
3 person-months in the domestic training program. Detailed documentation and a
summary of the proposed training program is available in the project file. The training
program was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that Hunan Province shall, by June 30 of each year and commencing in
1997, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation program to the Bank for
approval and shall carry out the training under the approved program.



- 35 -
4.31  Training in Guangdong. The proposed program in construction supervision
training would focus on contract management, FIDIC conditions of contract, cost
management, construction management, quality and progress control. In addition to the
training in construction supervision, a series of training programs would be conducted in
project planning and design, highway engineering, construction, highway maintenance
and operation management. Depending on the nature of the training, the courses would
be provided either in China, by local institutions, or abroad, by foreign consultants. It has
been proposed that 108 people (122 person-months) will attend overseas training while
752 people (672 person-months) will be given domestic training. The proposed training
programs build on training that is being undertaken and nearing completion under the
ongoing Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA).   Detailed
documentation and a summary of the proposed training is available in the project file.
The training program was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province shall, by June 30 of each year and
commencing in 1997, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation program to the
Bank for approval and would carry out the training under the approved program.
4.32  Equipment. Equipment to be provided under the project has been identified by
GPFC and HPCD and reviewed by the Bank. Agreed equipment lists including cost
estimates are available in the project file. These lists include, for both provinces,
equipment items required for expressway operation and maintenance, strengthening of
central laboratories, and environmental monitoring. In the case of Hunan, selected
equipment items for RDB and PMS development as well as for the maintenance of the
provincial highway network are also included. In Guangdong, the equipment list has
taken into consideration those items that were already procured under the ongoing
Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA). All equipment lists as
proposed by Hunan Province and Guangdong Province including cost estimates were
reviewed and confirmed during negotiations.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.33  Hunan.  An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for XLE and its
interconnecting roads was carried out by the Highway Research Institute (HRI) of MOC
and an EIA report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental
Assessment (EA) Summary were submitted to the Bank in March 1995. These
documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with HPCD during the preparation
missions in April and July 1995. Based on the Bank's comments, the revised EIA
reports, EAPs for XLE including its interconnecting roads, and the EA Summary were
submitted to the Bank in September 1995 for review. These documents were further
reviewed and discussed during the preappraisal mission in November 1995. The EIA and
EAP for LLH, and an EIA report for XZH were also reviewed by the Bank at that time.
The final EIA reports, EAPs and EA Summary covering XLE and its interconnecting
roads, LLH and XZH, were submitted in January 1996 and found to be satisfactory to the
Bank.



- 36 -
4.34 Guangdong. An EIA for XGE including its interconnecting roads was carried
out by the Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute (SSSRI) of MOC, and an EIA
report, an EAP, and an EA Summary were submitted to the Bank in May 1995. These
documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with GPCD during the preparation
mission in July 1995. Based on the Bank's comments, the revised EIA reports, EAPs,
and the EA Summary for XGE and its interconnecting roads were submitted to the Bank
in September 1995 for review. These documents were further reviewed and discussed
during the preappraisal mission in November 1995. The final EIA reports, EAPs and EA
Summary covering XGE and its interconnecting roads were submitted in January 1996
and found to be satisfactory to the Bank.
4.35  Ii both Hunan and Guangdong sections, major environmental impacts during the
construction period will include noise and dust, alteration of hydrological regimes, soil
erosion, interference with local people and traffic, and impacts on the local ecology and
on irrigation systems. Among others, noise and dust, and soil erosion would be most
serious. In addition, on XGE, in view of the large quantities of cut and fill works,
particular attention was paid to the impacts of transportation of construction materials.
Traffic noise and vehicle exhaust, soil erosion, and water pollution from service areas
were identified as major adverse impacts during the operation period.
4.36  The EAPs specify the appropriate mitigation measures, environmental monitoring
plans, institutional arrangements for their implementation, training and equipment
requirements, and budget needed for environmental protection. On both XLE and XGE,
major mitigation measures in the construction phase will include optimum planning of
earthworks to reduce damage to be caused by borrow and spoil works, appropriate design
of overpasses/underpasses to minimize interference with local people and traffic,
reconstruction of irrigation and drainage systems where appropriate, and water sprinkling
to reduce dust. On XGE, particular attention will be paid to optimum use of excavated
soil for filling works, and reduction of impacts of borrow material hauling trucks.
4.37  On both XLE and XGE, major mitigation measures in the operation phase will
include construction of noise barriers, construction/heightening of fences around the
residences to reduce traffic noise, strengthening of vehicle emission inspections and
better maintenance of vehicles to minimize air pollution problems, and afforestation to
improve landscape and reduce air pollution. The engineering design and technical
specifications for the expressways incorporate appropriate measures required for
environmental protection. It was ascertained that the proposed expressways and their
interconnecting roads, and other highways included in the NH2 Project in both Hunan
and Guangdong will not affect ecologically sensitive areas and that their construction and
operation should have no adverse impacts on the environment through the
implementation of EAPs. The summary of the EIAs and EAPs are presented in Annexes
3a and 3b, and copies of the EIAs and EAPs are available in the Project File and are also
available through the Public Information Center (PIC). Assurances were obtained at
negotiations from Hunan Province and Guangdong Province that: (a) the environmental
protection measures stipulated in the EAPs with respect to XLE and its interconnecting



- 37 -
roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads shall be carried out in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) Hunan Province and Guangdong Province shall
each furnish to the Bank annual environmental monitoring reports for XLE and its
interconnecting roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads during their
construction phases and for each of the first three years following their construction
completion.
H. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
4.38  Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for the project were prepared by the
Resettlement Offices (ROs) of GPFC and HPECDC for the two project provinces based
on the following laws and regulations:
(a)   The Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China for Land
Acquisition and Resettlement (1986);
(b)   Implementation Regulations for Land Administration of the People's
Republic of China (1991); and
(c)   Provincial and municipal regulations as listed in Annexes 4a and 4b.
4.39  Objectives. The RAPs establish the basis for land acquisition and resettlement in
the project and respond to the general Bank guidelines on involuntary resettlement. The
basic objectives of the RAPs are to: (a) minimize resettlement; (b) improve the standards
of living of the project-affected persons (PAPs) or at least to restore them; (c) consult the
affected communities on the project impact, entitlements, and rehabilitation measures;
(d) compensate the villages for land and the PAPs for their lost assets at replacement
value without depreciation; (e) provide land to the PAPs whose land is affected by
readjusting the village land; (f) provide alternative jobs to the PAPs losing agricultural
land if the land endowment of affected villages do not permit readjustment; (g) ensure
that PAPs whose jobs are affected through affected enterprises are provided with similar
employment in new enterprises; (h) compensate the disrupted infrastructure; (i) establish
the time schedule and the budget of the resettlement component of the project; (j) devise
a mechanism for grievance and appeals; and (k) devise internal and independent
monitoring.
4.40  The RAPs meet the general standards of transport sector RAPs for China and the
Bank Guidelines for Involuntary Resettlement. The RAPs are reviewed in detail in
Annexes 4a and 4b. Assurances were obtained at negotiations from Hunan and
Guangdong Provinces that all land acquisition and resettlement activities with respect to
XLE and its interconnecting roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads
shall be completed in accordance with the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.41  Institutional Strengthening. The project addressed this issue by encouraging the

collaboration of local administrations and then sharing the data with the same local
offices. This approach also facilitated the consultation process at all levels, while
connecting the resettlement component of the project with the civil works by
superimposing the population and asset data on preliminary design maps. This approach
can lead to further reductions in resettlement and its cost in future transport projects by
improving resettlement minimization during preliminary design.
4.42  Adverse Impact of NH2 Project. The project will lead to permanent acquisition
of 32,785 mu, temporary acquisition of 4,958 mu of land, and removal of 1,828 private
houses in the two provinces. Most of the effect on houses will be in the more densely
populated Hunan Province. In Guangdong, the expressway will be shorter and pass
through a sparsely populated region of the province, affecting only 281 private houses.
Total number of households affected by the project will be 8,816 with a total population
of 39,167. Overall, 8,239 persons will need to relocate their houses, while another 30,926
will lose land only, of whom 1,433 would be transferred from agriculture to enterprise
employment due to limited land availability. Total enterprises affected by the project will
be 14 with an employment of 354 employees. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
from Hunan Province and Guangdong Province that the monitoring of the effectiveness
and socioeconomic impact of the resettlement activities with respect to XLE and its
interconnecting roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads shall be
carried out in accordance with the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank
4.43 Outstanding Issues Resolved During the Appraisal. The appraisal mission
ensured that all the points raised during the Bank's review of the RAPs were addressed
by the borrowers. Issues relating to consultation with the local units on land readjustment
has been completed, and a clear understanding was reached between the Provincial
Resettlement Offices and the Local Units on the extent and nature of resettlement impacts
and policies of compensation and rehabilitation. Surplus labor is being resettled after
consultation with them. PAPs will be able to exercise their choice among available
employment opportunities. Enterprises are being consulted on the terms of compensation
and timing of relocation to ensure the continuity of operations and the employment of
their workers. The mission observed that the PAPs were satisfied with the resettlement
altematives provided and the choices that they made. Selection and compensation of
enterprises that will employ the surplus labor is also being carried out with the
participation of all affected parties.
I. COST ESTIMATES
4.44  The total project is estimated to cost Y 9.40 billion or $1.13 billion equivalent,
including land acquisition, and physical and price contingencies as summarized in the
following table and as detailed in the Consolidated Project Cost Summary for Hunan and
Guangdong provinces and in Tables 4.2a and 4.2b. This estimate does not include taxes
which are estimated at Y 240 million. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at about
$432 million, or about 38 percent of the total. Base costs were estimated in late 1995
prices and were updated to 1996 prices in Hunan and Guangdong during project appraisal



- 39 -
and reconfirmed during negotiations. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent
of the base cost of civil and E&M works and construction supervision services. Price
contingencies have been calculated for foreign costs, using international annual escalation
factors of 2.3 percent in 1997, and 2.5 percent in each of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and
2002. Price contingencies for local costs are based on local annual escalation factors of
8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998, 6.5 percent in 1999, and 6.2 percent in each of
2000, 2001, and 2002.

/a Expressway civil works contracts in Guangdong include several short sections of interconnecting roads totaling about 2 km in
the amount of Y 10 million.
4.45    The costs of civil works are based on work quantities calculated from  detailed
engineering designs in Hunan and preliminary engineering designs in Guangdong. The
costs were computed on the basis of MOC's standard manuals for labor and equipment
productivity, the related, annually updated costs, and the current market costs of
materials, labor, and equipment. The unit rates were checked against the unit prices
provided in recent bids for similar highway works executed under Bank financing in
Guangdong and ADB financing in Hunan.
4.46    The estimated cost of equipment is based on prevailing prices and those quoted by
manufacturers and suppliers and includes the cost of equipment delivered in Guangzhou
under the Bank's ongoing highway project and in Changsha under the ongoing ADB
highway project, spare parts, and related training, if needed, to operate and maintain the
equipment. The estimated cost of consulting services is based on recent contracts for
similar services under the Bank's ongoing highway project in Guangdong and under the
ongoing ADB highway project in Hunan.
J. FINANCING
4.47    The Bank loan of $400 million would finance about 35 percent of the total project
cost or about 93 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Central Government (MOC)



- 41 -
would provide the equivalent of about $153.8 million (14 percent of the total), while the
Hunan and Guangdong provincial governments would provide the equivalent of about
$579 million (51 percent of the total) to meet the remaining costs of the project, including
contingencies.  MOC's funding would be restricted to the construction of the
expressways. The details of project financing for Hunan and Guangdong are shown
below and in Tables 4.3a and 4.3b.

4.48 The Bank loan, of which $200 million would be for Hunan and $200 million for
Guangdong, would be at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based, US dollar, single
currency loans. It would be lent to the Borrower for a maturity of 20 years, including
5 years of grace. The proceeds of the Bank loan would be made available to Hunan and
Guangdong Provinces at the same rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower with
0.75 percent per year commitment fee on the outstanding balance, beginning 60 days
after loan signing, less any waiver. Agreement was reached with the Borrower at
negotiations that it shall onlend the proceeds of the loan to Hunan Province and
Guangdong Province on these terms.  The Hunan and Guangdong provincial
governments would bear the foreign exchange risks on their portions of the loan. The



- 42 -
Government of China and Hunan and Guangdong Provinces have selected LIBOR-based,
US dollar, single currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of
the foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of
their liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar
denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full
maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-
year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk.
K. IMPLEMENTATION
4.49 Implementing Agencies. In Hunan HPECDC would be the executing agency for
XLE and its interconnecting roads, including XZH. HPECDC would also be the
executing agency for LLH. HPCD would be the executing agency for the Highway
Maintenance Management and the Expressway Commercialization and Corporatization
studies and the Road Safety Program. In Guangdong, GPFC would be the executing
agency for XGE and its interconnecting roads. GPFC would also be the executing
agency for the technical assistance on expressway safety while GPCD would undertake
the transport and economic integration study.  The PCDs in both provinces have
submitted project implementation plans (PIPs) for their respective project components
that the Bank found to be generally satisfactory. These PIPs are available in the Project
File. The Hunan and Guangdong PIPs were revised and agreed during negotiations.
4.50  Expressways and Interconnecting Roads. Detailed designs and technical bid
documents are being completed in both provinces. Foreign experts from Sweden visited
Hunan Province in July/August 1996, while in Guangdong, the experts from Austria will
visit during late 1996/early 1997 to review designs and bid documents. Preparation of
commercial bid documents is being carried out by China International Tendering
Company (CITC) in Hunan and China Machine International Tendering Company
(CMCITC) in Guangdong. Pre-qualification documents, for both provinces, were
released to applicants at the end of March 1996, and the prequalification process was
completed by August/September 1996. Acquisition of land and the resettlement process
are expected to be completed by end-1997 in both Hunan and Guangdong. Supply and
installation of electrical, electronic, and mechanical systems for operation of XLE and
XGE is scheduled to commence around the end of 1998, and be completed by the end
2000. The construction of service facilities along XLE and XGE would be a continuous
process during the project implementation period. XLE and XGE are expected to be
completed by 2001.
4.51  Construction Supervision. Construction supervision services for XLE and XGE
would be carried out by two joint local/foreign supervision teams headed by chief
supervision engineers headquarters in Hengyang (Hunan) and in Shaoguan (Guangdong).
There would be a resident engineer for each of the 11 contract sections in Hunan and for
each of the 10 contract sections in Guangdong. About 169 and 110 local personnel would
be permanently engaged in supervision during construction in Hunan and Guangdong,
respectively. Invitations to foreign shortlisted firms were issued separately for the Hunan



- 43 -
and Guangdong sections in April/May 1996, and the selection of consulting firms is
expected to be completed by December 1996. The consultants are expected to mobilize
in early 1997 to help set up the supervision organization in each province prior to the
commencement of civil works and to provide training within the two provinces and
abroad to selected local supervision staff. Most of the supervision training is expected to
be completed by March 1997 in both provinces. Actual construction supervision of XLE
and XGE is expected to start by April 1997 in both provinces. Construction supervision
of LLH would be undertaken by local supervision consultants acceptable to the Bank.
4.52  Training. Formal selection procedures for candidates to be trained would be
developed by the PCDs in Hunan and Guangdong. Those to be trained abroad would be
given two-to-three months of intensive English language training, and each trainee would
be required to submit a report on training received to his/her parent department or agency.
Moreover, the PCDs of Hunan and Guangdong have indicated that training under the
project would be related to career development and the professional growth of the
selected staff. The comprehensive training programs would be open to all highway staff
in both provinces and would be administered by the two PCDs, in coordination with
MOC.
4.53  Equipment.  HPECDC  and GPFC would be responsible for equipment
procurement related to the central laboratories in Hunan and Guangdong, environmental
protection, and operation and maintenance of XLE and XGE, respectively. Preparation of
specifications and bid documents for equipment would be carried out by CITC in Hunan
and CMCITC in Guangdong. Equipment for the central laboratory and environmental
protection would be procured during the first year of project implementation while that
for XLE and XGE operation and maintenance would be procured between 1997 and
1999.  HPCD would be responsible for the procurement of equipment related to
maintenance of Hunan's highway network, and to RDB/PMS.
4.54 Operation and Maintenance of XLE and XGE. Hunan and Guangdong
Provinces intend to operate the XLE and XGE as toll facilities consistent with their
designs. HPECDC and GPFC would be responsible for operating and maintaining the
XLE and XGE, respectively, following their completion. To ensure that the toll rates
would be appropriately structured and that toll levels would not lead to a substantial
reduction in the benefits of highway investment, the rationale for setting the level of
tolling would be determined based on the findings of two studies to be undertaken by the
two project provinces which would take into consideration latest experience with
operation of toll roads in Hunan, Guangdong and the rest of China as well as similar
studies undertaken under Bank-financed highway projects in China. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province and Guangdong Province shall undertake,
and by December 31, 2000, furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, analyses
and recommendations for the structure of toll rates on the XLE and XGE, respectively,
taking into consideration the results of the toll rate structures under Bank-financed



- 44 -
highway projects in China and the recent experience with tolls on high-grade highways
in Hunan, Guangdong and other parts of China.
4.55  The project is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2002, with the loan closing
date stipulated as June 30, 2003. The implementation schedule for the project is
presented in Annex 5.
L. PROCUREMENT
4.56  Procurement under the project would be carried out as shown in Tables 4.4a and
4.4b which details the procurement arrangements separately for the Guangdong and
Hunan project parts. A consolidated summary of procurement is shown below. Goods
and works would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995 and revised in January and
August 1996. The procurement arrangements for the project have taken into account the
experience gained from previous Bank-financed highway projects in China.  The
procurement documentation, including that for prequalification of contractors,
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for
civil works, ICB for goods and consultant services has been standardized for Chinese
conditions in cooperation between the Chinese Government and the Bank. Invitations for
prequalifications or for bids concerning large, specialized, or important contracts (i.e.,
contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $ 10 million or more) would be advertised as
specific procurement notices in the UN Development Business and/or well-known
technical magazines, newspapers, and trade publications of wide international circulation.
Standard documents would be used for all relevant procurement processes under the
project.
4.57 Works. In Hunan, the civil works for XLE would be divided into 11 contract
sections, with an average contract size of $32 million equivalent. Electromechanical
works would be handled as one contract amounting to about $12 million equivalent.
Interconnecting roads including XZH, administration and maintenance buildings, service
areas and toll plazas would be carried out in several small contracts. LLH would be
divided into three contract sections averaging $14 million equivalent. In Guangdong, the
civil works for XGE would be divided into 10 contract sections for road and structures
and 3 contract sections for pavements, with an average contract size of $40 million
equivalent. Electromechanical works would be handled in two contracts, one for traffic
facilities and one for E&M in tunnels. Administration and maintenance buildings,
service areas, and toll gates would be carried out in several small contracts. The
interconnecting roads (several short road sections) would be included in the
corresponding contract sections for XGE because of the small size of the works involved.
4.58  The 11 civil works contracts and 1 electromechanical works contract for XLE, the
13 civil works contracts and 2 electromechanical works contracts for XGE, and the three
civil works contracts for LLH, with an estimated total cost of about $943 million would
be procured following ICB procedures. Contracts would be bid on a slice-and-package

basis; qualified contractors would be allowed to bid for more than one contract so as to
attract  international  and  large  Chinese  contractors.    The  three  contracts  for
electromechanical works would be bid later during the construction of XLE and XGE.
All bidders for the 24 civil works contracts would be prequalified. Domestic contractors
competing under ICB procedures would be eligible for a 7.5 percent price preference.
Domestic bidders are expected to be competitive for all contracts under this project.

Notes: (1)  Figures in parentheses represent the amounts financed by the Bank Group.
(2) All figures are rounded and include estimated physical and price contingencies but exclude the
cost of land acquisition and resettlement which is shown separately.
4.59   Other works, including interconnecting roads in Hunan and small service facilities
such as toll stations, maintenance depots, service and rest areas, and administrative
buildings in Hunan and Guangdong would be awarded following NCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank. These works would involve contracts estimated to cost less than



- 46 -
$10 million per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $57.0 million for
Hunan and $24.6 million for Guangdong. Since these contracts are small in value and
scattered along XLE and XGE and would be implemented over a four-year period, ICB
would be neither justified nor practical, but international firms would not be precluded
from bidding.
4.60 Equipment. Generally, all contracts for goods and equipment costing more than
$250,000 equivalent would be awarded under ICB. However, for equipment where the
number of suppliers is small, limited international bidding would be followed, in an
aggregate amount not exceeding $2 million for each province. All other items or groups
of items covering minor maintenance equipment, equipment for RDB and PMS,
laboratories, research and environmental protection purposes estimated to cost less than
$250,000 per contract package, in an aggregate amount not exceeding $3 million for each
province, would be procured following international shopping procedures on the basis of
comparison of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers from at least two
countries eligible under the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Domestic manufactures
competing under ICB would be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of
bids of 15 percent for goods, or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower.
4.61  Consultants.  All consultants required for construction supervision (in the
amount of $23.4 million), staff training ($4.1 million), technical assistance and studies
($1.7 million) would be selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Local expertise
available in the various provincial universities and institutes in the highway sector would
be used as much as possible.
4.62 Advance Contracting. HPCD and GPCD have requested advance contracting
and retroactive financing in the following areas:
(a)   Consultants for Construction Supervision of XLE and XGE. This
would allow for training of local staff and startup of construction
supervision by the time contracts are signed with contractors.  The
amounts subject to retroactive financing are estimated at $1 million each
for Hunan and Guangdong.
(b)   Laboratory Equipment for Joint Local/Foreign Supervision Teams.
This would permit effective and timely construction supervision. The
amounts subject to retroactive financing are estimated at $0.2 million each
in Hunan and Guangdong.
(c)   Construction of Xiangtan-Leiyang Expressway (XLE). Early start of
construction of the 2x2-lane, 169-km XLE would help alleviate severe
traffic bottlenecks and reduce traffic in the heavily trafficked Xiangtan-
Zhuzhou-Hengyang-Leiyang corridor. The amount subject to retroactive
financing is estimated at $15 million for Hunan.



- 47 -
(d)   Construction of Xiangtan-Zhuzhou Highway (XZH). Early completion
of this 2x2-lane, 16-km long highway would also help alleviate severe
traffic bottlenecks and reduce traffic accidents on this heavily trafficked
road.  The amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at
$3 million for Hunan.
4.63  Agreement to the above four requests for advance contracting and retroactive
financing is recommended, subject to HPCD and GPCD completing all Bank
requirements, including those for procurement, environment, and resettlement. The total
amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at about $20.4 million, well below
the 10 percent limit of the proposed $400 million loan. All of this amount would apply to
expenditures after June 30, 1996.
4.64 Bank Review. Prior review procedures would be used for: (a) civil works
contracts with an estimated cost of $2 million (Y 17 million) or more; (b) equipment with
an estimated value of more than $250,000 per contract, and (c) consulting services with
an estimated contract cost of more than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals.
This represents about 83 percent and 78 percent of the estimated value of works and
equipment contracts, respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-
review procedures would be followed.
M. DISBURSEMENTS
4.65  The proposed Bank loan of $400 million would be disbursed over a period of
about five years, as shown in the table below. To facilitate disbursements, two Special
Accounts would be opened, one in Hunan and one in Guangdong, with an authorized
allocation of $14 million in Hunan and $14 million in Guangdong, the estimated average
expenditures for a four-month period. The accounts would be opened in US dollars in
local banks acceptable to the Bank and would be managed by the Hunan and Guangdong
Provincial Finance Bureaus. Applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts
would be submitted monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn down to
50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever comes first.  A schedule of estimated
disbursements is given in Table 4.5, which takes into consideration the project
disbursement profile for transport projects in China and the potential risks of delay in
project implementation.
4.66 Disbursements would be made against authorized payment requests for work done
under priced contracts for the civil works and for the delivery and installation of the
equipment. Interim certification of civil works completed and estimated at unit rates in
the contracts would be prepared by the contractors, reviewed by the supervision
teams/units and payments authorized by the Hunan and Guangdong PCDs. Retroactive
financing of up to $19.2 million in Hunan and $1.2 million in Guangdong (5 percent of
total loan amount) would be applied to expenditures made after June 30, 1996, for
consultants for construction supervision of XLE and XGE, laboratory equipment for joint
local/foreign supervision teams in Hunan and Guangdong, and construction of Xiangtan-



- 48 -
Leiyang expressway and Xiangtan-Zhuzhou highway. Disbursements for staff training in
China or abroad would be made against the actual costs of travel, subsistence, and tuition
or training fees. For expenditures relating to contracts for works of $2 million equivalent
or less, training, and contracts for goods, each valued at $250,000 equivalent or less, and
contracts for services each valued at $100,000 equivalent or less for firns and $50,000
equivalent or less for individuals, reimbursement would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained
by the implementation agencies and made available for review by the Bank supervision
missions.

N. AUDITING
4.67   The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Auditing Administration
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing the project expenditures. Actual audits would
be carried out for SAA by the Hunan and Guangdong Branches of SAA or the Hunan and
Guangdong Provincial Audit Administrations. Assurances were obtained from Hunan



-49 -
Province and Guangdong Province during negotiations that the project accounts and the
Special Accounts, including SOEs, shall be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and that audit reports would be sent to the Bank for review within
six months of the close of each fiscal year. In the case of the SOEs, the audit reports
would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the SOEs submitted
during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals. The Bank Group
currently accepts SAA audits for this purpose.
0. PROJECT SUPERVISION, MONITORING, AND REPORTING
4.68  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is
presented in Annex 6. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at
headquarters for project-related activities comprising, inter alia, supervision reports,
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment, and follow-up
and review of the agreed studies, as well as for efforts related to coordination between the
two project provinces. Moreover, the Bank would monitor progress of implementation of
all project components through quarterly progress reports to be submitted to the Bank
independently by HPCD and GPCD on their respective project components. In addition,
both PCDs would submit to the Bank monthly reports on works progress for XLE, LLH,
XZH, and XGE. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the project, the
total time expended on supervision would be in the order of 100 person-weeks.
4.69  Monitoring.  During implementation, project performance, including the
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives would be
monitored by HPCD, HPECDC, GPCD, and GPFC through the use of performance
indicators, reports on the environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress
reports and auditing of project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be
reviewed in an Implementation Completion Report. Annex I presents the outline
monitoring plan for the project. Each of the project components indices will track annual
progress in attaining targets during implementation and impact objectives after the project
is completed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province and
Guangdong Province shall, on the basis of performance indicators acceptable to the
Bank, prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly report, and by June 30 of each year
commencing in 1997 and ending three years after completion of the project, an annual
monitoring report, in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of the
project and assessing the extent to which different implementation and development
impact objectives are being attained in the course ofproject execution and operation.
4.70 Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 1, HPCD and
GPCD will submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on
the following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given
year:



- 50 -
(a)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration
strategies followed and the number of people rehabilitated (Annexes 4a
andA4);
(b)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase
and the first three years of the operation phase of the XLE, LLH, XZH,
and XGE (Annex 1);
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements
(para. 4.67);
(d)   Quarterly progress reports for all project activities (including highway
safety) and up-to-date performance indicators (para. 4.69);
(e)   Reports, by an independent agency/expert, on the completion of the
Guangdong and Hunan highway safety components within six months of
the completion of these component; and
(f)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.1   The economic evaluation focuses mainly on the following two segments of the
Guangdong-Hunan expressway corridor that the Chinese authorities intend to complete
by the year 2000: (a) Xiangtan-Leiyang segment (168.8 km) in southern Hunan, and
(b) Xiaotang-Gantang segment (108.7 km) in northern Guangdong. Both segments
would be financed by the Bank under the proposed NH2 Project and would account for
over 91 percent of the project base cost. To assess the overall feasibility of the planned
expressway corridor, the entire Guangzhou-Changsha corridor was also analyzed. The
corridor comprises the two segments described above plus three other segments, under
construction or to be financed by other sources, with a total length of 659.0 km.
Additionally, the construction of Loudi-Lianyuan highway and of Zhuzhou-Xiangtan
highway in Hunan was also evaluated which both account for 6 percent of the project
base cost.
A. EVALUATION OF THE EXPRESSWAYS
5.2   Benefits and Beneficiaries. The proposed expressway corridor passes through
the provinces of Hunan and Guangdong. This region now enjoys large economic and
regional advantages and strategic importance, being the central axis for distribution of
productive forces, with abundant natural resources and well-developing economies,
functioning as an important traffic corridor between Beijing and Hong Kong. However,
as the rapid development of the economy in the region has stimulated a rapid growth of
increasing numbers of vehicles passing through the region from neighboring cities as well
as provinces, transportation in this region has become a bottleneck to the development of
the national economy and society, with, in general, poor transport facilities, saturated
railway lines, traffic congestion on highways, and the withering of water transport. Thus,
it is urgent to build an expressway connecting Hunan and Guangdong, and particularly
the segment between Xiangtan and Leiyang in Hunan, to link up with the south and north
transportation in Hunan and the segment between Xiaotang and Gantang in Guangdong to
link up Guangdong Province with the inland provinces.
5.3   The major quantifiable benefits of the project are the reduction on vehicle
operating costs and time costs of road users. The expressways will have shorter lengths,
improved surface conditions and riding comfort, improved geometry, reduced traffic
interference, and better safety facilities than the existing roads. Therefore, most of the
long-distance traffic and some of the local traffic is expected to divert from the existing
roads to the new expressways, reducing the vehicle operating and time costs for the future
expressways users. Because many users will take the expressways, there will be a
reduction in the current congestion levels on the existing roads. Thus, traffic that
continues to use the existing roads will also benefit in the form of time savings due to the



- 52 -
resulting higher travel speeds on the existing roads. Other quantified project benefits are
due to the traffic that is generated as a result of the lowering of transport costs and which
previously did not exist on the existing roads or is existing on other transport modes such
as rail, inland water and air. The newly generated traffic includes traffic resulting from
increased industrial and agricultural production. Other project benefits that have not been
quantified are the reduction in accident costs, the generated traffic on the existing roads
due to the reduction of the current congestion levels, and the positive effects on non-
motorized traffic that uses the existing roads.
5.4   The HDM Model. The project benefits described above were estimated using the
1995 version of the Highways Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM)
developed by the World Bank as a result of 17 years of research and analysis carried out
collaboratively by the Bank and major research institutions around the world. The HDM
model is widely used to analyze the economic consequences of road projects. It predicts,
for a user-defined set of vehicles and traffic levels, the vehicle operating costs and travel
time costs on a given roadway as a function of the vehicle characteristics, roadway
geometry, roadway surface condition (roughness), and congestion level. The model first
computes the free-flow vehicle speeds as a function of the road and vehicle characteristics
and, using these speeds, it computes the actual speeds as a function of the congestion
level. The computed actual speeds are then used to estimate the physical quantities of
resource consumption (for example, liters/km of fuel consumption or hours of delay) that
are multiplied by unit costs to finally obtain the road user costs.
5.5   Data Collection. Data were collected on vehicle fleet characteristics, utilization
and unit costs, and typical road maintenance operations unit costs. The vehicle and
maintenance data were collected from Guangdong and Hunan Provinces separately. The
analysis has shown that the data from the two provinces were similar and could be
combined to yield a unique and high quality set of vehicle and maintenance data that
could be used for the economic evaluation for both provinces. Table 5.1 shows the
resulting vehicle and maintenance input data used in the economic evaluation. The
average number of passengers for buses is 40 and the average payload is 3 tons for
medium trucks and 11 tons for heavy trucks. The number of kilometers driven per year is
65,000 for buses, 50,000 for medium trucks and 75,000 for heavy trucks. The economic
costs were derived from financial costs by deducting taxes and duties, and the value of
time was estimated to be Y 1.00/hour calculated on the basis of annual income for the
region and conservatively assuming that 25 percent of passengers are traveling on work/
business purposes.
5.6   Data describing the existing road characteristics and their current traffic were also
collected in the field. Table 5.2 shows the data collected for each expressway section.
For the economic evaluation, the two expressway's segments to be financed by the Bank
were subdivided into three sections, each to take into account different traffic levels,
design standards and construction costs. The number of expressway sections identified
and evaluated for the entire corridor between Changsha and Guangzhou is nine. Each
expressway section captures the traffic currently on a network of existing roads, which is



- 53 -
represented in the analysis by a representative existing road based on the data collected in
the field. The expressways would be constructed to four-lane standard with access
restricted to normal motor traffic; thus, agricultural tractor and nonmotorized traffic
would be excluded. Due to differences in topography, the average construction cost is
Y 20 million per km in Hunan and Y 40 million per km in Guangdong. The existing
roads have an average road width of 12 m in Hunan and 8.5 m in Guangdong; and the
average gradients are around 3 percent in Hunan and 5 percent in Guangdong. The
average distance savings will be I0 percent in Hunan and 17 percent in Guangdong.
5.7   Projected Traffic.  Comprehensive origin-destination (O-D) surveys were
conducted in the two provinces, covering 43 influence areas in Hunan and 18 in
Guangdong, that provided a good basis for estimating the diverted and the generated
traffic. The survey revealed the following: (a) the current average daily traffic (ADT) is
on average around 10,000 vehicles per day in Hunan and 7,500 vehicles per day in
Guangdong; (b) trucks constitute about 85 percent of ADT; (c) medium trucks represent
about 40 percent of ADT and heavy trucks represent 17 percent of ADT; (d) current
measured vehicle speeds during the most congested hours are about 35 km/hour in Hunan
and about 15 km/hour in Guangdong; (e) current measured vehicle speeds at night are
about 55 km/hour in Hunan and 40 km/hour in Guangdong; (f) the expected speeds on the
expressways are 80 km/hour in Hunan and 70 km/hour in Guangdong; and (g) traffic in
the peak hour is about 7 to 8 percent of the average daily traffic.
5.8   On the basis of the O-D surveys, the diversion of traffic from the existing roads
was estimated to be about 74 percent for Hunan and 55 percent for Guangdong; and the
generated traffic to be about 3 percent of the current traffic in both provinces. Based on
the expected economic growth in the area of influence, traffic is projected to increase at
the following annual rates for the period 1996-2005: 10 percent for cars in both
provinces, 7 percent for commercial vehicles in Hunan, and 14 percent for commercial
vehicles in Guangdong. For the period 2006 to 2019, the growth rate is set at 6 percent
for all vehicles in both provinces.
5.9   Methodology. For each expressway section, the unit road-user costs, in Yuan per
vehicle-km, were estimated using the HDM  model for vehicles traveling on the
expressway and the representative existing road based on the vehicle data shown in Table
5.1 and on the road data shown in Table 5.2. A sample of these unit costs is given in
Table 5.3. The road-user costs are a function of the congestion level of a road.
Therefore, they were computed for a series of traffic levels, and a relationship between
road-user costs and traffic was established for each road. This relationship was then
introduced into a customized economic evaluation model created on an Excel
spreadsheet.
5.10  The Excel model estimates the benefits due to the diverted and generated traffic
on the expressways and the remaining traffic on the existing roads. For the diverted
traffic, the benefits were taken to be the reduction in total transport costs; and for the
generated traffic, the benefits were taken to be one half of the unit benefits of the diverted



- 54 -
traffic, assuming the traffic would have developed in proportion to the reduction in
transport costs. The Excel model takes as inputs the unit road user costs given by HDM
for the "with" and "without" project cases, the length of the expressway and the existing
road, the construction and maintenance costs, and the traffic assumptions; and gives as
outputs the rate of return and the net present value, at a discount rate of 12 percent, of the
proposed project. The expressways are assumed to be constructed in 4 years, opening to
traffic in 2000; the economic life of the expressways was assumed to be 20 years (2000-
2019), and the residual value to be 50 percent of the initial construction cost. Table 5.4
shows, as an example, the resulting outputs for the Xiaotang-Daqiao section.
5.11   Results. The following table presents the resulting Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) (at 12 percent discount rate in Y million)
obtained for each expressway section, each segment to be financed by the Bank, and the
entire corridor. None of the sections evaluated obtained an EIRR below 12 percent. The
sections with lower EIRRs are the ones with higher construction costs within each
province and the section with the highest EIRR, Honghshi-Leiyang in Hunan with 34.2
percent, is the section with the lowest construction costs and high distance savings of 24
percent. The EIRR of the segments to be financed by the Bank is 26.3 percent for the
Hunan segment and 18.1 percent for the Guangdong segment yielding a combined EIRR
of 22.1 percent. Compared with the segment in Hunan, the segment in Guangdong, has
higher construction costs, lower traffic, and a lower traffic diversion rate. The EIRR for
the entire corridor is 19.6 percent. Graphs 5.1 to 5.4 present the diverted traffic to the
expressway sections in year 2000, the distance savings, the construction costs per
kilometer, and the resulting EIRR for each section being evaluated.

5.12   Sensitivity Tests. Table 5.5 presents the results of the sensitivity tests. In the
first sensitivity case, construction costs are increased by 15 percent; in the second case,
user benefits are reduced by 15 percent; and in the third case, construction costs are
increased by 15 percent and user benefits are reduced by 15 percent. The results of the
third case indicate that both segments financed by the Bank would be economically
justified even if this pessimistic scenario occurs. The EIRR of the Hunan segment would
be 22.2 percent, the EIRR of the Guangdong segment would be 15.0 percent and the
combined EIRR would be 18.6 percent. In this case, the lower EIRR obtained is 11.4
percent for the Leiyang-Xiaotang section in Hunan.
5.13   The fourth sensitivity test eliminates the value of time and yields a small
reduction on the resulting EIRRs.  In this case the combined EIRR for the two
expressway sections is 20.7 percent and for the entire corridor EIRR is 18.4 percent,
which confirms the low value of time in China and the low percentage of cars in the
traffic composition. The fifth sensitivity test eliminates the generated traffic and yields a
negligible reduction in the resulting EIRRs. In this case the combined EIRR is 21.9
percent and the entire corridor EIRR is 19.3 percent, which indicates the low percentage
of generated traffic adopted in the analysis. The final sensitivity test reduces drastically
the diverted traffic to 50 percent of the estimated values. In this case, the combined EIRR
for both expressway sections is 15.9 percent and the entire corridor EIRR is 13.6 percent,
which indicates that the project expressways and the corridor are economically justified
even under this pessimistic scenario.
5.14   Risk Analysis. A risk analysis for the Bank financed segments and for the entire
corridor was undertaken using the @RISK software that adds risk analysis capabilities to
an Excel spreadsheet following the methodology that is explained briefly in Table 5.6.
For this analysis, all the input estimates defined in the previous paragraphs were adopted
and the uncertainty for the following inputs was defined using a triangle distribution:
(a) the construction costs, (b) the diverted traffic from the existing roads to the
expressways, (c) the generated traffic, and (d) the traffic growth rate.
5.15   For the construction costs, the most likely value was set to the estimated
construction costs, the most likely minimum value was set to be 90 percent of the
estimated construction costs, and the most likely maximum value was set to be 140
percent of the estimated construction costs. These assumptions indicate that there is a
higher probability that the construction costs will be higher rather than lower than the
estimated value. For the other three traffic related inputs, the most likely value was set
to the estimated values, the most likely minimum value was set to be 60 percent of the
estimated values, and the most likely maximum value was set to be 1 10 percent of the
estimated values. These assumptions indicate that there is a higher probability that the
traffic related assumptions will be lower rather than higher than the estimated values.
5.16   With this information, the @RISK software evaluated 400 what-if scenarios,
varying the construction costs and traffic assumptions accordingly to the defined input
probability distributions, yielding an estimated EIRR for each what-if scenario. Graphs



- 56 -
5.5 to 5.10 show the resulting probability distributions for the following cases: (a) the
input multiplier for the construction costs, (b) the input multiplier for the traffic
assumptions, (c) the output EIRR for the Bank-financed Majiahe-Leiyang segment in
Hunan, (d) the output EIRR for the Bank-financed Xiaotang-Gantang segment in
Guangdong, (e) the output EIRR for both segments financed by the Bank, and (f) the
output EIRR for the entire corridor. Finally, the following table presents, for the
segments analyzed with risk analysis, the following: (a) the resulting mean EIRR, (b) the
EIRR standard deviation, and (c) the probability (in percent) that the EIRR will be lower
than 12 percent.
Province         Segment              Mean EIRR    EIRR STD    P<12%
Hunan            Majiahe-Leiyang         22.7           2.1        0.0
Guangdong        Xiaotang-Gantang        15.1           1.7        4.2

Hunan/Guangdong  Entire Corridor         16.5           1.8        1.6
5.17  Conclusion. Both the single point estimation of the Excel model and the risk
analysis performned by @RISK indicate that the rates of return obtained for the segments
to be financed by the Bank and for the entire corridor are greater than 12 percent even
under the most pessimistic scenarios. Therefore, both the project expressways and the
entire corridor are economically justified.
B. EVALUATION OF OTHER HIGHWAYS
5.18 Loudi-Lianyuan. The proposed highway from Loudi to Lianyuan would link
Loudi city and Lianyuan city in central Hunan, an area that is endowed with abundant
mineral resources. The Loudi-Lianyuan highway and the Loudi-Xiangxiang highway
which is under construction will together connect with the provincial capital, Changsha,
and will become an important east-west transport connection in central Hunan. The
existing roads that are related to this project have substandard alignment and pavement
conditions, and carry large traffic volumes leading to serious traffic congestion. The
proposed highway will be a 58.8-km class II, auto-only road with a design speed of
80 km/hr and a road width of 2x6 m.
5.19  It is estimated that the project cost is Y 296 million, the distance saving is 10 km,
and the traffic on the highway after completion will be 3,700 vehicles per day. The
traffic on the existing roads at the completion of the highway is estimated to be 500
vehicles per day and without the highway 3,800 vehicles per day. The resulting
economic evaluation yields a net present value of Y 200 million and a rate of return of
20.7 percent. The sensitivity tests indicate that the rate of return is 18.8, 18.6, and 16.8



- 57-
percent, respectively, for the following cases: (a) costs are increased by 15 percent,
(b) user benefits are reduced by 15 percent, and (c) costs are increased by 15 percent and
user benefits are reduced by 15 percent. Therefore, the highway is economically
justified.
5.20 Zhuzhou-Xiangtan. The proposed highway from Zhuzhou to Xiangtan would
link the two cities and also directly connect with Xiangtan-Leiyang expressway,
assuming an important role in strengthening highway development in the "Golden
Triangle" between Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan. The proposed highway will be a
16.1-km, 2x2 lanes, first-class highway with a design speed of 100 km/hr and a road
width of 24.5 m.
5.21  It is estimated that the project cost is Y 101 million, the distance saving is 15 km,
and the traffic on the highway after completion will be 5,400 vehicles per day. The
traffic on the existing roads at the completion of the new highway is estimated to be
1,500 vehicles per day and without the highway 6,600 vehicles per day. The resulting
economic evaluation yields a net present value of Y 453 million and a rate of return of
47.0 percent. The sensitivity tests indicate that the rate of return is 43.4, 42.8, and 39.5
percent, respectively for the following cases: (a) costs are increased by 15 percent,
(b) user benefits are reduced by 15 percent, (c) costs are increased by 15 percent and user
benefits are reduced by 15 percent. Therefore, the highway is economically justified.
C. OVERALL PROJECT ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.22  The overall project, which includes the expressway sections in Hunan and
Guangdong and the other highways in Hunan, yields a net present value of Y 7,733
million and a rate of return of 22.4 percent.

TABLE 5.6: RISK ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
Standard spreadsheet models analyses combine single "point" estimates of the model's input variables to
predict a single result. Estimates of the input variables are used because the actual values are not known with
certainty. For example:
Revenues = 100                  Costs = 90                       ==>              Profits = 10
In reality, however, things don't always turn out as planned because too conservative or optimistic estimates
may have been adopted. The combined errors in each input variable estimate could lead to real-life result that
is different from the estimated result. With risk analysis, one can explicitly include the uncertainty present in
the estimates to generate results that show all possible outcomes. For example, consider a simple case where
there is uncertainty in both input variables:
Revenues = 100 or 120           Costs = 90 or 80
Possible Profits = >             100-90 = 10             100-80 = 20
120-90 = 30             120-80 = 40
In a risk analysis, one includes the estimate of an input variable and some measure of the likelihood of
occurrence for that variable. The risk analysis will then use this information to analyze every possible
outcome, executing hundreds of what-if scenarios adopting in each case random inputs accordingly to the
input probability distributions. For example, consider this more complex case:
Revenues        Estimated most likely value= 100                         (triangle distribution)
Estimated minimum possible value =90
Estimated maximum possible value = 130
Costs           Estimated mean value = 90                                (normal distribution)
Estimated standard deviation = 20
Results: Scenario I             Revenues = 105.9         Costs= 116.8            Profits = -10.9
Scenario 2              Revenues = 119.5         Costs = 87.2            Profits = 32.3
Scenario 300            Revenues = 103.4         Costs = 86.6            Profits = 16.8
In this case, the results are presented as probability distributions and statistics that give the decision-maker a
complete picture of all possible outcomes. For example, for the case above we have the following results:
. . .~~~~~~~~~~~~.........  .... .. .. ......... .... .. ... ... ............. ....... ............ ....... ............
Mean Profits = 16.7
Standard Deviation of Profits = 22.4
Probability that profits will be lower
than zero = 24.1 percent

ANNEX 1: PROJECT MONITORING INDICATORS
A. PERFORMANCE AND MONITORING INDICATORS FOR KEY PROJECT COMPONENTS
1.    The effectiveness of project implementation in terms of alleviating infrastructure
bottlenecks of Guangdong and Hunan at which the project is targeted, will be measured
by reference to a number of monitoring indicators. The specific project objectives and
the associated monitoring indicators are listed in Table 1. Each indicator will require a
baseline level against which the effectiveness of the project in achieving the design
objectives can be measured. The base data would be September 1996, and HPCD and
GPCD should take the following action to obtain the necessary baseline data and develop
the necessary methodologies for monitoring. The parameters, baseline and targeted
values shown in the table are tentatively estimated by the project team; the baseline data!
methodologies were reviewed and discussed with HPCD and GPCD during the appraisal
and be finalized during negotiations.
2.    The achievement of project output will be monitored by monitoring indicators.
The current monitorable targets are set as shown in Table 2.
B. MONITORING INDICATORS FOR ENVIRONMENT
Construction Period
3.    Environmental Supervision. One of the environmental supervisors in each
contract section will be assigned or nominated to carry out the supervision of the
environmental protection measures addressed in the Environmental Action Plans (EAP)
and integrated in the bid documents. The results will be included in the engineering
supervision reports and reported periodically to the environmental protection staff at the
district level. The results of environmental supervision will be annually reported to the
World Bank through the annual report to the World Bank. The monitoring items will
include:
(a)   brief description on environmental protection measures supervised/
inspected during the reporting period; and
(b)   brief description of problems regarding environmental protection measures
and their reasons and possible solutions.

frequencies, monitoring sites etc. are clearly specified in the EAP (see Annex 3a for the
Hunan section and Annex 3b for the Guangdong section). On the Hunan section, all
environmental monitoring, except motor vehicles noise monitoring, during both
construction and operation will be carried out by the local environmental monitoring
stations through contract with the Xianglei Highway Company and the Loudi-Lianyuan
Highway Company. Noise (motor vehicles, construction equipment, etc.) will be
monitored by the environmental supervision engineers at engineering supervision
stations. On the Guangdong section, the Environmental Monitoring Station (EMS) under
EPD/GPFC will carry out all environmental monitoring works regarding XGE except
noise and dust monitoring during the construction phase, which will be monitored by the
environmental supervisors at the construction contract section. The results will be
reported to the environmental protection staff at the district level and annually to the
World Bank through the annual report to the World Bank.

C. MONITORING OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
8.    The monitoring and evaluation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) agreed
between the Bank and the Borrower will be carried out both internally and externally
(Annexes 4a and 4b). Internal monitoring will be carried out by the Planning Department
and the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Department of ROs of HPECDC and GPFC.
An internal monitoring report will be submitted to the Bank every six months, with the
first one due on March 31, 1996, and the last one on the completion of the land
acquisition and resettlement activities. The Academies of Social Sciences of Hunan and
Guangzhou will conduct the external monitoring of resettlement and will submit a
monitoring report every six months, with the first one to be submitted by June 30, 1997,
and the last one at the completion of the project (December 31, 2002).
9.    The main indicators of land acquisition and resettlement monitoring have been
identified. They are:
(a)   Timely payment of compensation to affected entities of various categories;
(b)   Progress of construction of new houses and quality of construction, also
distance from old houses
(c)   Progress in land redistribution;
(d)   The type of productive use to which compensation amounts have been put
by the local (township and village) governments;
(e)   Restoration of production/business activities of affected enterprises.
Payment of all types of compensation to affected enterprises and workers;
(f)   Propose linkage of resettlement activities with the project implementation
schedule (resettlement to be completed at least one month before start of
construction);
(g)   Restoration of civic infrastructure at the new sites;
(h)   Levels of satisfaction of the affected persons;
(i)   Income levels and standards of living after resettlement.

ANNEX 3a: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION
PLAN SUMMARY (HUNAN SECTION)
1.    Background. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for Xiangtan-Leiyang
Expressway (XLE) was carried out by the Highway Research Institute of MOC. An EIA
report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental Assessment (EA)
Summary were prepared as per the policy and administrative requirements for
environmental assessment of development projects in China and the Bank's OD 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment. The development and review of these documents involved
inputs from various units in the province, the environmental protection bureaus, research
institutions, universities and the affected groups and NGOs along the highways. These
documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with the Hunan Provincial
Communications Department (HPCD) during the preparation mission in April 1995 and
the preappraisal mission in November 1995. The EIA and EAP for the Loudi-Lianyuan
Class II Auto-only Highway (LLH), and an EIA report for the Zhuzhou-Xiangtan
Connecting Road (ZXH), were also reviewed by the Bank during the preappraisal
mission. The final EIA reports, EAPs and EA Summary covering XLE and its eight
connecting roads, LLH and ZXH were submitted to the Bank in January 1996 and found
to be satisfactory to the Bank. A detailed summary of the environmental assessment and
the action plan is available in the project files.
2.    Brief Project Description. The main civil component of the Hunan section
consists of the construction of a 172-km, four-lane expressway between Xiangtan and
Leiyang (XLE); eight connecting roads to XLE; a 16-km, four-lane Class I highway
between Zhuzhou Tiantaishan and Xiangtan Yisuhe (ZXH); and a 60-km, two-lane
Loudi-Lianyuan Class II Auto-only Highway (LLH).  Other components include
institutional strengthening, training programs, highway safety and construction
supervision.
3.    Baseline Environmental Description. The proposed alignment of XLE lies in
the mid-south of the Hunan Province, whose altitude decreases from the middle to both
north and south. Twenty percent of the area along XLE is subject to heavy surface soil
erosion and is becoming more problematic and significant every year. The rivers in the
region belong to the Xiangjiang drainage system, and have water flows all year round.
The well-developed surface water system has become the major water source for
industrial and agricultural production. The area along the proposed road is the most
developed zone in Hunan Province and an important economic belt which not only serves
as the major production base for rice, cotton and oil, but also serves as the base for
metallurgy, building materials, chemistry, textile and food processing industries.
4.    Because of the past development and dense settlement, the original vegetation has
been gradually replaced by the present state of scattered secondary forest and



- 96 -                     ANNEX3a
nonindigenous vegetation, mainly mason pine, China fir, oil-tea tree and citrus forest.
Two nature reserves, the Nanyue Natural Protection Zone in Hengshan and the Niaozhou
Protection Zone (bird sanctuary) in Jiangkou of Hengnan, are both located 23 km and
6 km, respectively, from the proposed alignment. No rare or endangered animal or plant
species were found within the 500-m zone on either side of the proposed roads. Lead,
concentrations in soil samples ranged between 31.6 and 90.3 mg/kg, significantly lower
than 200 mg/kg value recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture as the criterion for
acid soil.
5.    The areas along XLE are rich in tourism resources including scenic spots and
historical sites such as the Yuelu Mountain Park, the Leiyang Pagoda in Hengyang, the
Jiangkou Bird Sand-bar Natural Conservancy, etc. During field investigations, three
potential sites of ancient tombs of Han dynasty were discovered along the alignments.
6.    Atmospheric monitoring data of the past five years and air quality monitoring at
14 sites along the alignment of XLE indicate that NO, and CO concentrations meet the
Class II standards and that TSP (except for two stations) and SO2 (except for one station)
also meet the Class II standards. The connecting roads and LLH was also monitored and
found to be acceptable. Daytime and nighttime noise levels at 21 sites along the
alignment were found to be below the noise standard.
7.    Potential Environmental Impacts and Their Mitigation Measures. The major
potential environmental impacts of XLE, its eight connecting roads, LLH and ZXH and
their mitigation measures are incorporated in their respective Environmental Action Plans
(EAPs). The EAPs stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the EIA will be
dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases, and what institutional
arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAPs during the three
distinct phases. The key elements of the EAPs are summarized below.
Design Phase
8.    Three alternative alignments were considered in the project design phase of the
XLE. The final alignments for XLE, LLH and ZXH were selected to minimize land
acquisition and resettlement costs, potential environmental impacts of the project on
farmlands, residences, schools, cultural relics, flood control and poor geographical and
geological conditions. The design includes a number of passageways, overpasses and
underpasses to facilitate the crossing of the expressway by local people, animals and
vehicles. To reduce soil erosion, arbor, bush, grass and climbing ivy will be planted in
the central strip, side slopes and along the road sides. Additional measures such as
subgrade drainage systems are integrated in the project design, and temporary and
permanent drainage systems will be constructed to minimize soil erosion and alteration of
hydrological regimes. Particular attention will be paid to balance cuts and fills, to locate
borrow areas in waste land, to minimize the use of arable land, and minimize dust and
noise problems.
9.    During the initial operating phase, noise levels at several sensitive locations will
significantly exceed the noise standards used in the initial phase. In later years, as the



- 97 -                     ANNEX 3a
traffic increases, the noise levels will significantly exceed the standards at many more
sensitive sites. To mitigate the short and medium term noise problems, a combination of
measures such as resettlement and installation of noise barriers will be undertaken. In the
long term (2020), noise monitoring will be continued and appropriate mitigation
measures will be taken when the noise monitoring results significantly exceed the
standards. Construction of schools and hospitals will not be allowed within 200 m on
either sides of XLE, and construction of other buildings, within 50 m of XLE, will be
prohibited. Up to the year 2020, CO concentration at all sites is expected to meet the
Class II air quality standards.  In the long term, NOx concentration at Xinting-
Liugongquiao, Liugongquiao-Hongshi and Hongshi-Guanshi sections will slightly exceed
the maximum standards while the daily average NO, concentrations will exceed the
standards at four sections (the three sections mentioned above and the Dashiqiao-Shanpu
Section), with maximum value 110 percent higher than the standards. Along the eight
connecting roads, LLH and ZXH, CO and NOx concentrations at all sensitive sites as
predicted to be within the standard. The long-term air pollution problems caused by
vehicle exhaust gases will be dealt with by improving vehicle emission controls and
strengthening vehicle emissions inspection to reduce the exhaust emissions.
10.   During the cultural relics survey, three ancient tombs, over 2000 years old were
found in the Yangliu village of Guanshi, Hengnan county. An archaeological salvage and
protection plan was developed and integrated in the National Highways 2 Project. All the
salvage activities will be carried out before the start of construction.
11.   Additional design measures include provisions for adequate drainage, wastewater
treatment facilities at three service areas, strengthening of crash barriers at pollution
sensitive locations, and adequate bridge and culvert design to minimize flooding.
Construction Phase
12.   To minimize dust during construction, road surfaces, excavation areas, material
stockpiles, storage areas, and construction sites will be sprayed with water specially near
towns and villages, water supply sources and near sensitive locations. In particular, coal
ash will be kept moist with at least 30 percent moisture content. Asphalt and lime stone
mixing plants will be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m
from residential areas on the leeside of the wind directions. Additional precautions will
include covering of haul trucks and material storage piles, control of exhaust gas, etc.
Construction activities within 150 m from residences will be suspended between
10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., except under exceptional circumstances when a prior written
approval of the local government and the environmental protection bureau will be
required.
13.   Where possible, borrow areas will be restricted to non-forest and non-arable lands,
and topsoil will be saved and returned to the land. Spoil disposal sites will be carefully
selected to minimize disruption to the farmlands. Damage to irrigation systems will be
minimized by construction of temporary channels and conduits and measures will be
taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted waters and silt from construction activities



- 98 -                     ANNEX 3a
into rivers and irrigation channels. Construction camp wastes and sewage will be
collected and treated and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Trees and
grass will be planted on side slopes, and along the roadside, particularly on sections with
high fills and deep cuts.
14.   During construction, effective safety and warning measures will be adopted to
reduce accidents. This will include, minimization of traffic jams, provision of efficient
lighting equipment and safety signs, restriction on blasting time and implementation of
stringent controls at quarries, development of a materials transport plan, etc.
Operation Phase
15.   During the operation phase, emphasis will be placed on better vehicle
maintenance and management to promote safety and to minimize vehicle emissions.
Low-speed, badly maintained old vehicles will be barred from using the expressway.
Periodic campaigns will be undertaken to educate drivers about the unnecessary use of
horns, reduction in night time speed, safe transport of hazardous materials, etc. To avoid
future noise and air pollution problems, construction of residential buildings and schools/
hospitals will be prohibited within 50 m and 200 m, respectively, from the roadside of
XLE, and 50 m and 100 m, respectively, from the roadside of LLH and ZXH.
16.   Environmental Monitoring. During the construction and operation of XLE, its
connecting roads, LLH and ZXH, environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify
the actual impacts on the environment, identify unexpected environmental problems at an
early stage, and to adjust environmental protection measures as appropriate. Local
environmental monitoring stations will be responsible for environmental monitoring of
XLE, its connecting roads and LLH during the construction and operation phases. Motor
vehicle noise will be monitored by the environmental supervision engineers at
engineering supervision stations.
17.   The major items to be monitored during the construction and operation phases
will include air quality, noise and water quality.  Seven noise level meters, four
computers to process environmental data, two fire engines, and five ambulances will be
procured under the project. The detailed monitoring plan is presented in the EAP.
18.  Institutional Arrangements. The Environmental Protection Office (EPO) in
HPCD will be responsible for the overall environmental protection and management of
the highways. The six staff in the EPO will be assisted by the five environmental staff in
the Environmental Protection Section (EPS) who will be responsible for the
environmental aspects of the project during the construction phase. Environmental
monitoring during the construction and the operation phases will be carried out by the
local environmental monitoring stations through contract with the Xianglei and the
Loudi-Lianyuan Highway Companies. Environmental training will be undertaken to
provide adequate training for environmental staff at all levels. The detailed staffing and
training plan is presented in the EAP.

ANNEX 3b: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION
PLAN SUMMARY (GUANGDONG SECTION)
1.    Background. An EIA for Xiaotang-Gantang Expressway (XGE) including its
connecting roads was carried out by the Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute of
MOC. An EIA report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental
Assessment (EA) Summary were prepared as per the policy and administrative
requirements for environmental assessment of development projects in China and the
Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. The development and review of these
documents involved inputs from various units in the province, the environmental
protection bureaus, research institutions, universities and the affected groups and NGOs
along the highways. These documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with
Guangdong Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) and Guangdong Provincial
Freeway Company (GPFC) during the preparation mission in July 1995, and the
preappraisal mission in November 1995. The final EIA report, EAP and EA Summary
covering XGE and its interconnecting roads were submitted to the Bank in January 1996
and found to be satisfactory to the Bank. A detailed summary of the environmental
assessment and the action plan is available in the project files.
2.    Brief Project Description. The main civil component of the Guangdong section
consists of the construction of 110-km, four-lane expressway between Xiaotang and
Gantang (XGE) and the interconnecting roads of XGE. Other components include
institutional strengthening, training programs, long-term studies on transport and
economic integration, technical assistance on expressway safety, and construction
supervision.
3.    Baseline Environmental Description. The proposed alignment of XGE starts
from Xiaotang, on the border with the Hunan province, passes through west Lechang
mountains area and Ruyuan county, and ends in Guantang in the suburb of Shaoguan
City. Generally, the terrain slopes from northwest to southeast. The 73-km section
between Xiaotang and Ruyuan is located in the mountain terrain, while the 37-km section
between Ruyuan and Gantang is located in the heavy rolling terrain. The area is criss-
crossed by the Wujian and Nanshui rivers, neither of which is open to navigation.
4.    Plant resources are abundant and forests cover more than 50 percent of the project
area. However, over the past 100 years, due to the sharp increase in population, various
economic activities, etc., forest vegetation has changed from broad-leaved evergreen
forests to forests with simple tree varieties. As a result, some of the hilly areas have only
sparse bush slopes or bare rocks, and most fine soil has been washed away. The present
vegetation along the alignment are mostly cropland and woodland (shrub and manmade
forests). Thus, only limited wild animals such as hares and pheasants are found along the



-100-                       ANNEX3b
alignment. Lead concentrations in soil sampled at seven sites ranged between 34 and
40 mg/kg, significantly lower than 300 mg/kg value recommended by the Ministry of
Agriculture as the criterion for soil with a pH value of 6.5.
5.    The area surrounding Shaoguan City is rich in tourist resources. The tomb of
Yujing, a Minister of Soong Dynasty, is located approximately 300 m from the alignment
and a field survey identified ancient tombs at two sites along the alignment.
6.    Atmospheric baseline monitoring of TSP, CO, NOx and lead was carried out for
five consecutive days, at five sites along the alignment. At all monitoring sites, CO, NO,
and lead concentrations were much lower than the ambient air quality standards for both
maximum and daily average values. The maximum TSP concentrations were also below
the standard but at three sites, daily average TSP concentrations slightly exceeded the
standards. Of the eight sites monitored for baseline noise, only the Laopinshi town site,
where the alignment is next to the existing National Highway 107, exceeded the noise
standard at night.
7.    Potential Environmental Impacts and Their Mitigation Measures. The major
potential impacts of the XGE and its linking roads and the associated mitigation measures
are summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) of XGE
and its linking roads. The EAP stipulates how the environmental impacts identified in
the EIA will be dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases, and what
institutional arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAP during the
three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAP are summarized below.
Design Phase
8.    Three major alternative alignments were considered at the prefeasibility study and
the selected route (the Ruyuan route) was further refined during the feasibility stage,
using factors such as land minimization, impacts of air and noise pollution on
environmentally sensitive areas, etc. The design includes a number of passageways,
overpasses and underpasses to facilitate the crossing of the expressway by local people,
animals and vehicles. To mitigate soil erosion, trees and grass will be planted on median
divider, side slopes, and along the roadside. Further measures such as slope protection,
temporary and permanent drainage systems are also incorporated in the design. Particular
attention was paid to balance the cuts and fills along the XGE, and in selecting quarries
and borrow sites so as to minimize impact on farmlands and dust and noise problems.
9.    At 16 environmentally sensitive sites, traffic noise during the operation phase will
significantly exceed the assessment criteria, particularly in later years. This will be
mitigated by constructing noise barriers, constructing high fences beside the first row of
residences and schools, by resettlement and by rezoning the first row of houses as
warehouses. While CO concentrations at all sites will stay within the assessment criteria,
in the later years, NO, concentrations at seven out of nine sites will significantly exceed
the assessment criteria. This will be mitigated by improving vehicle emission controls,
strengthening vehicle emissions inspection, planting trees, and by prohibiting the



-101-                        ANNEX3b
construction of new residences, schools, hospitals and other sensitive buildings within the
60-m zone on either sides of the highway.
10.   Tombs at two sites (K91+700-800, and K105+600-650) will be excavated and the
information on these sites will be included in the bid documents to ensure that the
contractors take adequate actions.
11.   Additional design measures include provisions for adequate drainage, wastewater
treatment facilities at service areas, strengthening of crash barriers at pollution-sensitive
locations, adequate bridge and culvert design to minimize flooding, and planting of a
20-m wide and 200-m long forest belt.
Construction Phase
12.   To minimize dust during construction, road surfaces, excavation areas, material
stockpiles, storage areas, and construction sites will be sprayed with water, especially
near towns and villages, and near sensitive locations. Asphalt and lime stone mixing
plants will be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m from
residential areas on the leeside of the wind directions. Additional precautions will
include covering of haul trucks and material storage piles, control of exhaust gas etc.
Noisy construction will be prohibited between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., except under
exceptional circumstances when a prior written approval of the local government and the
environmental protection bureau will be required. Other measures include, construction
of noise barriers at sensitive locations, equipping machinery with effective mufflers and
strengthening equipment maintenance.
13.   Where possible, borrow areas will be restricted to nonforest and nonarable lands
and topsoil will be saved and returned to the land. Spoil disposal sites will be carefully
selected to minimize disruption to the farmlands. Damage to irrigation systems will be
minimized by construction of temporary channels and conduits and measures will be
taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted waters and silt from construction activities
into rivers and irrigation channels. Construction camp wastes and sewage will be
collected and treated and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.
14.   During construction, effective safety and warning measures will be adopted to
reduce accidents. This will include, minimization of traffic jams, provision of efficient
lighting equipment and safety signs, restriction on blasting time and implementation of
stringent controls at quarries, development of a materials transport plan, etc.
Operation Phase
15.   During the operation phase, emphasis will be placed on better vehicle
maintenance and management to promote safety and to minimize vehicle emissions. Low
speed, badly maintained old vehicles will be barred from using the expressway. Periodic
campaigns will be undertaken to educate drivers about the unnecessary use of horns,
reduction in night time speed, safe transport of hazardous materials, etc. Construction of



-102-                     ANNEX3b
permanent buildings within 60 m on either side of the expressway will be actively
discouraged.
16.   Environmental Monitoring. During the construction and operation of XGE and
its interconnecting roads, environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify the
actual impacts on the environment, identify unexpected environmental problems at an
early stage, and to adjust environmental protection measures as appropriate.  The
Environmental Monitoring Station (EMS) under the Environmental Protection Division
of GPFC will be mainly responsible for environmental monitoring during the
construction and operation phases. However, noise and dust will be monitored by the
environmental supervisors at construction contract sections.
17.   The major items to be monitored during the construction phase will include air
quality, noise, and water quality. These items will be monitored during the operation
phase as well. In addition, lead in soil and crops will be monitored during the operation
phase. Fifteen sets of domestic sound-level meters will be procured under the project.
The detailed monitoring plan is presented in the EAP.
18.  Institutional Arrangements: Environmental aspects of the construction of the
XGE will be managed and promoted by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD). It
will be headed by a senior level manager in GPFC and will also include full-time
environmental staff assigned to the XGE Preparation Office. Three Environmental
Protection Offices will be established and part-time supervisors will be assigned to each
contract section to carry out environmental supervision and dust and noise monitoring.
Other monitoring will be carried out by the Environmental Monitoring Station under
EPD/GPFC. During the operating phase, environmental work will be carried out by an
Environmental Protection Section with environmental staff, set up in the XGE Company,
which will operate and maintain the XGE. Environmental training will be undertaken to
provide adequate training for environmental staff at all levels. The detailed staffing and
training plan is presented in the EAP.

with Hunan section of the National Highways II project. It is based on the Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) prepared by the Provincial Resettlement Office (PRO) of the Hunan
Province Expressway Construction and Development Corporation (HPECDC) in
cooperation with the Resettlement Offices (ROs) of affected cities and counties, as well
as Institutes associated with the project.
B. DIMENSIONS OF RESETTLEMENT
2.    Project Impact. The Xiangtan-Leiyang Expressway (including the link up road
between Xiangtan and Zhuzhou) will affect 124 villages in 31 towns and 5 counties. The
RIP component between Loudi and Lianyuan will be passing through 50 villages in 1 1

3.    Resettlement Action Plans. The PRO of HPECDC prepared two RAPs for the
project based on the Laws and Regulations of PRC and Hunan Province as well as the
Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. The main RAP
covers the Xiangtan-Leiyang expressway including the linkup road between Xiangtan and
Zhuzhou, the second RAP is presented as an appendix covering the RIP component
(Loudi-Lianyuan Highway).
C. POLICY AND STRATEGIES FOR RESETTLEMENT
4.    Legal Framework and Resettlement Policy. In addition to the National laws
and regulations mentioned in the main text, the following local regulations govern land
acquisition and resettlement in Hunan Province:
Provincial Policy:
* Hunan Provincial Land Administration Implementation Regulations (1992)
* Hunan Provincial People's Government's Xiangzhenban No. 22 Document
(1992)
City Policy:
* Xiangtan City People's Government's Tan Zhen No. 3 document:
Regulations on Land for State and Town Construction (1989)
o Zhuzhou city Land Administration Regulations (1989 and 1993)
* Hengyang City People's Government's No. 10 document (1991)
5.    Resettlement Compensation. The average annual output value for land varies as
much as 24 percent among the counties which are affected. For this project the highest
average annual output value (Y 1,002/mu) had been selected as a basis for compensation.
The multipliers selected are 6 for irrigated land, and 3 for resettlement grant, the highest
multipliers in the Land Law.
6.    Land Redistribution. Preference will be given to land-based resettlement by
readjusting the village land among the laborers in the village, to the extent that the
average land per person in the village does not fall below the township level. Whenever
the average falls below the township level, then the surplus labor will be resettled in
enterprise jobs. After the readjustment of land, the PRO, local governments, City ROs
(CIROs) and County ROs (COROs) will take rehabilitation measures to increase the
productivity of agricultural land.
7.    House Relocation.  Compensation for affected buildings will be paid at
replacement cost (without depreciation). PAPs will be relocated in original villages, near
their original house.  Construction of new housing will be completed before the



-105-                       ANNEX4a
destruction of the affected structures. Vulnerable groups and those who need assistance,
such as, the old, sick and the handicapped will be assisted by the local authorities while
they reconstruct their houses. Detailed rates of house compensation is provided in the
RAP.
8.    Affected Public Buildings and Enterprises. Affected enterprises will be rebuilt
and will reemploy all the original workers. Construction of new facilities will be
completed before old structures are demolished so that production losses are minimized.
Compensation of lost output, work stoppage allowance and production stoppage
allowance will be incorporated into the compensation rates for the facilities.
9.    Transfer of PAPs from Agriculture to Enterprise Jobs. A tota of 1,221 PAPs
(including all family members) will be transferred from agricultural to enterprise jobs due
to limitations in land availability. This figure translates into 483 economically active
laborers. During the waiting period, if any, enterprises will pay the workers a fee of
Y 200 per month. PAPs will sign employment agreements with the enterprises which
will provide lifelong employment and pension after retirement.
10.   Job Creation. To provide jobs for the eligible PAPs, 28 enterprises were chosen
along the route which are willing to employ the 483 laborers. Currently, these enterprises
employ between 80 and 210 workers. After resettlement they will be employing between
5 and 28 additional PAPs each. Over the last three years, the rate of growth of
employment in these enterprises was between 10 percent and 22 percent, and the rate of
growth of output has surpassed the employment growth. This record provides a favorable
indication on their future performance. It is predicted that the PAPs' income will
increase as a consequence of enterprise employment. Employment environment in these
enterprises has been screened to ensure that it will not cause employment related health
problems.
11.   Infrastructure. Affected infrastructure will be rehabilitated either by the project,
or compensation will be paid, at replacement cost, to the owners of infrastructure.
Improvement of the standards of affected infrastructure will be ensured through
consultation with the PAPs during the rehabilitation of the infrastructure.
D. INSTITUTIONS
12.   Institutional Responsibility. Leading groups at the project, city and county
levels have been established with the responsibility of coordinating and implementing
resettlement. Actual implementation of resettlement will be under the responsibility of
CIROs and COROs. These offices have been equipped with the necessary staff and
equipment. The responsibility of the ROs at all levels are to distribute compensation,
guarantee the implementation of the RAP, and assist the PAPs to improve their standards
of living. COROs have assigned members from the local government, communications,
land acquisition, water conservancy, post and telecommunications bureaus to staff their
offices. TROs have followed the same procedure.



-106 -                       ANNEX4a
13.   Staffing of the ROs. PRO has seven staff members including the Director. Five
COROs have a total of 34 staff members and 29 TROs have a total of 97 staff members.
The monitoring data base that the village ROs and TROs will utilize is also available at
the CIRO, CORO and PRO level in electronic form. Monitoring results will flow to
COROs, where the information will be processed in electronic form and transmitted to
PRO to complete the monitoring cycle.
E. SCHEDULING
14.   Implementation Schedule. Preparation of the RAP has begun in January 1995
with the establishment of the PRO. The census survey, consultation with PAPs,
establishment of local ROs, and consultation on compensation rates and rehabilitation
packages have already taken place. The schedule for the remaining activities associated
with the implementation of the RAP is presented in Table 2.

G. GRIEVANCE, PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION
16.   Grievance Process. PAPs with grievances on the process of resettlement and
rehabilitation shall consult with the village resettlement offices and TROs. If the results
are not satisfactory to the PAPs, they can submit their complaint in written form to the
CORO. The county will respond to the complaint within 15 days. If the issue is not
resolved, an appeal should be made to the PRO which will respond in 15 days. If the
issue cannot be resolved within by the project authorities, then grievance will be brought
to the people's court according to 38th article of PRC Administration Lawsuit Law.
17.   Participation and Consultation. PAPs have been consulted on the impact of the
project and resettlement measures since January 1995 through surveys, public meetings,
consultation on compensation rates and the selection of resettlement sites.  As a
consequence of the participation process, the house compensation rate has been increased
to the present level as it was suggested by the PAPs. The PAPs were informed about the
project and already know the location of their new land and house-plots. Consultation
with the PAPs will continue during implementation.
H. MONITORING AND REPORTING
18.   Internal Monitoring. PRO is responsible for the organization and execution of
internal monitoring of the resettlement associated with the project. All levels of ROs will
coordinate their monitoring activities. During implementation, TROs and COROs will
record their resettlement and rehabilitation activities at the individual and household level
into their databases and transmit the information to the PRO.

3.    Resettlement Action Plan. RO of GPFC prepared the RAP for the project based
on the laws and regulations of PRC and the Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.30 on
Involuntary Resettlement. SHSDI, Expressway Construction Command Office (ECCO)
of affected cities and counties and local Land Acquisition Offices (LAOs) collaborated
with the RO during the preparation of the document. Guangzhou Academy of Social
Sciences (GASS) provided consulting services for population surveys. The RAP forms
the basis of implementation of land acquisition and resettlement of the project.
C. POLICY AND STRATEGIES FOR RESETTLEMENT
4.    Legal Framework and Resettlement Policy. In addition to the National laws
and regulations mentioned in the main text, the following local regulations govern land
acquisition and resettlement in Guangdong Province:
Provincial Policy:
*  Interim Methods of Land Acquisition for Communication Infrastructure of
Guangdong Province (1992);
*  Administrative Methods of Forest Land of Guangdong Province (1992)
  Interim Regulations Development and Administration for Mine Sources of

-111-                        ANNEX4b
5.    Resettlement Compensation.  Compensation for agricultural land, and for
structures fall within the range applied in Bank projects. The multipliers for paddy field
is 4; dry land, vegetable field, orchard and fish pond is 3; and, woodland and bamboo is
6. Multipliers for young crop compensation is 1/2 for paddy and dry land; 1/3 for
vegetable land; and, 1 for pond, orchard, woodland and bamboo. As some of the
multipliers were low, the Calculated Average Annual Output Value of agricultural land
was adjusted upwards to yield total compensation amounts (per mu) which would be
comparable to the figures applied in the Hunan section of the project.
6.    Land Redistribution. Preference will be given to land-based resettlement by
readjusting the village land among the laborers in the village, to the extent that average
land per person in the village does not fall below the minimum level. Whenever the
average falls below the minimum, then the surplus labor will be resettled in enterprise
jobs. After the readjustment of land, the RO, local governments, and city and county
ROs will take rehabilitation measures to increase the productivity of agricultural land.
7.    House Relocation. PAPs will be relocated in their original villages, near their
original house. Construction of new housing will be completed before the destruction of
the affected structures. Vulnerable groups and those who need assistance, such as, the
old, sick and the handicapped will be assisted by the local authorities during the
reconstruction of their house.
8.    Affected Enterprises. The project will affect 14 enterprises employing 354
employees. These enterprises will be compensated and rehabilitated according to the
following principles: (a) they will be rebuilt, and will reemploy original workers at their
former salaries; (b) construction of new facilities will be completed within three months
after the signing of the contract to ensure the normal resumption of business; and
(c) compensation of lost output, work stoppage allowance and production stoppage
allowance will be paid to the enterprises.
9.    Transfer of Surplus Labor in Agriculture to Enterprise Jobs. A total of 3,106
agricultural laborers will lose some of their land allocation. After land readjustment, only
2,156 will be able to continue with their agricultural occupation due to the scarcity of
agricultural land.  The remaining 950 surplus laborers, will either be allocated
nonagricultural jobs in 15 designated township or county level enterprises, or chose to
receive the resettlement grant to find their own employment.
10.   Job Creation. 331 surplus laborers will receive a minimum wage of Y 300/
month (at about the twice the rate of earning from cultivation) in the designated
enterprises. During the training period the PAPs will receive a minimum salary of Y 150.
Details of the enterprises are provided in the county level RAPs. A total of 619 laborers
chose to find work on their own, in activities such as reclaiming deserted land, cultivating
fruit trees on the slopes, and working independently in the service sector. The township
and village authorities will assist these PAPs in finding new job opportunities by
providing credit and technical advice.

11.   Affected National Minorities. The project passes through Ruyuan county where
the Yao minority is concentrated. During the design of the highway, a special effort was
made to minimize the impact on the Yao, but, due to the difficulty of the terrain, 1,351
Yao will still be affected, where 121 families will lose their houses. GPFC will provide
rehabilitation benefits to the Yao community beyond the compensation of lost assets.
12.   Infrastructure. Compensation for infrastructure has been agreed between GPFC
and the owners of the infrastructures. Compensation will be paid by GPFC and the
owners will be responsible for the rehabilitation of the affected infrastructure.
D. INSTITUTIONS
13.   Institutional Responsibility. Leading groups at the project, city and county
levels have been established with the responsibility of coordinating and implementing
resettlement. Actual implementation of land acquisition will be under the responsibility
of county and township ROs. Expressway Construction and Command of Shaoguan City
(ECCSC) will be responsible for the signing of contracts and supervising the
implementation of the RAP. GPFC has set up three Resettlement Offices On the Spot
(ROOS) in Qujiang, Ruyuan, and Pingshi, to work as the field office of the RO of GPFC
and to conduct internal monitoring.
14.   Staffing of the ROs. RO of GPFC has 10 staff members. ECCSC has four
sections (secretariat, land acquisition, engineering and finance), employing 16 staff
members. ROOS will have three staff members each. County and Township ROs have
at least two staff members each.
E. SCHEDULING
15.   Implementation Schedule. RO of GPFC was established in May 1995. In June
1995, SHSDI was given the task of conducting the census of the PAPs and their assets,
and GASS was appointed as the advisor for population surveys. The census was
conducted between August-September, and November 1995. The RAP was prepared in
collaboration with GASS, SHSDI and local ROs . The schedule for the remaining
activities associated with the implementation of the RAP is presented in Table 2.
