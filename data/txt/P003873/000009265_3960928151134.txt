MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A SECOND SECONDARY EDUCATION AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia of US$154.2 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 yearn, including five
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate to help finance the
Second Secondary Education and Management Project.
2.        Background.  Indonesia has greatly expanded its education system in
the past decade, achieving in 1988/89 nearly universal primary education and
increasing overall secondary enrollment ratios to 53Z for junior and 37Z fnr
senior secondary education. However, a 1984 Bank analysis of secondary educa-
tion identified serious issues of quality, equity, management capacity and
financial sustainab:lity, and proposed an Action Program to address these
issues. The report led to the ongoing Secondary Education and Management
Training Project (Loan 2472-IND), which covered the initial phase of the
Action Program. The Government has requested further assistance to continue
the quality improvement program.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.        Bank strategy is to emphasize the improvement of education quality
at all levels of the education system. The first Secondary Education and
Management Training Project built upon and incorporated a number of the recom-
mendations of the Bank's 1984 analysis of issues in secondary education. That
project put in place and tested programs for teacher upgrading, data collec-
tion and analysis, and nianagement training. However, due to the size of
Indonesia, the project was only able to cover the initial phase of the subsec-
tor action program and the Government has indicated its commitment to continue
the investment. Now that successful pilots have been undertaken, it is time
to generalize them. These future actions would be consistent with the agreed
Secondary Education Action Program, which lists the actions needed to improve
the quality of secondary education. The Bank would continue supporting
improvements in educational quality and management in the subsector. An
important innovation of the proposed project is that it would be the first
Bank-assisted initiative in the sector to focus on the school level, where
improved inputs are most likely to affect teaching quality and learning. In
parallel, the Bank is supporting a set of institutional and policy changes in
*        the Higher Education Project,and a Basic Education Sector Study, recently
completed, is expected to lead to loan in support of basic education.
4.        Project Objectives are:  (a) to improve the quality of secondary
education; and (b) to strengthen the management of secondary education.
5.        Project Description.  The main quality inputs are:  (a) upgrading of
teachers in science, mathematics, Bahasa Indonesia, English and social sci-
ences including training of teaclier instructors and key teachers, (b) improv-
ing sustainability of quality improvements through provision of permanent
budget support for equipment and materials for quality science instruction;



- 2 -
(c) supplying the needed curriculum, as well as *tudent and teacher materials;
(d) assisting with the development of an environmental studies program for
secondary schools; (e) procuring new stocks of science equipment in direct
response to tndividual schools' needs; (f) assisting with the development of
prototype science equipment; (g) training teachers and laboratory assistants
in the use and maintenance of the science equipment; and (h) establishing a
permanent and formalized examination system.   The management inputs are:
(a) assisting the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) to undertake a man-
agement information system study with specific attention given to personnel,
logistics and financial operations; (b) assisting the MOEC to improve its data
collection, processing, management and feedback to administrative offices and
schools at all levelsl (c) assisting the MOEC to implement its new integrated
management training policy and to undertake practical "hands-on" management
training activities at the central, provincial and district levels for senior
managers and principals; (d) conducting workshops and seminars in evaluation
and monitoring to improve the management of education programs; and (e) finan-
cing studies tot (i) define recurrent educational inputs required to dispense
quality secondary education; (ii) develop measures to improve MOEC support for
private education; and (iii) develop policy options for targeting public
support to inmprove education quality in deprived areas.
6.        The project is estimated to cost a total of US$223.4 million, of
which US$98.0 million is expected to be in foreign exchange. The proposed
Bank loan of US$154.2 would finance 70? of project costs net of taxes.
Estimated costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amount
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedules are shown in
Schedule B. The timetable of key events in project processing is summarized
in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is summarized
in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed separately.
7.        Actions Completed.  During negotiations, the Government provided:
(a) staffing plans for the teachet upgrading programs; (b) training programs
in examinations for the first two years; (c) short lists and terms of
reference for the first two years of consultancies for teacher upgrading,
science equipment, examinations, data processing and management activities;
(d) details of the management training programs to be undertaken, and (e)
staffing plans for the Project Implementation Units. In addition, project
implementation indicators were agreed.
8.        Agreements were reached at negotiations that:
(a) the Borrower would appoint by July 1, 1990, the Head of
Education/National Coordinator for teacher upgrading who would be
either one full-time person or at most two persons devoting at least
one-half their time to the position. The Head would be appointed
for a three year term. For effective operation of the teacher
upgrading programs, the Directorate of General Secondary Education
(Dikmenum) would, by April 1, 1992, fill all vacant positions for
national and provincial subject specialists (in science,
mathematics, Bahasa Indonesia, English and social sciences, with
suitable qualifications and experience as teachers);

(d) details of the management training programs to be undertaken, and (e)
staffing plans for the Project Implementation Units. In addition, project
implementation indicators were agreed.
8.        Agreements were reached at negotiations that:
(a) the Borrower would appoint by July 1, 1990, the Head of
Education/National Coordinator for teacher upgrading who would be
either one full-time person or at most two persons devoting at least
one-half their time to the position. The Heaa would be appointed
for a three year term. For effective operation of the teacher
upgrading programs, the Directorate of General Secondary Education
(Dikmenum) would, by April 1, 1992, fill all vacant positions for
national and provincial subject specialists (in science,
mathematics, Bahasa Indonesia, English and social sciences, with
suitable qualifications and experience as teachers);



(b) the Borrower would by April 1, 1994, have taken all necessary steps
to pruvide permanent annual funding satisfactory to the Bank for the
procurement, replenishment and maintenance of science equipment for
the secondary schools;
(c)  the Borrower would establish within the MOEC by June 1, 1991,
teacher upgrading examination teams with terms of reference and
membership satisfactory to the Bank, and by February 1, 1993,
establish in each provincial education administrative office,
functional provincial examination teams with at least ten subject
specialists and an evaluation specialist, each with qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Bank;
(d) the Borrower would, by September 1, 1990, review the results of the
Integrated Management Study and, by March 31, 1991, furnish to the
Bank, for comments, a detailed action program for integrated
management training based on such review. Such action program would
thereafter be implemented in a manner satisfactory to the Bank;
(e)  the Borrower would furnish to the B&nk by January 1, 1992, an action
program satisfactory to the Bank, for the implementation of the
management studies: "Policy Options for Improved Equity in
Secondary Education,. 'Recurrent Input Needs of Secondary Education"
and "Puolic Support for Private Education'.  The Borrower would
carry out these studies under the coordination of MOEC's Office of
Educational and Cultural Research and Development and in
consultation with its Secretariat General and its Directorate
General of Primary and Secondary Education;
(f) the Borrower would appoint by July 1, 1990, key staff for the three
Project Implementation Units and the Secretariat of the Project
Monitoring and Coordinating Committee for three year terms. These
positions would be filled by full-time staff or at most two persons
devoting at least one-half their time to each position. New staff
would have a three-month overlap with the then existing staff;
(g) the Borrower would undertake a comprehensive project implementation
review in October each year, commencing in 1990. The results of
each such review would be discussed with the Bank; and
(h) As a condition of disbursement for management training, the Borrower
would have commenced implementation of the action program for
integrated management training.
9.        Benefits and Risks.  The project would improve secondary education
quality and equity through: improved teacher training programs benefitting
about 200,000 teachers, 5,300 key teachers and 150 teacher instructors; the
supply of instructional materials and science equipment benefitting about
660,000 teachers and 10,000,000 students; improved examinations which would
benefit about 39 million students; and assisting MOEC to respond better to
needs by identifying essential inputs necessary to impart qualitative



- 4 -
secondary education. The actions taken tu ensure sustairab;litv of quality
improvements in secondary education would be the Bank's first attempt in the
sector to address sustainability issues head-on. Management would be improved
through management training of: about 640 subject supervisors' about 25 long-
term and 2,500 short-term officers/teachers in the management and operation of
examinations; about 500 regional and district supervisors; about 300
administrative staff in data processing; about 25,000 prircipals in combined
pedagogical and management skills; and about 20,000 middle-level officers at
the provincial level and 200,000 at the district level concentrating on opera-
tional training in areas such as personnel, finance and logistics. The man-
agement training provided under the project would improve the general
administration of the MOEC, standardize data collection, and improve the feed-
back and utilization of data, thus facilitating sound decision making.
Project risks are of two kinds: (a) rigidity of budgetary Drocedures and
partisanship on the part of the units within the MOEC might undermine sustain-
ability of the quality improvement measures being introduced under the
project, and (b) the quality improvement measures themselves could suffer if
key staff for teacher upgrading and project implementation are not appointed
on a timely basis.   Risks of the first kind are being addressed through
agreements relating to permanent financing of the key inputs for improved
education quality, through the MOEC's new policy on integrated management,
through the commitment during Repelita V (already started in the 1989/90
budget) to increase allocations for recurrent expenditures, and through the
Bank's ongoing dialogue with the Government on financing issues in the educa-
tion sector. The second risk is being addressed by Government assurances
relating to project staffing and monitoring and by the recent approval of a
new MOEC career structure.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would cnmply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
