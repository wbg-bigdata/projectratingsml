BRAZILIAN STEEL EXPANSION PROGRAM
PART II
APPRAISAL OF COSIPA EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed Stage II expansion project of
Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA), one of the three leading Gov-
ernment-owned flat steel producers in Brazil. The plant is situated at Cuba-
tao, about 70 km from Sao Paulo and about 20 km from the port of Santos, near
the principal market in the Sao Paulo area, although not very close to the
major raw material sources. The project is designed to increase by 1976
COSIPA's raw steel capacity from 1.0 to 2.3 million tons per year (TPY) and
its rolling and finishing capacity, particularly for wide plate and cold
rolled sheet. Its estimated total cost, including interest during construct-
ion and additonal working capital, is US$472 million equivalent of which
about US$210 million will be for imported equipment and services. The
requested Bank loan is US$64.5 million.
ii.       COSIPA was founded in 1953 as a private company, but since 1957
has been controlled by Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE),
the Federal Government Development Bank. Construction of the initial plant
began in 1960 and in late 1963 the rolling section began to operate. Inte-
grated production commenced by the end of 1965 with a capacity of 500,000
TPY of raw steel which has since been increased to 600,000 TPY. The Company
is presently implementing an expansion which is to raise capacity further to
1.0 million TPY by early 1973 (Stage I) and which will partly overlap with
the Bank assisted project (Stage II).
iii.      In its early years of operations the Company had substantial losses
due to a heavy debt burden and high operating costs caused primarily by
its relatively small-scale operations and the general economic recession in
Brazil during those years. Wdhile losses have gradually been decreasing
since 1967, the Company was unable to service its debt which was paid by
BNDE and the National Treasury. In 1971, BNDE, through capitalization of
some of its outstanding loans, increased COSIPA's share capital and thus
placed the Company in a sound financial position. The Company is expected
to show a profit in 1972.
iv.       Since the early 1950's consumption of steel in Brazil has on
average increased by about 9% per year and is expected to grow at an annual
rate of about 10% during the current decade, as compared with an annual
increase in COSIPA's domestic sales of flat steel products of about 11.3%.
The project (Stage II) introduces no new items to COSIPA's present product
line, except for some foundry and metallurgical coke for sale, and the em-
phasis is on larger tonnages, especially of cold rolled material and wider
plates.



- ii -
v.        After completion of the project nearly 30% of COSIPA's plate
production will be oriented towards the shipbuilding industry with the
remainder expected to go to the automotive industry and the manufacturers
of pipe and structural fabrication. The Company's production program is,
to the extent feasible, coordinated with those of the two other Government-
owned flat products mills - Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) and Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais (USIMINAS). When the new facilities are
commissioned in 1976, there may be some capacity available for exports, but
increasing domestic demand should soon absorb all of COSIPA's production.
vi.       The project is part of an overall program to increase Brazil's
raw steel capacity from 6 to 20 million TPY by the early 1980's. The
program was formulated by Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica
(CONSIDER), the National Steel Council, and includes simultaneous expansions
of CSN and USIMINAS. The Bank approved a loan of US$64.5 million to CSN on
February 1, 1972 and another loan of US$63.0 million to USIMINAS on April 4,
1972.
vii.      The major objectives of the Stage II project are to expand basic
iron and steel-making and rolling capacity by the installation of large
modern production facilities equipped with pollution control devices, improve
product quality and lower operating costs. To achieve this, a second blast
furnace will be installed which is designed to provide - together with the c:x--
isting one - sufficient hot metal for both Stage II and the next planned ex-
pansion (Stage III) to 3.5 million TPY of raw steel. In addition, the project
includes two coke oven batteries; a third 100-ton BOF vessel in place of
the existing 75-ton vessel; a 160-inch wide plate mill; and other necessary
support facilities; plus alterations and additions to the existing plant.
viii.      The financial plan for the project is composed of an estimated
US$199 million in foreign exchange loans, US$94 million in local currency
loans and US$179 million from share capital increases and internal cash
generation. The proposed Bank loan of US$64.5 million and an Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) loan of US$43.0 million will be used jointly in a
60/40 proportion for internationally bid equipment. An additional US$101
million worth of equipment is to be financed (90%) by export credit
institutions in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
United Kingdom and the United States. This equipment will be bid competi-
tively among suppliers in the above exporting countries. On average the
bilateral credits will be for about 15 years and at an interest rate of
7-1/2% per annum, with any differences in credit terms to be taken into
account in bid evaluation. COSIPA's cash generation will cover part of the
construction cost, downpayments to equipment suppliers under the bilateral
credits, and interest during construction. The Brazilian Government is
prepared to finance any overrun in project cost or shortfall in financing.
ix.       To assist COSIPA in the execution of the project and in its
operations the Company has concluded technical assistance agreements with
Nippon Steel Corporation of Japan and Arthur G. McKee and Company of the
U.S. The Company has also engaged Booz, Allen & Hamilton International Inc.
of the U.S. to establish intra-departmental management information and stan-



- iii -
dard cost systems,. cost reduction programs and to help in strengthening the
department in COSIPA that will have primary responsibility for project execu-
tion. With such assistance and the additional assistance for improving the
Company's organizational structure which the Company agreed during negotia-
tions to obtain, it is expected that the Company will be able to carry out
the project efficiently and within the budget and construction schedule.
x.        COSIPA obtains its iron ore from various sources in the State of
Minas Gerais and, because of the longer distances, at a higher delivered
cost as compared with the two other flat steel producers. However, this
handicap is offset by COSIPA's closeness to the market. The other principal
input, coking coal, is imported with the exception of about 38% of the Com-
pany's present requirements that are procured domestically. The combined
cost to COSIPA of iron ore and coal is slightly higher than the lowest cost
in Japanese and Western European steel mills. Primarily because of the high-
er price the Company has to pay for its supply of iron ore and its past in-
ability to run the facilities at their full rated capacity, COSIPA's produc-
tion costs have been higher than those of CSN and USIMINAS but no major cost
differences are expected once the expansions of all plants have been com-
pleted.
xi.       The Company's selling prices on which the financial projections
are based, are on the whole competitive with European domestic prices for
similar products with the exception of cold rolled steel products. Present
CIF import prices (ex-duties) are less than 5% below domestic prices for
COSIPA's product mix and it is expected that upon completion of the project
COSIPA could meet such import prices and still earn an acceptable return.
In view of the importance of steel prices, which are controlled by the
Brazilian Government, both to the steel industry and the economy as a whole,
the Government has agreed to consult with the Bank on steel pricing policy
as circumstances warrant.
xii.      The project has satisfactory financial and economic rates of
return of about 16.8% and 14.8% respectively. Sensitivity tests indicate
that a suitable return can be expected even under foreseeable adverse
conditions. At full production net foreign exchange savings from the
project would be about US$95 million per year. Finally, after the expansion
COSIPA would have a low profit break-even point at 67% of capacity production
and a satisfactory debt service coverage.
xiii.     The shortage of funds, which handicapped COSIPA from its inception
until 1971, was mainly responsible for the imbalance in the existing plant
facilities and the lack of an experienced operating partner, which in turn
contributed to the Company's poor past performance. The project envisages
not only a large expansion of production capacity, but also an all-round im-
provement in financial and managerial performance. In this sense the risks
inherent in the COSIPA project are greater than in those of the other two
flat steel producers, which have a better record of achievement. But the
contracts with COSIPA's technical and management consultants are expected
to help the Company acquire the necessary expertise in time for it to suc-
cessfully implement the expansion and cope with the larger scale of oper-
ations.



- iv -
xiv.      Provided satisfactory arrangements are made for the financing of
the project and based on the assurances obtained during negotiations, the
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$64.5 million equivalent for a
term of 15-1/2 years including 4-1/2 years of grace.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the proposed expansion project of Companhia
Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA), virtually wholly-owned by Banco Nacional do
Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE), the Federal Government Development Bank.
COSIPA is an integrated iron and steel plant located at Cubatao, near the
port city of Santos, in the State of Sao Paulo. The Company is presently
expanding its production capacity (Stage I) from 0.6 to 1.0 million tons per
year (TPY) of raw steel 1/ by early 1973 and is about to start a further
expansion (Stage II) to 2.3 million TPY of raw steel for which Bank financing
is being sought and which is expected to be completed by 1976. Total
financing required for Stage II, including interest during construction
and additional working capital, is estimated at US$472 million of which
about US$260 million is in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would
be US$64.5 million, to finance equipment which is all to be internationally
bid.
1.02      The project is part of an overall program to increase Brazil's
raw steel capacity from 6 to 20 million TPY by 1980 or shortly thereafter,
at which time COSIPA's contribution is expected to be 3.5 million TPY. The
program was formulated by Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica (CON-
SIDER), the National Steel Council, and includes simultaneous expansions of
the other two existing Government-owned flat product mills, Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) and Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais, S.A.
(USIMINAS). The Bank approved a US$64.5 million loan to CSN on February 1,
1972 (Report PI-15a of January 7, 1972) and another loan of US$63 million
to USIMINAS on April 4, 1972 (Report PI-17 of March 20, 1972).
1.03      COSIPA, CSN and USIMINAS virtually control the flat products
market in Brazil and account for about half of the country's total steel
production capacity. COSIPA, which like its competitors uses domestic
iron ore and largely imported coal, produces only uncoated flat products
(plate, hot and cold rolled coil and sheet) and in 1971 contributed about
26% to domestic sales of these products; about 80% of its output is sold
in the State of Sao Paulo. Stages I and II introduce no new products to
the Company's existing lines except for foundry and metallurgical coke
which is to be sold until Stage III expansion is completed.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. Jaffe, Nayar and Perram of
the Industrial Projects Department, based on the findings of a pre-apprais-
al mission in 1970, joint IBRD/IDB appraisal missions 2/ in May/June 1971
1/   Raw steel is defined as steel in the first solid state after melting and
includes ingots and continuously cast semi-finished products.
2/   The May/June 1971 mission consisted of Messrs. Jaffe (Chief), Paschke,
Perram, Thadani, Zaman and Herzog (Consultant) of the Bank, and Messrs.
Prado (Deputy Chief), Dragisic, Meyer, Pokorny and Miller (Consultant)
of IDB. The February 1972 mission consisted of Messrs. Jaffe (Chief),
Nayar, and Perram of the Bank and Messrs. Prado (Deputy Chief) and
Pokorny of IDB.



and February 1972 and discussions held in Washington with representatives
of the Company, CONSIDER and BNDE. The valuable contribution from Messrs.
Prado and Pokorny of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in the
appraisal of the project is acknowledged.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
2.01      COSIPA was founded in 1953 as a private company.  When it became
evident that the private sponsors were unable to raise most of the equity
necessary for the realization of the initial plant designed by Kaiser
Engineers of the U.S., the State of Sao Paulo and BNDE provided a major
portion of the share capital. Suppliers' credits guaranteed by the National
Treasury completed the financial plan. Construction of the plant began in
1960 and by the end of 1963, the rolling section began to operate using
ingots and slabs from CSN and USIMINAS. Integrated production commenced
in November 1965. The construction phase was slowed down by a shortage of
funds and the ensuing delays resulted in higher than expected capital costs.
2.02      As mentioned earlier, COSIPA is currently increasing its raw
steel capacity from 0.6 to 1.0 million TPY (Stage I). This project was
planned and designed with the help of Arthur G. McKee & Company (McKee) of
the U.S. and is being financed by BNDE and suppliers' credits. Stage I
is now expected to be completed in early 1973, about one year behind sched-
ule due to delays associated with (a) the registration of contracts; (b)
the issuance of import licenses; and (c) the supply of data from equipment
suppliers for the civil works. Capital costs of Stage I are estimated at
about US$112 million, or US$280 per incremental annual toii which, given the
site conditions, is reasonable for the type of facilities added.
B.   Ownership
2.03      The Company was founded with an initial share capital of Cr$ 2,170
(some US$43,000 equivalent in 1953) all privately held but for reasons
explained in para 2.01 control soon shifted to the Federal Government.
As at December 31, 1971 the share capital of COSIPA was Cr$ 1.3 billion
(US$308.4 million) of which BNDE held 97.1%; the State of Sao Paulo 2.4%;
and private shareholders the remaining 0.5%. The capital was represented
by 394 million shares outstanding, divided into 60% common and 40% preferred
(6% cumulative participating 1/). In order to broaden the ownership and to
have a significant shareholder in addition to BNDE, the State of Sao Paulo's
shareholding in the Company, according to the financial plan for the project,
would be increased to 15.5% by the end of the construction period.
1/   Participates with common up to 8% in dividends.



-3-
C.   Management
2.04      The organization of the Company is shown in Annex 1.  The principal
management body, the Board of Directors, consists of seven members elected by
the shareholders for a term of four years. The existing Board was elected in
April 1971 and is composed of COSIPA's President, Treasurer, and Controller,
and four outside Directors, three of whom represent BNDE, the Ministry of Fi-
nance and CONSIDER. The Board's main function is to formulate long-term pol-
icy and give guidance to management.
2.05      There are two other formal management bodies, the Consulting Council
and the Fiscal Council. The Consulting Council formerly represented the Gov-
ernment in its control of policy and operations at COSIPA; however, most of
its functions have been taken over by CONSIDER and it now serves little pur-
pose. The Fiscal Council reviews the annual financial statements and recom-
mends them for approval to the shareholders, as required by Brazilian law.
The Company lhas an independent auditor, Price Waterhouse Peat and Company.
2.06      COSIPA's management team is headed by Dr. Mario Lopes Leao (age
61), who is an engineer by training. Dr. Leao became President of COSIPA
in 1967, having previously served three power companies in the same capac-
ity. He is considered a good executive and has provided stability and
maturity to COSIPA's management. In his temporary absence, the Controller
acts as President. Most of the department heads were recruited from other
Brazilian steel companies and have been with the Conpany since start-up.
The calibre of these individuals is high, but their potential has not always
been realized in the past due to organizational weaknesses which allowed a
certain lack of coordination among the various departments. With the view
to improving this situation BNDE caused the Company's by-laws to be changed
in 1971 to provide for an enlarged Board of Directors (para 2.04), which
shortly after its election, commissioned Booz, Allen and Hamilton Interna-
tional, Inc. (BAHINT) to study the Company's intra-departmental organization
and information system to reduce costs and maximize profit. During negotia-
tions the Company agreed that it will expand the scope of these services to
cover the entire organizational structure and management, review the recom-
mendations of the consultants with the Bank, implement them as appropriate,
and take further action if necessary to improve COSIPA's management organiza-
tion.
2.07      On the operational level, COSIPA had in the past obtained assis-
tance from McKee in the operation of the plant and in developing staff
training programs. In order to obtain further help commensurate with the
large expansion, COSIPA entered in June 1971 into a five-year agreement
with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) of Japan to provide operational know-
how and technical assistance, including training abroad.
2.08      To maintain COSIPA as an independent entity, agreement was reached
during negotiations that COSIPA's present corporate form will not be changed
and that it will not be merged or consolidated with other companies without
prior consultation with the Bank.

D.   Location and Plant Facilities
2.09      The plant, called the "Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva Works",
is located at Cubatao (Map IBRD 3662R), a town of about 40,000 inhabitants
some 20 km from the port of Santos and 70 km from Sao Paulo. The site is
served by railway lines, roads, and a good dock capable of accepting ves-
sels up to 30,000 dwt. This location is close to COSIPA's market area,
since Sao Paulo is the center of consumption of flat rolled steel products
in Brazil, and is also convenient for receiving domestic and imported coal.
The plant is less well situated with regard to its iron ore which must come
from the State of Minas Gerais by rail. The site is relatively flat but re-
stricted, and permits expansion only up to 3.5 million TPY of raw steel per
year.
2.10      All facilities previously built, or now being installed as part
of the 1.0 million TPY expansion, are described in Annex 2. They include
raw material handling; three coke oven batteries; two sinter plants; one
blast furnace; two 100-ton and one 75-ton BOF converter; one plate and semi-
continuous hot strip mill and cold rolling and finishing facilities.
E.   Subsidiaries
2.11       The Company has at present two subsidiaries, Mineracao Ferro e
Manganes,S.A. (MFM), acquired in July 1964 at the suggestion of BNDE and
COSIPA Processamento de Dados, Ltda. (CPD), which was created very recent-
ly.
2.12      MFM supplies COSIPA with all its limestone and dolomite and in
emergency cases, part of its iron ore. Its mines are connected to the COSIPA
plant by both railroad and highway. MFM delivers practically all of its pro-
ducts to COSIPA on a cost basis and at prices comparable to those from out-
side sources. MFM's share capital is Cr$ 600,000, all held by COSIPA except
for Directors' shares; its Board of Directors is composed of high-level
COSIPA management members.
2.13      The prime purpose for the establishment of CPD is to enable it to
liave a salary scale in line with those of other similar companies in the Sao
Paulo area, without thereby disturbing COSIPA's present salary structure.
This subsidiary, which is owned by COSIPA (80%) and MFM (20%), will under-
take computer and data processing work primarily for COSIPA, but to the
extent that it has excess capacity also for other industries in the area.
During negotiations agreement was reached, that the Company will not es-
tablish new subsidiaries without the Bank's consent. Moreover, during
1972-1980 COSIPA will also limit its lending to, guaranteeing debt for
or investing in subsidiaries to US$2.0 million equivalent per year, with
accumulation of this amount possible up to US$6 million in any one year.

/1   Audited.
2.15      As can be seen from this table, COSIPA's financial and operating
history has been poor. The basic factors which caused such unsatisfactory
performance have been (i) low steel prices until mid-1970; (ii) shortage of
iron making and finishing facilities in relation to rolling capacity result-
ing in high depreciation charges; (iii) the absence of technical assistance
from an experienced operating company; (iv) certain deficiencies in organiza-
tion and cost control; and (v) an excessive labor force and high financial
charges. Reflecting improvements in both operational efficiency and sales
volume, and aided by real price increases granted to the Brazilian steel in-
dustry in the later years, COSIPA's income from operations showed steadily
decreasing losses from 1967 through 1970 and a small operating profit in
1971.
2.16      The large losses in the early years made it impossible for COSIPA
to service its debt, particularly since many of the foreign suppliers'
credits had short maturities, and BNDE provided the funds for such pay-
ments. In 1967 BNDE converted much of its outstanding loan to equity and
thereby reduced financial expenses. Nevertheless, earnings, while improving,
were still not sufficient in 1968 through 1970 for COSIPA's debt service
requirements. As a result, another re-financing took place in 1971 to
overcome this problem and to provide COSIPA with a sound equity base to
complete the Stage I and begin the Stage II expansion. During 1971 BNDE
converted another US$92.9 million of loans into preferred shares. The
historical balance sheets are given in Annex 3. Summary sources and appli-
cation of funds statements for the years 1967 to 1971 are given below:

3.02      During 1968-71, COSIPA's sales increased by about 11% annually,
from 425,000 to 586,000 tons, compared with an overall market growth for
flat products of about 12% per year. Domestic sales during the same pe-
riod increased from about 366,000 to 586,000 tons, with plate and hot
rolled products showing the strongest gains, primarily because the cold
mill operated close to capacity in 1970. As the domestic market expanded,
exports declined, and there were no exports in 1971 when the Company's ca-
pacity was fully utilized. Due to limitations in iron and steelmaking,
COSIPA has been producing a portion of its finished products by purchasing
slabs for its hot and cold strip mills.
3.03      In 1971 COSIPA's domestic sales of flat products represented about
23% of total flat products consumption in Brazil, including over 500,000
tons of imports to supplement domestic output. Of the total 586,000 tons
of the Company's domestic sales, plate, and hot and cold rolled products
represented 20%, 47% and 33% respectively. Since Brazilian demand exceeded
supply, COSIPA had to allocate its output to selected customers.
3.04      Total domestic sales of COSIPA are projected to grow at an annual
rate of 11.3% between 1971 and 1980, about in line with the total domestic
demand for flat products in Brazil, which is expected to increase annually
by about 10% during the same period. COSIPA would thereby increase its
overall market share from 26% in 1971 to 33% in 1980.  Exports equivalent



- 8 -
to about 10% of the Company's production are projected.  Althouglh there is
likely to be some additional capacity available for exports when the new
production facilities are commissioned in 1976, the exportable surplus is
expected to be absorbed by domestic demand within a few years (Part I,
para 3.11). The possible implications of under-utilization of capacity,
which, if it occurs, is expected to be short-lived, should not impair the
financial viability of COSIPA.
3.05      The Company's production and sales projections are based on
CONSIDER's guidelines which have the objective of coordinating as much
as possible the production programs of COSIPA, CSN and USIMINAS. In future,
therefore, the Company intends to give high priority to sales of plate and
cold rolled products, and while COSIPA's products will continue to compete
with those of USIMINAS, this will be less so with CSN. With the expected
improvement in quality upon completion of the Stage I and II expansions and
the advantage COSIPA enjoys due to its proximity to the major markets, it is
expected that the Company will become increasingly competitive with USIMINAS.
3.06      COSIPA's domestic sales of plate are projected to increase from
120,000 tons in 1971 to 610,000 tons in 1980, equivalent to an annual growth
rate of nearly 20%.. Such an increase is possible since domestic demand in
1980 is expected to exceed production capacity of the three companies.
Furthermore, in the past, COSIPA's market share for plate was restricted
due to capacity and size limitations in its plant and, with the addition
of a new 160-inch wide plate mill, the Company will be able to overcome these
restrictions. After completion of Stage II nearly 30% of COSIPA's plate
production will be oriented towards the shipbuilding industry which is
experiencing a rapid growth, and 62% towards structural fabrication.
3.07      For hot rolled coil and sheet, COSIPA plans to increase its domes-
tic sales from 269,000 tons in 1971 to 353,000 tons in 1980, an annual in-
crease of only 3%. This is because USIMINAS will cover the increase in de-
mand of these products.   On the other hand, in cold rolled coil and sheet
COSIPA expects to increase sales during the 1971-80 period by somewhat over
12% annually sharing the demand increase with USIMINAS, while CSN will re-
duce production in this line. The quality improvement that COSIPA expects
to attain in cold rolled steel as a consequence of the project should en-
able the Company to penetrate further into the autobody sheet market in
which most of the major automobile manufacturers are already its customers.
3.08      Besides steel products, COSIPA intends to sell foundry and me-
tallurgical coke to local foundries and blast furnace plants which presently
rely on imported coke or charcoal. These sales will amount to about 230,000
tons per year from 1977 until a further expansion (Stage III) will require
such extra coking capacity to be used in ironmaking.
B.   Sectoral and Geographic Distribution of Sales
3.09      The Company's sectoral and geographic distribution of sales between
1968 and 1971 is shown in Annex 4. During this period COSIPA has continuously



- 9 -
increased sales through distributors to about 33% of its total sales in
1971 but in future the Company intends to shift more to direct sales. The
automotive industry and the tube and pipe manufacturers have gradually become
COSIPA's two major single customers accounting (in about equal shares) for
some 38% of the Company's domestic market. COSIPA's sales to the shipbuilding
industry are still negligible due to finishing and size limitations but, as
mentioned before, are expected to increase substantially with the completion
of the project.
3.10      At present more than 80% of COSIPA's domestic sales are made in the
rapidly growing market of Sao Paulo State; and virtually all of them in the
three States of Sao Paulo, Guanabara (Rio) and Rio Grande do Sul. This con-
centration of COSIPA's market is also expected to continue in future, although
to a somewhat lesser extent.
C.   Marketing Organization and Policies
3.11      In view of the strong and growing demand for its products, COSIPA
has not carried out an extensive market development program and recently has
not taken on any new customers. Instead, the Company has concentrated on
achieving a higher market penetration in the automotive industry around Sao
Paulo, the only industry with which it has been concluding annual sales
agreements. COSIPA recognizes that, after the expansion of the three flat
steel plants, a more competitive market position is likely to develop and
the Company has therefore had its marketing organization and staffing
requirements studied by BAHINT. As a result, COSIPA is now reorganizing its
marketing department and increasing staff from 80 to about 140 in order to
place more emphasis on market research and development, customer service and
direct sales.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
4.01      The proposed project (Stage II) is designed to increase iron and
steelmaking as well as rolling capacity of the plant and to make certain
alterations to the existing facilities, with the overall objective of
raising the Company's raw steel capacity from 1.0 to 2.3 million TPY by
1976. The plans, specifications and cost estimates for this expansion were
originally prepared by McKee. Subsequently, having concluded a technical
assistance agreement with NSC in June 1971, COSIPA requested this company
to review the project. This review resulted in certain modifications of the
new raw materials handling plant, the blast furnace and the plate mill, and
in the decision to transfer the engineering responsibilities for these
facilities to NSC. In addition, the Company made minor alterations primarily
to provide a better base for further expansion.



- 10 -
4.02      The major facilities to be installed under Stage II comprise an
extension of the existing dock, a primary ore yard, a coal yard, two coke
oven batteries each with 53 ovens, a blast furnace designed for an ultimate
capacity of 5,000 tons per day, a third 100-ton B.O.F. vessel in place of the
existing 75-ton vessel, an oxygen plant, a single stand 4-high 160" wide
plate mill, two cold-rolled coil inspection lines, of which one will have
a combination stretcher/leveler and all necessary auxiliary equipment.
Also, for more reliable and flexible supply, an 88 KV electric power distri-
bution system will be added. A detailed description of the project is given
in Annex 5.
B.   Observations
4.03      COSIPA's expansion to 2.3 million TPY places emphasis on larger
tonnages especially of plate and cold rolled flat steel, but introduces
no new steel products. The project, however, includes one coke over bat-
tery which is required only after completion of the Stage III expansion
(para. 3.08).
4.04      Another plant unit which is designed to meet the requirements of
Stage III is the No. 2 blast furnace which will be operated initially at a
rate of 4,000 tons per day, but can be enlarged to 5,000 tons per day. Tile
furnace is designed to operate under top pressure with a fuel rate of 550
kg/ton of iron (500 kg of coke plus 50 kg of oil) and with about 70% sinter
ratio in the burden. This represents efficient blast furnace operation but
should be achievable. The imbalance in COSIPA's iron making capacity is ty-
pical of large steel plants and will be absorbed as Brazil's steel demand
permits further expansion of rolling facilities. In view of this, the Bank
has received assurance during negotiations that the Government will consult
with the Bank prior to sanctioning any new flat product capacity before com-
pletion of the Stage III expansions of the three companies.
4.05      While the Company has excess capacity in its coke ovens and
blast furnaces, the BOF shop and slabbing mill must be operated at their
rated capacity, if COSIPA is to produce 2.3 million TPY of raw steel. To
prevent possible bottlenecks the Company is now making certain modifi-
cations designed to facilitate the operation of these two critical units.
If COSIPA can, with the help of NSC, approach the standard of operation
currently achieved by USIMINAS, it will have no serious difficulty in
attaining a production level of 2.3 million TPY.
4.06      Finally, the Company will be able to produce much wider plates
than hitherto possible on its new 160-inch plate mill, whose output is
primarily intended for the shipbuilding industry. This plate mill can be
enlarged to meet the requirements of Stage III through a second rolling
stand and some additional finishing equipment.



C.   Ecology
4.07      The new facilities of the project incorporate pollution control
equipment which is estimated to cost about US$9 million.
4.08      The blast furnace, coke plant, BOF shop and hot scarfing machine
will be provided witlh control equipment to keep water and atmospheric
pollution within acceptable standards. Since water will be recirculated,
only make-up water will be drawn from the tidewater and treated prior to
discharge. Major items to minimize air pollution are filters and dust
catchers at the blast furnace, gas washing and ignition burning devices
at the coke oven batteries and venturi scrubbers at the BOF shop. After
cleaning, the blast furnace and coke oven gases will be used in the power
house boilers, soaking pits and reheat furnaces. Details of the project's
pollution control devices are given in Annex 6.
4.09      The water treatment plant to be installed under Stage II will
also treat water from the existing facilities before discharge. No new
facilities are proposed to control the pollution from the existing two
coke oven batteries, which can be eliminated only with heavy investments.
No. 3 coke oven battery which is being installed as part of Stage I, will
however, be equipped with the same pollution control devices as No. 4 and
No. 5 batteries which form part of the project.
D.   Labor Force
4.10      COSIPA reduced the labor force from 9,850 employees in 1966, its
first year of integrated production, to 6,136 at the end of 1971. At the
same time, it increased output by about 65% and thus improved its overall
labor productivity substantially. The Company plans to add about 500 new
employees during the Stage I expansion and an additional 3,000 employees
on completion of Stage II, when its labor productivity is forecast to be
about 13.7 man-hours per ton of finished steel. This compares well with
comparable indices for the U.S. and Japanese steel industries of 13 and
13.2 man-hours per ton in 1970, respectively. COSIPA's present and future
labor requirements are given in greater detail in Annex 7.
4.11      COSIPA is favorably located with respect to the labor market and
it is expected that most of the new employees will come from the Sao Paulo
area. No problems are therefore foreseen in attracting the required
personnel for which the Company has well developed training programs. Labor
turnover has been small and COSIPA has had no strikes over the past six
years. The Company's safety record is good.
1.   Project Execution
4.12      COSIPA will have primary responsibility for project execution.
It will be assisted by NSC which will carry out the engineering of the
raw materials handling facilities, blast furnace and the new plate mill
complex. McKee, which is supplying technical assistance for the Stage I
expansion, will undertake the engineering of the remaining facilities in



- 12 -
the Stage II project, as well as of the general plant utilities and other
off-sites. The contracts with McKee and NSC also provide for assistance
in procurement and the dispatch of experienced engineers, as needed, for
supervision of construction and start-up.
4.13      Civil construction and erection of equipment will be carried out
by Brazilian contractors. During negotiations, assurances similar to those
given by CSN and USIMINAS were obtained that, if it became apparent that the
use of local contractors would result in substantially increased costs or de-
lays in completion, foreign bids for subsequent contracts would be solicited.
hle services of Brazilian engineering firms will be used for the civil and
mechanical design and detailed work. The structural design of the plate
mill building will be carried out by NSC and that of the remaining buildings
either by Brazilian engineering firms or by McKee.
4.14      The main burden of project execution will rest with COSIPA's
Expansion Department which numbers 25 professionals and is headed by
Dr. Pedro de Souza, formerly the Company's General Superintendent of
Operations who has considerable experience in the steel industry. He is
assisted by three superintendents responsible for the technical, planning
and construction divisions. To make this department more effective the
major recommendations of a recent BAHINT study are now being implemented
by adding to it control and scheduling functions and a new administrative
unit. The Company is also receiving assistance from its consultants
(BAILINT, NSC, and HIcKee) in project management, the assessment of staff
requirements and operations, and together with that provided by major
equipment suppliers, in the erection and start-up of the new facilities.
With such assistance, the Expansion Department is judged to be capable of
lhandling a project of this size and complexity. During negotiations a
general commitment was obtained from the Company obligating it to engage
such consultant services as the implementation of the project calls for.
F.   Project Timing
4.15      Stage IT is planned to be completed by mid-1976 in accordance
with the construction schedule shown in Annex 8. The schedule was prepared
by COSIPA on the basis of its past experience and with the assistance of
McKtee and NSC. It is considered achievable with such assistance as the
Company has contracted and provided the Government expedites the registration
of contracts and the issuance of import licenses for the project.  Confirma-
tion oni this point was obtained from the Government during negotiations.
Major equipment orders are expected to be placed between the Fourth Quarter
of 1972 and the Second Quarter of 1973.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCIAL PLAN

/1   Cruzeiros of February 1971.  US$ equivalent capital costs, except the
price contingency, were converted to Cruzeiros at the rate of exchange
of US$1 = Cr$ 5.03 prevailing in February 1971.
5.02      Tlie equipment cost estimates were originally prepared by McKee
and subsequently revised by NSC and are based on prices prevailing in
September 1971. They have been adjusted for the currency realignments
of December 1971 and take into account the expected effect of interna-
tional bidding. Further revisions were incorporated as a result of the
minor project modifications introduced by COSIPA (para 4.01). Also in-
cluded in the equipment cost estimates is a provision of US$5.2 million
to cover possible cost increases due to the 15% margin of preference to
Brazilian suppliers. As for the two other steel expansion projects, no
import duties on equipment are payable.
5.03      The civil construction and equipment erection cost estimates are
based on unit costs experienced by COSIPA in its ongoing Stage I expansion,



- 14 -
and on international experience. Finally, a physical contingency of 9.5%
has been added on all project costs except pre-operating expenses, additional
working capital and interest during construction as well as a 5% per year
price escalation from January 1, 1972 to the expected dates of disbursement.
The above estimates and contingencies are considered adequate.
5.04      Brazilian suppliers are expected to win about 20% of the equipment
contracts for the project. This is a lower percentage than that foreseen
by CSN and USIMINAS in their projects, because COSIPA expects that in some
instances Brazilian suppliers may not be in a position to accept orders for
COSIPA in view of their limited capacity, the tight delivery schedules, and
the fact that they will already be doing work for the other two companies.
Of the total project cost of US$422 million excluding interest during
construction, the foreign exchange component is estimated to be about US$220
million or some 52% of total project cost.  Including interest during cons-
truction on foreign loans total foreign exchange requirements are estimated
at about 55% of total financing requirements.
B.   Working Capital
5.05      The incremental working capital required for the project is esti-
mated at US$45.3 million. While COSIPA's current ratio in the past 11as gen-
erally been better than 1.5:1, this ratio is misleading because it does not
reflect COSIPA's excessively large inventories, particularly in raw materials,
nor the fact that cash has been very low in relation to the level of sales and
accounts payable. McKee has studied these problems and has made recommend-
ations on how to improve the Company's working capital position. These
recommendations are currently being implemented and are expected to enable
COSIPA to reduce its working capital by about US$7 million at the completion
of Stage I (1973) from the 1971 level. Moreover, during negotiations, the
Bank has received the assurance that the Company will take all steps to
reduce its inventories to more reasonable levels. The increase of US$45.3
million after 1973 therefore pertains to the Stage II project and further
details on this are given in Annex 10. The Company should be able to fi-
nance any additional requirements either by short-term loans or discounting
accounts receivable.
C.   Financial Plan
5.06      The financial plan to cover the expansion project's total cost
of US$472 million consists of US$179 million in the form of equity (capital
increase plus internal cash generation) and the remaining US$293 million
in loans and credits.
5.07      All nmachinery and equipment, except for the downpayments needed
for the bilaterally procured equipment, will be financed by loans from
IBRD/IDB and foreign bilateral agencies. Since local currency requirements
for the project are closely Interlaced with COSIPA's other financial
requirements such as those for the Stage I expansion and repayment of exist-
ing debts, the following summary of the sources and applications of funds,
during the implementation of the project has been prepared:

/1   Relending of preferred dividends plus interest during construction
period.
/2   Includes relining of blast furnace.
13   Includes pre-operating expenses of US$2.7 million for Stage I.
5.08      The Bank and IDB loans would be jointly disbursed in a 60:40
proportion and are proposed to be for 15-1/2 years, including 4-1/2 years
of grace at the prevailing interest rate of 7-1/4% for the Bank and 8% for
IDB. The Government of Brazil would charge the Company a 1-3/4% per annum
guarantee fee on the outstanding amount of the Bank loan, thereby bringing
its cost to the Company to 9%. The bilateral credits will on average cover
90% of the CIF value of equipment from suppliers in the respective coun-
tries 1/ and will be for 15 years after signing (or 12 years following com-
missioning of the equipment) at an average cost to COSIPA of 7-1/2% per
annum. The 10% downpayment for this equipment would be paid out of COSIPA's
cash generation. The bilateral credits can only be used for imported
equipment, but the IBRD/IDB loans are also available for local equipment
purchases after international competitive bidding.
5.09      In addition to the amounts committed for the Stage I expansion,
BNDE has agreed to provide, together with the eventual contributions by
othier shareholders, during the construction period funds estimated to total
1/   Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom
and the United States.



- 16 -
about US$170 million equivalent. The funds are to be in the form of equity
or loan depending on the Company's debt/equity ratio (para 8.10) at the
time the funds are needed. This new commitment is assumed in the financial
projections to be (i) a loan of US$93.7 million and equity participation of
US$41.9 million for the project and (ii) relending of preferred dividends
paid by the Company during the construction period, totalling US$31.4 million.
5.10      BNDE loans are expected for a period of 16 years including 4 years
of -race and at an interest rate of 5% per annum plus monetary corrections 1/.
The Sao Paulo State Government has indicated in a letter to COSIPA that it
intends to invest annually in shares of COSIPA, through 1975, an amount
equal to 50% of its 1CM tax receipts from the Company, which is estimated
to be US$40.2 million equivalent. A first such investment was made in 1971.
This equity participation is forecast to increase the State's shareholding
in the Company from 2.4% to 15.5% at the end of 1975. During negotiations
BNDE agreed to the financial plan, including the State of Sao Paulo's parti-
-ipation.
5.11      The cash generated from the operations will cover part of the
construction cost, downpayments for equipment purchased with bilateral
financing, and financial expenses during the construction period. COSIPA's
cash generation appears adequate to meet the projected needs. Ilowever,
during negotiations the Government has agreed to provide, on terms satis-
factory to the Bank, whatever additional resources - foreign as well as
local - may be needed to complete the project and bring it into operation,
in case of a cost overrun or shortfall in financing.
VI. PROCUREMENT
A.   General Procurement
6.01      The Bank and IDB will jointly finance on a 60:40 basis equipment
and spares totalling US$107.5 million to be procured under international
competitive bidding with Brazilian manufacturers receiving a 15% preference.
This preference is less than the normal import tariff which has, however,
been waived for the steel expansion program. The remaining equipment and
spare parts to be-imported (approximately US$101 million) will be bid
competitively among the countries which have agreed to join the bilateral
financing scheme. Construction work will be executed by local contractors,
provided they can meet completion schedules and their prices remain
reasonable (para 4.13); it will not be financed by IBRD/IDB. Further
details on general procurement are dealt with in Chapter IX of Part I.
1/   This involves revaluation of loans in accordance with indices (ORTN
monetary correction indices) published by the Ministry of Planning and
General Coordination.



- 17 -
B.   Allocation of Bank's Loan
6.02      Brazilian manufacturers are expected to win under international
competitive bidding up to 40% of the equipment financed by the Bank and
IDB loans (para 5.04). This estimate is based on the same assumption as
that used for CSN and USIMINAS, that is to say that Brazilian suppliers of
equipment to the project qualify for export incentives. With these incen-
tives, the allocation of the Bank loan is estimated as follows:
Estimated Allocation of Bank's Loan
Expenditures (US$ millions)
Brazilian   Foreign /1       Total
Equipment (including freight)         14.4        34.9           49.3

/1   Including foreign exchange component (20%) of local equipment
and spares.
6.03      The equipment to be financed by the Bank is shown in Annex 11.
The disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is based on the estimates of
order placement and expected delivery times for each equipment package and
is in conformity with the construction schedule discussed in para 4.15.
The forecast disbursement schedule is given in Annex 12.
VII. PRODUCTION COSTS AND SELLING PRICES
A.   Raw Material Costs
7.01      One of the major factors in the development of a competitive steel
industry in Brazil is the availability of high quality iron ore at low cost.
hlile its location does not give COSIPA as low cost iron ore as CSN and
USIMINAS, the Company can compensate for the increased ore costs by higher
ex-factory prices for its finished products due to the proximity of major
customers (para 7.06). The cost of iron ore delivered to COSIPA is US$9 per
ton, which is about twice that of CSN and USIMINAS and includes a rail freight
element of about US$5.20 per ton. Nevertheless, the ore cost per ton of
finished steel produced by COSIPA is US$17 which compares well with a typi-
cal ore cost of US$17-24 in Japanese and Western European plants. Brazil
has virtually unlimited iron ore and hence an assured supply. Although
COSIPA's contracts with four or five mines are short-term, no difficulties
are foreseen in covering its future iron ore requirements.



- 18 -
7.02       Brazil's need to import large quantities of high grade coking
coal and thie Government regulation, which presently requires COSIPA to
consume about 38% of its total coking coal requirements in the form of
high cost and poor quality national coal, tend to offset the Brazilian
steel industry's cost advantage stemming from relatively low iron ore and
labor costs. Assurances have been obtained from the Government during
negotiations that COSIPA will not be required to obtain more than 20% of
its coking coal requirements locally after 1976 as long as the domestic
coal remains of low quality. To protect its position with regard to foreign
coal sources, COSIPA intends to enter into long-term contracts (eight years)
with at least two suppliers; negotiations are well advanced.
7.03      The Company's coal cost per ton of finished steel in 1971 amounted
to about US$27 and is expected to decline to about US$24 after completion
of Stage II as a result of a reduction in coke rate and improvements in
operating efficiency. COSIPA's coal cost would thus remain somewhat higher
than those of around US$18 per ton in Japan and US$22 in lWestern Europe.
The combined cost per ton of finished steel for the principal raw materials -
iron ore and coal - is estimated at US$41 in 1978, which is slightly
higher than the lowest cost in Japanese and Western European steel mills.
7.04      The other two principal raw materials, limestone and dolomite,
are obtained from the mines of MFM, a COSIPA subsidiary (para 2.12), located
approximately 200 km and 450 km from the plant. The quarries are being
enlarged to meet the Company's increased needs. Further details regarding
raw miaterials, including quantity and sources, are given in Annex 13 and
Man -IBRD 3893. COSIPA's transportation and shipping facilities will also
be expanded and improved to support the planned growth in production. Water
and electric power supply are available in sufficient quantities to meet the
increased requiremnents.
B.   Production Costs
7.05       COSIPA's direct manufacturing costs for representative products
are shown below for 1971 (actual); 1973 (1.0 million TPY) after completion
of Stage I, and 1978 (2.3 million TPY) after completion of Stage II. Fur-
ther details are given in Annex 14.

/1   Excludes ICM, depreciation and financial charges.  The manufacturing
costs of end products vary slightly between 1978 and 1980 due to
changes in product mix.



- 19 -
7.96      In 1971, of the total direct manufacturing cost of about US$71
million, raw material costs accounted for about 60% or some US$42 million.
The raw material costs in that year were unusually high because of excep-
tional circumstances in the supply of iron ore 1/. The economies of scale
to be achieved by the expansion plus the improvements in operating
efficiency, which can reasonably be expected as a result of the NSC assist-
ance, should take place at all stages of production - from hot metal to
finished steel. The manufacturing cost of slabs is expected to drop by
about 25% between 1971 and 1978 and that of cold rolled products by some
31%. Raw material cost per ton of finished steel in 1978 would be about
US$46.5 and operating cost, excluding depreciation, administrative and sell-
ing expenses and financial charges about US$40.0, giving a total direct man-
ufacturing cost of US$86.5 per ton of finished steel - about 70% variable
and 30% fixed cost. The input prices, operating costs and efficiencies are
considered realistic and achievable and are consistent with those projected
by CSN and USIMINAS.
C.   Selling Prices
7.07      COSIPA's selling price assumptions, shown in Annex 15, are based
on February 1971 prices. The weighted average selling price of the Company's
finished steel products (excluding ICM and IPI taxes) is about US$159 per
ton and, on a product-by-product basis, is in line with Western European
prices except for cold rolled products. Maximum prices are established
twice a year after approval by the Interministerial Price Council (CIP),
based on increases in costs outside the steel companies' control, i.e.,
raw materials, fuel and power, labor contracts and depreciation. CIP's
policies are discussed in Part I (para 2.19). Since CIP's steel price
control applies to a "delivered Sao Paulo" basis, COSIPA's ex-plant prices
are higher than those of CSN and USIMINAS due to its nearer location.
7.08      As discussed in Part I (paras 5.10 and 5.11), the Government has
given the Bank satisfactory assurance as to the aims of its steel pricing
policies and has agreed to consult with the Bank if the return on the aggre-
gate operating assets of CSN, USIMINAS or COSIPA should fall below 10% or
rise above 15% in any year. This should permit the companies to (a) earn
an adequate return on capital under efficient operating conditions, (b) meet
their financial obligations, and (c) contribute to the financing of further
expansion, while being reasonably competitive with imports. A detailed
study on the future price structure for steel products will be carried out
by the Government.
1/   The delivered cost of iron ore per ton of finished products was about
US$11.5 (about 25-30% higher than normal) because of the collapse of
a railway bridge which necessitated the transportation of iron ore by
ship, which, in the case of COSIPA, is a more expensive mode of trans-
port.



- 20 -
7.09      Moreover, the Bank has reached an agreement with COSIPA during
negotiations that the Company would take all reasonable steps to ensure
that the average February 1971 prices of its domestically sold products
will not be reduced in real terms prior to 1977.

8.02      COSIPA is expected to show a net profit of US$14 million in 1972
compared with a loss of US$6 million in 1971. This substantial improvement
would come about as a result of (i) a reduction in financial charges by
about US$5.6 million due to the capitalizatLon of BNDE's loans (para 2.16);
(ii) a decrease in operating cost due mainly to a temporary reduction, al-
ready achieved, in thie Company's labor force by about 150 people and a
decrease in raw material costs from the exceptionally high level of 1971
(para 7.06); (iii) an increase in operating efficiency; and (iv) an antici-
pated increase in sales of finished products by processing slabs purchased
at favorable contract prices on some of the Stage I equipment already
installed. These results are considered reasonable and achievable.
8.03      After completion of Stage I, net sales in 1973 would increase
marginally over 1972 and so would net profits. Once the Stage II project
is completed and running at capacity in 1978, net sales are expected to
increase by US$193 million or by about 135% above 1973 and net profits would
go up by US$37 million over the same period. In 1978 net profit would
amount to a satisfactory 16% on sales and 12% on average equity. Reflecting
the increased profit levels as a result of the Stage II expansion, the
Company's internal cash generation is forecast to rise from US$37 million in
1973 to US$99 million in 1978, an increase of 167%. The technical,
commercial and financial assumptions underlying the forecast are considered
sound and the projected profit levels attainable.



- 21 -
B.   3reak-Even Point
8.04       Break-even points are calculated only for flat steel production,
i.e. excluding the costs and benefits attributable to foundry and metallur-
gical coke production. The nrofit break-even point is at about 67% of capac-
ity or 1.14 million TPY of finished steel, after completion of Stage II,
and at about 73% after Stage I. Differently expressed, once the Stage II
project is operating at full capacity, steel prices could fall by 19% be-
fore the Company would show a loss. The cash break-even point will be
lower than the profit break-even point for all of the projected years,
since the annual depreciation is higher than the debt amortization of each
year. Hlowever, the additional debt incurred for Stage II will move the
cash break-even point from 55% of production capacity in 1973 to 64% in
1978. Further details on the break-even levels are given in Annex 18.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
8.05       The project - Stage II - provides a financial rate of return of
16.8%o. Details on thie assumptions used are contained in Annex 19. However,
given the same standard of operating efficiency at the completion of Stage I
as that assumed for Stage II, the Stage I production capacity with minor
additions and alterations of equipment would be about 20% higher than
forecast, or 1.2 million TPY of raw steel. Taking this higher base case
would thus reduce the incremental rate of return of the project to 13.6%.
8.06       Sensitivity tests have been conducted to determine the effect of
various events on the financial rate of return and are provided in Annex 19,
a summary of which is shown below:
Sensitivity Tests on Internal Financial Rate of Return
Case                       Description                       Rate of Return (%)
1       Base Case                                                 16.8
2       Sales Revenue decreases 10%                               12.6
3       Operating Costs increase 10%                              14.4
4       Operating Costs decrease 10%                              19.1
5       Project Costs increase 10%                                15.3
6       One-Year Delay in Completion plus 15% of
Project Costs increase                                 12.7
7       Sales Revenue decreases 5% and Operating
Costs increase 5%                                      13.6
8       Project Costs increase 10% and Operating
Costs increase 10%                                     13.0
9       Project Costs increase 10% and Sales Revenue
decreases 10%                                          11.0
8.07       Thle project is Imiost sensitive to changes in sales revenue.  If
revenues drop by 10% without corresponding reduction in operating costs, the



- 22 -
return will decrease to 12.6%. The project is more sensitive to operating
costs increases than similar increases in capital costs. For instance, an
increase of 20% in operating costs will decrease the return by 30% as
compared with a 17% reduction with a 20% increase in capital costs. A
combination of circumstances would have an effect on return to the extent
each cost and revenue stream varies from the expected values. As an extreme
case, if both operating costs as well as capital costs are increased by
10% while revenue is reduced by 10%, the return would drop to 8.6%. lHence,
even with such combinations of adverse conditions, the project is expected
to provide a marginally satisfactory financial return. In comparison with
the expected financial returns on the CSN and USIMINAS projects, that of
COSIPA's project is considerably higher. This is not due to any basic
differences in the projects per se, but rather to the slim base against
which the incremental return of the COSIPA project is measured.
D.   Major Risks
8.08      Apart from factors largely beyond the control of the Company such
as (a) possible delays caused by the simultaneous implementation of three
large steel projects in a rapidly expanding economy, and (b) a slowing down
of the predicted growth of demand, the major technical risks inherent in th1e
project are the attainment of the planned production in the expanded BOF
shop and revamped slabbing mill (para 4.05) and the projected reductions in
operating cost. While the Company may have difficulties in the beginning in
achieving and maintaining its production targets, it is expected that, with
the operating assistance to be provided by NSC, any such difficulties will
be shortlived. The other potential risk stems from COSIPA's lack of a suc-
cessful record of achievement. However, the ongoing studies of the Company's
organizational structure and management and the implementation of the recom-
mendations emerging from this study are expected to help the Company to
cope with the increased scale of operation.
E.   Financial Position
8.09      Balance sheet projections for 1972-1981 are contained in Annex 20
and significant data and ratios from these for selected years are given
below:

/1   Excludes surplus cash.



- 23 -
8.10      The nresent long-term debt/equity ratio of the Company is strong
and is expected to remain satisfactory during the implementation of the
project.  COSIPA's debt position would build up to a maximum of 50,Z of total
capital in 1975 and then decrease rapidly, reflecting the good profitability
of the expanded plant. Also as discussed in para 5.09 the debt/equity
ratio would not rise above 50/50 during the implementation of the project,
since any additional financing needed to complete the project would have to
be provided in a form satisfying such requirement. As mentioned before,
the liquidity position of the Company at the end of 1971 is burdened by
excessively high inventories, but this situation is expected to improve by
1973. The current ratio is lowest in 1975 and thereafter would be kept at
about 1.4:1, exclusive of excess cash, assumed to be earmarked for further
expansion (Stage III).
8.11       The Company's liquidity position will not allow payments of
dividends to common shareholders during the construction period.  In order
to keep the Company in a sound financial and liquidity position, assurances
were received during negotiations that COSIPA will pay no dividends on
common shares if the current ratio would fall below 1.5:1 and also that the
Company should maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.3:1. It was alsc
agreed that COSIPA will not borrow additional long-term funds if its long-
term debt would exceed equity, or if projected debt service coverage would
be less than two times.  Finally, the Company agreed that it will not under-
take additional capital investments (other than the project and Stage I)
whether in COSIPA or in its subsidiaries in excess of US$8 million equivalen
annually, including not more than US$4 million equivalent in any of its sub-
sidiaries, during the life of the Bank's loan without the Bank's approval.
F.   Debt Service Coverage
8.12       Based on the projections and the proposed financial plan, COSIPA's
long-term debt service forecasts indicate the following:
Long-Term Debt Service Coverage Forecasts
Year             1972   1973   1974   1975   1976   1978   1981
Times Covered          2.1    2.4    1.8    1.2    1.3    1.9    2.3
Long-term debt service coverage is unsatisfactory only in 1975.  Hiowever,
since the project will not hiave been completed by then, the Government/
BNDE, would have to meet any possible shortfall in COSIPA's loan repayment
ability as part of their commitment to provide whatever funds are required
to complete the project.
G.   Further Expansion (Stage III)
8.13      As mentioned in para 4.04, COSIPA will need additional steelmaking
rolling and finishing facilities to meet the expected increase in demand



- 24 -
for steel in Brazil. The Company plans to undertake a further expansion
of its raw steel capacity to about 3.5 million TPY which is tentatively
scheduled to be completed by 1983. The timing of this expansion and the
composition of the finished products will depend on the findings of the
market study, which CONSIDER will commission, and the timing of the
further expansions (Stage III) of CSN and USIMINAS. The project cost (in
1971 prices), including interest during construction, working capital and
pre-operating expenses, is roughly estimated at US$350 million, of which
US$170 million will be in foreign exchange. COSIPA tentatively plans to
implement this project with US$120 million in loans and thie remainder in
equity. The financial covenants mentioned in para 8.11 are designed to
assure that these investments will be carried out on a soundl basis. The
financial statements superimposing costs and benefits of this expansion oni
the forecasts of Stage II are summarized in Annex 21.
IX. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.01      The prices used for the economic rate of return calculations are
(i) for domestic sales the European export prices that prevailed in February-
August 1971 1/ for comparable products plus the actual cost of transport from
main European ports to Sao Paulo, and (ii) for exports the prices used for
the financial calculations. Based on these prices and an assumed life of
18 years with no scrap value remaining for the assets added in the Stage II
expansion, the project yields an economic rate of return of 14.8%. The
underlying assumptions and details of the economic analysis as well as the
sensitivity tests are given in Annex 19. The economic return is generally
sensitive to changes in costs and benefits to the same extent as the finan-
cial return. A decrease of 10% in the revenues reduces the return to 11.1%.
If the project is delayed one year and project costs go up by 15%, the return
would drop to 11%. A combination of revenues 10% lower and operating costs
10%o higher than assumed will still produce an acceptable economic return of
10%.  Thus, the project provides a satisfactory return under foreseeable
circumstances and an acceptable return under adverse circumstances.
B.   Competitiveness and Protection Required
9.02      As mentioned in para 7.07 and discussed in greater detail in Part
I, selling prices for most finished flat products in Brazil are in line
with those prevailing in Western Europe. A comparison of COSIPA's domestic
selling prices assumed for the financial analysis and the CIF price of
equivalent imports reveals that the domestic prices of plate and hot rolled
1/   The currency realignments in late 1971 have tended to increase European
steel export prices.



- 25 -
products, which represent about 65% of COSIPA's projected domestic sales,
are lower than equivalent import prices, while the prices of cold rolled
products are about 12% 1higher than import prices. As a weighted average,
the import price for COSIPA's product mix is 5% lower than the domestic
price. Since the project would yield a satisfactory 15% return if domestic
prices were decreased by 5%, the project is financially viable even without
the nominal tariff protection.
C.   Estimated Foreign Exchange Savings
9.03      The project will have a beneficial impact on Brazil in terms of
foreign exchange, since the calculated incremental net foreign exchange
savings of US$95 million per year at full production after the completion
of Stage II would offset the estimated foreign exchange costs of the
project of US$260 million in about three years. At full production upon
completion of Stage II, the net foreign exchange savings resulting from
the operations of the Company are calculated at US$171 million per year.
Further details of the calculation of foreign exchange savings are shown
in Annex 22.
X.  AGREENENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
10.1      Agreement was reached on the following principal points during loan
negotiations:
A.   Commitments by the Government and BNDE
(a) The Government will consult with the Bank prior to
sanctioning any new flat steel production capacity
before the existing plants have been expanded to their
Stage III capacities (para 4.04).
(b) The Government and the Bank will consult on future
pricing policy (para 7.08).
(c)  The Company will remain an independent corporation and
will not be merged or consolidated without prior approval
of the Bank (para 2.08).
(d)  The Government will expedite the registration of contracts
and the issuance of import licences for the project
(para 4.15).
(e)  The Government will take all reasonable measures required
to enable the Company to obtain bilateral financing on
terms satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.08).



- 26 -
(f) BNDE shall make new loans and/or subscribe to increases of
capital stock of the Company on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank; such loans and subscriptions to
provide, together with funds from others, sufficient funds
(estimated to be about US$170 million equivalent including
financial changes) to COSIPA to enable the Company to carry
out the project and cover the preferred dividends paid by
the Company during the construction period (para 5.09).
(g) Confirmnation that BNDE agrees to the financial plan, includ-
ing the purchase of the Company's shares by the State of Sao
Paulo to the extent of half the latter's 11CM tax receipts
from COSIPA through 1975 (para 5.10).
(h) The Government will cover project cost overruns or shortfall
in financing of the project, whether in foreign or local
currency, on terms satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.11).
(i) The Government will not require COSIPA to use low grade
high cost coking coal for more than 20% of its requirements
after completion of the expansion project (para 7.02).
B.        Commitments bV tyhe Company
(j) The Company will expand the scope of the consultants' present
services and review their recommendations witht the Bank, im-
plement them as appropriate and take further steps, if neces-
sary, to strengthen the management of the Company (para 2.06).
(k) The Company will limit investment in, or loans to and
guarantees for, its subsidiaries to US$2 million equivalent
in any one year with the possibility of accumulation of up
to US$6 million, through 1980 (para 2.13).
(1) No new subsidiaries will be created by the Company without
prior consent of the Bank (para 2.13).
(m)  In the event there is evidence that the local construction
industry is becoming over-extended, the Company will take
remedial action including utilization of contractors
(including foreign contractors), who shall be in a position
to provide such services on reasonable terms and in accord-
ance with the construction schedule for subsequent contracts
(para 4.13).
(n)  The Company will promptly obtain additional assistance, as
needed, for the proper implementation of the project
(para 4.14).



- 27 -
(o)  Agreement that the Company will take necessary steps,
satisfactory to the Bank, to reduce its inventories to
reasonable levels (para 5.05).
(p)  The Company will not reduce before 1977 the average
price in real terms of its finished products sold on the
domestic market without prior consultation with the Bank
(para 7.09).
(q)  The Company will maintain a current ratio of not less than
1.3:1 (para 8.11).
(r)  The Company will limit additional capital investments for
fixed and capital assets (including by subsidiaries) to
US$8 million equivalent annually, of which only up to US$4
million equivalent may be made by its subsidiaries except
with Bank approval (para 8.11).
(s)  The Company will not contract additional long-term
borrowing if its total long-term debt exceeds its
equity or if projected debt service coverage would be
less than two times (para 8.11).
(t)  The Company will declare dividends on common shares only
if, after such dividends, it maintains a current ratio of
1.5:1 (para 8.11).
10.02     Concurrent effectiveness of the IDB loan will be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank's loan.
10.03     Based on the above agreements reached during negotiations, the
project is suitable for a loan of US$64.5 million equivalent, for 15-1/2
years including 4-1/2 years of grace period.

ANNEX 2
BRAZIL - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING FACILITIES
The integrated plant at Oubatao,with installations and moderni-
zation encompassed in the one million ton plan of expansion (Stage I), consists
of facilities necessary for raw materials handling, coke and by-products pro-
duction, iron and steelmaking, and conversion of ingots into marketable flat
rolled products.
Transportation Infrastructure
At the present time the plant is serviced by railroad, ocean vessels
and trucks. Several significant projects currently underway will provide
improved service to and from the plant, as follows:
Railroad trackage has been laid which will shorten the
distance from the ore mines to the plant. Furthermore, the
City of Sao Paulo will be completely by-passed.
At present, the movement of railroad cars to and from
Piacaguera is limited to the capacity of steam locomotives
with a cable tow arrangement for movement up the slope of the
Serra do Mar mountain. This system is being augmented by
electrically driven locomotives equipped with cog wheels arran-e-
ment.  One track system, including bridges, is being rein-
forced to handle heavier loads. It is estimated that the
capacity of total system will be increased by some four to
five fold.
A new railroad track is being built into the plant which
will permit direct railroad delivery of limestone and dolo-
mite from the mine site. At present these materials are
being delivered by truck.
A new highway is being constructed from Santos to Sao
Paulo which will more than double the capacity of the
present one. Trucks from Piacaguera will have easy
access to the new system.
A new highway is being contructed along the coast
which will connect Santos with Rio de Janeiro.  This wilL
facilitate movement of traffic to Rio de Janeriro
All the above mentioned programs are expected to be
completed between 1973 and 1975.
Delinition of Existing Facilities
For the purpose of this Annex, all facilities previously built, or
scheduled to be built as part of the one million ton expansion plan, are con-
sidered as existing facilities. The description which follows is written in
the present tense as though all of the facilities were completed and in
operation.

Dock installations consist of one pier 200-meter long equipped with
an unloader rated at 600 tons per hour maximum when unloading coal.
Raw Materials Handling
Imported and national coal, and part of the iron ore are received
over the dock. Some iron ore, limestone and dolomite arrive by railroad.
Facilities for raw material unloading, storage and handling consist at a
raw materials conveyor system from the dock to the raw materi. als and coal
storage yards; two car dumpers; and storage areas equipped with three stackers,
a ore rotary wheel reclaimer, and associated conveying systems. Crushing and
screening facilities for iron ore and stone are available in thie vicinity of
the iron ore storage yard.
Sintering Plants
Sintering facilities consist of sintering plants No. 1, No. 2
with nominal capacities of 2,100 and 3,000 tons of sinter per day, respectivey,.
Coke Plant
Coke-making facilities consist of 97 ovens, in three batteries, coal
storage and preparation system, coke crushing and screeening equipment. Faci-
lities are used for the recovery of coke oven gas, tar and tar distilla-
tions products, ammonium sulphate, and benzol products.
Blast Furnace
Facilities for the production of pig iron consist of one blast
furnace and associated equipment, which, after the reline and enlargement
program scheduled for 1972, will be able to produce about 3,000 tons of hot
metal per day.Torpedo cars are used to transport hot metal from the blast furnace
to the steel plant.
BOF Steel Plant
The basic oxygen steelmaking shop has two 100-ton furnaces, one
operating at a time in normal sequence, and a third furnace of 75-ton capacity
maintained as an emergency stand-by facility. The shop is self-contained and
is complete with all necessary auxiliary facilities.
Foundry
The foundry is equipped with two cupola furnaces for cast iron, one
electric arc furnace, two crucible furnaces for nonferrous metals, and the
required auxiliary equipment. Capacity is adequate to supply the ingot
molds and stools and spare parts required for the one million ton level of
operation.

Slabbing Mill
The 4h-inch high lift slabbing mill, driven by twin 4,000 hp DC
motors, permits the rolling of slabs 1,600 mm (63 inches) wide. This mill
is capable of rolling about 2,300,000 ingot tons per year, with some altera-
tions. Soaking pit facilities consist of six 2-hole pits with a capacity
to process 1,000,000 tons of ingots yearly.
Hot Strip Mill
Existing facilities for rolling plate and strip for hot and cold-
rolled product consist of the following major units:
Two slab reheating furnaces of 100 tons per hour capacity
each.
One 72-inch 2-high rougher/ scale breaker driven by a 1,000
hp motor.

ANNEX 5
BRAZIL - COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT
PROPOSED FACILITIES
The new facilities and alterations to existing equipment and systems
comprised in the 2.3 million TPY expansion project (Stage II) are described below.
The layout of the plant is attached after Annex 24.
1.  Dock and Raw Materials Handling
The existing dock will be extended by 100 meters and a second unloader
rated at 600 t/h will be installed. The turning basin will be enlarged to 170-
meter radius and 10-meter depth to allow for 30,000 DWT carriers to dock at the
terminal.
On the assumption that the entire quantity of coal will be unloaded at
the dock, the two unloaders will operate at about 30% of their capacity only and
will, if necessary, be able to handle about 50% of the ore consumed by the planit
at the completion of the 2.3 million TPY project.
In addition, the Company is considering the installation of a separate
125 m long x 37 m wide dock provided with a 15-ton loading crane to facilitate
shipment of about 20% of the planned production of plate, coil and sheet. The
preliminary location of this loading dock is shown in the plant layout. However,
whether or not it will become necessary and its precise location will be studied
further. Nevertheless, the capital cost estimates include the construction of
the dock.
The addition of a primary yard to complement the existing raw materials
handling facilities will enable the materials received either by ship or via the
car dumpers to be adequately stored in individual piles prior to blending. The
yard will be connected to the dock and to the present raw materials facilities by
means of belt conveyors.
The primary yard will cover an area of about 39,000 sq m for Stage II.
Provisions will be made to allow for the addition of two more 300 m x 60 m berths
which will be required for Stage III. Depending upon NSC's further investigation
required in connection with the final design and location of the primary yard,
some changes in the original concept may take place and it is possible that the
third berth may have to be provided in Stage II to serve as a site for temporary
storage of various materials such as coke, sinter return, coke breeze, dolomite
fines, limestone, manganese ore and others, since the area allocated for this pur-
pose at the east end of the present yard may not be sufficient. The plant lay-
out shows, among other items, the proposed primary yard arrangement and location.
Test borings will be carried out in this area to provide supporting data for its
design and specification. Each berth will have a storage capacity, based on 30-
day storage, of about 128,000 tons of sized ore or 142,000 tons of ore fines.
File height will be kept at a maximum of 10 m.
The yard will be served by two 840 t/h wheel-loaders. In the exist-
ing blending yard one stacker will be added to operate on the gravel and lime-
stone piles. To improve reclaiming operations one additional 1,000 t/h double-
wheel rotary type unit will be added.

2.   Coke Plant
This will consist of two 53 oven batteries of the underjet type with
coking cells of 6,000 mm high x 16,000 mrnm long x 430 mm wide. The batteries
will be served by two sets of oven machinery. The three existing batteries
comprising 97 ovens and one of the new batteries will be operated for the pro-
duction of metallurgical coke. The new No. 5 battery will be reserved during
Stage II for the production of merchant blast furnace and foundry coke.
On the assumption of a bulk density of coal (dry basis) of 730 kg/rn',
total coke yield of 73.5%, blast furnace coke yield of 63.5%, normal working
rate of the existing ovens of 135% and that for the new ovens of 145% and oper.!-

Total                                          525,738
Coal consumption has been computed considering that petroleum coke
equivalent to 10% of the wet coal requirements will be purchased from Petrobras.
The unit for the production of such by-products is being installed at Cubatao
refinery.
The coal yard has been arranged and sized to satisfy the requirements of
Stage 1II. It will cover a total area of about 110,000 sq.m.with space for stor-
ing approximately 335,000 tons of coal.
The basic arrangement comprising four berths, four lines of piles, four
stack wheel-loaders (1,200 t/h stacking, 400 t/h reclaiming capacities) provided
with 50-meter booms will be installed.
Pile height will be about 8 m. In order to improve stanking efficiency,
a 3-m high wall will be built between the two inner berths. It is expected that
the revamped coal yard will have a high efficiency.
When No. 5 battery reverts to the production of metallurgical coke in
Stage 11I the overall B.F. coke production (5 batteries) will total 1,437,950 t/y
which, in   turn, will afford the equivalent raw steel production of 3,220,000
t/y at a coke rate of 500 kg/t and 3,437,000 t/y at a coke rate of 470 kg/t
respectively.
3.   Blast Airnace Plant
The hot metal production required in Stage II will be about 5,600 t/
day.
It is assumed that the existing No. 1 blast furnace will participate
with an average of 2,000 t/day and a maximum daily production of 2,40o t.  The
new No. 2 furnace will produce initially an average of 3,600 t/day (1.1h t/day/rm3
of inner volume) and a maximum of )4,000 t/day with a sinter ratio of 67% to 70%
in the burden. The furnace will, however, be designed as free standing with
provision for future enlargement of inner volume by about 20g.  The hearth dia-
meter will be 10.9 meters and the inner volume abou-t 2,540 m.  Inner volume
is defined as the volume between the iron notch and the stockline. The furnace
is designed for an ultimate top pressure of 1.5 kg/cm2.  The fuel rate is assLmed
to be 550 kg/t of hot metal (500 kg of coke + 50 kg of oil).



ANNEX '
Page 1
The furnace will comprise two cast houses and three hot stoves wiLh
provision for addition of a fourth stove in the future. A hot blast tempera-
ture of 11000C is to be obtained.  Gas cleaning equipment and charging eu pTne.l t,
will be sized for a production of 6,000 t/day with a fuel rate of 550 kg/t,.
Centralized control will be located at the furnace control room. One turbo-
blower rated to operate in the ranges of 3,000 to 4,600 Nm3/min. of wind voliume
and 1.5 to 3.2 atg of wind pressure will be sufficient for the Stage II prodiuc-
tion of No. 2 furnace. For production beyond 4,000 t/day, a second blower will.
be installed to operate in parallel with the one included in the initial blast
furnace installation.  Stand-by service will be provided by one of the presetlt.
units.
4.   B.O.'. Plant
The present B.O.F. shop initially modified and extended can attain a
production of 2.3 million tons of ingots per year. The major alterations are as
follows:
(a) Install a third 100-ton vessel complete with hood to replace the
existing 75-ton unit.
(b) Extend the teeming aisle 36 m.
(c) Install a third 150/40/10 ton ladle crane in the teeming aisle.
(d) Extend the mold preparation yard 80 m.
(e) Install a third 50/25 ton crane in the mold preparation yard.
(f) Install a second 300/25 (50) ton stripper crane in the stripper
building.
(g)  Install a second 250 t/day rotary kiln at the calcining plant.
(h) Install a second gas cleaning plant to supplement the present
facilities.
The production of 2,300,000 t/year is to be attained on the basis of:
192,000 t/month (good ingot)
76.7% hot metal ratio
80% good ingot yield
110 t/heat
26.6 working days/month
41 min tap to tap time
61 heats/day
2c,940 heats/year.
These figures are conservative in comparison with NSC's actual operat-
ing practice in Japan. Having regard to COSIPA's technical assistance agreement
with NSC for the operations in the metallurgical area, no serious problems are
foreseen in achieving the forecast production.



ANNEX 5

5.   Oxygen Plant
In order to meet the requirements of oxygen for steelrmaking and mis-
cellaneous uses totalling about 22,000 Nm3/h (16,680 Nm3/h max for the B.O.F.
shop), a third air separation plant for the production of 8,000 Nm3/h of gaseous
oxygen will be added. Two oxygen compressors for 8,000 Nm3/h each will be
installed at the new plant. In this way, one of the 3,000 Nm3/h existing com-
presssors will serve as a standby unit. No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces will not
require oxygen enrichment of the blast for Stage II, but additional liquid oxygen
storage of about 300 m3 will be provided to support supply of oxygen to the B.O.-W.
shop during regular maintenance work of the air separation plants. Existing
gaseous oxygen storage totalling 500 m3 will be increased to 900 m3. Piping
will be extended to the new plate mill and No. 2 blast furnace.
The oxygen producing facilities in Stage II will thus comprise:
Air Separator    2 Caovgressor
(a)  No. 1 Air Separation Plant (existing)          2 x 3,000 Nm3/h  2 x 3,000 Nm3/h
(b)  No. 2 Air Separation Plant (Stage I)           1 x 8,000 Nm3/h  1 x 3,000 Nm3/h
(c)  No. 3 Air Separation Plant (Stage II)          1 x 3,000 Nm3/h  1 x 8,OOO Nm3/h
1 x 8,000 Nm3/h
Wnether to install the second 8,000 Nm3/h oxygen compressor in the new
air separation plant or to split this capacity between two units and install them
in the No. 2 air separation plant which has been designed with provisions to
receive two additional oxygen conpressors, is a matter that will be further
investigated during the engineering stage of the plan.
6.   Slabbing Mill Plant
The required alterations to be carried out at the slabbing mill in order
to process 2.3 million tons of ingots annually are as follows:
(a) Installation of four soaking pit batteries of the top-one-way
recuperative type, four-holes per battery, 120-ton capacity per hole, in sequence
with the present six batteries comprising top-two-way recuperative type pits
with two holes per battery. The pits proposed are more efficient than the exist-
ing ones and, furthermore, require less building area. One soaking pit crane
will be added. The existing ingot buggy is considered sufficient to take care
of the additional handling.
(b)  Replacement of the slabbing mill drives by more powerful motors.
NSC has investigated this matter and has indicated that with the present 2 x
3,000 KW drives the mill has a capacity of 290 t/h, whereas the use of 2 x 1h,250
KW motors would raise its capacity to the minimum requirement of 326 t/h. This
matter is to be further studied with the electrical manufacturer to determine the
alterations, if any, required on the existing twin-drive foundation and anchor
bolts, as well as the most suitable way to increase the present motor-generator
capacity and respective control changes.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
(c) The installation of one high capacity hot scarfing machine using
LPG as fuel, between the mill and the existing shear.
(d) Installation of a slab cooler on the transfer to the slab yard
provided with water sprays and recirculating cooling tower. Hand scarfing will
be carried out on two transfers separated by one slab turner.
(e) Installation of one 3-ton crane provided with a grab bucket over
the scale pits; and two 37.5 x 2/15 t cranes in the existing slab yard.
7.  Plate Mill Plant
The new 160-inch plate mill complex will be designed for a production
of 600,000 t/y of plates during Stage TT and, for subsequent expansion to about
1,000,000 t/y for Stage III. The product mix as envisaged at the present time
has the following distribution;
Plate for                    %
Shipbuilding                        29

The building area will cover about 74,000 sq.m.  Major items comerrsed
in the installation will include:
(a)  One [-high reversing stand with back-up rolls of 2,P,00 mm dia and
work rolls of 1,000 mm dia x 4,064 mm in length. The stand will be driven by
two 4,500 KW motors and will be provided with automatic gauge control and X-ray
gauge for width measurements and control.
(b) One slab yard with two 35-meter spans totalling about 11,500 sq.
m.in area. Slabs will be transferred with the aid of one 100-ton transfer car.
The yard will be provided with three 4O-ton cranes equipped with tongs.
(c)  One 140 t/h continuous reheat furnace of the pusher type to pro-
cess slabs of 160-ton maximum weight and one double chamber in-and-out furnace
with a capacity of 20 t/h capable of receiving slabs with a maximum weight of
20 tons, served by one 20-ton crane.
(d)  Scale breaking equipment of the high pressure water jet type with
descaling pressure of 15 kg/cm2.
(e) Following the mill runout table one 4-high reversing hot leveller
will be installed.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
(f) In the mill bay, one 210/40 t crane will be installed for roll
changing and other services and one 20-ton claw crane for picking up heavy plates
from the mill roller tables and laying them on the floor for cooling.
(g) Two cooling beds 40 m wide x 30 m long of the walking beam or
carrier chain type will be installed in separate bays. Space for a third cool-
ing bed required in the future is provided in the layout.
(h) One finishing line following the second cooling bed, comprising
roller tables, one double side shear of the down-cut type for thicknesses up
to 40 mm; one dividing shear for rolling cut up to 40 mm in plate thickness pro-
vided with shear gauge appropriate for the range 2,400 to 25,o00 mm in plate
length; and one cold level]Pr.
(i)  The finis}/ing bay has space for the installation of a second shear-
ing line in the future. IThe bay will be served by two 30-ton and one 16-ton
magnet cranes. Install d transversely at the end of this bay there will be two
30-ton magnet cranes w' Jch will be used to pile the plates in the area beside
the finishing line anc/return the piles to the roller table for transfer to the
shipping yard.  Flameputting will take place in the area beside the future side
trimmer.             /
(j) The/,hipping yard will be transverse to the mill buildings in an
east-west directiF,.. It will comprise three aisles totalling about 1,500 sq m.
In each aisle, o-/ 30-ton magnet crane will be installed to store the plates and
to move them fry shipment.
(k/ One roll shop provided with one roll grinder and space for a secon8
unit to be / stalled in the future.  The roll shop and the motor room will be
served by .,e 210/40 t crane.
(1)  Plate treating equipment (grinder) will be provided in the area
beside> ,he dividing shear. Maintenance of the first cooling bed will be done
wn <-,ie aid of one 5-ton hoist crane, whereas servicing of the second cooling
kfi and of the continuous reheating furnace will be by means of one 5-ton and
m,ne 7-ton hoist crane, respectively. Additional areas have been provided in the
layout for heat treatment, jet blast and shipping yard.
8.   Hot Strip Mill Plant
The company was originally planning to increase the capacity of the
two existing 100 t/h reheat furnaces and to install one additional 100 t/h roh-eat
i' rnrace. After discussions with M*cKee, the Company has decided to install a new
200 t/h furnace instead of replacing the old furnaces and installing a new 100
th furnace. However, this change does not warrant any revisions in the capital
cost estimates.
Slab sizes will be 105 x 1,400 x 5,8oo mm.  The reduction in thickness
will result in a gain of about 6 sec in rolling time. A greater saving in roll-
ing tirrLe (plus 20 sec) could be accomplished by revamping the present scale
breaker to make it reversible and by replacing its 1,000 HP AC drive motor by



ANNEX 5
I ape t
one DC 2,000 HP unit designed to provide mill speeds in the range 71.8-143.6
mrmin. This, however, is not considered essential for Stage Il. The capital
cost estimates do not include this alter'Aion nor the replacement of the 3,500
HP No. 1 stand motor of the finishing train by a 4,500 HP motor.
The present hot strip mill runout table has a standard lengthi. Only
the volume oL cooling water will be increased.
A second hot rolled shear line will be installed for a capacity of 20,00!0
t/rnonth since the capacity of the existing line is regarded as of 10,000 t/month
due to the up-cut shear.  A Hallden type shear will be used in the new line.  A
hot rolled coil conveyor about 65-meter in length will be installed ir the presen,
plate finishing building.
One additional grinder will be provided in the roll shop.  Grinding time
for the finishing train work rolls is expected to be 66 min.,for the back-up
rolls 2)40 min.and the changing time 50 min. The existing hot rolled shear line
building will be extended 56 meters to provide for additional storage and ship-
ping areas. Two 35-ton cranes will be installed. One will serve the mill aisle
and the second one will operate in the hot rolled shear aisle.
9.   Cold Mill Plant
The mill has sufficient rolling capaci.y for Stage II. The existing
temper pass mill capacity is about 55,000 t/month. The tonnage to be processed
through this mill in Stage II (58,000 t/month) can be achieved by improvemen-l
of operational technique.
The additional equipment to be provided in the Cold Mill Plant for
Stage II is as follows:
(a) Four stack annealing furnaces with ten bases with external, cool-
ing, of the size purchased in the Stage I expansion.
(b)  Two additional cold rolled coil inspection lines, the second of
which will be a combination stretcher/leveller. One line will process material
0.305 - 3.38 mm thick x 510 - 1,575 mm wide and, the second unit 0.305 - 1.6
mm thick x 510 - 1,280 mm wide. Both lines will be prepared to handle coils up
to 24. tons in weight. One -welder will be installed in the cold stripmill.
(c)  No. 1 cold rolled shear line will be revamped to comprise two
pilers instead of one.
(d) One additional 35/5 ton crane will be installed in the new anneal-
ing aisle which is being built as part of Stage I.
10. Electric Power Receiving and Distribution System
The plant will consume an average of 371 KWh/t in Stage II. This repre-
sents an average demand of 9E,390 Kw.  The 88 Kv system within the plant wrll be



ANNEX -
Page 9
made into a double-loop system to afford the required reliability and flexibj iity.
The loop will embrace the oxygen plants, the power house, the existing rolling
mills and the new plate mill. The loop will not be extended to the raw materials
area due to the presence of dust and other elements that may harmper the conti-
nuous operation of the overhead lines.  The area will continue to be fed through
underground ducts.
The receiving station electrical arrangement will have to be modified
to include a substantial number of additional disconnecting switches.  The double
loop within the plant site will be wired with 410 mm  cables.
The existing 88/13.8 Kv substations at the powerhouse and air separation
plant will undergo the necessary changes to receive each one rnore 15/20/25  IVA
transformer and the necessary 88 Kv circuit breakers and disconnecting swi-tches.
The present rolling mill. substation will be revamped to receive two
additional transformers rated at 30 MVA each and, due to space limitationi, a
switching yard will be built on the north side to establish the connection with
the double-loop system and concurrently with the transformers at the substation.
A new 88 Kv switching yard and a new substation will be built for the
plate mill plant. It will comprise two 15/20/25 MVA - 18/13.8 Kv transformers
and the required disconnecting switches and circuit breakers.
Transformers rated at 5,000 KVA - 13.8/w.4 Kv (3 or 4 units) will be
installed in the raw material area substation and slabbing mill. One 3,750 KVA
13.8/2.4 Kv unit will be added to the existing switching station. Other miscella-
neous power transformers will be installed as required.
11. Power House and Utilities
A new 12,650 Kw turbo-generator will be installed in the powerhouse comi-
plete with boiler to burn the excess by-product gases that waill be generated by
the new facilities. This turbo-generator will be installed at the north end of
the existing building. The turbo-blower for the new No. 2 blast furnace wilI be
installed at the south end of the powerhouse by extending the building accordingly.
Two new 110 t/h - 43.5 atg - 440C boilers will be installed outdoors
at a site east of the powerhouse. The installation will require an area of aboul.
2,000 s;q.m.  One of the boilers will be kept as a standby unit to allow for main-
tenance and emergencies. The powerhouse boilers will burn all surplus tar pro-
duced at the by-products plant.
The existing steam distribution piping needs no alterations, but will
be extended by about 200 meters to the plate mill plant and a branch provided to
No. 2 B.F. and the coke oven batteries.
An energy center is to be built to centralize and supervise all flows
in the steai, gas and oil systems. One 20,000 m3 coke oven gas holder is to be
installed at the site where the present gas holders are located.



ANNEX L
Page 10
Approximately 1,000 m of blast furnace gas piping and some 1,200 m of
coke oven gas piping will be added to the existing gas distribution system.
12.   Water System
The present water distribution system will be modified so as to provide
for recirculation of uncontaminated water. Thus, no additions are required at
the existing pump houses Nos. 1 and 2.  However, the following expansion of the
water piping and sewer systems of the treated water facilities are contemplated
to provide for the recirculation of water:
(a)  Blast furnace plant, with emergency water being supplied by an
elevated tank provided with a diesel generator and pump.
(b) Coke plant (Nos. 1, 2 and 3 batteries and auxiliaries).
(c)  Coke plant (Nos. 4 and 5 batteries and auxiliaries).
(d) B.0.F. plant (treated water for the lance system).
(e) Existing rolling mills (except No.3 reheat furnace).
(f) Plate mill plant (including No. 3 reheat furnace), with emergency
water provided by an elevated tank, local 400 KVA diesel-generator unit and res-
pective pump.
(g) Powerhouse (only water used by No. 3 turbo-generator and No. 3
turbo-blower).
(h) Air separation plants (all three plants).
Expansion of the main water piping system will be mainly concentrated
in the extension to the rolling mills and plate mill plant. The sewer system
will be extended by about 2,500 m in the plate mill and coke plant area.
13.   Mobile Equipment and Rolling Stock
Additional mobile equipment and rolling stock comprised in Stage II in-
cludes:
11 - diesel electric locomotives (one for transportation of hot metal
from No. 2 B.F. to the B.O.F.; one for moving torpedo cars at
No. 2 B.F.; one for moving torpedo cars at the B.O.F.; two for
ingot cars; one for the transporation of ingot molds, rolls,

1.        Among the facilities to be added or modified under the 2.3 million ton
stage, the blast furnace, coke plant, B.O.F. shop and the hot scarfing machine
are the items that will mostly contribute to air and water pollution. The afore-
mentioned units will be provided with auxiliary equipment especially designed to
minimize pollution to a degree that will meet the requirements established in
present U.S. standards.
2.        Insofar as water pollution is concerned, the 2.3 million ton project
contemplates industrial water recirculation within each individual plant such
as the blast furnace, the coke plant, the steelmaking shop, the existing roll-
ing mills, the new plate mill, etc. In this way, the amount of water to be
drawn out of the river for plant industrial use will consist practically of make-
up water only. The water to be discharged into the river will consequently be
limited to a rather small flow. Notwithstanding this fact, contaminated water
will be treated prior to discharge. For instance, at the by-products plant
ammonia destructing equipment will be incorporated.
3.        In order to prevent or to minimize air pollution, the following is
anticipated:
At the blast furnace special exhausters and filters will be
installed at strategic points in the cast houses to collect dust-
carrying fumes generated during casting. A dust catcher will collect
most of the solids contained in the gas generated by the furnace. The
remaining will flow through the primary venturi and drained together
with water for transfer to the thickener where such flue dust will
be recovered.
The coke oven batteries will be provided with automatic
larry cars equipped with gas washing and ignition burning devices
to minimize environmental and air pollution by the gases liberated
when the ovens are being charged.
Stacks will be built high enough to meet the present regula-
tions.
At the B.O.F. shop, a second gas cleaning station will be
installed to collect all the gas generated in the LD vessels and
recover the flue dust for utilization at the sinter plants.
Gases generated by the blast furnaces and coke ovens, after
being properly treated will be used in other furnaces and in the
power house boilers.

*Negotiations with Polish and U.S. suppliers are in progress.
Coal Sources and Supply
Because domestic coking coal is of lower quality (high ash and
sulfur content) and higher cost than imported coal, COSIPA expects to
reduce the proportion of its domestic coal consumption from the 1971 level
of 38% to 20% from 1977 onwards. At the completion of the expansion the
projected coal-mix for coke production is assumed to average 80% imported
(60% high volatile and 20% low volatile) and 20% domestic Santa Catarina
coal. To protect its position with respect to foreign coal sources,
COSIPA is planning to enter into long-term contracts (8 years) with at
least two suppliers in the United States and Poland. Contract negotia-
tions are understood to have reached an advanced stage. In the meantime,
COSIPA is making year-to-year commitments for its foreign coal with the
IJnited States.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
Iron Ore Sources and Supply
On account of its location, COSIPA has the highest iron ore
cost of the three flat-product mills. COSIPA has been receiving iron
ore from different sources; of its 1971 ore purchases 44% came from CSN,
30% from Iltaminas, 15% from Itacolomi and 11% from MFM. Present ore
contracts are short-term, but in view of Brazil's abundant iron ore
resources, this will not cause the Company any difficulties in cover-
ing its future requirements.
The Company is making preparations to simplify its ore receiv-
ing facilities to accommodate larger deliveries. The modifications to
the raw materials handling facilities, which form part of the project,
are expected to reduce the cost of the blast furnace burden. The assump-
tions on which the cost calculations are based are considered achievable.
Limestone and Dolomite
Both these raw materials are obtained from the Company's sub-
sidiary, MFM. The limestone mines are located about 205 km and the
dolomite mines about 450 km from the COSIPA plant. The quarries are
being enlarged so that MFM will be able to provide the Company's increased
requirements.
Scrap
Scrap for use in the B.O.F. converters is obtained from the
rolling and finishing operations. The indicated need of about 600,000
tons at the completion of Stage II is equivalent to 26% of planned raw
steel production.

for dimensions and quality specifications.
2/   This includes handling and transportation costs to point of shipment as
well as port utilization taxes which are estimated to be US$4/ton. IPI
and ICM taxes are not applicable for exports.
NOTE:
IPI - Federal Excise Tax. This tax is, for all products except
hot coils, 5% of the price including ICM taxes; for hot coils it is only 4%.
ICM - State Sales Tax. According to the laws of the State of
Sao Paulo, the ICM has a value of 17% for the products sold in the State of
Sao Paulo and 15% for the ones sold outside the state. From these values ICM
paid on raw material and supplies can be deducted. The average ICM paid by
COSIPA is about 15.4% of the price without IPI and this has been used in the
projections.

ANNEX 19
Fage 2
Notes:
Prices used for economic return calculations are based on European
export prices that prevailed in February-August 1971 for the various products.
These prices have been analyzed in the context of historical trends, and on
average are expected to reflect representative prices over the long-term period
relevant for evaluation of this project. In fact, if Brazil had to import 3.5
million TPT of steel products in the context of the existing volume of world
trade (under 50 million TPI) there would probably be some upward pressure on
prices of several products.
The cost of transport from the ualn BEropean ports to Sao Paulo, the
principal market for steel, has been calculated on the basis of actual costs
incurred in recent years on imports of up to 300,000 TPY, with benefit of special
contract rates for bulk shipments. While it is possible that much larger ship-
ments could be movd at somewhat leas cost, there is also the likelihood of
higher costs on account of port congestion and the need for additional handling
facilities, etc.
Altogether, import prices (CIF) assumed for the calculations appear
to be a fair average of costs that would have to be incurred for imports during
the period of time under consideration.
For exports, the economic return calculation assumes February 1971
Brazilian prices (FOB Brazilian Ports). These are generally lower than the
prices actually obtained for Brazilian steel exports in the recent past. Price
calculations include adjustment for freight from the steel mills at Oubatao  to
Sao Paulo in each case.
