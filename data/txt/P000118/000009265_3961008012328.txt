MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN FOR A
HEALTH AND POPULATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Benin for SDR 17.9 million (US$27.8 million equivalent), on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. This credit would help finance a project for
assisting the Government to improve the health and well-being of Benin's population with special
emphasis on its vulnerable segments (women, children and the poor). It will do so through the
support of national sector policy and strategic objectives. The Government and beneficiaries will
contribute US$5.6 million equivalent.
2.     Country Economic Background. Benin is a country of more than five million people
with a total GDP of about US$1.5 billion (1994). Its economy is highly open and strongly
dependent on primary and tertiary activities. The primary sector, which accounts for 33 percent of
total GDP, provides the country's largest export commodity: cotton. A large tertiary sector
dominated by commerce accounts for 53 percent of the country's GDP, and its dynamic re-export
activities provide about 45 percent of the country's total export revenues. In contrast, the country
has a small secondary sector which barely accounts for about 14 percent of GDP. A new
Constitution was approved by referendum in December 1990 and multi-party legislative and
presidential elections were held in February/March 1991. The President, Mr. Nicephore Soglo, a
former Bank Executive Director, was elected with an overwhelming majority of the votes and took
office on April 4, 1991. Legislative elections took place on March 28, 1995, and presidential
elections are scheduled for March 28, 1996.
3.    After nearly two decades of state-led development, Benin embarked, in 1989, on an
ambitious economic reform program, supported by an IDA SAL I, and by an IMF Structural
Adjustment Facility (SAF), approved in May and June 1989, respectively. A second phase of this
program adopted by the newly elected Government in 1991, was supported by an IDA SAL II and
an IMF three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). Together with its partners in
the CFAF zone, Benin decided to modify the parity of the CFA franc from CFAF50 to CFAF100
to the French franc in January 1994. By increasing Benin's external competitiveness this measure
helped strengthen the ongoing adjustment program, the results of which had been encouraging
during 1990-93. A proposed third SAL will support measures to strengthen the supply response to
the devaluation and consolidate reforms initiated under previous operations. The third annual
arrangement of the IMF three-year ESAF is expected to be approved in May 1995.
4.      Benin's medium-and long-term economic prospects have improved.  Although GDP
increased by 4.3 percent in 1992 and 1993, several major constraints to development remain to be
addressed, including a high fertility rate of 7.1, a still heavy and ineffective public sector, a strong
dependence on cotton, an inadequate administrative and human resource capacity, and limited
employment opportunities in the private sector.
5.     The Bank's country assistance strategy aims to promote a private sector supply response
and to strengthen the market orientation of the economy by supporting policy measures which are
critical for the country's long-term prospects: public finance management, human resource
development, and the public sector's administrative capacity to implement the reforms.



2
6.     Sector Background. The rehabilitation and reform of social service delivery is a key area
of concern in Benin's adjustment program and in the Government's overall development strategy as
stated in the Policy Framework Paper distributed to the Executive Directors on March 14, 1994.
7.     Benin's population growth rate of 3.2 percent will result in a doubling of its current 5.1
million population size in less than 25 years. A persistently high fertility rate will burden the labor
force with an increasingly large proportion of young persons needing education, health care,
nutrition and other services, and will keep the country's propensity to save below a level needed for
generating adequate capital for economic growth. High fertility alongside low economic growth
will contribute to poor nutrition and health status which will, in turn, inhibit productivity and
exacerbate poverty. Contraceptive prevalence is well below 5 percent despite availability of
funding for family planning and safe motherhood activities under the first IDA funded health
project. Both the recent Cairo conference and the sector dialogue have encouraged the Government
to acknowledge and address population issues and it proposes in its PFP to adopt a population
policy by November 1995.
8.     Despite recent improvements in health care reflected in higher immunization rates and
increased attendance at health facilities, morbidity and mortality rates are still very high. The
prevalence of tropical communicable and parasitic diseases as well as poor nutrition remain the
major causes of morbidity and mortality. Efforts initiated since 1989 with IDA and other donor
funding have been limited by inefficient organization and resistance to reforms that would improve
management within the Ministry of Health (MOH). The causes of morbidity and mortality are
dominated by malaria, acute respiratory tract infections, diarrhea and water bome diseases, which
could be drastically reduced if the MOH improved its management capacity. Rising HIfV infection
rates and AIDS cases are matters of public concern. The crude death rate and infant mortality
rates are 16.1 and 80 per thousand, respectively, and the maternal mortality rate (800 per 100,000
live births) is high even by African standards. Between 20 and 40 percent of children under five
are malnourished and three to six percent are severely malnourished.
9.     Reforms initiated since 1989 with the support of IDA (Health Services Development
Project, Credit 2031-BEN, cofinanced with the Swiss) and other donors have begun to tackle basic
curative and preventive health care needs of the population. Essential generic drugs and basic
supplies are now available on a regular basis in all health facilities and a cost recovery program
initiated under the first IDA-financed project currently guarantees replenishment of such supplies.
A major facility rehabilitation program is underway and new management tools have been
developed in an effort to inprove sector performance. Current budgetary constraints have limnited
the proportion of the Government recurrent budget allocated to health. However, donor funding
and community financing through cost recovery and investments have compensated for the low
level of public resources for health. Over-dependence on extemal funding in the sector poses a
problem for future sustainability. The shift of financial responsibility to beneficiaries through cost
recovery has become relatively substantial amounting to over 1.5 billion CFA in 1993. The
Govenmment with Bank assistance is continuing efforts to improve donor coordination and to
articulate a clear health financing policy.
10.   At the recent Health Sector Round Table (January 12-13, 1995), the Govenmment and its
partners discussed and debated a draft sector strategy for the period 1995-99. The new strategy
places great emphasis on consolidating and building on notable achievements of the previous
strategy (1989-1993), most particularly: (a) the reorganization of the MOH; (b) the extension
nationwide of cost recovery and the creation of health management committees (COGES/COGEC);
(c) the establishment of the Centrale d'Achat, which assures affordability and availability of
essential generic drugs; and (d) the establishment of mechanisms for fuller participation in the
planning, coordination and evaluation of sector activity (CNEEP/CDEEP). In addition, the new



3
sector strategy proposes to reform sector organization with a view to achieving improvements in
the quality, access and efficiency of services. It is the intention of the MOH that this strategy
would provide the basis for eliciting and coordinating the contributions of all donors active in the
sector.
11.    Project Objectives. This project will assist the Government to improve the health and
well-being of its people, particularly the most vulnerable groups: women, children, and the poor.
First, in support of Benin's population policy (expected to be approved by the Council of
Ministers before end-November 1995), the project will assist in the development of the nascent
family planning program. Second, it will support the implementation of the main reforms
included in the national health sector strategy for 1995-1999: (a) the decentralization and
strengthening of sector management and administration; (b) the reformulation of the referral
system and strengthening of its technical support capacity; and (c) expansion of the participation
of major stakeholders, including beneficiaries, in the planning, implementation and evaluation of
national health policy and strategy.
12.    Project Description.  The project's support to the implementation of national sector
policy and strategy will be provided through four components. A breakdown of the costs and the
financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
(a) Development and Expansion of Family Planning Program and Services: To
ensure nationwide availability of quality services and information, this component will assist the
Goverrnment in disseminating and promoting its population policy and in establishing a viable,
nationwide family planning program. It will also support expansion of family planning (FP)
services and their integration into the minimum package of services at all levels of the public
health system.
(b) Improving the Quality and Efficiency of Priority Health Services: This component
will assist the Government in revitalizing and streamlining the referral system, with a particular
emphasis on upgrading and improving the quality of first referral services through the gradual
establishment of district hospitals (h6pitaux de zone), and on establishing norms and standards for
quality services at all levels of the system. To this end it will support upgrading of the health
infrastructure and focus on strengthening priority health programs and disease interventions.
(c) Strengthening and Streamlining Sector Management and Administration: This
component will support the decentralization of sector management and administration, which will
involve the gradual establishment of health districts (zones sanitaires), the strengthening and
expansion of departmental-level capacity, and the strengthening of key functions of the central
MOH. It will also support the development of key management capacities at all levels of the
system. In addition, it will improve pharmaceutical policy, legislation and regulation and fine-tune
systems and processes for ensuring the quality, affordability and timely replenishment of essential
generic drug stocks throughout the system.
(d) Strengthening of Partnerships for Health Under this component, existing
mechanisms and structures for intersectoral coordination and community participation will be
revitalized and strengthened, and integrated into an organizational framework for partnerships. It
will support the operations of these committees through which stakeholders will be more fully and
routinely involved in the planning, management and evaluation of sector activity at all levels of the
health system.
13.    Project Implementation. Responsibility for project implementation will rest with the
operational units of MOH--both  central and decentralized--as part of their functions.
Furthermore, in light of the new reorganization of the MOH, the upcoming mid-term review of the



4
first project will also seek ways to integrate the work and staff of the project coordination unit
more fully into the relevant directoraies and decentralized levels of administration. A project
coordinator, working out of the MOH's Direction de la Planification, de la Coordination et de
I'Evaluation (DPCE), will coordinate programming and supervision activities, including works
scheduling, budgeting and procurement requests. Funds from the Japanese Grant have been
budgeted for the training of accountants, procurement specialists and other project
implementation staff.
14.    Project Sustainability. Recurrent costs generated by the project include the salaries of
contractual staff who would fill key management and service delivery positions at decentralized
levels of the health system. The most efficient performers among them would eventually be
absorbed into the civil service, as Government allocations to the sector increase. At the project's
end, their combined annual salaries would amount to the equivalent of US$0.77 million or about
16 percent of the approved 1995 MOH salary budget. These costs are sustainable in light of
Government's commitment to increase resource allocations to health, reflected in the PFP, in the
SAL III and in the Government's Letter of Sector Development Strategy. Already successful
cost recovery activities initiated under the ongoing project will ensure adequate coverage of
drugs and other non salary operating costs in health facilities. The participatory process used in
the design and development of this project, and project components to strengthen
decentralization and participation will ensure local ownership and continued stakeholder
involvement in project implementation.
15.    Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement.  While only about 50 percent
disbursed and with a closing date scheduled for September 30, 1997, the first project has already
revealed important lessons. Its key contribution was to establish the linkages between the supply of
low-cost essential drugs, the introduction of cost recovery measures to ensure their replenishment,
and the creation of management committees to manage funds generated by the health centers. The
second project will strengthen existing partnerships at the local, departmental, and central levels,
which should provide countervailing pressure against the continuing urge to centralize decision-
making. Experience under the first project has also shown that structures with sufficient control
over the generation and use of resources (such as COGES/COGEC) are much more likely to be
viable than those without the financial means to assure their operations (CNEEP/CDEEP). The
second project will consolidate and streamline mechanisms for cost sharing by: (a) defining specific
parameters for contributions by, respectively, the Government, donors and beneficiaries; and (b)
defining procedures and accounting systems for ensuring the timely release and management of
appropriated Government budgetary allocations and project funds from donor supported projects.
16.    Rationale for IDA  Involvement.  This project is consistent with IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Benin, whichi was discussed by the Board on June 7, 1994. Its
main objectives are to encourage and support the private sector supply response and to ensure
adequate provision of basic social services. The proposed health and population project will
enhance quality and coverage of health services and thus contribute to improving the quality of
life and well-being of Benin's population. The improved nutritional and health status of the
population is a condition sine qua non for sustainable development. Furthermore, the project
supports a number of objectives laid out in the CAS. It will contribute to strengthening public
sector capacity through: (a) improved management of public resources and delivery of public
services; (b) improved public investment programming; and (c) the reform of institutions. in
addition, the improved access and quality of family planning, health and nutrition services will
enhance women's opportunities to participate in economic activities. Finally, the project is
designed to complement donor interventions and to encourage donor coordination.



5
17.    Agreed Actions. The Government has: (a) submitted to IDA a signed Letter of Sector
Development Strategy; (b) completed the staffing of key positions in the three new central-level
departmnents (Planning, Coordination and Evaluation; Financing and Administration; and Family Health)
and in their corresponding services at the DDS level; and (c) presented to IDA a signed administrative
text amending the bylaws of COGES and COGEC (Arrete No. 0390 of February 14, 1995). During
negotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) submit to IDA not later than April 30 of each year for its
review and comments: (i) the updated three-year rolling development plan for its health sector for the
succeeding years and a report on the execution of the sector's recurrent budget for the past year; and (ii)
its salary and non-salary recurrent budget allocations to the health sector for the following year; (b)
submit to IDA and to other donors, at least four weeks prior to the Annual Review of project
performance (to occur no later than April 30 of each year), an annual sector perfomiance report, to be
prepared by CNEEP, on the progress made in the implementation of the Project and the national sector
strategy. T his report would cover, among other things: (i) improvements in the quality of health services
(particularly family planning, matemal and child health, immunization, STD/AIDS, and strengthening of
the patient referral system); (ii) progress in strengthening and decentralizing sector management and
administration; (iii) increase in participation in vaious health activities of the private and public sector
contributors to, and beneficiaries of, the health services; and (iv) in the years 1997 and 1999 an
assessment of the impact of services provided under the Project by the beneficiaries. And based on this
perfomiance report, submit to IDA not later than four weeks after each Annual Review, an action
program and budget, acceptable to IDA, for the further implementation of the Project, including, if
appropriate, consequential amendments to the Project Implementation Manual, and, thereafter,
implement such action program; (c) submit to IDA, by September 30, 1996, a time based action plan,
acceptable to IDA, for regulatory reform of the pharmaceutical subsector; (d) submit to IDA, by June
30, 1997, an estimate of costs of hospital care and the Government's proposal for contribution to these
costs by the beneficiaries; (e) prepare by December 31, 1996, draft texts, acceptable to IDA, establishing
medical treatment guidelines, norms, standards and protocols for its health facilities and adopt a
plan and timetable, satisfactory to IDA, for their application nationwide; (f) carry out jointly with
IDA not earlier than 34 months and not later than 38 months after the Effective Date a mid-term
review of the progress made in carrying out the Project; (g) submit to IDA quarterly reports on
management of cash and stocks, and annual audit reports on the Centrale dAchat accounts as a
means of monitoring the financial health of this entity; (h) deposit into the Project Account in each
year during the implementation of the Project, an amount or amounts equivalent to the following
aggregates: (i) CFAF 349 million for the second year after the Effective Date; (ii) CFAF 200
million for the third year after the Effective Date; (iii) CFAF 296 million for the fourth year after
the Effective Date; (iv) CFAF 237 million for the fifth year after the Effective Date, or other
amount or amounts as IDA may specify during the Annual Review and as being required for the
purposes of the Project; and (i) adopt by December 31, 1995, a budgeting and costing system,
acceptable to IDA, for all levels of the health system for the delivery of health services. As
conditions for credit effectiveness, the Government will: (a) open a Project Account and deposit an initial
arnount of CFAF 216 million; (b) submit to IDA a National Population Policy as adopted by the Council
of Ministers; (c) adopt a Project Implementation Manual satisfactory to IDA; (d) appoint consultants to
assist in the introduction of a decentralized accounting management and monitoring system for the
Project accounts and to provide related training; (e) amend Decree No. 90-236 and Arrete No. 688 of
February 27, 1989 in manner acceptable to IDA in order to, among other things, modify the composition
of the membership of the CNEEP and the CDEEP and to clarify their functions; and (f) adopt a legal
status for the Centrale d'Achat satisfactory to the Borrower and the IDA.
18.    Poverty Category.  The findings and recommendations of a participatory poverty
assessment carried out by the Bank in 1994 have been endorsed by the Government. An important
component of the Government's strategy to reduce poverty is to improve the access of the poor and
vulnerable to basic social services. In support of this strategy, the project will strengthen priority



6
programs aimed at the most vulnerable target groups (women and children) and it will improve
access in currently underserved areas.
19.    Environmental Aspects. The project is rated C for its negligible environmental impact.
The implementation of this project, however, will lead to the adoption by households and
communities of better sanitation practices. In the long term, reduction of fertility achieved through
the implementation of appropriate family planning services will reduce the burden on land and
contribute to enhancing its productivity.
20.    Program  Objective Categories. The project is consistent with the Bank's strategy on
poverty alleviation, public sector institution building and management of human resources
development. It is also consistent with Bank strategy to increase ownership of programs funded
through credits, consolidating progress achieved under the first Bank-funded health and population
project.
21.    Participatory Approach. Continuing the approach adopted under the first operation, the
design and development of this project were highly participatory. All operational missions were
carried out through a series of workshops, many of which occured outside of Cotonou, in which
departmental and health facility managers, service providers and community members actively
participated. These workshops also served as the vehicle for eliciting opinions of the various
stakeholders on the new draft health sector strategy (1995-99).
22.    Project Benefits. The main benefit of the project will be improved welfare for the general
population, especially women and children, resulting from greater spacing of births and improved health
and nutrition status. Time spent by women attending to patients in the household and on continuous
childbirth will be channeled into more productive endeavors. The general population will benefit as
fanily planning services are made available in all districts of the countiy. Improved curative and
preventive health services will motivate a growing number of Beninese to use the health services and
thereby reduce the high cost of medical complications. The institutional reforms carried out under the
project will enhance the Government's responsiveness to the basic family planning, health and nutrition
needs of the population and will lead to better resource use and greater equity in service delivery.
Greater involvement of beneficiaries in sector operations will strengthen the decentralization process,
lead to greater transparency and mobilize the population to prevent rather than cope with disease. The
project will contribute to building a solid human resource base for future development and will
progressively reduce the high dependency burden and lirmfited opportunities for women that result from
high fertility, morbidity and mortality.
23.    Risks. The main risk of the project is the potential inability of the Government to carry
out the comprehensive reforms included in the project. The extensive participatory strategy used
for preparing the project will mitigate any tendency by central level officials to stall sector reforms
or project activities. The coordination mechanisms and supervision arrangements will ensure full
stakeholder involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. Another risk
is that Government budgetary allocations may fall short of resources needed to implement the
project. Conditions to be met under the project include a restructuring of the current public budget
for health to encourage decentralization and increase absorptive capacity, and a gradual increase in
the health sector share of the total current budget over the life of the project. In addition, resources
generated through cost recovery and managed by communities constitute a guarantee that essential
drugs and critical non-wage operating expenses are protected. To ensure greater sustainability, the
project design envisages a decentralized implementation strategy in which the regions, rather than
the central MOH, are primarily responsible for execution of various project activities. Periodic
reviews and annual programming workshops at the level of the CNEEP will ensure that all regions
are respecting the implementation plans, standards and deadlines. A mid-term review and two



7
beneficiary assessments to be carried out in years two and four of the project will be used as a
monitoring mechanism to tackle any problems of implementation that are detected.
24.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Disbursements
The bulk of the portfolio has been put in place since Benin's move to a democratic
government and a market-oriented economy in 1991. Credit effectiveness and, for that
matter, project implementation of some operations have been delayed because of the
insistence of the newly elected Parliament, in which the Government only holds a small
majority, to review  in detail the related legal documents.   Moreover, project
implementation issues, such as poor administration of special accounts and non-
compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures have slowed down disbursements. A
country implementation review in June 1992 addressed these and other issues and agreed
upon specific corrective actions, such as carrying out an audit of the government debt
(CAA) management agency, restructuring of some projects and organization of a
disbursement seminar for project coordinators which took place in February 1993. In
September 1993, the Government agreed to improve management of special accounts,
formerly administered by the CAA. Special accounts are now opened and maintained in a
commercial bank, in line with the Bank's Loan Department's recommendations. A
Country Project Performance Review (CPPR) was conducted in November 1994. It
concluded with a series of recommendations to facilitate project implementation and
disbursement of funds including the harmonization of Government and cofinanciers
procedures for procurement, disbursement and taxation issues and the provision of clear
descriptions be included in project implementation manuals. In order to facilitate and
accelerate procurement steps, it was asked that the signature of procurement contracts be
delegated from ministers to cabinet directors, that project units be equipped with
electronic mail in order to speed up response time of non-objection requests, and that the
Bank's resident missions be available to provide advice and guidance on procurement
issues. It was suggested that problems concerning counterpart funds be examined. A
committee was established to follow up on the implementation of these and other
recommendations made at the review. The next CPPR, tentatively scheduled for October
1995, will follow up on these reforms.
