HASHElITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
JORDAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:                The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Beneficiary:             The Water Authority of Jordan (WA).
Amount:                  US$50.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                   15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:         Same as the Bank loan.  The WA will bear the foreign
exchange and the interest rate risks.
Project Description:    The project, which is part of the Government's high
priority program to improve the water supply and
sewerage services in Jordan, would include:  (i)
extension and rehabilitation of about 450 km of water
mains;  (ii) construction of one service reservoir and
two pumping stations;  (iii) construction and
extension of about 365 km of trunk and collection
sewers; (iv) construction of three and extension of
two sewage treatment works;  (v) supply of equipment
for works operation and maintenance and water sources
monitoring; and (vi) consultant services for
engineering, construction supertision and water supply
systems control.
The project would continue the institutional
development efforts started under previous Bank
loans. The main beneficiaries of the project would be
low and middle-income families. Since the WA is
reasonably well established, project preparation is at
an advanced stage and because previous experience in
project execution has been very good, no particular
risks are foreseen during project executiun or in
reaching the project objectives.

HASHEMT E KIWGDOM OF JORDAN
JORDAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
L SECTORAL CONTEXT
1.01     Jordan is a semi-desert country with a land area of about 91,000 sq.
km with the only access to the sea along a 25 km coastline in the south where
the seaport of Aqaba is located.  The most remarkable physical feature of the
country is the structural split of the Red Sea/Jordan Rift Valley which has
created a long narrow trough of land, running from Aqaba in the south to the
foot of Mount Rermon in Syria in the north. Much of the land in this trough,
which includes the Jordan Valley and Wadi Araba, is below sea level with the
water level in the Dead Sea at -392 m. To the east, the land rises steeply to
a plateau with an average altitude of about 800 m with peaks rising to over
1,500 m. This plateau constitutes the uplands of Jordan and is characterized
by a more temperate climate and relatively abundant rainfall. Further towards
the east, rainfall decreases rapidly and the land slopes gently to the Arabian
Desert.
1.02     Current population on thE. East Bank is estimated at 2.5 million, of
which some 70% is urban.t' About 902 of the population lives in the
northwest quadrant of the coun.ry. The net growth rate is about 42 per annum.
1.03     Administratively the East Bank of Jordan is divided into eight
governorates: Amman, Irbid, Balqa, Kerak, Ma'an, Mafraq, Zarqa and Tafila.
The governorates are further subdivided into districts, sub-districts and
nahias, the smallest units of regional administration. The total number of
nahias in the country is 44, encompassing about 1,017 population centers.
Water Resources
1.04     About 80f of Jordan's land area is desert.  Availability of water
depends largely on rainfall, ranging from moderate amounts (600 millimeters
per year) in the northern uplands to negligible amounts in the southern and
eastern deserts, over 85% of which is lost through evaporation. As the more
conveniently located sources of municipal and industrial water supplies have
become fully utilized, surface and groundwater in other areas, hitherto used
for agriculture, will have to be transported at high cost over long distances
Urban communities are defined to include all principal towns of each
governorate, district, sub-district and the urban population as
computed corresponds roughly to the population in towns with 10,000 or
more people.

and/or steep gradients1' to meet these needs. The rapid growth of the
economy in recent years and the associated increase in municipal, industrial
and agricultural water demands, coupled with Jordan's high rate of population
increase, have put serious pressure on the country's limited water resources;
and water scarcity may become a principal constraint to economic growth. In
these circumstances, it is crucial for Jordan to realize the maximum benefits
from its limited resources by the continued development and implementation of
a sound sector strategy and through prudent water resource management.
Water Supply & Sewerage
1.05     About 87% of the total population is supplied through house
connections with remaining population being served hrough standposts, private
wells or tankers.   However, due to transmission and distribution system
inadequacies, the supplies in many areas are intermittent and over 302 of
water produced could be assumed to be lost through leakage (para. 3.02). With
intermittent suppl4's there is a danger that contaminated groundwater can
enter the system when depressurized, a risk which is particularly acute where
septic tanks and cesspits are used.
1.06     About 25b of the total population is connected to a piped sewerage
system while the remaining population is served by septic tanks, cesspools,
pit latrines and similar facilities. Despite significant efforts to provide
sewerage in recent years, rapid growth in urbanization, rising standards of
living and extensive but uncoordinated land development have caused individual
waste water disposal facilities to become inadequate, particularly in high
density areas and in soils with limited percolation capacity. Occasionally,
overflows or improper disposal of cesspool waste occur, creating major health
hazards. Severe outbreaks of cholera have occurred in Jordan, the latest in
1981. The infant mortality rate has declined in recent years but still
remains high (60 per 1000 live births in 1982 compared with 15 per 1000 live
births in the industrialized countries) as does the incidence of water-related
infectious diseases. This suggests the need for continuing efforts to improve
water supply and sanitation conditions in the country.
Government Strategy in the Sector
1.07     The scarcity of water and the high cost of its development have long
been recognized by the Government. Based on a number of studies over the
years, including the Bank Water Sector Study (Report No. 4699-JO) completed in
January 1984, available water resources are projected to be adequate to meet
municipal and industrial needs beyond the turn of the century with a modest
increase available for irrigation if the Government pursues appropriate
policies in the following areas: (i) proper allocation of known resources and
new resource development (which includes transfer of water from water surplus
to deficit areas, continuing exploratory work for ground water and further
I~'  Under the Deir Alla or the East Ghor Main Canal scheme for the Greater
Amman water supply, pumping is required to a height of 1,200 m (para.
3.01).

development of remaining surface water sources); (ii) prudent water resource
management by strengthening the sector's institutional capability; (iii)
quantity and quality control of water and wastewater; (iv) development of
policies related to reuse of waste water; (v) development of appropriate cost
recovery and other financial policies; and (vi) manpower planning and training.
1.08     Aided by sound Government policies, water conservation is generally
practiced throughout the country. The Government has made impressive strides
in developing the sector. It has embarked on a program of large water
projects to help relieve water shortages, particularly in the upland areas of
northwest Jordan. During the Five-Year Plan period (1981-85), almobt 16% of
public sector investments was allocated for water sources development and
supplies (including use for irrigation), which was abwt seven times the
corresponding actual investments in the previous plan period (1976-80) and
continued priority for the sector is expected in the next plan period
(1986-90). The Government has also adopted a policy for adequately treating
all sewage from industries and municipalities so that effluents may be
suitable for reuse in agriculture and with the assistance of the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), it has developed a data
management system for monitoring quantities and quality of water rescurces in
the country.
Istitutional Aspects
1.09     In the past, the water supply and sewerage sector was plagued with
problems of inadequate coordination due to the large number of institutions
involved. This often led to duplication of efforts and sub-optimal investment
decisions. As recommended in the Bank's Water Sector Study, an autonomous
agency, the Water Authority of Jordan (WA) was created in December 1983 to
assume the responsibilities for providing water supply and sewerage services,
water resource allocation, management and monitoring, planning and project
development for the whole of Jordan. This has set the institutional framework
necessary to better husband critically scarce water resources in order to
sustain economic growth.  The thrust of the WA's work will be to formulate
policies and take appropriate measures to augment the country's usable water
resources, to efficiently allocate these among the various competitive users,
and to ensure that th.e water allocated is used economically. The WA is being
reorganized in order to undertake its mandated role (para. 4.02).
1.10     In vies of the growth of the sector functions and activities the
demand for trained personnel has becQme an urgent matter. In the past there
was a number of different training programs but these were generally ad hoc,
unfecussed and suffered from a lack of coordination. With the assistance of
USAID, the WA is in the process of preparing a national training program
(para. 4.09) to satisfy both short- and long-term training needs.
1.11     Tariffs and charges for urban municipal water supply and sewerage
have generally been in line with the costs of these services. However,
ineffective control of groundwater extraction by industry and agriculture,
where tariffs or extraction fees have not been imposed or are below costs of



-4-
production, has contributed to the need for early development of distant water
sources at high costs. T-hese matters will be partially addressed in a tariff
study (para. 5.05) for municipal and industrial water uses to be completed by
end-1986, which would also develop the necessary financial strategies. The
subject of appropriate pricing of agricultural water will be part of the
Bank's continuous dialogue with the Government in establishing overall
development priorities.
IDA/Bank Role in the Sector
1.12     IDA commenced its assistance to the sector in the 1960s.  The FY62
Credit 18-JO for US$2.0 million and the FY64 Credit 43-JO for US$1.5 million
supported water supply development respectively in Amman and in the cities of
Ramallah-El Bira, Jerusalem, Nablus, Azraq, Irbid, and Zarqa. In the 1970s,
the Government concentrated its efforts on developing the water supply and
sewerage services of Amman, which also resulted in the creation of the former
Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA). The FY73 US$8.7 million Credit
385-JO and the FY78 US$14 million Credit 780-JO assisted in the development of
AWSA and helped finance investments for Amman's rapidly expanding needs for
additional water supply and sewerage facilities. These projects have been
successfully executed and completion reports for Credits 385-JO and 780-JO
have been prepared. The lessons learned from the above projects include the
need for better coordination in planning and execution and the particular
importance of reducing unaccounted-for water in a largely water deficit
situation. It was also noted that while substantial efforts had gone into the
institutional development of AWSA, weaknesses remained, particularly in its
financial department. These factors have been taken into account in the
design of later projects, and in the establishment of the WA.
1.13      In FY83. FY84 and FY85 the Bank provided further assistance through
(i) Loan 2213-JO of US$17.0 million for che improvement of the water supply
and sewerage services for the cities of Zarqa and Ruseifa; (ii) Loan 2425-JO
of US$30 million for the extension of water supply, sewerage and sewage
disposal facilities in the eight cities of Ramtha, Mafraq, Anjara, Ajloun, Ein
Janneh, Kufrinja, Madaba and Ma'an: and (iii) Loan 2483-JO for the extension
and improvement of the water supply and sewerage services with the inclusion
of sewage disposal facilities for the Greater Amman area. These projects are
presently under execution with significant progress being made and with
completion expected during 1987, well ahead of schedule.

1.14     The Bank's Water Sector Study (para. 1.07) made several
recommendations concerning the sector's organization and financial policies,
outlined a strategy to develop available water resources for meeting the needs
of competing users, established general recommendations for appropriate waste
water disposal, and formulated associated investment programs. Based on this,
the Bank's overall strategy in the sector includes assistance to the
Government in implementing policies to efficiently manage and allocate the
country's scarce water resources, executing technically sound and economically
feasible projects to increase usable water resources (inecluding effluent
reuse), strengthening the sector institution including training, and
establishing sound pricing policies to assure economic use and conservation of



water and to provide for adequate standards in works operation and maintenance.
1.15     The proposed project has been designed to support the Bank's overall
strategy. It would play an essential role in providing assistance and advice,
and in ensuring proper follow-up actions for (i) the development of water
resources management and conservation procedures; (ii) the development of
appropriate management and organizational systems for the WA; (iii) judicicus
selection and formulation of potential projects and related investment
strategies; and (iv) improvements in-operational areas such as financial
planning, accounting, auditing, manpower development and training.
U. POPULATION SECTOR SERVICE  -ND DEMAND IN PROJECT AREA
Project Area
2.01     The project area includes the population centers of the Greater Amman
and the Jerash areas and the town of Aqaba (Maps 1, 2 and 3). Amman, the
capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, has grown rapidly in the past two
decades, and has become a major metropolis surrounded by growing suburbs and
outlying communities. The economy of the Amman Region has, in recent years,
been characterized by a continuing shift in relative importance from the
agricultural sector to the industrial and service sectors. Most of the
industrial activities are concentrated in the Zarqa and Ruseifa areas.
2.02     Jerash located some 40 km north of Amman is a major tourist
attraction wi.h its archaeological sites from the Roman era, when it was an
important trade center. Aqaba located at the Red Sea is the only port in
Jordan with increasi.ng importance for the country's industrial development and
also for the transit of goods to Iraq.
Population Projections
2.03     Population projections1" for the Project Area are shown in Annex 1,
Table 1, and summarized below:
1985            1990            2000
Greater Amman Areal'      1,929,000        2,324,500      3,251,600

-' Including Zarqa/Ruseifa and Salt.
I/Source:  The Water Authority of Jordan.



-6-
The above total population represents about 75% of Jordan's population by
1990. Corresponding percentage of population directly benefitting from the
project would be about 101. Population projections for the different areas
take into account factors such as employment, land use and expected industrial
development.
Water Sources Development
2.04     The existing and future water supply systems in the northwest
quadrant of Jordan (para. 1.02) which rely on a number of ground and surface
water sources, are proposed to be fully integrated in the long term. Potable
water supply will continue to be primarily provided from ground water sources
while the surface water sources would be mainly allocated to irrigation. The
Deir Alla (surface water) and the Wadi Arab (ground water) schemes (Map 1) are
scheduled to be commissioned during 1986 to serve the Greater Amman and
Greater Irbid areas respectively.
2.05     Present and projected water demands in the northwest quadrant of
Jordan, shown below, are based on two levels of per capita consumption. The
lower estimate assumes no increase in the per capita water consumption (para.
2.14); the higher estimate assumes an increase in per capita consumption of
about 60X from 1985 to 2005. The lower estimate on which financial
projections have been based may at least during an intermediate period
represent future water demand because of high water costs. However, the
design of various work components is, where applicable, based on the higher
estimate to provide for a reasonable safety margin (para. 3.14). These
assumptions are satisfactory.

In case a riparian rights issue for the Maqarin dam can not be satisfactorily
resolved the development of the Euphrates water source has been considered as
a possible alternative to the Yarmouk river, although it would be far more
expensive.
2.07    An analysis of projected water demand and water availability indicates
that (i) existing water sources and those under development (total 126 MCM)
would be sufficient to 1990; and (ii) total water resources would be
sufficient beyond the planning period 2005.
-i-  This capacity may be increased to 30 MCM if groundwater pollution is
reduced and if effective blending with good quality water from other
sources is achieved.
2' The construction of the Maqarin dam would be subject to a satisfactory
resolution on the riparian rights issue.



- 8 -
2.08    Water sources to be developed in the intermediate future include
Mukheiba and/or Wadi Wala with the construction of the Rumeil dam. It may
then also be feasible to connect the Amman and Irbid areas with a water
transmission main (the "national carrier") in order to achieve the advantages
of an integrated water supply system. The WA is studying the alternative
means by which this could be achieved as well as the timing of construction
works which would depend on the increase in water demand in the future.
2.09    The extension and rehabilitation of the water transmission and
distribution systems, as proposed under the investment plan (para. 3.03) with
the additional water quantities to be made available through the commissioning
of the Deir Alla and Wadi Arab projects will significantly improve the water
supplies to the related areas.
2.10    The first priority would be extension and rehabilitation of the water
transmission and distribution systems in order to optimize the use of existing
water sources and to ensure continuous and reliable supplies. Concurrently,
preparatory works would be undertaken for subsequent water source development.
Sewerage and Sewage Disposal
2.11    Although significant efforts have been or are being made in the
construction and extension of sewerage and sewage disposal works, the needs
have not yet been satisfactorily covered. Master plans have been prepared for
the Greater Amman and Greater Irbid areas but project implementation has so
far been limited to the central parts leaving the fringe areas without proper
excreta disposal facilities. Studies have also been made for other major
urban centers and an inventory of required systems with a tentative
establishment of priorities have been carried out for all towns and villages
with a population exceeding 2,500.
2.12    It would neither be feasible nor economical to provide piped sewerage
and sewage disposal services to the whole population. Hence, the WA has
proposed and the Bank has agreed to basic criteria which are:
(i) extension of the sewerage systems in areas already provided with
sewage disposal works in order to obtain optimal utilization;
(ii) identification of areas where sewage effluent infiltration (through
soakpits) poses a direct threat to a groundwater source being used
for potable water supply;
(iii)  identification of areas where, because of impermeable soil
conditions, individual excreta disposal facilities require frequent
and costly pump outs, and are therefore not economical;
(iv) identification of areas with high population density and
significant growth potential; and
(v) provision of simple but adequate sewage treatment enabling effluent
reuse for irrigation purposes.



-9-
These criteria therefore form the basis on which sewerage sector development
priorities are established.
Population Senred and Standard of Services in Project Area
2.13     The percentage of population connected to the public water supply
system. (in 1985) in urban and rural areas are about 892 and 84% respectively.
The remainder of the population is served by standposts, water tankers and, to
a minor extent, by private wells.
2.14     Water consumption by those connected to the piped system averages 85
liters per capita per day (lcd). The unaccounted-for wateri' averages 45%
of water producea, which is comparatively high. With recently improved water
supply and distribution system pressu   the rate of leakage has increased.
However, it is expected to be reduced through ongoing rehabilitation or
replacement of older water mains (paras. 3.02, 3.17). The water supply is for
the time being sufficient. The water supply facilities are generally well
operated and maintained but still some 6% of water samples being taken are
bacteriologically unsatisfadtory.
2.15     The sewerage service levels by areas are shown in Annex 1, Table 1.
In Amman about 80% of the population is connected to the piped sewerage system
(in 1985) and, some 30% of the total urban population of Jordan is served.
The remaining population relies mainly on cesspool installations, whereby
effluent from the stored sewage percolates into the ground. There are five
existing municipal sewage disposal systems in operation: (i) the Ain Ghazal
Treatment Plant with a capacity of about 30,000 m3/day mainly serving the
Amman municipality; (ii) the recently commissioned stabilization ponds at
Schirbet es Samra with a capacity of about 70,000 m3/day mainly serving the
Amman, Zarqa and Ruseifa municipalities; and (iii) smaller treatment plants
of various capacities (Annex 3) serving the municipalities of Salt, Jerash and
Aqaba.
2.16     With the completion of ongoing projects (para. 3.01), the sewerage
service levels including sewage disposal are expected to cover about 552 of
total urban population by 1987.
2.17     Existing cesspool installations operate with varying degrees of
efficiency depending upon loadings, soil conditions and maintenance.
Maintenance costs primarily for emptying can be significant and in many
instances the effluent from neglected cesspools overflows or is pumped
illegally into the streets, creating a sanitary nuisance and a health hazard.
Unaccounted-for water is the difference between volume of water
produced and water billed divided by volume of water produced. It
includes inaccuracies in water metering, non-metered water used at
standposts, and leakages.



- 10 -
Demand for Services
2.18     Since water production facilities are presently adequate, efforts are
now being concentrated on the extension and improvement of water services with
the ultimate goal of serving the total population with satisfactory piped
water. In addition, existing distribution systems require continuous
maintenance and rehabilitation to reduce water losses, thus deferring the
development of new and costly water sources. Of equal priority is the need to
protect existing groundwater sources from sewage infiltration.
2.19     With the provision of adequate quantities of water there is an
increased need for improved waste water collection and disposal facilities,
particularly in higher population density areas. The construction and
extension of sewerage and sewage treatment works have thus been assigned
enhanced priority. Furthermore, the reuse of treated effluents has been
recognized by the Government as a means to provide a valuable contribution to
water conservation.
m. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01.    Major projects under execution and funding agencies are summarized as
follows:
(i)    Zarqa/Ruseifa Water Supply & Sewerage Project financed by the
World Bank, Kreditanstalt fur Wideraufbau (KfW), USAID and
Islamic Development Bank;
(ii)    Eight Cities Water Supply & Sewerage Project financed by the
World Bank and European Investment Bank;
(iii)    Greater Amman Water Supply & Sewerage Project financed by the
World Bank;
(iv)    Deir Alla Water Supply Project for the Greater Amman area
financed by USAID;
(v)    Wadi Arab groundwater source development for the Greater Irbid
area entirely financed by the Government;
(vi)    Two Cities Water Supply & Sewerage Project financed by USAID; and
(vii)    Extension of sewerage and sewage disposal systems in Irbid and
Aqaba.
All of the above projects are expected to be completed by no later than 1987.
3.02     The execution of all projects is progressing well with all major Bank
financed contracts already awarded. Actions are also being taken to reduce
unaccounted for water (para. 2.14) through improved metering, billing and leak



- 11 -
detection. WA staff members have recently been trained in leak detection at
the Thames Water Board (UK) which, as a follow-up action, will also provide a
short-term adviser. The WA placed an order in December 1985 for 40,000 water
meters, representing about 15Z of the total number presently in use. Orders
have also been placed for leak detection equipment. The WA aims to have a
satisfactory metering system by no later than 1988 and this combined with
actions being or to be taken on water main rehabilitation (para. 3.17) and
meter reading and billing (para. 4.11) should enable a reduction of
unaccounted for water to about 25S by 1990 (para. 3.30). This level of
unaccounted for water should be acceptable in the medium term for a system of
this age.
3.03     The WA has submitted to the Ministry of Planning (MOP) its investment
program for the 5-Year Plan 1986-90 which is simmnrized in Annex 1, Table 2.
Apart from ongoing works, the program includes:
(i)    water resource studies and investigations particularly relating
to management, monitoring and control, conservation and test
drilling in order to ascertain groundwater availability in deep
aquifers;
(ii)    development of additional water sources;
(iii)    extension and rehabilitation of water transmission and
distribution systems including additional storage capacity;
(iv)    extension of sewerage and sewage disposal facilities in the
Greater Amman and Irbid areas;
(v)    extension of sewerage systems in the Salt, Jerash and Aqaba
urban areas; and
(vi)    construction of sewerage and sewage disposal systems ir. smaller
urban areas.
The investment plan is well balanced and reflects as appropriate the sector
policies and objectives (para. 1.07).
3.04     Based on water demand projections and the criteria which have been
adopted (para. 2.12) to determine the need for piped sewerage systems, the
immediate priorities would relate to the studies, investigations and works
referred to under items 3.03 (i) to (v). For item 3.03 (iii) the WA has
reached a tentative agreement with KfW for financial assistance for related
works in Irbid and neighboring districts. For item 3.03 (iv) USAID is
expected to provide financial assistance for related works in the Greater
Irbid Area. The WA also intends, with USAID assistance, to centralize its
water supply monitoring through the installation of a telemetry and
telecontrol system. Finally, with other bilateral assistance, the WA will
undertake a comprehensive groundwater survey with deep borehole test
drilling. For a major portion of remaining works under the priority items the
Government has requefLed Bank financial assistance. Such assistance would
then enable the water supply and sewerage needs to be addressed on a country
wide basis.



- 12 -
3.05     A Master Plan, financed by USAID, for wastewater collection and
disposal for the Greater Amman Area, prepared by James M. Montgomery
Consulting Engineers and DMJM International (US consulting firms) was
completed in February 1982.  The Master Plan proposed a phased extension of
required works and subsequently the execution of the first phase was financed
under the Greater Amman Project (Loan 2483-JO).
3.06     A study of the "Primary and Secondary Cenveyance Systems for Domestic
Water Supply in the Amman, Balqa and Irbid Govern',rates," undertaken by
consultants-' was completed in April 1985. The study evaluates the overall
availability of water sources, their phased extensions and their allocations
between different users. It also analyzes, on a district basis, the needs for
the extension and strengthening of transmission and distribution systems and
of service reservoirs. A phased program was prepared for the execution of
those works to be covered under the 5-Year Plan.
3.07     Proposed works to be undertaken in Aqaba and Jerash are also based on
previously prepared master plans for the construction and extension of
sewerage and sewage disposal facilities.
Project ObIectives
3.08     The project objectives would be: (i) to assist the Government in
developing an optimal investment plan for the sector; (ii) to develop water
resources management and conservation and water systems operation procedures;
(iii) to improve and extend water distribution and sewage collection systems;
(iv) to augment present efforts to reduce unaccounted-for water; (v) to
reduce groundwater pollution by the collection and treatment of sewage; (vi)
to provide for recycling of treated effluents; and (vi) to assist in the
continued development of the WA.
3.09     The project would also contribute to an increase (from 1986 to 1990)
in the percentage of population served by piped water supplies from 89% to
close to 100% and by waterborne sewerage systems including sewage treatment
facilities from 32% to about 85% (urban areas only). Population to directly
benefit from the project is estimated at about 300,000.
3.10     The project would be consistant with the country objectives in water
resources management and conservation and would have a significant impact on
the living conditions and the health standard through improved excreta
disposal facilities and through reduced ground and surface water pollution.
'-' The study which covers the northwest quadrant of Jordan was prepared
by Watson Hawksley and Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners (UK) in
association with ArabtecL Consulting Engineers.



- 13 -
The project would also enable the .ecycling of treated effluents to be used
for agricultural purposes, particularly in the Jordan Valley.
Technological Aspects
3.11     The alternatives of extending a piped sewerage system or maintaining
individual on-site exereta disposal facilities have been evaluated based on
agreed upon criteria (para 2.12). In the project areas, the high density
population and the necessity to protect available groundwater sources justify
the construction of piped sewerage systems. For adjacent drainage zones
evaluations have been made between the provision of separate treatment works
or pumping collected sewage to one treatment site.
3.12     In order to safely recycle sewage effluents and to conserve scarce
water resources adequate sewage treatment would be required to minimize health
risks. Proposed effluent quality standards are: 30 mgli as a monthly average
for both BOD5 (Five-Day Biological Oxygen Demand) and SS (Suspended Solids)
with faecal coliform organisms as MPN (Most Probable Number) less than
1001100 ml in 80% of sampled. These proposed quality levels are
satisfactory. Sewage effluents from the treatment plants will be discharged
into river beds where they will either percolate into the groundwater or
finally collect in impoundments. In this process the water quality will
naturally further improve to the standard required for most types of
irrigation.
3.13     Evaluation of alternative treatment processes has shown that, where
sufficient space is available, stabilization ponds are the most economical
form of treatment; in other cases primary and secondary settling tanks
combined with oxidation ditches or rotating biological disks (RBD) have been
found to be feasible. Selected treatment methods for the different areas are
shown in Annex 3.
3.14     The basis for overall system design is as follows:  (i) the per
capita sewage flow, which has been assumed at 802 of the water consumption,
varies between 70 tu 105 liters per day depending on the area served; (ii)
the peak flow factor has been assumed at twice the average sewage flow; (iii)
the interceptors are designed for the projected flow by the year 2010; and
(iv) the treatment works will be extended in phases with the first phase to
cover the period up to the year 2000. W4here necessary new trunk sewers will
be provided with PVC or similar approved materials, to improve their
capacities and act as a corrosion protection. Sewer connections are being
included up to one meter from the property boundary lines. Thereafter they
are financed by the property owner served (para. 3.29).
3.15     Alternatives selected and various project components recommended for
implementation represent the most feasible least cost solutions at a discount
rate of 10X. The proposed phasing of the various project components and the
design criteria used are appropriate.

3.19     The cost estimates are mainly based on preliminary engineering design
for the various project components. The base costs are end-1985 price levels
and physical contingencies average 10%. The following price contingencies1'
for both civil works and equipment have been assumed: (i) for local
expenditures 5% for 1986 and 7T  thereafter; and (ii) for foreign expenditures
7.22 for 1986, 6.82 for 1987-88, 72 for 1989, 7.1% for 1990 and 4%
thereafter. The cost estimates do not include direct import duties and taxes
from which the WA is exempt.
3.20     The computation of the price contingencies is based on the
disbursement profile for Jordan (9/11/85) "Combined for all Loan Types
IX' These are for foreign expenditures according to the Bank "Guidelines
on Expected Price Increases and Interest Rates" of February 5, 1986
and for local expenditures according to "EMENA Recent and Projected
Rates of Inflation" (as of October 1985).

General." An alternative estimate based on a shorter project implementation
period (para. 3.27) would reduce the total costs to US$79.0 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$49.8 million.
3.21     The costs for the consultant services are estimated at about US$1.6
million which corresponds to about 350 and 25 man-months for local and foreign
consultants respectively.
3.22      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$64.0 million
equivalent (including interest during construction) or 66% of total costs.
This reflects assumptions made regarding goods to be imported, civil works
contracts to be awarded to foreign and local contractors and the average
foreign cost components of locally manufactured equipment.

3.24     The proposed Bank loan will be made to the Government, which
coordinates all foreign financing for public sector investments through the
MOP on standard terms for Jordan, i.e. for 15 years including 3 years grace.
The Government will on-lend the Bank loan to the WA on the same terms and
conditions under a separate subsidiary loan agreement. The WA will bear both
the foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Interest and other charges
during construction over the grace period will be added to the subsidiary
loan. The execution of the subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank
will be a condition of loan effectiveness.

Proiect Implementatiou
3.25     The present status of project preparation is summarized as follows:
(i) a consulting firm has been appointed for water distribution network
analysis and final engineering; (ii) final engineering is ongoing for the
construction and extension of sewerage and sewage disposal systems; and (iii)
final engineering including preparation of tender documents will be completed
for the bulk of the works by mid-1986. The consulting firms already
appointed, or to be appointed are all local firms with foreign association.
The procedures followed for the appointment of consultants are satisfactory
and consistent with the Bank guidelines.
3.26     For the implementation of the project the WA has established a
separate Project Management and Construction Supervision Unit (PMCSUJ which
has also been responsible for the preparation of the project. During project
implementation the PMCSU would be assisted by engineering consultants for (i)
project management; (ii) tender evaluation and preparation of contract
documents; (iii) finalization of detailed engineering and review of
contractors' drawings; and (iv) supervision of construction works and
equipment supply and installation. These consultant services will be provided
by the same consulting firms that have undertaken the engineering design. The
WA is in the process of acquiring land for the sites of the sewage treatment
works, which is expected to be completed by mid 1986. Based on past
experience in Jordan this should pose no problem.
3.27     The project implementation schedule is shown in Chart 1 and detailed
CPM networks for individual contracts will be prepared by respective
contractors. The assumed project implementation period, 1986-91, is based on
Jordan's disbursement profile (para. 3.20). However, based on experience from
ongoing projects and the status of project preparation, the bulk of the works
is expected to be executed during 1987-8P with completion in 1989 or 1990.
3.28     A project monitoring and reporting system including selected
financial performance indicators (Annex 1, Table 4) was discussed and agreed
upon during project appraisal. Agreement was reached at negotiations thiat the
WA should prepare quarterly progress reports to be sent to the Bank,
commencing from the second quarter of 1986.
3.29     The WA has sewer regulations which require properties to be connected
once the service has become available. This may pose some financial
difficulty for the lower income group but, based on previous experience from
the Amman area, less than 2% of the beneficiaries may need financial
assistance. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the WA will, if
needed, assist in making adequate financial arrangements to enable low income
families to be connected to the sewerage system.
3.30     The unaccolmted-for water remains hi gh despite efforts being made on
water meter replacements and distribution system rehabilitation. Proper
actions are being taken (para. 3.02) and the WA is expected to allocate
sufficient funds and manpower resources and to engage consultant assistance to
enable a reduction in unaccounted-for water on d country wide basis to a
target level of 252 by 1990. The consultant assistance which is to be
financed under the Project will also cover distribution system operation and



- 18 -
control and may be undertaken in the context ot a proposed "twinning
arrangement" with the Thames Water Board (U.K.) (para. 4.09). Progress to be
made in reducing unaccounted-for water will be monitored throughout project
impleLlentation.
3.31     During negotiations assurances were obtained from the WA that within
six months following the closing date of the loan it will prepare and submit
to the Bank a project completion report reviewing the planned objectives and
achievements of the project including costs and benefits derived and
performance and contribution of all parties associated with project execution
and system operation.

- 19 -
3.33     All equipment supply contracts and those civil works contracts
estimated to cost more than US$1.5 million will be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. Other civil works contracts with an aggregate cost n4it exceeding
US$8.0 million would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding
procedures, which are satisfactory. Based on previous experience these
contracts are too small in size and too scattered in locations to attract
foreign bidders. For equipment to be procured under ICB a domestic preference
of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower, will be used for the purposes
of bid evaluation. Documents and awards for all contracts under ICB
representing about 88% of project costs would be subject to prior review by
the Bank. Other contracts would be subject to selective post-award reviews.1t
is anticipated that local contractors will be awarded the bulk of the civil
works contracts, while local agencies or foreign suppliers may be awarded the
contracts for treatment plants and equipment which would represent about 20%
of total project costs.
Disbursement
3.34     Statistical data in the Bank shows that disbursements for the water
supply and sewerage sector in the EMENA region extend over a ten year period;
however, the disbursement period is 6.5 years for Jordan as an average for all
loan types. The Jordan disbursement profile has therefore been used for this
project, based on which the loan would be fully disbursed, including payments
of retention monies, by December 31, 1992. In order to expedite
disbursements, a Special Account of US$2.0 million (equivalent to an average
of four months disbursements) will be opened by the Government; this will be
replenished on the basis of standard documentation for eligible reimbursable
expenditures. All disbursements under the project would be made against
standard documentation except for contracts below US$5C),000 equivalent to be
claimed under Statements of Expenditures for which related documentation will
be retained for review by Bank missions and audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.14). A forecast of disbursements is shown in
Annex 1, Table 5.
3.35     The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million would be disbursed as follows:

3.36       The extension and improvement of the water supply and sewerage
systems in Jordan is a continuotis process and for contracts awarded according
to Bank procurement procedures, retroactive financing for expenditures
incurred after November 1, 1985 is recommended up to an amount of US$3.0
million equivalent, or 6b of the Bank loan.
IV. THE BENEFICIARY
Or,anization and Management
4.01       The WA, created in December 1983 under Law No. 34 of 1983, has been
assigned the responsibility for water resources management and for the
provision of water supply and sewerage services throughout Jordan. It is an
autonomous agency reporting to the Prime Minister's office, enjoying
independent financial and administrative status. It has a twelve-member Board
of Directors, of which ten are ex-officio and two are from the private
sector. The Board is chaired by the Prime Minister. Headquarters in Amman
are managed by a President and a Secretary General who deputizes for him.
Both positions are appointed by the Council of Ministers. The headquarters in
Amman perform the following major functions: Water Supply and Sewerage
Operations, Finance and Accounting, Administration, Water Resources
Management, Planning and Project Implementation. Operation and maintenance of
water supply and sewerage is carried out by three regional offices, each under
a manager, but supervised by related headquarters departments. The regional
offices are also subject to control by Water Councils composed of
representatives from the public and private sectors.
4.02       The WA has since its establishment taken over th! Amman Water and
Sewerage Authority (AWSA), the Water Supply Corporation (WS(), the water
resources branch of the Natural Resources Authority (NRA), the water
department of the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) and about 300 municipal wacer
supply operations. Because of various problems encountered in the taking over
of these sometimes disparate entities, the WA's organizational structure has
still to be consolidated and alternative solutions are being analysed. The
organizational structure as shown in Chart 2 has still to be considered as
tentative and will be subject to adjustments.
4.03       The number of the WA's staff engaged in water supply and sewerage
operations is about 3,000. This is equivalent to about 11.2 employees per one
thousand connections served which is reasonable given the fact that the WA's
responsibilities are spread over the whole country and that the population
density outside the Greater Amman area is low. Another 550 people, previously
belonging to the NRA, are engaged in well drilling activities.
4.04       Through the creation of the WA, staff from the different organi-
zations were brought together to work in consolidated units and a number of
previously overlapping functions have been eliminated. While this will
contribute to increased productivity, additional staff would still have to be
recruited to operate new systems being or to be built and by end-1990/91 when
this project is to be completed, the WA staff is projected to reach about
4,000.



- 21 -
Institutional Development
4.05     Institutional assistance is being provided to the WA by the Bank
under the Zarqa/Ruseifa Project (Loan 2213-JO) and by the USAID,!/ with whom
the Bank is cooperating closely. Related funds are being used to provide
management advisory services to assist the WA in developing its organizational
structure, staffing and training needs, and propose personnel policies.
Technical and financial advisors have also been engaged to assist the WA to
improve operating and maintenance practices, to set up a data collection
system for project planning purposes, and to prepare major projects.
ConsultantsZ- were appointed in January 1986 to undertake the design of
appropriate tariff structures with recommendations to be made on feasible
tariff levels, taking into account the need for water conservation. the
affordability to the poor, and the generation of adequate revenues to allow
the WA to remain financially viable. USAID is also assisting the WA in the
evaluation of the need for computerization of its various activities and would
subsequently finance the installation of computer facilities which is expected
to take place during 1986.
4.06     The period since the creation of the WA has essentially been one of
consolidation. Because of the urgent need to ensure satisfactory water
supplies and to provide adequate sewerage and sewage disposal facilities the
WA has heavily concentrated on the development of its project planning,
preparaticn and implementation capacity, and impressive strides have been made
regarding these activities. At the same time issues such as organizational
development, accounting and financial management information systems,
computerization, tariffs and training have been actively studied, but the
stage of their implementation has still to be ieached, which is however
expected to take place during 1986-87. During supervision of the proposed
project the Bank will continue past efforts and emphasize the institutional
development of the WA.
Stfing and Training
4.07     The WA's salary levels for its technical staff are competitive, and
attracting and retaining qualified technical staff do not pose a problem.
However, for financial staff the salary levels are substantially lower and
there is a general shortage of qualified accountants in Jordan. The issues
"i-  USAID's assistance is being provided through two projects for
improvement of water supply and sewerage services in the city of Irbid
and the cities of Zarqa and Ruseifa (cofinanced by the Bank), and
through the provision of technical assistance.
Z'  The consultant study was originally proposed to be financed under the
Bank Loan 2213-JO, but subsequently the WA decided to include it under
the USAID program.



- 22-
related to salary structure and other personnel policies will be addressed
under the management advisory services (para 4.05).
4.08     The WA has an ongoing training program financed largely by the
USAID. The program provides for training of managerial and professional staff
abroad and operating staff at local institutions. The financial advisor is
providing on-the-job training to the accounting staff in implementing a public
utility accounting system. Several facilities exist in Jordan-the Amman
Polytechnic Institute, the Vocational Training Corporation, the University of
Jordan and the Yarmouk University--which now provide training for technicians
in civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering. Programs have been
or are being developed for training in water supply and wastewater engineering
and specifically for sewage treatment plant operators, in view of the number
of plants to be commissioned in the near future.
4.09     The USAID has, based on a study of the overall training requirements
for the sector, prepared a proposal for a long term training program which is
satisfactory. Consultant proposals have been invited with award of cottract
expected by mid-1986. This has beer incorporated in USAID's "Water Systems
and Services Management Project" and sufficient funds have been provided for
its implementation. The Bank is cooperating closely with USAID in these
matters. In order to supplement the above training program as needed the
proposed project also includes a minor training component which was requested
by the WA particularly in view of a possible "twinning arrangement" that could
be established with the Thames Water Board (TWB), UK which inter alia would
entail WA's staff to be sent to TWB for training; the USAID only provides for
overseas training in USA.
Blling and Collection
4.10     The WA bills its large volume customers in its Amman operations on a
monthly basis and residential consumers quarterly. The consumers outside
Amman are on a two month billing cycle. The billing for Amman is fully
computerized and operated by the WA's staff, while that outside Amman is done
by a service bureau and some billing is done manually. The computer
facilities are being upgraded (para. 4.05) and by end-1987 all billing will be
computerized and done in-house.
4.11     The WA's accounts receivable represents a little less than four
months of sales and can be improved. A part of the problem is that a
substantial portion of the operations which the WA has taken over is spread
out over a large area and the existing systems of billing and collection is
less than satisfactory. The introduction of computers during 1986-87, as well
as different incentives that are being devised by the WA's management, are
expected to lead to substantial improvements in WA's billing and collection
efforts. Progress in reducing the proportion of outstanding receivaldes would
be monitored throughout project implementation.
Accountmg
4.12     The WA's accounting system for Amman follows the standard public



-23-
utility format, is on an accrual basis, and is reasonably well kept; that
outside Amman is on a cash basis, as prescribed for government agencies.
Although these accounts may be translated into the more generally used utility
format, they are not entirely satisfactory from an operating point of view.
The WA recognizes this weakness and has decided to extend the accrual system
to its entire operations. The system will be computerized and, through
appropriate coding, will produce accounts to satisfy both the
government-prescribed system and the public utility format with accruals.
4.13     The financial advisor (para. 4.05) has already prepared a manual of
accounts for implementation in early 1986. Meanwhile the accounting personnel
are being trained. Implementation will be monitored through periodic progress
reports.
Audit
4.14     The WA's Amman operations have been annually audited by a local
independent auditing firm. The audit reports have been of acceptable quality
and prepared in sufficient detail. The operations outside Amman have until
now been subject to a system of expenditure control and final audit by the
Government Auditing Department. Since the accounting system of all the WA's
operations was converted into a standard public utility format beginning in
1985, assurances were obtained from the WA under the Bank loan for the Greater
Amman Project that (i) from fiscal 1985 onwards all the WA's accounts would be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and experienced in
public utility accounting systems; and (ii) the audited financial statements
and the auditors report would be forwarded to the Bank within six months after
the end of each tiscal year. At negotiations it was agreed that these
conditions would be maintained. In addition, it was agreed that the auditors
will certify, for each fiscal year, the validity and accuracy of all
`isbursements from the Bank loan account under the Special Account and
Statement of Expenditures.
Insurance
4.15     The WA carries insurance with a Jordanian insurance company which
follows the general guidelines regarding insurance for a Government agency.
These primarily relate to workmen's compensation and third party liability for
vehicle and equipment operators. In view of the WA's expanding operations,
the adequacy of the insurance coverage would be reviewed periodically.
V. FINANCE
Past Performance and Present Position
5.01     The financial position of the WA reflects the nationwide scope of its
operations, the scarcity of water which makes it imperative to protect and to



- 24 -
treat sources, and where feasible, to recycle effluents, the low average
consumption levels, the locational mismatch between water sources and
consumption centers which necessitates the transportation of water over long
distances and steep gradients, and the relatively high construction costs.
The effect of these difficult circumstances is evidenced by the existing water
tariffs in Jordan which are the highest in the Middle East Region.1'
5.02     The WA derives most of its revenues from water and sewerage charges
ba3ed on metered water consumption. In addition, the WA also collects a
one-time sewerage connection fee equal to 25% of the annual rental value of
the property and a 4% annual tax on the same rental value for twenty years.
For small communities without a piped water supply the WA, for reasons of
equity and affordability, provides water to these areas by tankers at average
costs similar to piped water supply. For a substantial nomadic population the
WA supplies the water free from water points for which the actual cost per
cubic meter is up to ten times higher than in the larger population centers.
The Government assumes a portion of the costs associated with the tanker and
free water supply. During 1985 the WA took over a large number of water
supply systems spread out all over the country along with the personnel
employed in these operations. The resulting increase in its wage bill had a
temporary negative impact on its financial performance for the year. In the
past, however, the WA's net revenues have been sufficient to cover its
operating costs and debt service.
5.03     At the end of 1985 the WA had a current ratio of 2.2 and a
debt/equity ratio of 33/67 which reflects the significant role of the
Government in the financing of the WA's facilities.
Tariff-Cost Recovery
5.04     The WA's tariffs are proposed by its Board of Directors and subject
to approval by the Council of Ministers. Water tariffs in its Amman and
non-Amman urban operations are slightly different; Annex 2, Table 1 provides
detailed information on existing tariffs. Water tariffs in its piped supply
operations which average about JD 0.231 per cubic meter (US$0.62/m3) are
adequate and in line with the cost of these services, while the cost of
providing tanker supply and free water point service is partially supported by
the Government. Water tariffs will require substantial upward adjustments
mainly to offset the increased pumping costs of the Deir Alla Scheme (para.
1.04), which will come into operation in 1986, albeit initially for inter-
mittent operation to meet peak demands only.
5.05     Based on the current system of sewerage charges, the WA's average
revenue is about JD 0.296 per cubic meter (US$0.80/M3), which is financially
adequate. Such charges are generally less than the costs to maintain cesspool
installations. The proposed tariff study will include the determination of
appropriate sewerage charges for cost recovery and the means for collecting
them which may be either by continuing the present system of a combination of
tariffs, user charges and levies or by a sewerage surcharge based on water
t-'  Jordan US$0.62/m ; Tunisia US$0.31/m3; Syria US$0.25/r3; Morocco
US$0.16/m3; Egypt (Alexandria) US$0.10/m3.



-25-
consumption. The study, for which the terms of reference were prepared with
Bank assistance, will be carried out by consultants financed by USAID and the
results of the study are expected to be submitted to the Bank for review by no
later than December 1986, following which appropriate tariff structures and
water and sewerage charges will be implemented.

5.07     The WA's investments during the period would be substantial, so
that its fixed assets in 1992 will be three times as much as that in 1985
whereas the benefits would be derived over a long period. Funds
generated from internal sources and customer contributions would provide
about 25b of the overall funds required, all of which would be used for
debt service and provide small increases in working capital. The WA will
assume, starting in 1986, the liabilities associated with the substantial
capital expenditures on water resources development -which were undertaken
by the JVA (Deir Alla and Wadi Arab schemes). During 1986-91 the WA
would be making investments of about JD 315.2 million (US$851.1 million)
in addition to the investment under the proposed Bank project. Of this
additional investment, JD 144.9 million (US$391.2 million) or about 46
percent would be financed by loans, so that WA's debt:equity position



- 26 -
during the period would go from 33:67 to 43:57. Given the already high cost
of water and low average levels of consumption, increasing water tariffs by
any significant extent so as to enhance WA's self-financing capacity would be
difficult to justify from the standpoint of equity, conservation or
affordability. The Government would, therefore, continue to play a
substantial financing role in WA's expansion program. During negotiations it
was agreed that the Government will for the proposed project, provide to the
WA as an equity contribution all local funds and those foreign funds that are
not covered by the Bank loan.
Future Fioancial Performance
5.08     The financial forecasts for the WA as a whole and the assumptions on
which they are based appear in Annex 2, Tables 2-4, and Annex 4.
5.09     The period covered by the projections (1986-92) will be one of
institutional consolidation and rapid growth for the WA. It has recently
taken over the operating responsibilities for water supply systems in more
than 300 small town and rural communities. The number of water connections
will rise by a third and that of sewersge about three times the 1985 level.
By the year 1992 its volume of water sales is expected to be double that of
1985, and with the new sewage systems related volumes to be billed will be
almost five times as much. The volume of water supplied by tankers and at
water points will level off by 1990. The revenues from water sales would
increase about three times the present level and the revenues from sewerage
and the taxes collected for sewerage services increase by about six times. In
the same period operating expenses would rise about 2.5 times the present
level. The difference between revenues and expenses would leave a margin
which would be sufficient for the WA to meet its overall financial
objectives. Agreement was reached under the Bank loan for the Greater Amman
Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 2483-JO) that the WA will from fiscal
year 1985 onwards (i) for its metered water services maintain or adjust
tariffs to provide sufficient revenues to cover its operating and maintenance
expenses (excluding depreciation), debt service or depreciation whichever is
higher and increases in working capital and to finance commencing in fiscal
year 1987 not less than 5% and from fiscal year 1989 onwards not less than 10%
of the average annual investment cost in each consecutive three-year period
comprising one actual and two forecast years; and (ii) for its sewerage
operations, implement a system of user charges, fees and levies sufficient to
cover full operating and maintenance cost (excluding depreciation) and debt
service or depreciation whichever is higher. For its water services by
tankers and at water points, agreement was obtained from the Government that
it would compensate the WA for any deficits resulting from such operations.
Based on unaudited financial results for FY84 and the first three quarters of
FY85 the WA complied with the financial covenant in 1984 but fell short in
1985 mainly due to the large number of takeovers which occurred during the
year. The level of operational subsidies received by the WA for the operation
of its tanker services has been around JD 2.0 million per year.
5.10     The cast of water to consumers in Jordan is very high compared to
most other countries in the region (para. 5.01). Based on estimated sales for
1985 the average revenue collected for its metered water supply has been about



- 27 -
JD 0.231/m3 (US$0.62/m3).  On the basis of surveys conducted by the WA's
financial advisor it is believed that with improved metering WA's revenues
from metered water supply could increase anywhere from 30-50% which
underscores the need to improve operations which will certainly lead to
improved financial performance without substantial changes in tariff levels.
Under the circumstances until and unless improvements are made in metering,
increases in water tariffs would be difficult to justify and the authorities
are unlikely to grant any increases.
5.11     For sewerage, a complex system of charges which comprises a sewage
surtax on water sales and a fee based on property rental values, yields an
average tariff of about JD 0.296/m3 (US$0.80/m3).  Although the population
connected to the sewerage system at present is low (about 25%). this is
expected to increase rapidly in the coming years with the completion of about
a dozen new sewerage systems. The problem here lies in the fact that the
major part of the sewage charge derives from the tax based on property rental
values which have not kept pace with inflation in recent years and often bear
little resemblance to actual rental values. The rental values are being
revised but it will take several years before these translate into higher
revenues for sewerage.
5.12     A further aspect of the WA's financial operations is the status of
its accounting systems. Since creation of the WA in December 1983 it has
taken over the water supply and sewerage operations in large and medium size
cities and over 300 other systems in smaller towns and rural communities.
While the takeover process is almost complete, the accounting systems,
procedures and control outside Amman are poor due mainly to past practices and
the general scarcity of qualified accounting personnel in Jordan. The WA is
exerting significant efforts to remedy the situation by:
Mi)    establishing a new accrual accounting system with assistance
from its foreign Financial Advisor; this system is presently
being translated into Arabic and the training of accounting
personnel in its use will be carried out during 1986;
(ii)    using the services of a firm of chartered surveyors and
valuation experts (engaged in May 1985) for the valuation of all
assets being taken over by the WA; this task was completed in
December 1985; and
(iii)    asseseing, with the assistance of a USAID consulting team, WA's
overall computer needs, including training and maintenance with
primary and priority emphasis on its accounting requirements.
The consultant's recommendations have been submitted and the
procurement and delivery of the hardware and related technical
assistance (also from USAID grant funds) will continue
throughout 1986.
5.13     While all of the above efforts are substantial and comprehensive, it
will take anywhere from 4-5 years before any significant improvements in WA's
financial operations become apparent. In the absence of a cost accounting
system it is difficult to allocate operating costs in a meaningful way between
metered water supply, sewerage and water tanker services. A new financial
covenant was agreed tu at negotiations therefore, which will require the WA to



-28 -
meet all operating and maintenance costs (excluding depreciation), debt
service or depreciation whichever is higher, and adequate increases in working
capital from its water supply and sewerage charges. Under the new financial
discipline the former operating subsidies for water tanker service, which were
about equal to the expected contributions to investments, will be eliminated.
The new approach would also make setting of tariffs and the monitoring of its
financial operations much more simple and realistic. Investments after 1990
will consist largely of continuous extensions to water supply and sewerage
networks, with the exception of major water source development. However, the
latter investment will be lumpy, lasting only a few years, and would have
distorted the tariff setting formula under the old covenant.
5.14     Agreement was reached under the Bank loan for the Greater Amman
Project that the WA would provide the Bank, three months before the beginning
of each fiscal year, with copies of its forecast budget for the fiscal year,
financial projections for the following two years as well as its proposals for
any adjustments in tariffs. It was agreed at negotations to repeat these
conditions for the new loan.
5.15     In the period 1985-92, the WA's debt-equity ratio would be around
43:57 which although satisfactory also indicates that in spite of the
important role that the Government will play in sector financing a significant
portion of the capital expansion program would be debt financed. In the same
period its fixed assets in operation would double. Average water tariffs
would have to go up about 652 in this period, only slightly above the
adjustment necessary for inflation, which also confirms the financial adequacy
of the present water tariffs. Average charges for sewerage would not have to
grow as much because of savings from economies of scale. The projected water
supply and sewerage charges would be within the customers ability and
willingness to pay (paras. 6.05), and internal cash generation should cover
debt service.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Socio-Economic Analysis
6.01     The benefits accruing from a modern sewage collection and disposal
system would be substantial but cannot be meaningfully quantified. In
assessing these benefits the reduction of the incidence of waterborne
infectious diseases, prevention of the pollution of waters used for various
purposes, the improvements in the general aesthetic conditions and in the
quality of life, and the enhancement of opportunities for economic development
are all important factors. However, by using the revenues from sewerage as
proxy and a minimum measure of the benefits accruing from this project the
rate of return would be about 10% (Annex 2, Table 5).
6.02     Related socio-economic benefits to be derived from this project are
as follows: (i) improved water supply and extended sewage collection systems
would result in enhanced hygenic standard and subsequently have a favorable
impact on general health conditions; (ii) the reduction in cesspool effluents



-29-
percolating into the ground would enable the continued use of groundwater
sources for domestic water supply, thus avoiding its replacement by far more
costly alternatives; and (iii) the provision of treated effluents to be used
for irrigation purposes will contribute to agricultural development.
6.03     The project provides severage services to two major refugee camps
(Sukneh and Mokhayyan Souf) with a present population of about 25,000. The
proportion of the project that would benefit and that could be ascribed to the
urban poor-' is estimated at about 351 (or about 100,000) of population to
be served, and about 301 of project costs and related benefits regarding water
consumption and sewage disposal.
Average IncremenW  Costs
6.04     In Jordan the long-run average incremental cost (LRAIC) of water at a
discount rate of 10  varies between JD 0.370/m3 in areas where
water is locally available to JD 0.490/m3 for areas such as Amman, where
part of the water has to be pumped over long distances (e.g. fromu the Deir
Alla). At present more than 30% of water sold is charged at the highest block
tariff, vhich exceeds the LRAIC. This confirms the present appropriateness of
the tariff levels and a willingness to pay for the actual costs of the water.
AVfordabMity
6.05     The water tariffs and sewerage charges as projected would not impose
any serious burden on even the lowest income segment. The lowest quintile of
average monthly household income in the Amman area is estimated at about
JD 137. Assuming an average household size of six persons and an average per
capita water consumption of 65 liters/day, the average water and sewerage bill
would be about JD 5.20/month, which represents about 3.8% of the household
income. This is considered to be affordable.
institution Building
6.06     Significant investments have been and are scheduled to be made in the
sector and by the end of the ongoirg 5-Year Plan (1986-90) the whole country
would be provided with satisfactory water supply and sewerage or excreta
disposal services. Consequently the quantum of operational and maintenance
functions and related costs will increase considerably, which also will
increase the need for institutional and financial efficiency. A solid
foundation has been laid for the development of the WA into a well-functioning
entity but still significant efforts will be needed before it can serve the
I' The urban poverty threshold is defined as the 30% of the population
with the lowest income. The 35% would relate to the inclusion of the
refugee camps with an unproportionately high percentage of urban poor.



- 30 -
sector objectives in a comprehensive manner. The proposed project will
provide a continuing and most valuable opportunity for the Bank to assist the
WA in its ongoing institutional development.
Project Risks
6.07     A project risk, if any, may relate to the possibility of not
achieving projected number of sewer connections that could affect the WA's
income and overall financial viability. Until now, however, the population
has indicated a willingness to connect to the sewerage system when it becomes
available, primarily because it provides cost savings as well as being
convenient. It is expected that this trend will continue. Furthermore, it is
expected that the tariff study would recommend a tariff structure which would
make sewerage services more affordable to the lower income group while at the
same time ensuring the financial viability of the WA.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreement having been reached on the issues referred to in chapters
'III through V of this report and subject to the condition of effectiveness set
forth in para. 3.24 the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$50.0 million to the WA for a term of 15 years including a three year grace
period, at the standard variable interest rate.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
JORDAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Assumptions Used In Financial Projections
General
Detailed income statements for the separate water supply systems
which comprises the overall WA operations were prepared by the Borrower.
For the report, only the consolidated income statement, cash flow
statement and the balance sheet have been presented.
Income Statement
Revenues from water and sewage tariffs are assumed to be
increased to meet, over the projection period, the proposed revised
financial covenants, i.e., water tariffs and charges for sewerage would
be established so as to cover operating expenses, debt service or
depreciation, whichever is higher and working capital increases. No
further subsidies are expected for the water supply by tankers and at
water points.
All operating expenses are adjusted for a 6% annual inflation.
Salaries and wages are based on prevailing WA's salaries and wages
scales. Adjustments have been made in the number of staff because of the
future increases in WA's activities and salaries were adjusted to allow
for general salary adjustments and for inflation. Improvements in
productivity - due to better coordination and elimination of certain
overlapping functions - have also been assumed. The quantity of energy
and chemical was projected on the basis of operating requirements. The
energy costs are expected to go up dramatically in 1986 with the
,nauguration of the Deir Alla and Wadi Arab systems, although initially
both systems will be primarily used to meet peak demands. The effect of
this huge increase on operating cost would also affect the average tariff
needed to meet the financial discipline in the initial years. With
increased water sales average water tariffs will level off.
Maintenance was estimated to average about 1% of fixed assets
values relating to the water activities and .5% of fixed assets values
for sewerage. General and administrative expenses were projected in line
with the expanded activities. Assets were depreciated on a straight-line
basis which averages at 3% of fixed assets for water works and at 2.5%
for sewerage works.

Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet
The Government's contributions consist of contributions to W4A's
investment program which are included in the five year plan (1986-19)0),
for the construction of water works and sewerage to be operated by the WA
as well as the contributions made for the construction of the Deir Alla
and Wadi Arab projects (constructed by JVA). Customer's contributions
include the amount collected in line with current regulations which
provides for certain payments at the time of connecting to sewerage. In
addition, some minor contributions referred to in WA's regulation as
application fees are included hereunder. Accounts payable include two
months of consumable operating materials. Inventories are assumed to be
eight months of the value of supplies of materials, chemicals and fuel
which is felt to be necessary for the present due to the dispersed nature
of WA operations. They are assumed to decline to about six months over
the projection period. Accounts receivables are at present a little less
than four months of sales but are projected to decline to about two and
half months.
The on-lent proceeds of the Bank loan are assumed to carry an
interest rate of 9X p.a., a commitment charge of 0.752 on the undisbursed
balance, and would be repayable over 12 years after an initial grace
period of three years. Other loans made to the WA by KfW and USAID are
assumed to be repaid over 20 years after an initial ten- year grace
period and to carry an interest rate of 5% per annum. A loan from the
Islamic Bank is projected to be for 15 years including 5 years of grace
and bears interest at 3% p.a.
Interest during construction will be capitalized and transferred
to fixed assets in operation at the time of commissioning. During the
construction period, interest payments to the various lenders will be
made by the Government and added to the on-lent proceeds of the various
loans.
