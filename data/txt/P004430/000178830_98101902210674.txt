REPORT AND RECOM{ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EZECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND PORTS PROJECT
1.   I submit the following report and recommnendation on a proposed loan
to the Repuablic of the Philippines for the equivalent of US $6.1 million.
Tne loan would be for a term of 25 years including a four-year grace period
with interest at 7.25 percent per annum and would help finance a project
for the improvement of two ports on the island of Mindanao.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.   A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
Philippines" (78-PH dated April 20, 1973) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85).      Since the previous economic report
in May 1972, the Philippines has suffered one of the worst floods of the
century in the Central Luzon area, President Marcos has imposed martial
law, and a new constitution, establishing a parliamentary system of
government, has been promulgated.   The President has announced that
martial law will continue under the new constitution and that elections
for a national assembly will be postponed for six or seven years.    The
President is undertaking social and economic reforms and has announced
that implementation of an agrarian reform program is a high priority in
the Philippine development program for the immediate future.    This would
involve transferring title to abouit a million tenants in rice and corn
areas over the next five years as well as improving supporting services
for them.   In addition to decrees on agrarian reform, the President has
promulgated decrees on tax reform and on a number of bills which had been
awaiting Congressional approval, including the customs and tariff bill
and the government reorganization bill.
3.   In the past three years the authorities have pursued policies of
monetary and fiscal restraint and have succeeded in improving substantially
the maturity structure of the external public debt.    In spite of this,
until recently the performance of the Philippine economy had been somewhat
disappointing, with real GNP increasing by about 5 percent a year.
Expansion of the economy has been hampered by a combination of factors.
First, a series of disruptions to agricultural output since 1970 that was
capped by the severe floods in July 1972, has seriously retarded the growth
of food production, in particular rice.    Second, there was a 30 percent
deterioration in the external terms of trade during 1971 arid 1972.
Because of this decline, real gross national income per capita has remained
unchanged at about $200 during the last two years.    Third, the economy
has experienced a period of rapid inflation with consumer prices rising by
more than 50 percent during the three years 1970-72 due to the combined
effects of devalua-tion, imported inflation and shortfalls in domestic food
production.   These adverse trends have been especially serious for tne

7.     Substantial additional taxation will be needed to finance the
proposed public investment program.   The tax reforms introduced since
martial law have resulted in a substantial increase in revenue collections.
But if the Government is to undertake its ambitious development program
successfully, real revenues would have to expand by about 8 percent a
year during 1974-77, which in turn means that the Government's fiscal
effort will have to be intensified further.
8.     If the sectoral growth indicated evolves as planned, incomes,
employment and the balance of payments should all improve.    In the first
half of 1973 there have been some unexpectedly favorable developments in
the Philippine's export earnings which suggest that the b'aarlce of
payments both this year and next will be more comfortable than the
economic report suggests.   However, for the period 1973-77 as a whole,
merchandise exports are still projected to increase by about rC percent.
Provided rice imports can be reduced after FY 1973/74 and imports of
other consumer goods kept at about current levels, imports of raw materials,
intermediate goods and capital goods could be allowed to rise at a rate
sufficient to provide for a 6 - 8 percent growth in GNP, without the
balance of payments deteriorating.
9.     The economic report projects that the foreign capital inflow
would need to be almost $3 billion during 1973-77.    Of this about $2 billion
would be provided by transfers, direct investment and private medium and
long-term loans.   The remaining $1 billion would have to come from official
development loans.      During the period, total disbursements of project
assistance could amount to $550 million.    The balance of about $450 million
would be needed in the form of quick disbursing commodity assistance.
The recent and unexpected improvement in export earnings, if sustained
through 1974, however, would reduce this required level of commodity
assistance and allow it to be phased out faster than the report's estimate.
This matter was discussed at the meeting of the Philippine Consultative
Group in late May and it was agreed that the improvement in export earnings,
if sustained, could be used to increase reserves, reduce the debt burden
to more tolerable levels and support an appropriate level of imports for
development purposes.   It was accepted that some official commodity
aid would still be needed.   The members of the Consultative Group
welcomed the economic and social reforms which had been announced in
recent months and were particularly encouraged by the success of the
program to raise Government revenues.    In addition to continuing their
commodity aid, members also indicated rising levels of commitments for
development projects to support the Philippines' increased development
program.
10.     Provided that adequate levels of official aid for commodity
imports and project assistance are forthcoming, and particularly if the
recent improvement in export prices is maintained, management of the
Philippines' external debt and debt servicing, while difLicualt, would
not present serious problems.    The debt service rati-o on public and
private debt would improve from about 28 percent in 1971 to about 22
percent by 1977.   Even with the anticipated official assistance program,



total service paymients 'mould exceed the inflow of reditu' -   and  on'g-terxn
oan co.pital during1973--?77.  -hus even with the proposed levels of
foreig-n assistance there  rill be virtually no net transfer of resources
to tlhe  hi incites in the next five years.   Hoowever, a more tolerable
debt- service ratio cormbi4ned with a somewhat better international reserve
posit,ion, gives t-he Philippines more room for maneuver.
11.    T'he Phili.ppines  development progr-a  will continue to require
resources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available
for finnancing -tle imDort component of development projects.  Part of
these resources will be prov-1ded from coimmodity assis-tance.  in addition
some financing of local currency expenditures   ill be justified especially
.Lor projects of economic and social importance which need cnly limited
amounts of foreign exchange.
-PAIRT II - BANK GROUP OPEPATIONS IN THE pFLKPINESE
12.     ,he Philinpines has received 18 Bank loans and two 1ThA czr-adts
totalling $302 million, net of cancellations.   Hialf of the Bani Goup s
lending; atou-t $150 million, has been. for infrastructure projects ir.
power, transportation, water supply and education.    Tihe remainder has
been divided equally between agricoul'ture and induistry.  Aboout, $85 million
of this has been for irri.gation  livestock, rice processing andL rural,
credit and about $65 milllon for industryj in th^ree loans to t,he Private
Development Ccp3oration of the Philipp-nes.    ;One pcrts loan for $8.5
million to finance dredging equipmient -was made in 1961.  Experience on
this loan was unsatisfactory, due to failure to operate and imainta-in thle
dredgers in an efficient manner,and some $1.1 million was cancelled.
1.3 .   Of total Bank/IDA len ding for the lhili. ppines, three loans and two
credits totalling $63.8 million were made since the begirLnnig of  972.
Disb-ursemnents on 'f'our of th-ese have just begun -rhile the fiJt is not yet
effective.   Of the remaining $238 million, the unrdisboursed balance on
Au.,gust 31, 1973 was about $ffi million, almost all of' i-ich was ac;counted
for by fius loans rade since the DeginiLng of 196?P.   Disbursements cn t-,wo
of these n, both agricult-ural credlt projects, are b0ehind schedule oue in
part to the general econom.ic slowdown in the Philippines following the
February- '1970 devaluation an.rLd the subsequent stabilization program.
lo wcve r, disbursements on, tuese loans began to pick up last year.
Annex TI gives the staatus of Ban;rc Group o-perateions.  The Bank Group's
presenst srhae in t.,otal debt :',tsf,Xtanding is abcut a percent,and i.,s share
in debt service is abou-t 3.-percent.   If tresent trends continue, as
expectzed, the Ba:-k Group 'a share  n   t lotal debt outstandi.ng woul d rise
to about 12 nercent by 1976 while its share   i n   debt service woulld be
about-  S pc;rcent,

A recent Bank Agricultural Sector Study noted that expanding and improving
irrigation was essential to support land reform and to permit agricultural
production and rural incomes to increase.   The Upper Panpanga project,
at present under way, will make a vital contribution in the heavily
tenanted areas of Central Luzon.   Several additional irrigation projects
are being prepared, the first of which will probably be ready for approval
late in FY 74.   A rural development project is being prepared and should
be ready for appraisal next year.   Further loans are also likely to be
made over the next two or three years for rural credit and livestock.
15.     Bank/IDA infrastructure lending will continue to emphasize
transportation and power projects.   A second highways project was
appraised in June and is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors
for approval in December.   Further projects for highways, ports, shipping
and power are being prepared for Bank financing.   In the social sectors
an IDA credit was signed in January 1973 for a second education project
and a proposed population project is being prepared.
16.     Bank Group lending could rise substantially above present levels
provided the economy is managed reasonably well and the Philippines
continues to improve its capacity to prepare and implement projects.
17.     IFO has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $66 million
for investments in ten companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products,
nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers.   Of these
investments, as of August 31, 1973, $17.8 million have been sold, $0.h
million cancelled and $1.1 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of
$46.7 million.   On the same date $16.8 million was undisbursed.
Preliminary proposals have been received for an aluminum smelter and
other projects in the pulp and paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and
shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE SECTOR
18.     Ports and shipping have, in the past, played a dominant role in
the transport sector of the Philippines and continue to provide an essential
means of transport and communication among the islands of the archipelago.
In recent years, however, an expanding network of highways, particularly
on Luzon, has provided access to the interiors of the larger islands,
and road transport has played an increasingly important role.    The
relatively short inland distances have limited railways to a small fraction
of total traffic.
19.     Difficult terrain, heavy rainfall and unfavorable soil conditions
are natural obstacles to provision of transport infrastructure but lack
of funds and poor planning and organization have compounded the problem.
The present inadequacy of transport infrastructure reflects the small



pro,ocrtaion of national resources which, in the past, has been devoted
to pubilc investmen:t.  A1 though it absorbed one half of total public
inves'ment Juring the past decade, transport investment represented
barely one percent of GN?.   Given an inadequate transport infrastracture
base, the ra-e o  capital expansion hnas been insuff^icient to meet a
traffic grow-Th of almost 1f0 percent per annurm.  This unsatisfactor-y
sit&iation has been attributable to the low levels of tax revenues,
although a contriLbutory factor has been political interference that has
hampered both planning and implement-ation of- transport programs and
projects.   For example, Congress denied many new tax measures proposed
by the Goverrmuent, particularly increased taxes on gasoline and other
fuels, to provide funds needed for transport investments.
20.     Tax reforms introduced over the last year nave notably increaseQ
the funds avai-Lable for public infrastructure investmentt  The
Goverrm enLtt s large transport investment program for l97t -77 -reflects thle
urgent r,eed to make good the results of past neglect..  It  1 a f-or
expenditures over the four years of' about $800 m^nilli.on, inclauding over
$200 million from foreign sources, and represents about 43 Oercernt of
the total public investment program or 1.8 percent of GITP.  Of total
transport invesstment, 73 percent is for highways, 10 percent for -ports,
10 percenit for railways and the remaining 7 percent f'or ailports.
This is an amr,bitious proaram, and it may be constrained by the
Government's adni-nistrative capacity to execute it.  However, th e
recent government reorganizationr which covered agencies dealing with
the transDort sector should lead to improved performance.
21.     The Philippines hias ariy natural, sheltered horbors with deep
water close to shore.   Construction miaterials are readil-y avail.able and
inexpensive, and in many cases construction of costly breakwaters is
unnecessary.   These cir3umstances have led to a proliferation of small
ports.   There are 90 na Aional n-d 390 mun_-.cir-,l- ports plus numerous
Drivate piers and wha-ves,   The pul-lic ports, which handle most imports
of consumer and capital goods and tthe bulk of inter-island trade, have
generally not been desig2ned for modern cargo handling and port areas are
too small tLo permit efficient Tort operations.  Port facilities are
generally poorly maintainedi and in many ports there -is a lack of both
equipment and sheds.   Privat2e zort facili.ties 'handle most of tLhe dry
cargo exports, and imports o-f oi.   Tn comparison with the public ports
they are modern ard efficienitw.
22.     Th11-e port of Manila iJs the most iapc-otant polrt in, tne country,
accounting for -h.bou1 7G0 perent ofGr all iinooras er±n 5 oeroent of ai!

- 7 -
executing agency for a UNDP-financed study of the ports of Cebu, Butuan,
Nasipit and Zamboanga.   This could serve as the basis for a further port
project suitable for Bank Group financing.
23.     There is no single agency responsible for planning, managing,
operating and maintaining public ports.   Administration and control of
public ports is in the hands of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) of the
Department of Finance, while their physical planning, construction and
maintenance are the responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works of the
Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications (DPWTC).
This situation has resulted in a lack of coordinated planning of port
development and serious deficiencies in port management, operations and
maintenance. Measures designed to improve the situation are discussed
in paras 27, 28 and 29.
24.     The main source of finance for the development and maintenance of
public ports is the Port Works Fund which is funded largely froma port
charges on foreign traffic through both public and private ports, since
domestic traffic is virtually free from any port charges.    Three Customs
collection districts, Manila, Batangas and Davao, provide 80 percent of
total port revenues. The amount accruing to the Port Works Fund rose
from P29 million in 1964 to P59 million in 1972, reflecting mainly
increased traffic volumes.   Port charges on foreign traffic remained
unchanged at the rate of P2 per ton between 1908 and November 1972, when
they were raised to P4 - 8 per ton by a decree under martial law.    At
present there is no wharfage charge on inter-island traffic.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.     The proposed project was prepared with the help of consultants
financed by the UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency.    A Bank mission
appraised the project in December 1972 and negotiations were held in
September 1973. The leader of the Government's negotiating team was
Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez.    The appraisal report (No 216a-PH dated
September 21, 1973) on the proposed project is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors.   Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
Description of the Project
26.     The proposed project would provide for the expansion of two of
Mindanao's principal ports, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos, which may
account for between one-quarter and one-third of total traffic through
Mindanao ports. It would assist in the further economic development of
Mindanao by reducing inter-island transport costs.   The project consists of
the construction of a 160 m wharf extension at Cagayan de Oro and a 300 m
extension at General Santos and, at both ports, the rehabilitation of the
existing wharves, construction of transit sheds and ancillary works. It also
includes consultants' services for detailed engineering and supervision
of construction at both ports, for detailed engineering for a future
ports project, and for preparing a master plan for the future expansion
of the Port of Manila. The project would also provide tec1hnical assistance

equipmlent will be provided if" required.
P7ort Organiaation and Finances
27.     The 3arLk has haad only limiA ited succXess in it's previous efforts
to assist the Goveri7unent ln institution buildir.g in tUhe Philip-pines.
however, thi.e adm-inistrative, fiscal, mnonetary an-d socical ref ormr1s that
the Gove=rnent is now undertaki-ng have created a situation which is
apparently more conducive than at any timle in the recent pt 't for
constractive efforts towards institution building4   The projec   is the
first of tw,-o to be prop'osed, with the -principal purpose of assisti_-g
the Governmenxt In improving overall port management, adininisratio-n and-
plannirng.
28.     SomQe ofL the weaknesses of t-he presernt arrangements for cort
admatnist ration anud deve& o-pmert in the Philippines were descri.bed in
paragraph 23 above.   Tc improve the s- tuation, the GovernmETnt has agreed
tx) set up a PhOiilippine Pcrts Authority (E?A) by Decer.m1ber 197Q, wh1ich would
be fully operational by Janua-ry 1975.  Thne proposed PPA Would hrave
Jurisdiction over all the important national ports and woiild also be
respornsible for developing a national ports rolilcy.  With- the help of
consultants financed under the project, t'he -overnment would prep,are and
carry outu a Plan of action which would enable tle P,RA -to talke over full
respcnstbllAty for operating the major national ports by January 1976f.
Thle EPA would be an autonomuvs and financi.a.lly self-supporting authoril -,
and would reLibuarse tne Govermr,ent, for allI debt serv-ice p)aymrents unider
tne proposed loan.   The Governr,ent has ag-reed tthat PPA would levy port
charges which would ensure that PEA woruld earn an adeouate returrn on its
net fixed a.ssets.

Overall responsibility for project execution would rest with the
Department of Public Works, Transport and Conmunications, of which the
Bureau of Public 'Works is a part.   Once the PPA is established, it will
take over responsibility for project management.
Cost of the Project
31.     The estimated total cost of the project is US $12.0 million with an
estimated foreign exchange cost of up to US $6.1 million, which the Barn would
finance.   The estimates include a 10 percent allowance for physical
contingencies and a 7½ percent per annum allowance for increases irn
domestic and foreign prices.   The project is scheduled for completion
by December 1976.   The Government has approached the Federal Reoublic of
Germany for bilateral assistance for the master plan for Manila port.    If
agreement is reached with the German authorities, the estimated foreign
exchange cost of this study ($0.4 million) will be cancelled from the loan.
Procurement
32.     All civil works contracts, such as those for the construction of
wharves and transit sheds, would be awarded on the basis of internaticnal
competit.ive bidding in accordance with the Bankrs guidelines.   There
will be no procurement of equipment.    The number and size of individual
civil works contracts will be determined upon completion of the detailed
engineering which is to start soon.    It is anticipated that the work would
be divided into no more than one or two contracts for each of the two
project ports.
Disbursement
33.     Disbursement would be made on the basis of 15 percent of the total
cost of the civil works (the estimated foreign exchange component, assuming
the work is to be undertaken by foreign contractors) and the actual foreign
expenditures for technical assistance.    If all civil worLks contracts were
let to local contractors this percentage would imply Bank financing Lor up to
$1.5 million of local currency expenditures.
34..    Provision has been made for retroactive financing of up to
US $200,000 equivalent for detailed engineering services performed since
October 1, 1973.
Economic Justification
35.   The project will have important benefits for tlhe economtic gro-wth of
Mindanac,  the second largest island in the Philippines, which is a

C.  Projects in ExecutionJ/
Ln No. 491-PH Fourth Power; US$12.0 million Loan of April 5, 1967
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
This project was to assist the National Power Corporation (NPC)
in financing the construction of a 75-MW thermal plant on the Bataan
Peninsula and a 50-MW addition to the Maria Christina Hydroelectric Plant
in Mindanao. The Maria Christina addition was completed in 1970. The
Bataan thermal unit was commissioned in December 1972, about two years
behind schedule. The delay was due initially to slow government approval of
contract awards and subsequently to financial difficulties of the civil
works contractor and mechanical failures. The undisbursed balance of
$0.6 million of the Bank loan represents the retention requirements for
equipment supplied under the project. The Closing Date has been further
postponed by 18 months to December 31, 1973.
Ln No. 607-PH Second Rural Credit; US$12.5 million Loan of June 4, 1969
Closing Date:  June 30, 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly due
to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was allowed
to float in February 1970. The subsequent increases in prices of farm produce
together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengthening of staff
and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of disbursement which
has particularly quickened over the last five months. $4.8 million remain
undisbursed. The Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973 has been postponed
to June 30, 1974 when present projections indicate that the loan will be
fully disbursed.
Ln No. 630-PH Development Finance Company; US$24.2 million Loan of July 10, 1969
Closing Date: September 30, 1973
The loan to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
(PDCP) has been fully committed for sub-projects but as of August 31, 1973,
$0.7 million of the loan remained undisbursed.   The Closing Date was postponed
to September 30, 1973, by which datethe loan was fully disbursed against
commitments for sub-projects.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

n No. 637-PH  Irriga-iDn; US$31.0 million Loan of August 18   1969
Closing Date:  June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares.   The project's on
farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation develop-
ment in the country.  Some delays were caused by the 1972 floods but con-
struction is now progressing satisfactorily.  All work is expected to be
completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30, 1976, the original
completion date. Project, costs have increased 34 percent over appraisal
estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso and design
changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination established
between irrigation and agricultural supportingservices, the project is
expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion of construction
instead of 13 years as appraised. The project remains economically viable.
Ln No. 720-PH, Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971 - Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project was designed to provide long-term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for the estab-
lishment of modern integrated rice processing and storage facilities. The
project encountered difficulties from the beginning owing to the lack of
demand for sub-loans. The major reasons for the disappointing sub-loan
demand were set out in the President's memorandum to the Executive Directors
dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) which proposed amendments to the loan agreement
to shift the emphasis on lending to rehabilitation of existing facilities
and tostreamline the procurement procedures. In spite of the subsequent
amendments of the loan agreement, the project has so far made very little
progress so that by the end of July 1973 only $0.26 million was disbursed
and this was entirely for the consultant services. The government has now
proposed further amendments to the loan agreement to expand the scope of the
project.  These amendments, which are designed to facilitate speedy and
full implementation without compromising the objectives of the project, are
being considered.
Lr. No. 731-PH Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
'fThe project f'or the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Di-os road (i160 im) in MindanaG is in general progressing satisfactorily.
',Crk was, ',Bwevar, su..pended in Ylarch 1973 beGause of civil disturbances in
the Cotabatc area, but the contractor has since resumed work from the Digos
erd wiich is outside the area affected oy the fighting.   iThe proG-act al-o
includes two components, financed by UNDP: technical assistance to the
Bureau of Public Highways (BPH.) for operational improvements and feasibiliy
studies fos Future highway projects. Wvork on the technical assistance
coliiponentt is progressing, well and `ah^e 'easibil'ty studies have bsen completed.

Ln No. 809-PH and Cr No. 296-PH Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 millior
Loan and Credit of April 3, 1972
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected. Although a further tariff
increase was imposed in January 1973, a proposed surcharge to cover increased
fuel costs was not approved by the government. As a result NPC is still
not achieving the covenanted financial rate of return, but no remedial
action is proposed since the fuel surcharge should be implemented in the
latter part of FY1974.
Ln No. 823-PH  Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the
Philippines. The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr No. 349-PH  Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project will assist Government in the improvement of such
areas as education planning, management and curriculum development, science
teacher training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and
farmers. Although no disbursements have been made the project is progress-
ing on schedule.
Ln No. 891-PH Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and irland
fisheries development.  The loan was to become effective by September 25, 1973.
All conditions for effectiveness have been met except the appointment by the
Development Bank of the Philippines of a marine specialist and a naval
architect.  DBP is making bilateral arrangements for these appointments but
a delay of at least a few months appears unavoidable.   The Bank has agreed to
postpone the final date of effectiveness to December 31, 1973. The demnand
for loans appears adequate and the organization to implement them has been
properly established.
