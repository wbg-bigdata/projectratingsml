APPRAISAL OF A SECOND PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Bank has been asked to help finance the expansion of
two of Mindanao's principal ports, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos, in
order to facilitate the further economic development of Mindanao and to
avoid substantial delays to shipping.
ii.       Ports and shipping have, in the past, played a dominant role in
the transport sector of the Philippines and continue to provide an essential
means of inter-island transport and communications. The public ports, which
handle the bulk of Philippine dry cargo imports and inter-island traffic,
are generally small, poorly maintained and not designed for modern cargo-
handling methods.
iii.      The project, which is based on consultants studies financed through
the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency, comprises construction of 160 m
of wharf at Cagayan de Oro and 300 m of wharf at General Santos and, at both
ports, rehabilitation of the existing wharves, construction of transit sheds
and ancillary works, and provision of consultants' services and technical
assistance. The total cost is estimated at US$12.0 million of which
US$6.1 million equivalent is foreign exchange.
iv.       Contracts for civil works would be awarded through international
competitive bidding. Detailed engineering is proceeding and bids could be
invited shortly after loan effectiveness.
v.        The present facilities at the project ports are inadequate to meet
forecast traffic and, without the proposed project, would cause serious delays
to inter-island ships, which are the principal users of the ports. The
proposed project would integrate well with planned and ongoing highway
projects, and would facilitate the substantial increase in shipments of
agricultural commodities which is expected to result from planned and on-
going agricultural projects. The proposed project would also reduce cargo-
handling costs. Project execution is expected to take about two years and
to be completed by Decenber 1976.
vi.       Port management and administration, which is, at present, the
responsibility of the Bureau of Customs, is unsatisfactory. A Philippine
Ports Authority (PPA) would be established by appropriate legislative action.
In the interim, certain organizational changes are necessary, both at the
project ports and in the departments concerned with port administration and
planning.
vii.      The Government has agreed to impose a wharfage charge on
domestic cargo and to increase this as required to cover the cost of
providing port facilities and services for inter-island shipping, such as



- ii -
those proposed in the present project. With this proposed charge the project
ports would generate sufficient cash to meet all operating and maintenance
costs and to service the proposed Bank loan.
viii.     The economic returns on the project, 22% at Cagayan de Oro and
29% at General Santos, are satisfactory.
ix.       The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$6.1 million
equivalent to the Government for a term of 25 years, including a four-year
grace period, reflecting the life of the assets.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND PORT PROJECT
I. INTROD UCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (the Government)
has requested the Bank's assistance in financing the expansion of two of
Mindanao's principal ports, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos, a project which
forms a part of the Government's five-year infrastructure program (1973-77).
The proposed project, which would be partially financed by a Bank loan of
US$6.1 million equivalent, is based on feasibility studies undertaken by
consultants (Sir William Halcrow & Partners - UK) with UNDP financing and
the Bank as executing agency. The loan would be made to the Government for
a term of 25 years, including a four-year grace period, reflecting the life
of the assets.  'When established, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) would
assume a debt to the Government of Ps 41.2 million on similar terms.
1.02      Two previous loans have.been made for transport infrastructure in
the Philippines, 290-PH in 1961 for US$8.5 million and 731-PH in 1971 for
US$8.0 million.  Experience on the first of these, for procurement of dredg-
ing equipment, was unsatisfactory, due to failure to operate and maintain
the dredgers in an efficient manner, and some US$1.1 million was cancelled.
Loan 731-PR (the first highway loan) is, in general, progressing satisfac-
torily although work by the contractor was suspended for some time in 1973
by civil disturbances in Cotabato Province. In both these loans the Bank
sought to bring about organizational improvements and, in the case of the
highway loan, a measure of success was achieved in strengthening the Bureau
of Public Highways, particularly its maintenance organization and ability to
prepare and execute projects. A second highway project has been appraised
for presentation to the Board during this fiscal year.
1.03      In total, the Philippines has received 18 Bank loans and two IDA
credits totalling US$302 million, net of cancellation. About half of this
total has been for priority infrastructure projects in power, transportation,
water supply and education. The remainder has been divided between agri-
culture and industry, with US$87 million being used for fisheries, irriga-
tion, livestock, rice processing and rural credit, and US$65 million for
industry.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission,
composed of Y. Akatsuka (engineer), J. Burns (financial analyst) and R. H.
Roberts (economist), which visited the Philippines in December 1972.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      The Phililpines consists of some 7,000 islands with a land area
of about 300,000 km (roughly tne same size as Italy). Luzon, on which



-2-
Manila is situated, and Mindanao are the two largest islands making up about
70% of the land area.  They also account for about three-quarters of the 39
million popul.ac.ion.  The annual population growth rate, 3% during 1960-70, is
one of the highest in the world.
2.02      Agriculture, the basis of the economy, generates about 32% of the
Net Domestic Product (NDP), accounts for about 70% of export earnings
(coconut, forestry products and sugar), and employs about 48% of the labor
force.  About 33% of the land area is cultivated (primarily rice and corn) and
about 48% is commercial forest. Manufacturing accounts for about 21% of the
NDP, considerably more than in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.  Tie
Philippines has abundant natural resources, with particular potential for
tropical agriculture, forestry and mineral development.(copper, gold, iron,
chrome and nickel).
B.   The Mindanao Eonoiy
2
2.03       Mindanao, with a land area of 102,000 km , is the second largest
among the Philippine islands and remains a relatively underdeveloped but
potentially ric'h area. it has abundant mineral resources, large primary
forests and richi fishing grounds, and considerable agricultural potential
is provided by ?lentiful water aind fertile soi'l.
2.04      Econoaic grow6i in 4 indanao irn the past decade, stimulated by
the exploitation of extensive virgin lands and forests, has been significantly
above the national average.  Over 602 of the regional NDP originates in
primary activities and almost three-quarters of the population, 1ive by agri-
culture.  In 1970, direct exports froma the region, principally forest and
coconut products and tropical fruit. amounted to US$300 million, approx-
imately one-third of national exports.  Since recorded imports in the same
year were US$116 million (11% of the national total), the regional trade
balance was heavily in surplus.  A substantiai proportion of the surplus
accrues to large corpora&iorns based outside Mindanao and is not utilized for
reinvestment or consumption in Miindanao. As a result, regional economic
growth has remained unbalanced.
2.05      The region's economic growth has attracted migrants from the
overcrowded areas of Luzon and the Visayas and this has contributed to the
more than 4.5% annual population growth rate over tlie period 1960-70.
Nevertheless, the level of employment in Mirndanao is better than the
national average, and population density is still substantially lower.  NDP
per capita in Mincanao i.s iLigher than for the. Philippinesas a whole and is
grawing faster. Nigration has led to comur.al strife which, in the last
few years, has caused serious economic dislocation in the province of Cotabato.
Up to 1966 this province was an iaportant contributor to Mindanao's foodgrain
surplus but since then has become a deficit area.
2.06      'ne province of Bukidnon (roughly coincident with the hinterland of
the port of Cagayan de Oro) is one of the most promising agricultural areas
in ?indanao, largely consisting of uplands (300-900 m above sea level) with
a semi-temperate climate and fertile soil.  Crops include corn, vegetables
and fruit, and the province is an important beef-producing area.  Population



-3-
has grown over the past decade at 7.9% per annum, reflecting the pleasant
climate and economic opportunities which have attracted many migrants from
the Visayas and Northern Mindanao. Given adequate infrastructure, technical
assistance and credit facilities, Bukidnon could support a meat and dairy
industry large enough to satisfy most of the national requirement.
2.07      The province of South Cotabato (roughly coincident with the hinterland
of the port of General Santos) is almost entirely dependent on agriculture,
mostly rice and corn production.  The Cotabato Lowland, formed by the Mindanao
River, with its rich soil and abundant water resources is well suited to further
agricultural development, and the Government has plans for rehabilitating
existing irrigation schemes and constructing new ones. Further development
of the area's potential will also require construction of feeder roads and
improvement of secondary roads.
C.   The Transport Sector (Map 10217R)
2.08      Ports and shipping have, in the past, played a dominant role in
the transport sector of the Philippines and continue to provide an essential
means of transport and communication between the islands of the archipelago.
In recent years, however, an increasing network of highways, particularly
on Luzon, has provided access to the interiors of the larger islands, and
road transport has played an increasingly important role. The relatively
short inland distances have limited the railways to a small fraction of the
total traffic.
2.09      Difficult terrain, heavy rainfall and unfavorable soil conditions
have been natural obstacles to the provision of transport infrastructure
but lack of funds and poor planning and organization have compounded the
problem.  The lack of finances has made it impossible to maintain or improve
transport facilities to an adequate level. Since the imposition of martial
law in 1972, there has been a notable increase in the amount of funds made
available for infrastructure investment and maintenance.
2.10      The highway network consists of about 16,000 km of paved roads,
38,000 km of gravel, and 20,000 km of unimproved roads. The highways of
Luzon and Mindanao comprise three-quarters of the entire system, most of
the rest being on the main islands of the Visayas. The condition of the road
system is generally poor, with even the national primary and secondary
roads in a deteriorated condition, due to inadequate maintenance.
2.11      The most important railway is the Government-owned Philippine
National Railways (PNR), which has about 1,000 km- of main line and 1,000 km
of branch lines on the island of Luzon.  About 760 km of PNR's track was
relaid during the 1960's with the aid of Japanese reparations. The remainder
is in very poor condition. Management of the railway has been weak, main-
tenance of facilities inadequate and operations inefficient and unprofitable.
The main line is paralleled by highways for most of its 'Length and it is
difficult to visualize the railway ever being competitive with trucks and buses
without Government subsidy. However, since PNR is an important employer, it
would be difficult for the Government to close it down, and the Government's



-4-
present objective is to improve its operations to the point where it is covering
all cash costs.
2.12      Manila, the only international airport in the Philippines is
served by 15 major international airlines, as well as by the Philippine
Air Lines (PAL), which has both international and domestic services.  An
extensive network of domestic airports is served by PAL and two other
major domestic carriers. Domestic passenger traffic has been increasing
at about 17% per annum with PAL carrying more than two-thirds of the traf-
fic. Despite the high traffic growth PAL has encountered increasing finan-
cial difficulties over the last two years due, in part, to an ambitious
expansion program.
2.13      There are some 90 national and 390 municipal ports throughout the
Philippine archipelago, plus numerous private piers and wharves. Most of the
public ports are small and the Government envisages the gradual elimination
of the less economic ports from the national system.  This will be achieved
through the concentration of investment at selected locations, a process
which should yield economies of scale. The long-established public ports
have generally been sited with a view to natural protection and, in many
cases, this has resulted in sedimentation problems. However, the more
modern private piers and wharves, which handle most dry cargo exports and
imports of oil, have generally been sited to take advantage of natural deep
water. Swell is generally a problem only during typhoons and many ports
do not have breakwaters. Most of the public ports are poorly maintained and
have not been designed for modern cargo-handling techniques. Sheds are often
lacking, although private warehouses are usually available nearby. Cargo-
handling is generally in the hands of private companies, and many ports lack
equipment. Manila, much the largest port, accounts for about 70% of all imports
and 5% of all exports.
2.14      The Philippine merchant fleet totalled approximately 1.6 million
gross registered tons (GRT) in 1971. This includes 130 ocean-going vessels
totalling 830,000 GRT and 157 inter-island vessels of over 500 GRT totalling
about 250,000 GRT, the remainder being craft of under 500 GRT each. More
than 45% of the inter-island fleet and 41% of the ocean-going fleet were 19
or more years old in 1971. In 1968, seven new cargo/passenger vessels, of
7,000 dwt each, were bought with aid from the Federal German Republic for
inter-island services. More recently, a few tankers and cargo vessels have
been acquired through private financing. Large, export-oriented companies
frequently provide their owr modern, efficient ships to carry commodities
such as minerals, sugar, fruit and forest products to overseas markets.
D.   The Mindanao Transport Sector (Map 10348)
2.15      The transport infrastructure, particularly roads, is generally in
a very poor condition and its improvement is a necessary condition of the
further economic development of Mindanao. Only about 8% of the 15,700 km
of existing roads is paved, and many areas are inaccessible, particularly
during the monsoon season. The Government is taking steps to improve a
number of Mindanao's national highways, and IBRD, the Japanese Government
and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are assisting in the financing some of



-5-
these:  IBRD is providing finance for the Digos-Cotabato road (Map 10348), the
Japanese Government for the section of the Pan-Philippine Highway from Surigao
to Davao and ADB for the General Santos-Cotabato road, and the Iligan-Butuan
road. The Government is, itself, financing the improvement of the northern
section of the 243 km highway from Cagayan de Oro to Digos.
2.16      To relieve the present congested state of Mindanao's ports the
Government is receiving assistance from ADB for the port of Cotabato and
from the Federal German Republic (KFW) for the ports of Iligan and Davao.
These ports, and the ports of Cagayan de Oro and General Santos (the project
ports), were identified as high priority projects by the UNDP-financed
Philippine Transport Survey (1970). In addition to the studies on which
the present project is based, the UNDP is financing, with the Bank as
executing agency, consultants' studies of the ports of Zamboanga, Butuan
and Nasipit. The first of these is expected to provide part of a project
suitable for Bank financing in FY 75. As in the case of the earlier studies,
the consultants are required to take into account, in defining the hinterlands
of the project ports, the traffic likely to move through neighboring and
competing ports.
E.   Transport Planning and Coordination
2.17      As a result of a recent sweeping Government reorganization, trans-
port planning is now the joint responsibility of the National Economic Dev-
elopment Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Public Works, Transportation
and Communications (DPWTC). A Planning Service under the office of the
Secretary, DPWTC, has a Planning and Project Development Division responsible
for intermodal transport planning. There is also a Port Programming and
Planning Branch in the Bureau of Public Works (BPW). A Bureau of Transportation
within DPWTC, working within policy guidelines laid down by a Board of Trans-
portation, is responsible for regulation of all modes of transport except
railways. The PNR remains responsible to the office of the President.
Exclusion of the railways from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Transportation
militates against effectiveness of the latter as an instrument of transport
coordination, but it is too early to tell whether this arrangement will work
in practice.
2.18      The Government's five-year public infrastructure program (1973-77)
calls for a very substantial increase in public investment, and a large number
of transportation projects have been identified. This emphasizes the importance
of the role of the Planning and Project Development Division in establishing
priorities amongst competing projects, since the Government will not be able
to implement all the proposed projects within this period. This Division is
already receiving technical assistance, financed by the UNDP, in its physical
planning studies. In addition, to make its studies meaningful, a general
improvement in the quality of basic data is required. Steps have already
been taken to improve the quantity and quality of highway traffic data,
and to improve highway project planning and implementation capabilities. A
similar improvement in the field of ports is essential. During negotiations,
the Government agreed to strengthen, not later than June 1974, the Port
Programming and Planning Branch of BPW with a view to organizing the collec-
tion of statistics and improving the preparation of projects for all National
Ports (para 3.05).



-6-
2.19      Further expansion of the port of Manila will encounter physical
constraints, particularly in the landward access to the port, which may be
costly to overcome. In view of the importance of Manila port in the exter-
nal trade and domestic traffic flows of the Philippines, the Government
proposes to develop, with technical assistance, a master plan for the
port.  The proposed project includes funds for this purpose (para 4.01(c)).
III.  PORT ORGANIZATION, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
A.   Organization and Management
1.   Present
3.01      At present all public ports, with the exception of San Fernando
(which is organized as a Port Authority), are under the control of the Bureau
of Customs (BOC) within the Department of Finance.  In addition to his
normal customs collection and anti-smuggling functions, the Commissioner
of Customs is responsible for port management and administration and, to
carry out this responsibility, he is assisted by the Office of the Special
Commissioner on Port Admrinistration.
3.02      For Customs administrative purposes the Philippines is divided
into 34 Collect_on Districts of which five are not yet operational. Each
District is managed by a Collector of Customs, one seaport therein being
designated as the principal Port of Entry with sometimes also one or more
sub-Ports of Entry.
3.03      At each principal Port of Entry, the District Collector of Customs
is in direct charge of port management and administration. He is responsi-
ble for the day-to-day work of the port, ancherages and outports, and, as
far as customs regulations are concerned, for the working of ships and cargo
at private facilities. In general, however, the Collector, being primarily
concerned with Customs duties, leaves routine port operations to ships'
agents in association with the stevedoring contractors and does not exercise
discernible control over waterfront activities.
3.04      Construction and maintenance at all public ports is the responsi-
bility of the Ports and Harbors Division of BPW (a branch of DPWTC). Main-
tenance is supervised either directly by this Division as at Manila, or
through City or District Engineers in other parts of the Philippines. Cons-
truction is nonmally carried out by contractors. Dredging at public ports
is the responsibility of the Harbor and Dredging Reclamation Division of
BPW, whether undertaken departmentally or by contractors.
3.05      T'lere is no administrative mechanism for coordinating the port-
related activities of BOC and BPW, with the result that capital expenditures
are often unrelated to operational needs, and maintenance is neglected. Fur-
thermore, BOC does not keep adequate records for purposes of port planning;
traffic statistics and data on ship movements and delays are either inadequate



-7-
or unavailable. This situation will be improved by the strengthening of the
Port Programming and Planning Branch of BPW referred to in para 2.18.
2.   Reorganization Proposals
3.06      To improve port management, administration, operations and plan-
ning, a PPA would be established with responsibility for developing a
national policy for ports and with jurisdiction over all the important
National Ports ond would become fully operational by January 1976. The main
functions to be performed by PPA are indicated in Annex 1. The Government,
using technical assistance provided by the project, would:
(a)  take appropriate legislative action, not later than
December 1974, to establish a financially and
operationally autonomous PPA with a constitution, including
powers and responsibilities, satisfactory to the Bank;
(b)  carry out a detailed Plan of Action, with a timetable for
implementation, satisfactory to the Bank, covering, inter
alia:
(i) National Ports to be included in PPA.
(ii) management and organizational structure for
PPA including local Port Management Units for
all ports to be included in PPA. In the case
of the project ports these Units would be set
up not later than June 1974. Annex 2 shows their
main functions and Chart 7811, a suggested organ-
izational structure.
(iii) development of management and administrative functions
through the transfer of port oriented personnel from
BOC and the hiring of suitably qualified staff.
(iv) training for all grades of personnel.
(v) accounting systems for PPA and individual ports.
(vi) tariff structure for all ports to be included in PPA
which would ensure that at each port the charges
reflect the costs of the services and provide
an adequate return on PPA's net fixed assets.
(vii) overall and individual port financial objectives.
(c) transfer the Port Programming and Planning Branch and
the Ports and Harbors Division to PPA.
Agreement on the foregoing was reached with the Government during nego-
tiations.



3.07      Pending PPA becoming operational in January 1976, BOC wili continue
to be responsible for the administration and operation of National Ports,
and the Ports and Harbors Division of BPW for construction and maintenance.
3.08      The achievement of the institutional improvements in port
organization, administration and management, a principal objective of the
proposed project, will depend to a great extent on the recruitment and
retention of suitably qualified and trained personnel for key positions.
Although an appropriate training component is included in the proposed project,
difficulties may nevertheless be encountered in recruiting sufficient quali-
fied and experienced staff, partly due to inadequate Government compensation
as compared to the private sector. Improvement in salary levels may be
expected, with the creation of PPA, but there may still be some delay in
achieving the objectives of the project.
B.   Finances
3.09      The main sources of finance for the construction and mainteniance
of public ports is the Port Works Fund which receives its income from dues
and charges raised, in accordance with the Tariff and Custons Code (Annex 4),
on cargo imports and exports, from berthing, harbor and tonnage dues levied
on ships, storage charges and a percentage of cargo-handling contractors'
gross revenue. These charges are collected by the Collector of Customs at
all national ports including the project ports. Dues and charges are uniform
and are applied at all private ports as wel1 as the National Ports. An
exception is storage charges, which are different in Manila from other ports.
3.10      It is laid down by statute that the Port Works Fund will be used
to repay loans and redeem bonds; 50% of the balance will be allocated
annually for financing port construction and itaproverients and the remainder
for financing maintenance and repairs. The Furnd is administered by the Depart-
ment of Finance. T he release of funds to finance EPW's expenditure program
is determined by the Budget Commissioner and, prior to the iiiposition of
Martial Law, had to be approved by Congress.
3.11      The total income generated over the past five fiscal years was:
Fiscal Year               Ps millions
i968                       55.0
1969                       48.0
1970                       50.0
1971                       57.0
1972                       59.0
Respa;ytive contributions of the various dues and services for FY 72 were:



-9-
Ps millions       %
Wharfage                            42.2         73
Harbor, Berthing and Storage         9.6         16
Cargo-Handling Contractors           3.2          5
Ship Tonnage Dues                    3.9          6
58.7       100
from which it will be seen that about 80% of income is derived from wharfage
and tonnage dues which are levied on foreign ships and cargoes only.  In
all, foreign trade and vessels provide around 90% of total collections and
inter-island traffic only 10%; 85% of total collections are charges on
cargo and 15% on ships.  It is estimated that the Fund income will be increased
by approximately Ps 100 million a year as a result of an increase in dues
and charges effected by Presidential Decree in November 1972.
3.12      Separate records are not kept by the Customs of the collections
which accrue from public ports, private installations, anchorages or load-
ing areas, but it is known that the income from private installations is
considerable and could well be 60% to 65% of total port revenues. Eighty
percent of the income is derived from three collection districts, Manila
and Batangas providing 75% and Davao, 5%.
3.13      Domestic shipping is exempt from tonnage dues and domestic cargoes
from wharfage and to the extent that capital and maintenance expenditures
are met from the Port Works Fund, foreign traffic is subsidizing domestic.
At negotiations, the Government agreed, as a first step in moving to a cost-
based tariff to introducej in January 1974, an initial wharfage charge of
Ps 1.00 per ton on domestic cargoes, which would be increased as necessary
in subsequent years.
3.14      It was further agreed with the Government during negotiations
that, in accordance with the principle of financial autonomy, PPA, when
established, would assume a debt to the Government, equivalent to the IBRD
loan, on similar terms and conditions.
3.15      With the establishment of PPA the Port Works Fund will no longer
be required for financing development of the public ports within PPA's
jurisdiction. The Government will review the means of financing other port
developments and the need for the Fund.
C.   Facilities at Project Ports
3.16      Cagayan de Oro has an alongside wharf of reinforced concrete open-
pile construction 367 m long with an alongside depth of about 6 m at low
water. With the mean tidal range of less than 1 m this depth can accommodate
ships of about 3,000 dwt. The entire wharf can be easily dredged to 8.5 m
without any structural modification to accommodate vessels up to 10,000 dwt.
The wharf is generally in good condition, except for the fenders which need
replacement. Of the total length of 367 m, 60% is provided with a paved



- 10 -
working area immediately behind it. Parts of the wharf are not designed
to carry the ca:go-handling equipment in use but can be strengthened econo-
mically. The port has no transit sheds, water and electric lighting, fire-
fighting system or drainage. Further details of facilities are given in
Annex 4.
3.17      The port's fences and boundary wall have prevented the intrusion
of squatters into the port working area but numerous buildings have been
constructed against the fences on the rock causeways and may need to be
removed to facilitate construction.  During negotiations, the Government
confirmed that steps would be taken, as necessary, to resettle squatters.
3.18      General Santos has a wharf of reinforced concrete open-pile
construction 241 m long with an unsurfaced working area immediately behind.
The depth alongside the quay is generally 8 m at low water and, with a mean
tidal range of 1.5 m, can accommodate ships up to 10,000 dwt.  The wnarf
is not designed to carry modern cargo-handling equipment but can be
strengthened economically.  The port has no transit sheds, water and
electric supply, lighting, fire-fighting or drainage.  Further details of
faclfities are given in Annex 4.
3,19      The present access road to the port is unpaved and traffic has to
ford two shallow rivers to reach the port.  The road will be paved and
bridges constructed as part of the Cotabato-General Santos road, financed
by ADB.
D.  Operations at Project Ports
3.20      Cargo-handling operations are entirely in the hands of private
enterprise and, at present, fifteen companies at Cagayan de Oro and four
at General Santos form a local association for cargo-handling services.
Each company is associated with a labor union but the association controls
its members' contracts with the labor unions and also the schedule of cargo-
handiing charges.  The shipping lines, through full or part shareholding,
exercise varying degrees of control over the stevedores and are free to
choose one organization to handle cargo right through from ship's holds to
the warehouse, o?en storage or the cargo owner's vehicle.  IHowever, the
proliferation of cargo-handling companies tends to result in duplication
of plant and equipment and diseconomies in its operatior. as well as in the
use of port labor.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to reduce, by
July 1975, the ni=ber of cargo-handling companies to a maximum of two at
each project port.
3.21      Both project ports are geared to round-the-clock working when
required.  Stevedoring on board ship is carried out by a combination of
shipf,    - and menual handling.  Shore operations are, for the most part,
mrechanizeed  u. l.zing forklift trucks in conjunction with pallets.  The private-
sector cargo-handli ng companies own enough equipment to meet present needs.
Hlowever, at negotiations, the Government agreed that, if required, additional
equip-mert would be orovrided. Labor productivity is low as a result of inadequate
operational control (Annex 5).



3.22      Because of a complete lack of transit sheds in both project ports,
direct deliveries are often required at ship's side with consignees and
shippers providing their own trucks. This practice slows port operations
because the narrowness of working area, particularly at Cagayan de Oro,
restricts traffic movement. At General Santos, heavy duty vehicles cannot
be brought alongside in sufficient numbers to suit operational requirements
and cargo-handling equipment cannot operate efficiently because of the weak
wharf structure. The movement of cargo stacked on the open area, mostly
by forklift trucks, either to vessels or private warehouses often interferes
with truck movements. The project would provide ample working space,
transit storage areas and upgraded wharf structures which will eliminate the
need for the direct delivery procedures and allow the efficient use of
cargo-handling equipment.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Description of the Project
4.01      The project consists of:
(a) at the Port of Cagayan de Oro (Map 10349 and Annex 6);
(i)  rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing quay;
(ii)  160 m quay extension with an alongside depth of 8.5 m
at LWOST;
(iii)  three transit sheds totaling 5,100 m 2
(iv)  ancillary works, including surfaced roads and open
areas totaling 92,000 m2, an administration building,
a fire station, and services for water, electric
supply, lighting and drainage;
(v) engineering services for detailed design and supervision
of construction;
(b)  at the Port of General Santos (Map 10350 and Annex 6);
(i)  rehabilitation and upgrading of existing quay;
(ii)  300 m quay extension with an alongside depth of 8.5 m
at LWOST;
(iii)  three transit sheds totaling 6,300 m 2
(iv)  ancillary works, including surfaced roads and open
areas totaling 53,000 m2, an administration building,
a fire station, and services for water, electric
supply, lighting and drainage; and



- 12 -
(v)  engineering services for detailed design and supervision
of construction;
(c)  consulting services for preparing a master plan for the future
expansion of the Port of Manila; and for detailed engineering of a
future Bank project; and
(d)  technical assistance in the formulation of policies and pro-
cedures for PPA and in the training of personnel.
4.02      The items enumerated in (a) and (b) above have been the subject
of a feasibility study, financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing
agency, which was substantially completed in November 1972. Assuming
bid documents are ready by Jume 1974, construction could start by January
1975 and would be completed by December 1976.
4.03      The rehabilitated and new facilities at both Cagayan de Oro and
General Santos would handle forecast traffic for about 8 years after comple-
tion. The plamned facilities could be easily expanded should traffic growth
warrant it.
B.   Project Cost Estimates
4.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at Ps 81.3 million
(US$12.0 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of
Ps 41.2 million (US$6.1 million equivalent). The estimates, based on the
feasibility study, have been up-dated and are reasonable. The estimates
include a 10% allowance for physical contingencies and 7-1/2% p.a. allowance
for increase in domestic and foreign prices. Details of the cost estimates
are given in Table 1 and summarized below:

4.05      The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at
about 50% of the total costs and would be financed by the proposed loan.
The Government would finance the remainder. It is not easy to foresee
whether the civil works would be carried out by local or by foreign con-
tractors. The individual contracts (see para 4.09) will be small enough
to be within the capability of local contractors, but a foreign contractor
may well bid on all contracts together and win the award. The foreign
exchange element has been calculated to cover this eventuality.
4.06      The foreign exchange requirements (40%) for engineering services
for detailed design and supervision of construction reflect substantial
Government assistance. For consulting services and technical assistance the
foreign exchange requirements have been estimated by the Bank at about 80%
of the total fees.
4.07      The costs of civil works are based on known costs of labor, mate-
rials, plant and equipment and on current prices ruling in the Philippines.
C.   Engineering Services and Technical Assistance
4.08      During negotiations, the Government agreed to retain consultants
acceptable to the Bank for all consulting services and technical assistance.



- 14 -
D.   Procurement
4.09      All civil works contracts, such as those for the construction of
wharves and transit sheds, would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. There would
be no procurement of equipment. The number and size of individual civil
works contracts would be determined upon completion of the detailed engineer-
ing which is to start soon. It is anticipated that the work would be divided
into no more than one or two contracts for each of the two project ports.
E.   Project Execution
4.10      BPW, with the assistance of consultants, would be responsible for
the execution of all project items.
F.   Disbursement
4.11      Disbursement would be on the basis of 45% of the total cost of
civil works and the actual foreign exchange costs for consultants' services
and technical assistance. If the civil works are undertaken by domestic
contractors, this percentage disbursement would finance about US$1.5 million
of local costs (13% of total project costs), in addition to foreign exchange
costs. The estimated schedule of disbursements, which assumes loan effective-
ness at the end of January 1974, is given in Annex 7. The Government has
asked Sir William Halcrow & Partners (UK), who are acceptable to the Bank,
to begin detailed engineering for the project as soon as possible. This will
involve retroactive financing for approximately US$200,000 equivalent of the
foreign exchange costs.
G.   Ecology
4.12      At Cagayan de Oro, the project will require dredging to be carried
out alongside the quay to increase the depth to 8.5 m. All of the dredged
spoil, about 215,000 m3 of coarse sand, will be pumped as fill behind the
quay structure. At General Santos, about 189,000 m3 of fine sand will be
dredged alongside the quay to reclaim the land behind the quay structure,
increasing the depth to 8.5 m, and no dredged spoil will be dumped offshore.
The project will not adversely affect the ecological and environmental condi-
tions at either Cagayan de Oro or General Santos.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
.,
A.   General
5.01      The project would assist in the development of Mindanao's
substantial economic potential and increase agricultural production by
reducing transport costs on capital and consumer goods shipped into Mindanao
and on substantial volumes of agricultural commodities produced in Mindanao
and shipped through the project ports for consumption in the urban areas
of Luzon.



- 15 -
5.02      The proposed project would reduce transport costs through avoidance
of substantially increased ship waiting time and through increased cargo-
handling productivity. In addition, at General Santos, the proposed project
would permit abandonment of a high-cost lighterage operation.
5.03      The proposed project would complement projects, financed by ADB,
for the improvement of the highway between Iligan and Butuan (which passes
through Cagayan de Oro), and that between Cotabato and General Santos.
Improvement of this latter road, together with the proposed project, will
reduce the costs of marketing agricultural commodities produced in the
province of South Cotabato and will thereby complement ADB- and Government-
financed irrigation projects in that province. A planned highway will sub-
stantially shorten the distance between Cagayan de Oro and Davao, and is
expected to make highway transport between the two cheaper than transport
around the coast by ship, thus promoting the flow of domestic cargo through
the port of Cagayan de Oro.
B.   Traffic Forecasts
5.04      Traffic records at both project ports are incomplete and unreliable,
and therefore the consultants for the project developed a basis for traffic
projections by collecting data from ships manifests, bills of lading, and
from information supplied by shipping companies and principal shippers. In
general, these data provide an adequate basis for traffic projections al-
though, in the case of General Santos, data were only available for the year
1971, and inward cargo flows may have been underestimated because of the
incompleteness of the records. The consultants' projections were modified
as a result of detailed review by the Bank.
5.05      Growth rates used to project individual commodities and groups of
commodities were related to estimated regional growth rates of population and
income, supplemented by regional surplus and deficit analyses and by local
information.
5.06      Regional income was estimated for the Philippines for 1968-70,
broken down by province and by sector, based on estimates of the Unit Value
Added for agriculture and mining and the Net Value Added for all other
sectors. These were used to estimate income growth in Bukidnon and South
Cotabato in the period to 1985 as a basis for forecasting cargo inflows
through the project ports. Income growth over the forecast period is
estimated at 7.4% per annum in Bukidnon, and at 8.0% in South Cotabato.
5.07      The regional income estimates for 1968-70 were also used to derive
regional consumption and production, from which regional surplus and deficit
tables were produced for each of the principal commodities. These tables
provided an estimate of total cargo outflows through Mindanao ports which
were allocated by port, on the basis of minimum transport costs, to derive
forecast cargo outflows for the project ports. Care was thus taken in
developing traffic forecasts to define the boundaries between the hinter-
lands of the project ports and those of neighboring and competing ports.



- 16 -
5.08        he resalting traffic projections for the project ports, which
take acco&- o: uncertainties regarding the rate of agricultural development
and vro-vision orf pr"ivate facilities, are shown in Tables 2 and 3.  The
principa:L co.dizty at both ports is corn (including corn products) which,
in 1971, ioxmed 2G%' of total cargo through the port of Cagayan de Oro, and
25% of that through. General1 Santos.  The forecast growth of corn shipments
to 19S0 (O636  per a&,nnum at Cagayan de Oro and 7.3% per annum at General
Santos' riflec: tthe inmorttant potential in Buikidnon and South Cotabato for
increased 3prodzction of this crop and the expected, strong demand for it in
Cebu =d Manila.  The growth rate and dominant position of corn in the
traffic of Both ?orts is an important factor in the high o-verall growth rate of
5.6% at Cagaar. te Oro and 6.0% at General Santos.  The overall growth rates
do not a?pear a2acessivelly high in light of the estimates of curreent regional
income growta of- 7.4% for Bukidnon, 10.9% for South Cotabato and 7.2% for
Mindaao .
C.   Feono.uidc BEnit:',@ 8S
5.09      '.he economlic benefits of the aropcsed project are derived from
a comparison w7ith the -mst economic alternative, namely, lighterage of the
volumes of cargo ir excess of the present whiarves' annual capacity.  Diversion
of traffic to tre naarest port would be a less economic alternative than
lighterage for almost all the traffic at both ports.  To do nothing would
involve unacoeptalbly nigho cosc 4En the form of ship waiting zime wh-ch, without
the projee., 4i8 expected to rise exponentially from  1978 at both ports.  Si1ce
the prolect pvrts are used almost exclusively by i:nter-island ships of the
Phillppint  IIeet, virtually all the economic benefits would acerue to the
Philip ines.
5.10      OnQ-  shi`pfing company contineui: to use lighterage at General Santos
to load and urload its ships but plans to abandon the operation, because of
its high cost, as soon as sufficievnt wharfege is provided.  'Yhe companly uses,
as ligntters. tank-Ianddng crafz from ltk-rld War II whizh it laaus on tlne beach
near t-he down of General Santos.  Without the pres snt -proje cC  the company
would have wo replaCe the p-resent craft witthin a few years by eonventional
lighters ar.i would h,, ve to build a 14 ghterage wharL to accomuodate them.  Tne
proposed project wosld avoid these coscs.
5.11       Al ighterage operation., adequate to handllXle the forecast volumes
of cargo which could not De accomodated at c he present wharves, would
require  provision of at 'east 65 m of tighter wharf, lighters and a tug at
each port and, ina 1983, further capital expenditures of a similar nature.
Avoidance of these Investeigents would be one of the ben efits of the proposed
project.
5. _2      The doub-lle handling of lightered cargo necessitated by lighterage
involves            cost of about US$1.50 per zon.  'Tris is based on experience
with ligbitera,6Z a' General Santos, and inc}ludles the costs of loss and damage.
In addi" a. In i,',.;.te~..ae  would result in delays in ship turnaround because of
slower na' qo operatio.-..  -These delays are esti.mated at one ship-day for
every 5G0 tw,s c;  car &ered, and valued at US$500 per ship-day.  Avoid-
ance of these costs woue  ,be a furtner benef_t of the proposed project.



- 17 -
5.13      The proposed project would improve the layout of the ports, provide
more working and storage space, and better lighting and surfacing. These
improvements would result in an estimated 10% increase in the cargo-handling
productivity of the present wharves.
5.14      These benefits, which are shown by year in Table 4, have been
taken over an assumed 20-year life.
D.   Economic Return and Sensitivity Analysis
5.15      The foregoing benefits yield a return of 22%Z on the proposed project
at Cagayan de Oro and 29% on that at General Santos.
5.16      The scale of the proposed developments was tested for appropriate-
ness by calculating the rate of return on increments in wharf length of
160 m at Cagayan de Oro and 100 m at General Santos.  The incremental return
at Cagayan de Oro would have been unacceptably low in each of the first eight
years of the project, indicating that this increase in scale would be pre-
mature. For this reason the project at Cagayan de Oro was limited to only
160 m of wharf.
5.17      The incremental return on the last 100 m of the 300 m wharf proposed
for General Santos, 7% in the first year, becomes acceptable after only four
years. A four-year delay in this part of the project would result in implement-
ation being continuous over an eight year period. To avoid the disruption
to normal port operations which this would involve, and to avoid the double
cost of contractor mobilization, the proposed project would provide a full
300 m of wharf.
5.18      The economic returns were tested for sensitivity to changes in the
values of key variables and, within a feasible range, were found to be sen-
sitive only to variation in the traffic forecasts. The return on the project
at Cagayan de Oro is particularly sensitive to the expected level of traffic.
However, even if the growth rate is halved, to 3% per annum (equivalent to a
40% reduction in benefits), the project remains viable, with a 13% return.
A 3% growth rate at General Santos results in a return of 22%. The returns
are not sensitive to variation in the capital costs because the proposed
project and its alternative would be equally affected. These tests confirm
that the project is economically justified.
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Past Earnings
6.01      As previously stated, no separate records are kept of the income
arising from each port of entry, private piers or loading point in the
Customs Districts. However, the contributions of the Cagayan de Oro and
General Santos Districts as a whole to the Port Works Fund during the past
four years were:

1972                      834               755
The 1972 collection for each district was approximately 1.5% of the total
Port Works Fund.
6.02      The consultants have reasonably estimated that in 1972 about
Ps 125,000 p.a. and Ps 50,000 p.a. in port charges were collected at the
public ports at Cagayan de Oro and General Santos respectively representing
15% and 7% of Port Works Fund contributions in these districts. The remain-
ing income was generated at the private piers and the loading areas.
6.03      Similarly past expenditure relating solely to the public ports
cannot be identified. General Fund expenditures for the entire Collection
Districts over the past four years were:
(Ps '000)
Cagayan de Oro   General Santos
1969                      195               120
1970                      200               122
1971                      191               125
1972                      198               174
Further expenditures in respect of routine maintenance and major repairs,
provided from the Port Works Fund, for the past four years were:

1972            12,000       8,000          -           6,500
B.  Future Earnings and Financial Oblectives
6.04      The financial forecasts which are shown in Tables 5 and 6 have
been prepared in order to provide some indication of the probable situation
at the project ports, given the fragmentary nature of the available data
and the assumptions hereinafter stated. Financial viability at these ports
is entirely dependent on the development of domestic traffic and the applica-
tion of appropriate charges thereon.



- 19 -
6.05      Revenues are based on traffic forecasts prepared by the consultants
and revised by the Bank and on the new level of charges introduced by
Presidential Decree in November 1972. In conformity with paragraph 3.13 it
has also been assumed that wharfage dues will be levied on domestic cargoes
at Ps 1.00 per ton in 1974, rising by Ps 1.00 p.a. to Ps 6.00 in 1979.
6.06      Forecast expenditures provide for (i) salaries and wages of the
staff required for the recommended Port Management Units; (ii) maintenance
and repairs on existing and new installations based on a percentage of the
new cost or replacement value of the port's assets; (iii) proportion of
Bureau of Customs and Bureau of Public Works overheads; (iv) depreciation
of new assets based on a twenty-year life except for fenders for which a
ten-year life has been taken; (v) interest on the proposed loan at 7-1/4%
repayable over 25 years with a four-year period of grace. It has been
assumed that local counterpart funds will be provided from the Port Works
Fund or General Fund.
6.07      Forecast operating results for the years 1974 to 1980 (Tables 5 and 6)
are summarized below:
(Ps '000)

1977       846.3      836.0        10.3         943.8     913.0        30.8
1978       453.0   1,015.0       (562.0)        613.8   1,107.0      (483.2)
1979     1,017.2   1,009.0          8.2       1,340.1   1,102.0       238.1
1980     1,133.0      988.0       145.0       1,520.4   1,078.0       442.4
6.08      Forecast operating ratios, interest and debt service coverages and
rates of return for the years 1974 to 1980 for the project ports are shown
in Tables 5 and 6 and are given below for 1977 and 1980:
Operating Interest Debt Service
Port              Year    Ratio    Coverage    Coverage
Cagayan de Oro       1977       59        1.0          2.0
1980      67         1.1          2.1
General Santos       1977       56         1.0         2.2
1980      59         1.4          2.3



- 20 -
6.09      The forecast operating ratios shown in paragraph 6.07 are satisfactory
and reflect the capital intensive nature of the ports which only provide and
maintain the wharves and sheds and do not carry out cargo-handling and
stevedoring operations.
6.10      The other ratios are satisfactory despite the failure at both ports
to earn all the interest payments in 1978, but this is acceptable since debt
service coverage is adequate. During 1974 to 1980, internally generated
cash would cover 19% of the capital investment; the Bank loan would cover
45% and the Government funds, 36%.
6.11      Since financial objectives for individual ports will be determined
when PPA becomes operational in January 1976, no specific recommendation as
to rates of return at the project ports has been made. It has, however, been
agreed that PPA will introduce a cost-based tariff and earn an adequate return
on its net fixed assets.
C.   Auditing and Insurance
6.12      During negotiations the Government agreed that the accounts and
financial statements of the PPA when established would be audited annually
by auditors acceptable to the Bank.
6.13      It was also agreed during negotiations that the Port Authority would
provide adequate insurance in accordance with sound port practice, and in a
manner acceptable to the Bank.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment on the following principal points:
(a)  strengthening of the Port Programming and Planning Branch
of BPW (para 2.18);
(b)  a Philippine Ports Authority to be established by
appropriate legislative action and a detailed Plan
of Action to be carried out (para 3.06);
(c)  introduction of wharfage charge on domestic  cargoes
(para 3.13);
(d)  PPA, when established, to assume an equivalent debt
to the Government (para 3.14);
(e)  auditors to be appointed for PPA (para 6.12).



- 21 -
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan to the Government
of US$6.1 million equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a four-year
grace period.

PHILIPPINES
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND PORT PROJECT
Description of Existing Port Facilities
A.   Cagayan de Oro
Location
1.        The port of Cagayan de Oro is situated centrally along the north
coast of Mindanao in Macajalar Bay (Map 10348). The bay faces northwest and
is protected to the east by a stretch of coast running almost due north for
nearly 30 km. It is very deep, reaching 1,000 m depth at its entrance, and
the sea bed off the port shelves steeply.
2.        The port is located on the east side of a headland known as
Macabalan Point (Map 10349) which lies immediately to the east of the mouth
of the Cagayan River. The city of Cagayan de Oro is connected with the port
by a two-lane concrete road 2 km long which crosses the principal nat.ional
highway along the coastline of Macajalar Bay. The city is the principal
town in the Province of lisamis Oriental and possesses an airport at Lumbia.
Present Port Facilities
3.        The port consists of an alongside wharf of reinforced concrete
open-pile construction 317.5 m long with an angled return, also used
for berthing, 49.5 m long.  Of the total 367 m, 215 m of quay is provided
with surfaced working areas immediately behind it. The depth of water at
NX1LLW alongside varies from 4 m at the south end to a maximum of over 11 m
at the north corner. But it can be economically deepened to 8.5 m without
any structural modification of the wharf to accommodate vessels of up to
10,000 dwt.
4.        The area behind the wharf has been largely reclaimed and is
enclosed by a wall and fence. The Customs Office and a warehouse are the
only substantial Government buildings in the port, but there are two
private warehouses and an office block within the fenced area of the port.
Outside this boundary there are several medium-sized warehouses.
5.        The port has no transit sheds and the open area is too narrow
to provide sufficient space for working and storage. There is no water
and electricity supply, lighting, fire-fighting or drainage.

Page 2
Present Condition of Wharf Structure
6.        The reconstruction and extension of the quay were made in five
stages up to the present length of 367 m over the past 25 years as shown
below:
Description                Length      Width      Design Load      Year Completed
(mn)       (mn)       (lb/sq ft)
Reconstruction               152         10           500                 1948
Reconstruction                26         12           300                 1956
Extension                     81         12           500                 1959
Extension                     60         12           500                 1965
Extension                     48         12           500                 1972
The structures are, in general, in reasonably good condition except some
piles and front beams which need repair. While most of the structures were
designed to BPW's standards (i.e. the superimposed load of 500 lb/sq ft
which is equivalent to the capacity required for 12-ton truck loads) 26 m
of the central portion reconstructed in 1956 has an inadequate capacity and
needs to be upgraded.
7.        The existing fenders have been quite unsatisfactory and have failed
to prevent damage to the wharf face from berthing ships. New fenders are
needed to replace these wooden-pile fenders.
B.   General Santos
Location
8.        The port of General Santos is situated at the head of Sarangani
Bay (Map 10348), roughly midway along the southern coast of Mindanao. The
city of General Santos, about 2 km northeast of the port, is the principal
town in the Province of South Cotabato and includes an airport (Map 10350).
9.        Sarangani Bay is about 33 km long from its entrance in the
Celebes Sea to its head at General Santos and at its widest is only 16 km
across.  It is aligned roughly SSW-NNE and is very deep reaching 1,700 m
at its entrance. The port is located in the northwest corner of the bay
and is well protected.
10.       The road from the cities of General Santos and Cotabato is to
be constructed and paved by the end of 1975, as far as the crossroads behind
the wharf, under the ADB-financed Cotabato-General Santos highway project.
At present, two shallow rivers have to be forded to reach the port.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Present Port Facilities
11.       The wharf is of reinforced concrete open-pile construction 241 m
long and 9 m wide, with reclaimed working area imediately behind the wharf.
Depth alongside the quay is generally 8 m and can accommodate vessels of
10,000 dwt. The sea bed is very irregular due to the presence of coral for-
mations and it drops steeply away from the quay face to a depth of 70 m.
12.       The port is of comparatively recent construction, having been
built originally as a causeway in 1954, with a reinforced concrete T head
pier and a 21 m long berthing face. Extension of the quay and reclamation
behind the quay structure was made in stages up to the present length of
241 m.
13.       At present there are seven private warehouses, four within the
port area and three on private land, and a private open storage lot. A
Government-owned small shed is currently used as a customs warehouse and
there is no transit shed available. There is no water and electricity
supply, lighting, fire-fighting or drainage. The open working area is not
surfaced.
Present Condition of Wharf Structure
14.       The existing structures are, in general, in fairly good condition,
except some beams and the wharf face which suffered damage from berthing
ships due to unsatisfactory fenders, to be replaced.
15.       Of the total length of 241 m, 114 m was constructed during 1954
to 1958 for a superimposed load of 200 lb/sq ft and the rest was completed
for a load of 300 lb/sq ft in 1970. The entire section can be economically
upgraded to BPW's standard of 500 lb/sq ft to carry 12-ton truck loads.
