SEEDS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Indonesia's present seed production system is unsatisfactory at
all stages and the institutions concerned are inadequate; as a result, seed
quality and control are poor, and the quantity produced is insufficient.
The project appraised in this report would establish a modern rice seed
industry which at full output would produce some 22,000 tons a year of high
yielding varieties. This seed would increase rice production by some 320,000
tons a year. An IDA credit of US$7.5 M is proposed.
ii.       The project is an important part of IDA's lending program for
agriculture in Indonesia and would complement three IDA credits (127, 195
and 220-IND) totalling US$38 M made to increase rice production through
rehabilitating irrigation works. Two further IDA credits (155 and 194-IND)
have been made for rehabilitation of rubber and oil palm estates and a third
has been appraised for rehabilitating tea estates.
iii.      The project comprises:
-    establishment of a National Seeds Corporation (NSC)
which would develop a mechanized and irrigated seed
farm and be responsible for production, processing
and marketing of seed;
-    creation of a 250-ha semi-autonomous Research Branch
within the framework of the Central Research
Institute of Agriculture to ensure an adequate flow of
high yielding plant varieties to support the seed
production program and to be initially responsible for
seed certification;
-    enactment of appropriate seeds legislation, and
establishment of a small Government regulatory
organization to administer the law and later to be
responsible for seed certification;
-    establishment by NSC of three seed production districts
in East and Central Java where farmers in selected
villages would produce seed on contract; and
-    development of staff and farmer training facilities.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at US$12.0 M equivalent.  The proposed
credit, amounting to 63% of total project costs, would finance only foreign
exchange costs. In order to avoid delays in project implementation, the
foreign exchange costs and 15% of local costs the of first year's expenditure



- ii -
on irrigation of the seed farm and Research Branch farm would be financed
under Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II (Credit 195-IND); subsequent
expenditures would be financed by the proposed credit. Government would
contribute the balance of local costs. Procurement of vehicles, plant and
equipment valued at about US$4.4 M would be by international competitive
bidding as would the development of the irrigation infrastructure; building
construction, including renovations, would be by local competitive bidding.
v.        Responsibility for the project would rest with the Ministry of
Agriculture. The proiect would be implemented by organizations established
for that purpose. They include the Research Branch; the National Seeds
Corporation, a wholly owned state enterprise; and the Seeds Control and
Certification Service within the Ministry of Agriculture.
vi.       The increased rice production from project seed would result in
foreign exchange savings of some US$28 M a year. The project would give
the economy an economic return of about 58% when calculated under the
conventional assumption that each year's net benefits are reinvested at
the internal return rate. When the return is calculated on the assumption
that annual returns are reinvested at a more modest compound rate of 20%,
the project's overall return falls to 41% over its 15-year life.
vii.      The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$7.5 M.



INDONESIA
SEEDS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested an IDA credit to assist
in financing a modern seeds industry. The project would initially concentrate
on producing improved rice seed in Java, forming a vital part of Government's
rice development program aimed at making Indonesia self-sufficient in rice
by 1973/74. The project was prepared by missions from the FAO/IBRD Coopera-
tive Program which visited Indonesia in 1969 and again in August/September
1970; assistance was also given by consultants from Louisiana State Univer-
sity, financed under IDA Credit 135-IND.
1.02      This appraisal report is based on the preparation reports and the
results of a mission to Indonesia in November 1970 consisting of R.J. Dewar,
J. Gregor and E. Zimmer-Vorhaus (IDA) with H.D. Bunch and D.P. Singh (con-
sultants). The Resident Staff in Indonesia assisted in preparing and
appraising the project.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Indonesia has a total land area of 1.9 M km 2, consisting of 3,000
islands, and a population of about 121 M with an annual growth rate of
2.5%. Population density per km2 on Java and Madura is 600; on the other
main islands, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Kalimantan, it varies between 15 and
45. Per capita GDP is about US$80.
2.02      Indonesia underwent a severe inflation between 1960 and 1969.  In
1968 inflation was still rising at about 85% a year but has now been brought
under control by Government's stabilization program. The limited data avail-
able on major food and cash crops and mining indicate that the national
product may have increased by about 5% annually over the last two years.
2.03      Government's development program gives highest priority to agri-
culture with particular emphasis on rice production for internal consumption;
IDA credits totalling US$38 M (Credits 127, 195 and 220-IND) have been made
to increase rice production through rehabilitation of irrigation works. To
increase agricultural exports IDA credits (155 and 194-IND) have been made
for rehabilitation of Government-owned rubber and oil palm estates and a
further project has been appraised for rehabilitation of tea estates. Two
of the irrigation credits (Rehabilitation I, 127-IND and II, 195-IND) are
now effective and Government is taking steps to meet the conditions of
effectiveness for the third (Rehabilitation III, 220-IND). More details
on the background and operation of the projects will be found in Annex 1.

B. Rice Production
2.04      Milled rice production in Indonesia totalled 10.6 M tons in 1969
from about 8.2 M ha; of this, 5.8 M tons were from about 4.3 M ha in Java.
The national average yield in 1969 was 1.3 tons milled rice/ha (1.9 tons/ha
of paddy 1/) (Annex 2). The Java grower is one of the best farmers in South
Asia; he cultivates and weeds his fields better, makes more efficient use
of organic and inorganic fertilizers and obtains higher average yields than
his counterparts in similar areas of South and Southeast Asia. Where sup-
plemental irrigation is available during the dry season, climatic conditions
permit two crops of rice a year to be grown without difficulty.
2.05      The Five-Year Development Plan (1969-1974) gives first priority
to the rice production intensification program since rice imports are a
severe foreign exchange drain. In 1969, 775,000 tons were imported to meet
domestic requirements. Annual consumption is expected to reach about 13.5
M tons by 1974, and the rice import bill will be prohibitive if domestic
production cannot be subtantially raised by that time. Government has set
a production target of 15.4 M tons of milled rice for 1973/74, but this,
representing an annual growth in paddy production of about 8%, is overly
ambitious. The Plan envisages construction of new irrigation facilities
for 830,000 ha of rice land plus rehabilitaton of existing irrigation systems
on a similar area; and an increase in rice yields in all production areas
through better husbandry and wider use of fertilizer and pesticides.
2.06      The components of the Five-Year Plan affecting rice are:
establishment of stable guaranteed prices for rice and a Government-
operated rice purchasing program; provision of farm inputs through an
efficient distribution system; provision of seasonal credit to farmers;
improvement of research programs; establishment of a seed multiplication
program for high yielding rice varieties; improvement of agricultural ex-
tension services; and rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of irrigation,
transport, processing and storage facilities.
2.07      The first year of Plan implementation, 1969, indicates that the
price stabilization program is establishing confidence among farmers and
proving an incentive for increased production. However, other aspects have
been unsatisfactory, and changes have been introduced:  rehabilitating
existing irrigation facilities and completing ongoing irrigation projects
is more emphasized than new works; the area where farm input and credit
facilities are provided will be reduced from 1.4 M to 1.1 M ha and farmers
will be permitted a choice in the size and composition of farm input
packages; and special attention will be given to expanding and improving
distribution, milling, storage and transport facilities.

C. BIMAS and INMAS
2.08      Farm inputs and credit are provided under Government's BIMAS 1/
programs (Annex 3) which offer groups of farmers in selected areas a
package of inputs on credit under mutual guarantee arrangements. The
INMAS 2/ program is a follow-up of BIMAS with a similar package but with-
out credit. The BIMAS programs, while beset by many problems, have had a
substantial impact on rice production since their introduction in 1963 and
in Java average yields in BIMAS areas were 2.5 tons paddy/ha in 1969 against
1.9 tons paddy/ha country average. Problems of the BIMAS GOTONG ROYONG
program, have been: high foreign exchange costs; poor distribution of inputs;
farmer dissatisfaction with collective credit responsibility; and inefficient
credit recovery. BIMAS GOTONG ROYONG was discontinued in 1970 and a new
improved program, BIMAS NASIONAL, introduced. Under this, farmers obtain
credit from the Bank Rakjat Indonesia (Rural State Bank or BRI) to purchase
inputs from distributors. The current interest rate is 1% per month. The
civil service and local administration are excluded from both credit and
distribution, although agricultural extension in BIMAS areas remains the
responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. The new arrangements appear
to be a significant improvement, although their effectiveness cannot be
fully determined before a complete analysis of 1970 results.
D. The Seeds Industry
2.09      Overall responsibility for seed multiplication and distribution
rests with the Ministry of Agriculture, with executive responsibility dele-
gated through the Directorate of Production and Development to the Provincial
Agricultural Services. The Central Research Institute of Agriculture (CRIA),
an autonomous institute under the Ministry, with its headquarters at Bogor,
is responsible for rice breeding and foundation 3/ seed production. CRIA
works closely with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) of the
Philippines. Foundation seed is distributed to the Provincial Agricultural
Services for producing stock seed at their 300 seed farms, and final multipli-
cation to extension seed is carried out on several thousand small private
farms; current production of extension seed is estimated to be between
10,000 and 12,000 tons/year. As described below and in Annex 5, the whole
system, from breeding to production of foundation, stock and extension seed,
1/   BINAS is the abbreviation for "Bimbingan Massal Swa Sembada Behan
Makan" -- literally "mass guidance for self-seffuciency in foods
help."

intensification".

and distribution and marketing, is generally unsatisfactory. Some rice
varieties have been released through CRIA; of these, eight are improved
varieties of local origin (not especially high yielding) and two, IR5 and
IR8, originate from IRRI. Improved varieties of maize, groundnuts and soy-
beans have also been released. The Bogor facilities are inadequate: CRIA
has a shortage of tra4ned research workers, and totally inadequate financial
provisions. Consequently, seed quality is poor. Stock seed produced on
provincial agricultural seed farms and farmer-grown extension seed are also
substandard and little better than that which farmers traditionally keep for
seed. Finally, no seeds legislation or quality control exist.
E. Forecast of Future Rice Seed Requirements
2.10      In establishing rice seed requirements by 1976, it is estimated
that 25 kg of improved seed/ha would be required as against the 35-40 kg of
unimproved seed now commonly used; that farmers in BIMAS and INMAS areas
(para 2.08) would cultivate 2.5 M ha; and that elsewhere 1.75 M ha of lowland
rice and 0.25 M ha of upland rice would be grown. Taking into account probable
seed replacement cycles of 2-1/2 years for BIMAS and INMAS areas (against a
current 3-1/2 years), 5 years for lowland areas and 7 years for upland areas,
it is estimated that by 1976, the final year of disbursement of the proposed
IDA credit, Java's seed requirements would be about 33,000 tons (project
production at that time would be about 22,000 tons; see Annex 6).
III. PROJECT AREA
A. Location and Transportation
3.01      Sukamandi Estate, the principal project area, is in West Java
115 km east of Djakarta on the main coast road. The estate is 15 m above
sea level and covers 4,565 ha. The production districts (Annex 7) are at
Klaten in Central Java, 32 km east of Jogjakarta; Batang, in the north of
Central Java 73 km west of Semarang; and at KepandJen near the coast, 16
km south of Malang in East Java.  All areas have good road and rail com-
munications (Map 1).
B. Climate and Soils
3.02      Climatic and soil conditions at Sukamandi and in the seed districts
are suitable for rice production. Rain at Sukamandi falls from November
through April averaging 1,200 mm in the northern sector, and 1,500 mm in
the south. The dry season is from May through October when monthly rainfall
averages about 60 mm. Soils are of a fine clay texture (Annex 8).



3.03      Rainfall distribution in the seed districts is similar to Sukamandi.
Kiaten has 2,000 mm but with higher precipitation during the dry season;
soils are volcanic in origin and highly productive. Batang has 2,250 mm,
with monthly precipitation between May and October rarely dropping below 80
mm; soils are heavy alluvial clays and there is some danger of waterlogging.
Rainfall figures are not available for Kepandjen but annual precipitation
is not less than 2,000 mm; soils are dark grey alluvial clays (Annexes 7
and 8).
C. Population and Land Tenure
3.04      Population densities in the project areas are representative of
Java and individual farm holdings are small, varying in size between 0.25
and 0.50 ha.
3.05      Sukamandi Estate is Government-owned.  In the seed districts most
farms are farmer-owned under registered title. Farmers can sell their land
but such transactions are rare, occur only between members of the village
community and are subject to approval from the lurah (village head). After
registration, transactions are recorded under the 1960 Agrarian Law which
also restricts the further subdivision of farms below 2 ha.
D. Irrigation
3.06      Sukamandi lies within the Djatiluhur irrigation system supplied
from a reservoir formed by a rockfill storage dam. Gross storage capacity
is sufficient for a dependable year-round water supply for cultivating two
rice crops on about 250,000 ha. The system is being rehabilitated and ex-
tended under the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II financed by IDA Credit
195-IND. Water is supplied to Sukamandi by the East Tarum canal and
Sukamandi's water requirements have been allowed for in the design of the
rehabilitation project.
3.07      All three seed districts have adequate water supplies for irrigat-
ing two crops annually. The Klaten system is satisfactory and is supplied
by springs and small rivers; it has a total dry season flow of about 0.64
m3/sec. Batang is included in the area to be rehabilitated as part of the
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project III (IDA Credit 220-IND); restoration will
be completed before it comes into production. Kepandjen has an adequate
supply of water from a river diversion; this system is only in fair condition
and some of the lined canals require maintenance. The design capacity of
the primary canal is 13 m3/sec with a command area of 13,000 ha. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that the irrigation infrastructure
and service and feed roads for Sukamandi Estate and the seed districts would
be adequately maintained and that the rehabilitation required at Batang would
be completed before that seed district was developed.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Definition
4.01      The project would be the initial development phase of a modern seed
industry in Indonesia, and under the project certified rice seed sufficient
to meet the major portion of Java's requirements together with small
quantities of maize and soybean seed would be produced. Rice seed produced
by the new seed stream would gradually replace seed produced under the
present unsatisfactory system; during negotiations assurances were obtained
that existing Government seed production would be curtailed in step with
increases in project production. The project comprises:
-    establishment of a National Seeds Corporation (NSC) as an
autonomous body responsible to Government through the
Minister of Agriculture, for seed production, processing,
packaging and marketing of commercial seed, assisted by
managing agents;
-    development of part of Sukamandi Estate as a mechanized
and irrigated seed production farm to be operated by
NSC;
-    establishment of NSC facilities in three seed districts
in East and Central Java for collecting and processing
seed produced by farmers in selected villages under
contract to NSC, and the provision of credit facilities
to such farmers;
-    creation of a 250-ha semi-autonomous Research Branch of CRIA
at Sukamandi to ensure a flow of high yielding plant varieties
to support the seed production program and initially to
provide a seed certification service; to carry out these
functions qualified and experienced staff would be employed;
-    enactment of appropriate seeds legislation, and establishment
of a small Government regulatory organization to administer
the law and to provide a permanent seed certification service;
and
-    development of facilities at Sukamandi by NSC and the
CRIA, Sukamandi Branch for training their staff, government
extension staff and farmers.
The Minister of Agriculture, advised by the National Seeds Board (para 6.02)
would have overall responsibility for the project and agencies of his
Ministry for its implementation; for further details on organization see
Chapter VI and Chart 1.



B. Development of the Project
4.02      General.  Sukamandi Estate, once privately owned, was taken over
by Government in 1957 and some 1,500 families of previous estate workers were
allowed to reside on the estate. Satisfactory development of the estate is
impossible while the settlers remain. A recent Government survey shows
that 860 families now remain at Sukamandi, and Government is confident that
these can be resettled. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
resettlement, in areas to be excised from the estate, would be completed by
the end of 1972.
4.03      The agencies administering the estate before the formation of NSC
(P.T. Sukamandi and Lembaga Sang Hjang Seri) incurred large debts amounting
to some Rp 48.6 M (US$128,000 equivalent). They also accumulated consider-
able assets, consisting principally of the right to use the Sukamandi land,
buildings,machinery, plant, equipment, vehicles and alimst new agricultural
machinery supplied by USAID under a loan to Government. No exact records
of values exist but a conservative estimate, excluding the right to use land
in Sukamandi, is around Rp 500 M (US$1.3 M equivalent). Government intends
to liquidate P.T. Sukamandi and Lembaga Sang Hjang Seri, and assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the unencumbered assets would be
transferred to NSC, as Government equity, on the basis of values established
as at an agreed date by a valuation committee, formed by the Ministers of
Finance and Agriculture, the findings of which would be subject to IDA's
approval. Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that NSC would
be given the right to use the Sukamandi land for at least the duration of
the proposed IDA credit.
4.04      Phasing.  Development of Sukamandi, construction of processing
facilities and seed production on the estate and in the seed districts would
be phased as follows:

4.05      Sukamandi Farm Development.  The Djatiluhur Authority, responsible
for planning and implementing the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II (Credit
195-IND; para 3.06), and its consultants are preparing the design and tender
documents for the irrigation at Sukamandi. To enable farming operations to
commence in 1971/72 at Sukamandi (on the seed farm and the CRIA, Sukamandi
Branch), expenses of up to US$377,000 for irrigating about 750 ha in the first
year of the project would be financed under Credit 195-IND. All further
irrigation infrastructure would be financed by the proposed credit. All
construction would be supervised by the Djatiluhur Authority.  During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the irrigation infrastructure
for the first 750 ha would be completed during season 1971/72.
4.06      The estate lands would be used as follows:
Plant Breeding Station and future research program         250 ha
NSC for seed production                                  2,450 ha
Rental farms (administered by NSC) until required
for seed production or other government purposes         800 ha
Roads, buildings, canals, etc.                           1,050 ha
Total 4,550 ha



-9-
4.07      Only the seed production and research areas would be levelled
and prepared for mechanical cultivation. Seed production and double-
cropping require speed in harvesting and cultivation; for this reason,
the estate would be mechanized with tractors both wheeled and track, harrows,
ploughs, cultivators, rollers, land levellers, and combine harvesters
(Annex 9 and Map 2).
4.08      Seed Districts.  Klaten, Batang and Kepandjen seed districts would
have 2,000 ha of irrigated land available for seed production. Seed would
be grown by groups of 20 or more farmers, under contract to NSC, and
cultivating blocks of not less than 10 ha. Klaten would be opened in
1972/73, followed two years later, if successful, by Kepandjen, and by
Batang in 1975/76; this phasing will permit adjustments to the program if
necessary (Annexes 7 and 8).
4.09      Seed Processing.  Seed processing (Annex 10) would be the
responsibility of NSC which would establish one large plant at Sukamandi
(3 units), with smaller plants in the seed districts. Consultants would be
engaged to prepare the final design for the processing plants, and to assist
in preparing tender documents.
4.10      CRIA, Sukamandi Branch.  Existing facilities for research at CRIA
are inadequate for the project. A Research Branch (a branch of CRIA) would
be established at Sukamandi.  The Branch would closely cooperate with other
research organizations and technical assistance programs (IRRI, the Ford
Foundation, Dutch, Japanese and USAID); be responsible for the flow of high
yielding varieties of rice and other crops; undertake seed certification
until the Seeds Control and Certification Service was established (para 4.11);
and conduct specialized training courses for staff employed by organizations
engaged in seed production. It would be provided with qualified and
experienced staff, adequate land, buildings, laboratories and staff houses
(para 6.09 and Annex 11).
4.11      Seeds Control and Certification Service. Seeds legislation has
been prepared. The legislation would establish standards for seed purity
and certification and would be administered by the Seeds Control and Certi-
fication Service which would form part of the Directorate of Agricultural
Production of the Ministry of Agriculture. From 1975 all project seed would
be certified at three laboratories to be established in West, Central and
East Java. Further details of legislation, quality standards and system of
certification are in Annex 4. It would be a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed IDA credit that the new legislation had been promulgated.
4.12      Marketing and Distribution of Seed.  No organized system of seed
marketing exists in Indonesia and seed is usually sold as part of the BIMAS
package or in private transactions. Seed grown under the project would be
marketed and distributed by NSC's Directorate of Commercial Services.
4.13      NSC's Chief of Commercial Services, a marketing specialist and a
member of the managing agents team (paras 4.01 and 6.05) would be responsible
for establishing and supervising the marketing organization. It would



- 10 -
consist of sections dealing with sales promotion, order and dispatch, and
sales representation (Chart 2). In addition, the project provides for a
marketing and distribution consultancy (Annex 12) which would give special
attention to seed pricing policy; marketing studies (direct marketing, through
retailers or through government and semi-government distributors); demand
projections; and seed sales promotion measures. During negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained that the study would be undertaken by consultants approved
by IDA and under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Cost Estimates
5.01      The total cost of the proposed project would be Rp 4,521 million
(US$12.0 M equivalent). Detailed estimates are given in Annex 13
and are summarized below. The costs of the processing plants and other
expenditures related to the development of the seed industry are based on
experience with similar operations elsewhere, and the costs of irrigation
infrastructure on information obtained in appraisal of the Second Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 195-IND). Contingencies.included in estimates
consist of:
physical - 5% per annum (irrigation infrastructure 15%)
to cover unforeseen items;
price    - 5% in the first year rising by 5% each year
to 25% in year 5 to cover cost increases
(local and import) in goods and labor.

B. Proposed Financin
5.02      It is proposed to make an IDA credit of US$7.5 M to Govern-
ment to finance the foreign exchange costs of the project less the foreign
exchange costs financed by Credit 195-IND (US$268,000) (para 4.05). The
proposed credit woL!d amount to 63% of total project costs.  Total IDA
contributions, including that from Credit 195-IND of US$377,000 (US$268,000
foreign exchange and US$109,000 local cost), would amount to US$7.9 M or
66% of total project costs.  The balance of total project costs, US$4.1 M,
would be provided by Government.

/1   For detailed breakdown, see Annex 14, Table 1.
5.03      Of the proposed IDA credit of US$7.5 M, NSC would receive
US$4.3 M as Government equity subscription and US$1.7 M by way of technical
assistance. Government's own contribution to NSC would amount to US$2.6 M
equivalent, also in equity, and US$0.2 M equivalent towards technical assis-
tance. The total NSC equity would therefore be about US$6.9 M, increased
by the value of the Lembaga Sang Hjang Seri assets (para 4.03) to be trans-
ferred to it. It is proposed that all funds be passed on as equity because
of the uncertainties inherent in establishing an entirely new industry, and



- 13
because NSC would be able to service only a small proportion of its capital
at the standard Indonesian interest of 1% per month and with repayment over
15-20 years. The project assumptions are reflected in the NSC Cash Flow
Statement at Annex 15, Table 1 which indicates that any significant interest
payments would amount to a partial consumption of funds required as working
capital, thus probably forcing NSC to obtain short-term-financing. Any
debt service or payment of dividends would have to be subordinated to NSC's
liquidity requirements, particularly for replacements and renewals, as well
as its need to cover operating costs; assurances to this effect were obtained
during negotiations.
5.04      Financial requirements of the CRIA, Sukamandi Branch and the
Seeds Control and Certification Service total US$2.7 M. The balance of the
proposed credit, US$1.5 M, would be provided for this purpose by Government
together with government budgetary allocations totalling US$1.2 M and a
small contribution from Credit 195-IND.
5.05      The Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Credit 195-IND covers the
foreign exchange requirements (33%) and about 17% of local costs. Details
of the expenditure to be financed by Credit 195-IND are shown in the
summary of project financing in paragraph 5.02 and Annex 14, Table 1.
C. Procurement and Contracts
5.06      All vehicles, farm equipment, seed processing plants and research
equipment, valued at Rp 1,680 M (US$4.4 M equivalent), required by NSC, the
CRIA, Sukamandi Branch and the Seeds Control and Certification Service would
be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding according to
IDA procedures; contracts for construction of the irrigation infrastructure
at Sukamandi would conform to the conditions of procurement under Credit
195-IND which provides for bids to be advertised according to normal IDA
procedures and open to international competition; contracts for new buildings
and the renovation of existing buildings costing Rp 250 M (US$660,000 equi-
valent) would be procured through local advertisement and would be subject
to IDA approval; this arrangement, involving contracts ranging from Rp 5 M
to Rp 120 M (US$317,000), is considered appropriate in view of the diversity
and small size of the contracts, and an assurance was obtained accordingly
during negotiations. A margin of preference of 15%, or the actual tariff
duty whichever is less, would be granted to local manufacturers.
D. Disbursement
5.07      Disbursement from the proposed credit (Annex 14, Table 2) would
be made against:

-    CIF documents for equipment and machinery or, in
case of locally produced or assembled goods, the

ment; CRTA. Sukamandi Branch; and                       3.1
-    Foreign exchange costs of contracts for technical
assistance and scholarships                            3.0

5.08      It is recommended that any surplus funds remaining in the credit
account be cancelled.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
6.01      The relationship of the project organization to the Ministry of
Agriculture is shown in Chart I; the function of the Ministry and the pro-
vision of extension services are described in Annex 3.
B. National Seeds Board (NSB)
6.02      The Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for the project;
the Minister would be advised by a National Seeds Board (NSB), established
by presidential decree, whose chairman is the Director General of Agriculture.
Other Board members are the representatives of the Ministry of Home Affairs,
the Ministry of Trade, the Central Bank, Bappenas 1/, BIMAS and the Cooperative
Center; the Director of CRIA; the Head CRIA, Sukamandi Branch; the President
Director of NSC; Section Head of the Seeds Control and Certification Service;
and a representative of private industry. NSB would be concerned with
planning and formulating policies for phased development and operation of
a national seed industry. It would advise on seed legislation, importation,
varietal releases, pricing and private enterprise involvement.
1/   The Government National Planning Council.



- 15 -
C. National Seeds Corporation (NSC)
6.03      The project's commercial activities would be conducted by NSC
with headquarters in Sukamandi. NSC would be established by Government
regulation as a wholly owned state enterprise or PERUM, and would operate
within the general legal framework of Law No. 19 of 1960 (see Annex 12).
An alternative could be to establish NSC as a PERSERO, a state enterprise
operating under the commercial code. This would permit private equity
investment in NSC. As discussed in paragraph 7.03, however, NSC would be
unable to pay significant dividends until farmers can be induced to pay
higher prices for rice seeds than at present. Consequently, while a switch
to the PERSERO form of organization may be possible in future, and, if con-
ditions permit, would be desirable, PERUM status is considered more appro-
priate at the outset of the project. NSC activities would include:
-    management of seed production on 2,450 ha at Sukamandi
Seed Farm;
-    management of seed production in three seed districts;
-    installation and operation of seed processing plants at
Sukamandi and in the three seed districts;
-    storing, marketing and distributing of certified seed produced
-t both Sukamandi and in the seed districts;
-    training personnel to meet NSC's staffing requirements; and
-    administration of subsidiary operations at Sukamandi including
rental farms totalling 800 ha, a rice mill, an existing ice
factory and related utility services.
6.04      NSC has been established by Government regulation and would be
headed by a President Director assisted by three Directors appointed by
Government (Chart 2).   Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the appointment of the Directors would be subject to prior consultation with
IDA. The Directorates would be responsible for: production and processing;
finance and administration; and commercial services.
6.05      Because of the lack of experience in Indonesia of the type of
activities that would be the responsibility of NSC, agents would be engaged
to assist in managing NSC for a period of five years under the policy
direction of the NSC board. The agents would employ qualified and experienced
staff, expatriate if necessary,to fill the positions of: Senior Consultant
and Adviser to the President Director; Chief of Farm Operations, Sukamandi;
Assistant Chief of Farm Operations (Mechanization), Sukamandi, Chief of
Seed Processing; Chief of Commercial Services; and Chief of Finance and
Administration; all would be full time employees with executive responsibility.
Such executive responsibility is permitted under Law 19 of 1960. A highly
important function of the managing agents would be to recruit and train
counterpart personnel to take over key positions occupied by expatriates.



- 16 -
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that terms of reference for the
managing agents, the firm of agents engaged and individual employees of the
agents as well as their terms and conditions of employment would be subject
to IDA approval. It would be a condition of credit effectiveness that
managing agents for NSC approved by IDA had been appointed.
6.06      The Director;'te of Production and Processing would have three
branches: the Sukamandi Seed Farm headed by the Chief of Farm Operations;
the Sukamandi Seed Processing Plant by the Chief of Seed Processing;
and the three seed districts und2r a Chief Manager. The Chief of Farm
Operations, Sukamandi, would be supported by an assistant manager special-
ized in mechanized farming, and six superintendents, two with functional
responsibilities (irrigation and workshops) and the remainder in charge
of field operations. The Chief of Seed Processing, assisted by two
superintendents, would be responsible for seed processing and storage
at Sukamandi. The Chief Manager, Seed Districts, would run the seed
districts through a manager for each, supported by two extension officers
seconded from the Provincial Agricultural Service, and processing plant
technicians and clerical staff; Kepandjen, being twice as large as Klaten
and Batang, would have a proportionally larger staff. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that IDA would be consulted before the Chief
Manager, Seed Districts, was appointed. The seed district managers would
also make contractual arrangements with village farm groups for production
of seed. Seed contracts would specify area to be cultivated, variety to
be grown, planting date, basis of payment and any special treatment consi-
dered necessary. Roguing of seed farms would be supervised by the manager
and his staff.
6.07      Seed district extension staff would receive special training at
Sukamandi and their salaries would be paid by NSC. Production in each
district and selection of farmers would be coordinated by means of an
advisory group comprising: the Bupati (the administrative head of the
Kabupaten, or Regency); the Provincial Inspector of Agriculture, or his
representative; the lurahs (village heads) associated with the program;
and the senior seed district extension officer. Subcommittees would be
established at village level and would include kontak (master) farmers, lurahs
and local extension staff.
6.08      The Directorate of Finance and Administration would provide
administrative and accounting services and manage non-farming activities
within NSC. The Chief of Finance and Administration would establish
administrative, accounting, stores and other proceeares.  The Directorate
of Commerical Services would be primarily responsible for seed marketing
and the Chief of Commercial Services would be supported by sales staff;
his initial responsibility would be to establish the marketing system
which would be the subject of the consultant's study (para 4.13 and
Annex 12).

D. CRIA, Sukamandi Branch
6.09      CRIA is responsible for the existing plant breeding program.  The
program operates under severe constraints including: soils atypical of the
rice growing areas of Java; old and poorly equipped facilities; inadequate
staff salary levels and conditions of service; and a totally inadequate
budget. CRIA could not provide the efficient plant breeding and research
services essential for the project and consequently a new Research Branch
of CRIA has been established at Sukamandi. It operates under the general
direction of a management board comprising the Director of CRIA as
Chairman, a representative of the Director General of Agriculture, the
President Director of NSC, the Head of CRIA, Sukamandi Branch, and the
Section Head of the Seeds Control and Certification Service. It also has
a technical committee to advise on all technical matters related to the
research program.  The members of this committee are:  the Director General
of Agriculture, Chairman; the Director of CRIA; representatives of
agricultural universities in Indonesia; the Head of CRIA, Sukamandi Branch;
representatives of Indonesian and other foreign research agencies including
IRRI; and other agricultural scientists as may be considered necessary.
(Annex 11) Under the present civil administration it is difficult to get
satisfactory results from staff employees at existing salary levels and
terms of service; salaries are inadequate and civil servants are required
to engage in other activities to support their families. Therefore the
Branch would be self-accounting and responsible for its own budget and
staff recruitment. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that staff
employed by the Research Branch and other project organizations would be
paid reasonable salaries which, together with other allowances and fringe
benefits, would be attractive enough to enable recruitment and retention
of skill of the required calibre. The levels to be agreed with IDA.
6.10      The project would provide for seven qualified and experienced
specialists: three plant breeders, one each for rice, maize and soybean;
one seed production agronomist; one plant pathologist; one entomologist;
and one seed certification specialist. It is unlikely that local staff
with the requisite qualifications would be available to fill all these
posts and some expatriate recruitment is anticipated. The Head of the
Research Branch would be an Indonesian scientist and a person of long
experience and considerable ability would be recruited. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that appointment of the Head would be subject
to consultation with IDA and that the specialists would be acceptable to
IDA. Counterpart staff would be employed together with technical officers
and student trainees. The project provides for training fellowships,
station buildings, laboratories, and staff housing. The certification
specialist would, until 1975, work in the Research Branch and be responsible
for certification of seed produced by NSC. On the construction of facili-
ties for the Seeds Control and Certification Service he would transfer to
that organization (Para 6.11 and Annex 4). The Research Branch would
look towards IRRI for technical assistance, help with recruitment of staff
for the Branch and the continued supply of high yielding varieties of
rice seed for testing and ultimate release. Continuation of the present
association between research organizations in Indonesia and IRRI is
important.



- 18 -
E. The Seeds Control and Certification Service
6.11      A Seeds Control and Certification Service has been established by
Decree of the Minister of Agriculture within the Directorate of Agricultural
Production and Development (Chart 1). This Service would be concerned with
maintaining quality standards and seed certification for seed and planting
material sold in Indonesia; it would deal only with rice seed initially
but later with maize, soybean and other seeds.
6.12      The Service would be headed by a Section Head with three senior
inspectors and fifteen seed certification officers, and would have its
headquarters in Djakarta; the seed certification laboratories, one each in
West, Central and East Java, would be operational in 1975 (prior to this
date seed certification would be carried out by CRIA, Sukamandi Branch;
para 6.10). Before appointment, staff would be trained at the Research
Branch.
F. Consultants
6.13      Arrangements for the following consultancies would be made during
project development:
-    the Djatiluhur Authority (responsible for the implementation
of the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II, Credit 195-IND)
and their consultants would be engaged by Government in 1971
to prepare the design and tender documents, award contracts and
supervise construction of the irrigation infrastructure for
Sukamandi Estate (para 4.05);
-    a specialist to assist with the preparation of seeds legislation
would be employed by Government in 1971 (para 4.11);
-    a consultant to plan, design and supervise construction of
the Plant Breeding Station, housing and other buildings in
Sukamandi;
-    a consultant to prepare the detailed design for the seed
processing plants, related tender documents, and to supervise
construction would be engaged by NSC (para 4.09); and
-    a consultant to conduct a survey of the marketing and
distribution system for certified seeds would be engaged
by NSC (para 4.13).
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the consultants engaged
and their terms of reference would be subject to IDA's approval.



- 19 -
G. Credit, Supply of Inputs,
and Seed Farmers' Marketing Arrangements
6.14      Credit to seed district farmers would be provided from BIMAS
(para 2.08), or a similar credit program, and would include larger quanti-
ties of rodenticides, insecticides, and allowance for labor than in the
standard BIMAS package. The cost of the seed farmer package would
be Rp 21,000/ha (US$56) as against the standard Rp 14,000/ha (US$35)
(Annex 7). Under BIMAS GOTONG ROYONG collective recovery of credit for
farm inputs (averaging 50-60%) was particularly poor. With the introduc-
tion of BIMAS NASIONAL, involving a network of village units including
BRI branches, retail kiosks for farm inputs and better qualified extension
staff, credit recovery has improved. BRI facilities would be available
in all seed districts, and the Seed District Manager would be responsible
for preparing estimates of farm inputs needed by seed growers. At full
production total annual credit requirements would be Rp 40 M (US$ 106,000).
Farmers would purchase inputs from the kiosks against credit slips provided
by BRI. They would sell their wet stalk paddy to NSC at roadside, and
receive as first payment a price equivalent to the local consumption price
for wet stalk paddy; NSC would assist with the recovery of outstanding
amounts owed by farmers to BRI. After quality and purity have been
confirmed farmers would receive bonus payments of 25%. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that credit requirements of seed district
farmers would be made available by Government; that NSC would assist with
the collection of outstanding amounts when crops are purchased; and that
by December 31, 1971 model contracts and agreement for seed growers would
have been prepared and submitted to IDA for approval.
H. Accounts and Audit
6.15      Since NSC would be established as a state enterprise (PERUM) under
Law 19 of 1960, its audit would be carried out by Government's Financial
Control Board and the Accountant Service. The Financial Control Board is a
body set up under Law 17 of 1965 and consists of a Chairman and four or more
members, all appointed by the President of the Republic, to whom they report
directly. It is primarily concerned with the protection of Government's
interests. The State Accountant Service is an arm of the Ministry of Finance
and normally carries out detailed audit.
6.16      The existing system, while satisfactory from Government's point
of view, would not be adequate to deal with a modern accounting system to
be established for the project (para 6.08). Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that an independent firm, acceptable to IDA, would be
appointed as NSC's auditors and that NSC's annual accounts and audit report
would be received by IDA within four months of the end of NSC's financial
year.



- 20 -
6.17      Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that CRIA,
Sukamandi Branch would maintain accounts and carry out internal audits
twice a year; and that an annual audit by an independent auditor acceptable
to IDA would be sent to IDA within four months after the closing date of
the fiscal year.
VII. SEED PRODUCTION, MARKETING, NSC AND FARMER BENEFITS
A. Seed Production
7.01      At full project development in 1978, seed crop yields and total
production are estimated as follows:
Total Production,
Cleaned and
Dry, Uncleaned Rice Seed         Certified Seed
(tons/ha)                     (tons)
Sukamandi Seed Farm                      4                        11,790
Seed Districts                          4                          9,690
Plant Breeding Station (stock
and foundation seed)                  4                            258
B. Prices of Rice and Rice Seed
7.02      The prices of extension (or "certified") seed produced under the
existing system vary throughout Java, and depend on the quality of seed
offered for sale. In some areas farmers are prepared to pay up to Rp 40/kg
for good quality seed; conversely, where seed quality is little better than
that of consumption paddy, the price approximates local paddy prices. Current
Indonesian rice prices ex mill are about Rp 36/kg (equivalent to Rp 21/kg
for paddy at mill); the retail prices after harvest in 1970 were Rp 47/kg.
Comparative price for imported coarse rice 1/ is now US$97/ton CIF Djakarta,
equivalent to Rp 37/kg. Certified rice seed produced under the project
would be of a better quality than any available in Indonesia at present, and
initial prices assumed for project-produced seed are Rp 45/kg wholesale, and
Rp 55/kg retail. The Rp 10 difference would be adequate to meet distribution
and marketing costs including an appropriate profit margin for retailers and
distributors. In 1976, following an anticipated acceptance of certified
seed due to the higher yields that would be obtained from its use, it is
assumed that it would be possible to raise wholesale and retail prices to
Rp 55/kg and Rp 65/kg respectively without a diminution in farmer demand.
1/   Between 35% and 42% brokens and similar in quality to Indonesian rice.



- 21 -
C. NSC OPerating Results
7.03      The cash flow at Annex 15, Table 1 indicates that self-generated
funds would be sufficient to service only a small loan; and as noted in
paragraph 5.03, it has been assumed that government contribution would be
made in the form of equity amounting to Rp 2,589 M (US$6.9 M equivalent).
NSC would develop an operating surplus, but after taking account of
working capital requirements (about Rp 100 M between 1972/73 and 1975/76
and Rp 330 M from 1976/77 onwards) it is unlikely to be in a position to
commence even modest dividend payments. With the passage of time farmers
should be both able and prepared to pay higher prices for rice seed; NSC
surpluses could increase due to this and the production and sale of seed
of other crops. It is not possible to predict the timing of such changes
and consequently, the cash flow does not reflect their possible impact.
In view of the substantial substitution of rice imports with project-induced
domestic production increases and related savings of foreign exchange and
local costs, Government should be prepared to accept insignificant dividend
payments from NSC during the next ten years.
D. CRIA, Sukamandi Branch Operating Results
7.04      Revenues accruing to the Research Branch would arise from
the sale of stock seed to NSC and fees from its seed certification services;
these would cover operating costs from 1976/77. During the five-year
development period (1971/72-1975/76) revenues would not be sufficient to
meet the cost of technical assistance counterpart staff, training and over-
heads; assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government would
meet these costs, estimated to be Rp 210 M (US$555,000 equivalent)
over the period 1971/72 to 1975/76.
E. Farmer Operating Results
7.05      Farmers growing a rice seed crop in seed districts are expected to
obtain 4 tons of dry paddy/ha as against 3.5 tons at present. The crop
of wet stalk paddy would be purchased by NSC at a premium of 25% over
prevailing local prices. A seed district farmer would have a net income
from one ha of about Rp 31,000 (US$87 equivalent) as compared with Rp 23,000
(US$60 equivalent) for a farmer producing consumption rice; at full devel-
opment some 8,000 farmers would be under contract to NSC (Annex 7).
F. Government Revenues
7.06      Cash revenues from the project to Government would be derived
from dividends and taxes from NSC and no significant revenues would accrue
directly to Government. It is not possible to forecast actual dividend



- 22 -
payment by NSC, but the consolidated sources and application of funds
statement in Annex 17 shows that the combined project surplus funds would
by 1985/86 accumulate to about Rp 620.6 M.  The annual project surplus
thereafter is estimated at Rp 19 M.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      Principal project benefits would be increased rice production and
related foreign exchange savings brought about by higher paddy yields and
better milling outturn through the use of project-produced rice seed. It
is estimated that when the new seed stream is in full production (1977/78),
the incremental benefits would be some 320,000 tons of rice resulting in
foreign exchange savings of US$28 M per year; yield improvements are esti-
mated to be 10% in the first season of seeding, falling to 7-1/2% during the
second and 5% in the third; these figures are considered to be conservative.
Other benefits which have not been taken into account in calculating the
economic rate of return are: seed of better quality and purity will ensure
a more homogeneous grain which could lead to an increase in milling yields
estimated to be as high as 4%; disease and pest protection for seed leading
to healthier crops; and better utilization of farm inputs. The calculation
shown in Annex 18 considers only the production benefit directly attributed
to increased yields from the new seed stream.
8.02      The project is an unusually profitable one for the economy.
Valuing the additional rice output at the US$87/ton world price forecast by
the Bank for the late 1970's, the project's economic return is estimated to
be 58%. This figure results from making the calculation under the normal
assumption that each year's net benefits are reinvested for the remainder of
the project life at the internal rate of return. Since this reinvestment
assumption is unrealistic for projects that show unusually high rates of
return, the overall return was also calculated on the assumption that annual
net benefits are reinvested, not at 58% but at 20% and, alternatively, 15%.
This reduces the overall return to 41% and 37%, respectively. The result
of using this modified but in this case more realistic method of calculating
the return is to show that the project's high profitability is real and not
arithmetic, in the sense that the high returns reflect the large and early
stream of primary benefits generated by the project and not the (purely
arithmetic) effects of compounding these primary benefits through unlikely
assumptions about the rate at which they could be reinvested. Project costs
have been defined to include not only the investment and operating costs to
be charged against the project's financing but also equipment and vehicles
purchased in 1970 for use by the project but not to be charged to it as a
financial cost. The costs also include an allowance for seed distribution
and for milling and handling. Since the operating costs include the cost of
fertilizer, which would cost the same whether farmers used project seed or
inferior seed, the benefits can be regarded as attributable to the seed
project alone.
8.03      Sensitivity tests have been applied to see how the project's
profitability would be affected if the world :-ce price should fall below



- 23 -
US$87/ton or if output from the seed-growing operations is much lower than
expected. The results show that (a) the project would still show a
rate of return of 45% even if the world price fell to US$70/ton; and (b) the
project would show a 23% return even if the Sukamandi Estate were able to
sell only half its planned output as seed (the other half being sold as con-
sumption rice) and there were zero production in the project's three seed
districts even though full investment had been made at one of them (Annex
18).
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained on the
following principal points:
(a)  irrigation infrastructure, including roads, would be
constructed or rehabilitated as required and adequately
maintained (paras 3.07 and 4.05);
(b)  existing seed production would eventually cease in areas
serviced by the new seed stream (para 4.01);
(c)  the arrangements to be made for the consultancies involving
marketing and distribution to be made of the new seed, the
design work for irrigation infrastructure and the design
of procession plants (para 6.13);
(d)  IDA would be consulted before the NSC Directors, the
Head of CRIA, Sukamandi Branch and the Chief Manager
Seed Districts were appointed (paras 6.04, 6.06,
and 6.10); and
(e)  IDA approval would be obtained before appointing managing
agents for NSC and specialist staff for CRIA, Sukamandi
Branch (paras 6.05 and 6.10).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness are that:
(a)  the new seeds legislation had been promulgated (para 4.11);
and
(b)  managing agents for NSC approved by IDA had been appointed
(para 6.05).
9.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$7.5 M.

SEEDS PROJECT
Experience Gained in the Operation of Irrigation Rehabilitation Projects
1.        The first irrigation rehabilitation project in Indonesia
(Rehab I, 127-IND) was appraised in March 1968 without the benefit of any
preparatory engineering or feasibility studies. It was recognized that
this entailed risk but it was nevertheless decided to proceed to ensure
that immediate attention would be given to high priority rehabilitation
tasks and to provide an entree for an accelerated program of lending to
Indonesia's agricultural sector.
2.        The President's Report and Recommendations drew the Executive
Director's attention to the fact that this project was not based on the
usual engineering and feasibility studies; it stated:
"I am presenting this Credit to you at this time even though
the necessary engineering study and the preparation of a
detailed plan for the execution of the project are still to
be carried out. The Government has agreed to engage consul-
tants acceptable to the Association for this purpose, and in
the meanwhile, the Government can begin ordering some of the
needed equipment and machinery on the basis of the estimates
made by the appraisal mission, and can put it to work imme-
diately on the most urgent and obvious tasks.
3.        The Ministry of Public Works and Power created a special organi-
zation -- PROSIDA -- to execute the project and consultants (Harza-USA) were
engaged and charged with responsibility for preparing detailed work programs
for project execution and also for the selection of, and preparation of
feasibility studies for, further rehabilitation projects.
4.        The project was visited by a supervision mission in March/April
1970. Heavy equipment financed under the Credit had been imported and,
after some delays due to weather and the lack of trained operators, was
mobilized, on site and ready to begin operations in the dry season.
5.        A more recent supervision mission (September-October 1970) has
reported that in spite of delays in providing budgeted funds, good progress
has been made. Machinery is being used effectively and contracts are being
awarded by competitive bidding. Training of surveyors and OEM workers
is in progress. However, progress in the construction of tertiaries by
the farmers is lagging and efficient water management has not yet been
established in those areas where secondary canals have been rehabilitated.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
6.        About half of the Credit had been disbursed by December 1, 1970.
Disbursements were about 20% less than anticipated at appraisal, mainly be-
cause the equipment and related training contracts cost less than expected.
IDA has agreed to a government request that these savings be used to pur-
chase supplementary equipment.
7.        The second irrigation rehabilitation project (Rehab II, 195-IND)
was declared effective on December 31, 1970 when the Djatiluhur Authority,
responsible for implementation, was finally constituted. The third (Rehab
III, 220-IND) was appraised in March/April 1970 and presented to the Board
in November; one of the conditions of credit effectiveness is the reten-
tion of three internationally recruited specialists and recruitment, with
IDA assistance, is in progress.

SEEDS PROJECT
Ministry of Agriculture and Government Institutions
Ministry of Agriculture
1.        The Ministry of Agriculture is in Djakarta and consists of five
technical directorates-general: agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry,
forestry and estates. Its principal secretary is the Secretary General,
supported by a public relations bureau and an administrative secretariat.
The Director General of Agriculture controls five technical divisions and
three agricultural research institutes, each headed by a Director: the
Divisions of Planning and Regional Development, Production and Promotion,
Agricultural Technology, Extension, and Agricultural Economics, and the
Central Research Institute for Agriculture, Research Institute for Horticul-
ture and Research Institute for Soils.
2.        Government's agricultural policies are implemented by 26 Provin-
cial Agricultural Services, one for each province, and each headed by an
Inspector. The number and educational standards of extension staff are
inadequate, extension coverage averaging throughout Indonesia about one
worker to 5,000 hectares; in Java there are about 6,900 extension workers,
a ratio of about one to 1,600 farmers.
BIMAS and INMAS Programs
3.        The BIMAS program dates back to 1963 when the Agricultural Col-
lege in Bogor demonstrated, on 100 ha, the significant increase in rice
yields achieved by the use of improved seeds, fertilizer, plant protection,
improved practices and proper water management. The Director General of
Agriculture was made responsible for relocating the work nationwide under
the so-called BIMAS program, basing it on a set pattern of physical inputs
per ha, extension service guidance and collective credit from the Bank Rak-
jat Indonesia (BRI) to groups of smallholders in selected areas. It was
expected that within two or three seasons farmers would have no further need
of intensive guidance and credit but would thenceforward purchase the input
package with their own resources and thus enter the INMAS program (BIMAS
without credit). The programs rapidly gained ground and by the wet season
1969/70, BItIAS had expanded to 836,000 ha and INMAS to 331,000 ha.
1/   Abbreviation of "Bimbingan Massal Swa Sembada Bahan Makanan", meaning
"massive guidance towards self-sufficiency in foodstuffs".  INMAS stands
for "Intensifikasie Massal" or massive intensification.



ANNEX 3

4.        Various modifications have been introduced.  BIMAS BARU was
introduced in 1967 and offered high yielding seed varieties. In 1969,
BIMAS GOTONG ROYONG was started and Government contracted with foreign
fertilizer suppliers, to service agreed areas with BIMAS-type packages
of inputs. In return farmers were required to deliver a sixth of their
crops to BULOG, the Government rice procurement agency which accepted the
responsibility for payment to the foreign fertilizer companies. This
program was not successful and BULOG incurred substantial losses. BIM4AS
GOTONG ROYONG has now been discontinued and for the 1970 dry season, a
credit system with direct BRI participation introduced; farmers now
contract individually with branches of BRI. The composition of the
input package is more flexible and introduces an element of choice; this
program, BIMAS NASIONAL, has been well received by farmers.
5.        In November 1969, BIMAS became the responsibility of a separate
agency established with its own policy-making board under the chairmanship
of the Minister of Agriculture. Its members are: five technical Directors
General drawn from various ministries (Agriculture, Public Works-Irrigation,
Trade, Cooperatives and Internal Affairs); Governor of the Central Bank;
representatives of BRI, the Cooperative Unions, and fertilizer manufacturing
companies (Government enterprise); and an Executive Secretary who funactions
as BIMAS' general manager. He has a functional relationship with the Inspec-
tors of the Provincial Agricultural Services through whom the implementation
of the program is organized at provincial level.
Bank Rakjat Indonesia (BRI)
6.        BRI is one of Indonesia's five state banks and its principal
objectives are to finance agriculture, fisheries and cooperatives. It
was established in 1896 and reorganized under Law 21 of 1968; it is a
large institution in terms of funds handled and people employed and its
resources are mainly loans from the Central Bank and clients' deposits,
Rp 26.6 billion and Rp 16.9 billion respectively as of December 31, 1969
(US$70.8 million and US$44.9 million equivalent). Its staff numbers about
8,200 and it has 13 regional offices, 213 branches supported by 509 mobile
units and 35 small village agencies.
7.        BRI is administered by a Board of Management which consists of a
President Director and three Directors, all full-time employees with direct
departmental responsibilities. They are assisted by a three-member Board
of Supervisors who act in an advisory capacity, with, however, direct access
to the Minister of Finance.  Members of both Boards are appointed by the
President of the Republic. During the last few years the bank has experi-
enced a period of administrative difficulty brought about by the extremes of
inflation, low caliber staff, and an outdated banking system. However, con-
solidation took place in 1969 and the cutrent position is much improved.
Records prior to 1970 are, however, unreliable. Financial restructuring of
BRI is overdue as it has virtually no capital nor reserves; its authorized
capital is Rp 300 million (US$800,000 equivalent) which is inadequate, and
t:'- zAnount actually paid up is only Rp 100,000 (about US$267).



ANNEX 3
Page 3
8.        BRI's funds are generally lent on short term.  The lending
rates of interest are prescribed by the Central Bank and the current
rates, valid from June 1, 1970 are:
Credit for the financing of any of the
nine essential goods (rice, textiles,
salted fish, palm oil, fuel oil, soap,
sugar, salt and batik)                             1% per month
Credit for export goods financing               2.25%  "
Credit for industrial production                2.50%  "
Credit for trade and commerce                 2.25-4%  "
These rates are low compared to the 1966/67 level when 6-9% per month was the
official price of money. BRI pays the Central Bank at half the scheduled
rates for their borrowings.
9.        BRI has been closely connected with BIMAS since the program's
inception and as a result of the low rate of repayments it has been carry-
ing a large amount of bad debts which, in the absence of adequate reserves,
could not be written off. However, as all the funds originated from the
Central Bank, the question of repayment of arrears has had a long history
of negotiations between the two institutions; an agreement has now been
reached and an interest is payable on amounts that cannot be collected.
10.       BRI's association with the project would be confined to its
normal credit commitments within areas included in the BIMAS program. It
would provide credit to farmers in the seed districts who produce seed on
contract for NSC. The standard credit requirements under this heading
would not be large. On the basis of Rp 20,000/ha, a seed district of
approximately 500 ha would involve about Rp 10 million (US$26,000 equiv-
alent) in lending operations. At full development, the peak credit require-
ment is unlikely to exceed Rp 40 million (US$106,000 equivalent) for the
three seed districts.
BULOG 1/
11.       BULOG is a Government procurement agency operating under Presi-
dential Decree No. 114 of 1967 and No. 11 of 1969. Its principal objectives
are to ensure availability of three categories of commodities and to
promote price stabilization within the Government's Economic Stabilization
Program. The three categories are:
-    9 basic consumer commodities (rice, sugar, salt, salted
fish, palm oil, fuel oil, soap, textiles, batik);
1/   This is a contraction of "BADAN URUSAN LOGISTIK" and means "Logistics
Bureau".



ANNEX 3
Page 4
-    rice (provision by imports, local production, warehousing
and marketing);
-    other essential foods.
12.       BULOG is headed by a Director, responsible only to the President,
and is assisted by 2 deputies; there are 4 functional divisions. The
Director is the chairman of a policy-making committee whose members include
the deputies and divison chiefs. Subject to the President's approval,
policy is implemented through 24 provincial representatives (DEBULOG).
13.       During the 1969/70 wet season a price support policy for rice was
introduced. Government announced in advance that BULOG would purchase milled
rice at an average of Rp 36/kg which would result in a price to consumers of
around Rp 50/kg. It was estimated that this would give the farmers a price
of at least Rp 13.2/kg for dry stalk paddy at harvest. This price was set
so as to provide sufficient incentive for rice farmers to use fertilizer and
other modern inputs. The result of the policy was a slight rise in current
prices, to a peak of Rp 54/kg during the first quarter of 1970 (prior to
harvest) and a post harvest decline which stabilized around Rp 47/kg.
Fertilizer Suppliers
14.       Prior to 1964 all fertilizers were imported under a monopoly held
by a Government-owned and run enterprise, "PN Pertani". In January 1964,
another Government enterprise, "PT Pupuk Sriwidijaja" (PT Pusri), commenced
manufacturing operations and has since been producing about 100,000 tons of
urea equivalent annually. In April 1970, IDA agreed, together with the
USAID, the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Japan, to finance the
expansion of PT Pusri costing the equivalent of US$84.4 million. This would
increase the total rated plant capacity to about 480,000 tons annually in
1976/77. IDA and its associate lenders will provide the equivalent of
US$68.4 million, the balance to be provided by Government. An additional
state enterprise, "Petrokimia", should commence production in 1971 and pro-
duce about 110,000 tons of urea equivalent annually from then on. Total
annual production of urea equivalent within Indonesia will then be about
600,000 tons.
15.       The results achieved by the BIMAS and INMAS programs, and
the future requirements of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs are
the subject of two ongoing studies (both sponsored by IDA). The studies
will include an examination of the effectiveness of the distribution and
marketing system for farm inputs operated by PN Pertani and PT Pusri. The
extent to which the project should rely on existing organizations for the
distribution and sale of certified seed would depend on the result of
these surveys and the seed marketing study for which provision is included
in the project.

SEEDS PROJECT
Seed Certification and Other Quality Control Measures
Seed Quality Standards
1.        The success or failure of any seed program depends on the
quality of seed produced. The farmer must be assured that the seed
he receives is genetically true to type; possesses desirable charac-
teristics, such as high-yield potential, resistance to diseases, pests and
lodging; has a short maturity period; higher nutritional value; and preferred
flavor or better cooking quality; it should be viable, be free from inert
matter, weed seeds, and other contamination; and otherwise should conform to
the minimum standards laid down for certification.
Control Measures
2.        The measures needed to regulate the quality of seed fall into
three categories:
(1) Seed Certification - a system of supervised production
of high quality seed based on rigorous field inspec-
tions and testing at all stages of production followed
by truthful labelling under the seal of the certifying
agent;
(2) Seeds Law Enforcement - inspections of seed after proces-
sing and enforcement of the Seeds Law when quality falls
below the prescribed standards;
(3) Laboratory and Field Testing - testing of seeds in the
laboratory and in the field as an aid to seed certifi-
cation or enforcement of the Seeds Law.
Seed Certification
3.   Types of Seed.  Quality seed may be classified into four types:
Breeder Seed: seed multiplied by plant breeders from
a few constantly reselected plants considered to repre-
sent the highest genetic expression of a variety;
Foundation Seed: seed produced in one generation from
breeder seed under strict supervision of scientists at
the Plant Breeding Station for further multiplication
as stock or certified seed;



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Stock (or Registered) Seed: seed produced in one genera-
tion from foundation seed, under strict supervision of
scientists on an institutional farm for further multipli-
cation as certified seed;
Certified (or Extension) Seed -: seed produced in one
generation from stock seed, under the supervision of the
seeds certification agency, for sale to farmers.
Steps in Certification
4.        Seed certification includes the following steps:
(1) control of the origin of seed to be used for multiplica-
tion by tracing the pedigree and checking the quality of
the foundation or stock seeds;
(2) sampling and laboratory testing of seed to be used for
multiplication;
(3) "pre-control growing" test of seed used for multiplica-
tion or growing the seed in the field against standard
samples to find out the genetic identity and physical
purity of the seed;
(4) field inspections of the growing seed crop at regular
intervals;
(5) taking samples of the seed crop harvested, before and
after processing;
(6) laboratory tests of the samples for physical purity,
germination capacity, moisture content, and genetic
purity;
(7)  final sealing and labelling of the seed containers;
(8) 'post control growing" tests of certified seeds.
Agency for Seed Certification
5.        The seed certification agency would be the Seeds Control and Cer-
tification Service of the Directorate of Production and Development in the
Ministry of Agriculture, with laboratories in West, Central and East Java.
Until the new Service is fully operational., in 1975, certification would be
carried out at CRIA, Sukamandi Branch where, as seed certification is sea-
1/   In this report extension seed has been used to describe seed produced
under the present system when no certification takes place; certified
seed is used in describing production from the new seed stream.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
sonal, it would be possible for the scientific staff working at the Branch to
combine research and multiplication of foundation and stock seed with certi-
fication. The National Seeds Board would act as the advisory board for seed
certification (Annex 11).
Standards for Seed Certification
6.        Standards for seed certification in Indonesia would be based
on internationally accepted standards which, for paddy, maize, and soy-
beans, would approximate to the following:

Eni-orcement of the Seeds Law
7.        Inspection of seeds after processing would also be the responsibil-
itlj of the Seeds Control and Certification Service.  Control measures would
in-olve:
-    sampling followed by laboratory and field testing of
seeds sold or offered for sale;
-    legal action by way of prosecution, stopping of sales,
or cancellation of licenses where seed does not meet
the minimum legal standards.

The Seeds Law
8.        The Seeds Law would be drafted by Government during 1971 with the
assistance of an experienced specialist provided under technical assistance
from the proposed credit. It will make provision for the following:
-    assure the availability of quality seed for growers and
prohibit misrepresentation;
-    regulate the sale, offering for sale, distribution and
transportation of agricultural, vegetable, flower and
ornamental seed, roots, tubers and other propagating
stock within Indonesia for sowing or planting;
-    prevent misrepresentation and fraud in the advertisement
and sale of seed;
-    authorize the Minister of Agriculture to sample, inspect,
analyze and test all agricultural, vegetable, flower and
ornamental seed, roots, tubers and other propagating stock
transported, sold, offered, exposed for sale or distributed
within the Nation for sowing or planting, and prescribe his
other powers and duties;
-    provide for the establishment of a Seeds Law Enforcement
Section and for laboratory facilities;
-    authorize the seizure and destruction of seed where the
owner or custodian thereof has failed to comply with the
provisions of the Seeds Law;
-    provide a method of appeal against orders issued by the
Minister of Agriculture;
-    require the registration with the Minister of Agricul-
ture of all seed dealers and the issuance of permits to
such persons;
-    authorize the M:inister of Agriculture to suspend or re-
voke permits for violation of the Law or of rules and
regulations promulgated under the Seeds Law;
-    provide for disclaimer or non-warranty clauses in in-
voices, advertising or labelling of any seed contem-
plated by the Law; and
-    provide penalties for the violation of the provision of
the Law and for the rules and regulations promulgated
under the Seeds Law.

The Development of the Indonesia Seed Industry
1.        The Indonesian five-year development plan 1969-1974 includes
the following targets for food grain production:

2.        The targets are to be achieved by providing the necessary in-
puts for improved agriculture, namely, high-yielding varieties of seeds,
fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and improved methods of husbandry.
The production of sufficient seed of high-yielding varieties (HYV) to ful-
fill farmers' requirements is one of the main components of the program.
The Present Seed Production System
3.        Since before World War II and in a more intensified fashion since
1952, an elaborate system for seeds multiplication has operated throughout
Indonesia. The system reflects awareness of the formal requirements for
seed quality control by providing for successive multiplication from breeder
seed through foundation and stock seed, to the final production of extension
seed for sale to farmers l/.
4.        The apex of the system is the Central Research Institute of Agri-
culture (CRIA). In its breeding capacity CRIA has developed, or is develop-
ing, 12 improved rice varieties and several improved varieties of maize,
groundnuts and soybeans. CRIA's responsibilities also cover the production
of sufficient breeder seed and foundation seed of approved crop varieties
to meet the requirements of the country.
5.        The growing on of foundation seed to produce stock seed is the
formal responsibility of some 285 Agricultural Extension Seed Farms. These
are scattered throughout the Indonesian provinces and are owned and directed
1/   See Annex 4 for definition of types of seed.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
by the various Provincial Agricultural Services. They are rarely larger than
7 ha and total 2,195 ha, a large part of which is reliably irrigated.
6.        The final stage of multiplication from stock seed to extension
seed, for direct sale to farmers, is the theoretical responsibility of
some thousands of "village seed farms".  These, in effect, are seed crops,
rarely more than 1 ha in extent, grown on village communal land or pri-
vate farmers' plots. Ostensibly they are supervised throughout their
growth, harvesting and processing by local officers of the Provincial
Agricultural Services.
7.        Overall, the present seeds system in Indonesia is variety rather
than quality oriented. At best, the system injects sufficient such "seed"
into the villages to allow farmers to begin multiplication on their own ac-
count. This farmers do with impressive speed because of their traditional
skills and their ability to grow two crops a year where irrigation allows.
Thus PBS5 (IR5) was first introduced into Indonesia early in September 1966,
and PB5 "seed" has now been planted over 1 M ha. How rapidly seed quality
deteriorates in these circumstances is well illustrated by the widespread
contamination which is evident in PB5 stands throughout Java.
8.        It is not possible to establish the total amount of seed produced
by the system described. Still less is it possible to establish the amounts
of each class of seed produced. From the information available it appears
that average total production, almost entirely of extension seed, is between
10,000 and 12,000 tons per year.
Deficiencies of the Present Seed Production System
9.        The present seed production system breaks down at almost every
level. The flow of foundation seed from CRIA to the Extension Seed Farms
is uncertain and inadequate, and its quality is constantly criticized.  More
particularly, relatively little stock seed passes to village seed farms and
the supervision of stock seed crops and, to an even greater extent of exten-
sion seed crops at village level, is generally insufficient to ensure qual-
ity. Even when extension officers condemn seed crops they are normally
harvested as "seed" and find ready sale if the variety is in demand.
10.       The most obvious cause of the breakdown of the system is the
lack of adequate budgeted funds from central and provincial governments.
Thus CRIA stations must help defray their running expenses by seed sales,
and this absorbs a considerable part of CRIA's time and energy. The Ex-
tension Seed Farms receive little or no budgeted finance; indeed, most
are expected to make a profit and so to contribute to provincial govern-
ment income. In the circumstances, both the CRIA stations and the Exten-
sion Seed Farms are obliged to neglect, in large part, their formal re-
sponsibilities in favor of growing extension seed for direct sale to
farmers, or to the agencies handling the various BIMAS programs.
11.       A second cause of breakdown is the inadequacy of supervision.
Some hundreds of agricultural extension officers aL the national, provin-



ANNEX 5
Page 3
cial and local district level are nominally responsible for seed-crop
supervision and seeds procurement. However, each has several other duLies,
the majority are untrained in seeds work, and almost all lack adequate
transport facilities.
12.       Modern seed processing facilities are almost nonexistent and
storage is inadequate. Seeds are sun dried, threshed by hand and cleaned
under conditions where contamination is unavoidable. The result is a
serious mixture of varieties (including inferior varieties), low germina-
tion rates and uneven grain size. A further limiting factor to the order-
ly development of a seeds industry is the absence of a seeds law and of
a national authority charged with the responsibility of administering
it.
13.       The current system of seed production is based on the premise that
extension seed should be produced as near the point of end use as possible.
This principle is inconsistent with modern seed technology. The production
of high quality seed is a skilled craft demanding intensive extension
guidance by highly trained staff, and the provision, close to production
sites, of sophisticated processing, storage, and merchandising facilities.
14.       In the light of these considerations no attempt to upgrade the
existing rice seed production system would succeed; under the project a
new seeds stream would be instituted which would initially complement and
progressively replace existing sources of seed supply.

Rice Seed Demand Projections for Java
Rice Seed Demand Projections
Estimates of the rice seed requirements for Java are based on the
following assumptions:
(a) Area
(i)  The BIMAS and INMAS areas would increase from approximately
1.1 million ha (1970) to 2.5 million ha per year by 1976.
(ii) The total annual crop area of lowland (sawah) rice would
increase from 4 million ha to 4.25 million ha by 1976.
(iii)  The area of upland (ladang) rice would remain constant at
250,000 ha.
(b)  Seed Replacement Frequency
(i)  Farmers in BIMAS and INMAS areas now purchase seed every
3.5 years (or 7 seasons). The frequency of seed purchase
would increase to once every 2.5 years (or 5 seasons) by
1976.
(ii)  Outside BIUMS and INNAS areas farmers now purchase seed
every seven years; this would increase by 1976 to once
every five years for farmers growing lowland rice and
remain at once every seven years for upland farmers.
(c) Source of Seed
(i)  50% of present production is from official and quasi-
official sources. This proportion would increase to
65% by 1975/76 and of this, all would be supplied by the
new seed stream.
(d)  Seed Rate
(i)  The seed rate for pure seed would be 25 kg/ha against
40 kg/ha under present circumstances.
With these assumptions improved seed requirements for Java in 1976 would be
about 33,000 tons; by that year project production would be about 22,000 tons
(see Table 1).

SEEDS PROJECT
Seed Districts: Organization
General
1.        In addition to direct production of seed at Sukamandi seed farm,
the annual production from the seed districts by 1977/78 (first year of
full production) would be some 10,000 tons or 45% of total project produc-
tion (see Table 1). NSC would construct and operate seed processing plants
in each district and the plants would be supplied by farmers growing seed
crops on their own account for contract sale to NSC.
2.        This system of seed production has been used on a limited scale
in the Far East and South Asia but on the whole, results have been dis-
appointing. It should be successful under Javanese conditions where the
village organization has proved to be a major factor in organizing communal
production of cash crops on contract (both sugar and tobacco). The system
requires an efficient organization; competent extension staff; modern seed
processing facilities; and well trained and disciplined farmers who are
provided with adequate production incentives. The seed districts have
been carefully selected and the project farmers are some of the most com-
petent in Indonesia; they are also familiar with the system of group
contract farming.
3.        The staff required, the processing facilities, and farmer incen-
tives are all provided. The development of the first seed district is
scheduled for 1972/73 with the second and third in 1974/75 and 1975/76
respectively; this phasing would permit the shortcomings of the system to
be resolved and amendments to the program to be introduced before the second
and third districts are opened.
Location and Size of Districts
4.        The seed districts have been selected as satisfying the follow-
ing standards:
-    freedom from flood hazard;
-    a reliable irrigation system;
-    good railroad communications; and
-    good farming standards and possibility for double cropping.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
5.        They are at:
-    Klaten in Central Java where 500 ha is available for seed
production. This will be the district to be developed in
1971/72;
-    Kepandjen in East Java with 1,000 ha available for seed
production, to be developed in 1973/74; and
-    Batang 1/ in Central Java with 500 ha available for seed
production, to be developed in 1975/76.
Fact sheets on each of these districts are at Annex 8.
Organization of Seed Districts
6.        Processing plants constructed in seed districts by NSC would
be of similar design to those described in Annex 10, and would have the
capacity to process the production of seed from the district when fully
developed. Seed District Managers would be responsible for NSC activities
and would report to the Chief Manager Seed Districts at Sukamandi (Chart 2);
the managers would have supporting staff including two extension officers,
two plant foremen and appropriate clerical staff and drivers 2/. Exten-
sion staff would be seconded from the local Provincial Agricultural Serv-
ices and would receive special training at Sukamandi before assuming their
appointments. Each district would have a fleet of vehicles including motor
bicycles, personnel vehicles, combine harvesters, tractors and a lor-ry.
7.        Farming operations in seed districts would be coordinated by a
consultative group consisting of:
-    the Bupati (administrative head of the Kabupaten or Regency);
-    the Provincial Inspector of Agriculture;
-    the lurahs (village heads) associated with the project; and
-    the senior seed district extension officer representing NSC.
Subcommittees of the advisory groups would be fo.med at village level.
These would comprise the lurah, the kontak farmer (a master farmer and
normally the leading farmer in the village) and the local extension officer.
1/   Batang is included in the area to be rehabilitated under the Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project III, IDA Credit 220-IND.
2/   Kepandjen seed district (1,000 ha) is larger than the other seed districts;
staff and other requirements have been increased proportionally.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
Methods of Production and Field Operation
8.        Since rice is a self-pollinated crop, dangers of cross pollination
are minimal; nevertheless, the possibility of mixed varieties exists and a
degree of control is essential; seed of only one variety would therefore
be grown in each block. With other seed crops cross pollination would be
a major problem, and for this reason it is unlikely that seed districts
could be used for the multiplication of maize or soybean seed.
9.        Individual farms in the seed districts vary between 0.3 and
0.5 ha, making supervision and quality control difficult. This problem has
been successfully overcome, in the case of tobacco, by making contractual
arrangements with a group of farmers; a similar system would be adopted for
seed production. The manager would draw up contracts with a group of
farmers in one village for the production of seed. The contract would
specify that the area to be farmed should be one block of not less than
10 ha (only in exceptional circumstances would smaller blocks be accepted)
and would stipulate the variety to be grown, the planting date, the basis
for payment and indicate any special treatment required.
10.       Incentives to farmers are essential and NSC would arrange for:
-    a special package of farm inputs through the BIMAS program;
-    a firm commitment in the contract to purchase at an agreed
price all seed produced subject to quality standards being
met; the price would be about 25% over the prevailing price
for wet stalk paddy 1/ in the project area;
-    technical guidance from the specially trained extension
staff.
11.       The farm input package would be supplied as part of the BIMAS or a
similar credit program; inputs per ha under the seeds project and normal
BIMAS inputs are compared below:

Credit facilities would be provided at sub-branches of BRI in the project
areas and farm inputs at kiosks constructed by distributors associated with
tne BIMAS program.
12.       Seed farmers would receive instruction in production techniques
and would harvest their crops under supervision.  Planning of the cropping
and harvesting programs would be done with the fullest participation of
farmers through their consultative groups. Harvesting would be by hand and
the wet stalk paddy would be hand-carried to roadside.
13.       Harvesting would last normally for 50 days within a period of 8-10
weeks at 10 ha/8-hour day. A total of approximately 160 man hours would be
required to carry out the harvesting and to transport the crop (in baskets)
to the combined harvesters operated by NSC at roadside (80 man hours for har-
vesting, 80 man hours for manual transport). Adequate labor exists in the
seed districts to meet harvest and transport requirements. Harvesting would
start only after the standing crop is dry (18-24% at about 9:30-10:00 in the
morning). After threshing the grain would be transported immediately to the
processing plant by NSC tractors and trailers.
Yields and Returns to Farmers
14.       Farmers would be paid on the basis of wet stalk paddy delivered
to roadside; weights would be calculated after threshing and measurement
of the moisture content. Farmers would receive a basic price equivalent
to the value of the crop as consumption rice within 24 hours of delivery
to the thresher, and the quality premium after the seed had been processed
and tested. To avoid farmer distrust the system of weighing and testing
would be demonstrated. A price calculation is given in Table 2.
15.       A pre-project farm budget for a 1-ha farm yielding 4.32 tons wet
paddy (4.0 tons dry paddy) producing consumption rice is compared below
with a similar farm producing rice seed as part of the project.

Farm size;          Average farm size is approximately 0.25 lia.
Cropping pattern;   Rice is rotated with tobacco every second dry season.
Rice yields are in thie order of 4 to 5 tons of dry
paddy with the highest yields in the dry season.
Main rice harvests are in May-June and November-
December. Tobacco is grown on a rental base contract
in blocked areas covering a large number of holdings.
At full development, the district would grow seed on
50O ha in the wet season and 250 lha in the dry season.

Soils:              Heavy alluvial clay soil with poor drainage and some
danger of waterlogging.
Roads:              Roads are generally in good condition throughout the
area and passable in all seasons, but some repair would
be necessary between Denasri Kulon and Denasri Wetan;
this could be undertaken by village labor. The plant
is located beside an asphalt highway. Road and rail
communications from the area are good.
Irrigation:         The irrigation system has deteriorated to a point where
there is no longer any control on the system. The Srugi
service area into which the Batang seed district comes is
irrigated by diverting the flow of the Kojar river at the
Medungdowo and Kramat weirs. A total of 2,900 ha could
normally be irrigated under this system which is due to
be restored under the Third Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project.
Farm size:           Average size of farm 0.5 ha
Cropping pattern:   Rice is the only crop grown on a significant scale
in the area. The cropping intensity is about 150 per-
cent per year, but can be expected to increase when
the irrigation system has been effectively rehabilitated.
Since yields are reported to be somewhat lower in Batang
than in the other seed districts (approximately 3 tons
dry paddy), the final service area of the processing plant
could be increased to approximately 600 ha in the wet
season and 300 ha in the dry season, if experience in the
first year's operation dictates this. Scope for further
expansion of the service area, should this be necessary,
exists in the neighboring Ketjamatans of Tulis and
Warungasem, as well as from a 100 ha local government
rice scheme 4 km from the plant site.

Irrigation:          Irrigation is carried out by diversion of the Bhantas
river. The diversion structure is in good condition,
except for some silting at the intake. The system is
generally in fair condition with lined canals down to
farm level but some maintenance is required on canal
structures and lining.  The design capacity of the pri-
mary canal is 13 m3/s with a command area of 13,000 ha.
Farm size:           Average size of holdings is approximately 0.5 ha.
Cropping pattern:   Rice is the predominant crop, though during the dry
season "second crops", including corn, peanuts and
some pulses, are grown on the higher areas where irri-
gation supply is less adequate. Under the project
approximately 1,000 ha would be cropped with seed in
the wet season and 500 ha in the dry season.

SEEDS PROJECT
Sukamandi Estate and its Development
A. General
1.        Topography and Climate.  Sukamandi Estate, at an elevation of
about 15 m, extends over 4,565 hectares. It is located on the main north
coast road 115 km east of Djakarta. Several water courses intersecting
the estate provide adequate natural surface drainage channels.
2.        The climate is tropical with a six-month dry season from May to
October and a wet season from November to April. The annual rainfall varies
over the estate from about 1,000 mm in the north to 1,500 mm in the south.
In the dry season the average monthly rainfall is normally less than 60 mm.
No other meteorological data exist for the estate, but for similar areas
located nearby, temperatures vary from a monthly average maximum of 330C
in September to a minimum of 230C in July and August; the mean temperature
varies between 260C and 280C. Relative humidity varies between a maximum
of 93% in February and 47% in September. No evaporation data are avail-
able.
3.        Water Resources and Requirements.  Irrigation water for the
Sukamandi Estate is supplied from the East Tarum canal, part of the
Djatiluhur irrigation system. This system is supplied from a reservoir
formed by a rockfill storage dam on the Tjitarum River with a gross
storage capacity of 3 x 109 m3 of which 2 x 109 m3 is effective storage.
This is adequate to provide a dependable, year-round water supply for
the cultivation of two rice crops on about 253,000 ha.
4.        The East Tarum canal is designed to serve about 86,000 ha which
are being rehabilitated and extended as part of the Irrigation Rehabilita-
tion Project II (Credit 195-IND). Sukamandi is included in the command
area of this system and its water requirements have been allowed for in its
design. A 5.2 m3/sec capacity secondary canal at present supplies water to
a control structure at the estate boundary capable of supplying 1.2 1/sec/ha
to 4,350 ha, i.e. the 3,500 ha cultivable on the estate and an additional
850 ha of cultivable land under command outside the estate boundaries.
The water supply is adequate for two rice crops per year.
5.        Soils.  A semi-detailed,soil survey of the estate has been carried
out by the National Soils Institute at Bogor. Five soil types have been
identified and described: alluvial; low humic gley; grey hydromorphic;
planosol; red-yellow podosolic. Profile descriptions are available as well



ANNEX 9
Page 2
as chemical and physical analyses of samples taken at different points in
the profile down to 1 m; sampling was carried out with a density of about 1
sample to 20 ha. All soils have common characteristics of a fine clayey
texture with a pH of about 5 on the surface. This generally increases below
50 cm and rises to about pH 8 in a few samples. The soils are well suited
for rice growing.
6.        Present Land Use.  In the 1970 dry season, 1,035 ha of rice were
grown on the estate under irrigation supplied from the East Tarum system
(opened in 1970) and 1,875 ha during the wet season.
B. Development of Sukamandi
7.        Area Distribution.  The 4,565 ha of Sukamandi Estate would be
used as a mechanized seed farm and plant breeding station, and the balance
as a rental farm until required for seed production.

Seed farm (cultivated area)                   2,450
Plant Breeding Station (cultivated area)        250

Total               4,550
/1   Details Table 1.
8.        Cropping Pattern.  On the 2,450 ha comprising the seed farm, double
cropping of rice, with mechanical seeding and harvesting, is planned on
1,825 ha allowing 625 ha, or 25%, of rotating fallow. This represents a
cropping intensity of just over 150%. For seed production a fallow period
is needed to control weeds and dropped seed regrowth, and to make varietal
switches possible. For agronomic and mechanical harvesting considerations,
sowing would take place over six weeks each season, from mid-April to end
of May for the dry season crop and from the beginning of November to
mid-December for the wet season crop.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
9.        Distribution System,  The irrigation development of the seed farm
would require the construction of main distribution canals (secondaries)
within the estate and associated canal structures including offtakes, drops
and canal bridges. In addition, minor distribution canals (tertiaries) with
canal offtakes would be needed. Field distribution requires the construction
of field canals (quatiaries) and head ditches; field drains and collectors
discharging into the existing natural water sources would also have to be
provided. The remaining cultivable areas on the estate not required for
seed production would require secondary canals with field offtakes. These
would be designed to conform with the field layouts required for eventual
incorporation into the main farm; no field feeders or head ditches would be
constructed.
10.       Drainage.  As there is no record of flooding at Sukamandi, the
existing natural water courses and a protecting cut-off drain, planned in
the Djatiluhur irrigation system, would be an adequate means of evacuating
surface runoff.
11.       Roads.  The present road network established on the estate would be
retained and rehabilitated but, as surfacing material has to be transported
some 65 km, road costs are high. Construction proposed would consist of
15 cm of compacted gravel laid on a base of 15 cm of compacted natural sub-
grade; allowance has been made in the annual costs for the maintenance re-
quired by this surface.
12.       Construction Program.  Development of the irrigation infrastructure
on land required for the first year's development, 750 ha, would be financed
as part of the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II (Credit 195-IND); the
remainder would be financed from the proposed Credit. Land levelling and
other development (including the sub-secondary and tertiary distribution
system), would be confined to the areas required for seed production and for
the CRIA, Sukamandi Branch; this development would be a commitment of the
seeds project.
13.       Operation and Maintenance.  The Sukamandi Estate, less the area
forming CRIA, Sukamandi Branch, would be owned and operated by the National
Seeds Corporation. Operation and maintenance of the irrigation system inside
the estate boundary would be carried out be the estate management and an
allowance has been made in the recurrent costs for water guards to operate
and regulate the system and for a maintenance gang to work permanently on the
upkeep of canals and structure and on cleaning and maintaining drains. Normal
operation and maintenance of the secondary supply would be the responsibility
of the Djatiluhur Authority who will levy a water charge for this service.
14.       Cost Estimates.  The cost per ha of the irrigation infrastructure
(including canals, roads, bridges and drainage) would be about Rp 294,000
(US$778 equivalent) for the seed farm and Rp 130,000 (US$342 equivalent) for
the rental farms.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
15.       Execution.  It has been agreed with Government that the Planning
Department of the Djatiluhur Authority, with assistance from its consulting
engineers, would prepare designs of the sub-secondary and tertiary systems.
The Authority would also prepare contract documents, call for tenders and
supervise construction.
C. Land Development, Cultivation Methods,
and Mechanization Requirements
16.       Assumptions.  The total area to be developed for mechanized rice
seed production would be 2,700 ha of which 250 ha are reserved for CRIA,
Sulcamandi Branch. The development would involve rotational fallow on at
least 25% of the area in order to facilitate control of weeds and rogue
seedlings from previous crops; when varieties are changed, fields would be
kept fallow for two seasons.
17.       Soil Preparation.  Direct seeding would be adopted, thus creating
conditions favorable to the germination of weeds. Therefore, early atten-
tion would be given to soil preparation methods and weed control under both
wet and dry conditions. Machinery requirements would be based on 35 working
days within a period of six to eight weeks.
18.       Stalk Cutting and Ploughing.  The first operation after harvest
would be "stalk cutting" and burning of straw. The limits of moisture con-
tent for good tillage are narrow and correct timing should be developed by
experience. Early ploughing would cause kneading of the soil into plaster
lumps; delayed ploughing would result in hard soil and in inadequate working
depth (a depth of 12-18 cm would be desirable). Both turning and mixing
soil preparation methods are foreseen; turning under may however, retard
decomposition. Three types of equipment would be used: heavy disc harrows
(pulled by crawler tractor); disc ploughs (pulled by wheel tractor); and
rotavators.
19.       Post Ploughing Operations.  Depending on the size of the clods and
the weather conditions, one to two harrowings and land levelling operations
would be required; and under certain conditions, roller packing might be
necessary. The following types of machines would be used: disc harrows,
spike tooth harrows, cultivators, land levellers, roller packers, levee
ploughs, small trench ploughs. The most unfavorable situation would be one
in which the remaining straw could not be burnt; in such cases cultivation
would be by rotavator.  When ploughing has been completed and the weather
conditions do not permit disc harrowing, puddling in shallow irrigated fields
with open rollers would be possible.
20.       Sowing and Fertilizers.  When soil is prepared under dry conditions,
sowing would be done with a grain drill also equipped with a separate fer-
tilizer attachment. Spacings of about 18 cm and a seed rate of 100 kg/ha
with an application of 200 kg/ha urea and 50 kg/ha TSP are recommended; half



ANNEX 9
Page 5
of thea urea would be applied after two to three weeks of growth. When dry
sowing is not possible, broadcasting with a spinner broadcaster is planned
and would be carried out immediately after draining. Seed to be sown in mud
would first be germinated (bags would be soaked for 24 hours in the irrigation
canals and then stored in the shade for 24-38 hours before sowing). Pro-
longed germination should be avoided.
21.       Water Management During Growth.  To control weed growth and to
obtain maximum rice growth careful water management during the first few
weeks is required. In the case of dry seeding a flush irrigation (allowing
a total of approximately 10 cm to the field) would be given followed by
draining; fields would be drained again. During the first few weeks the depth
of water required would be judged by the growth of the young rice plants.
Later the water level would be the main control measure for weed growth and
final draining prior to harvesting would take place three weeks after heading.
22.       Weed and Pest Control.  Direct seeding would require more attention
to weed and pest control than in traditional methods. Weeds would be con-
trolled by fallow periods, a good sowing method and efficient water manage-
ment. Control of grasses and weeds before sowing would be achieved by
using granozome; a 2-4 D butyl-ester would be used to control broad leaved
weeds. Pests that might occur are: rats, water snails, insects such as
leaf miners, dephacids, jassaids, brown borers, white borers, brown stem
bugs, seedbugs, and grasshoppers; applications of Diazinon would be used.
23.       Roguing.  Good quality stock seed and the destruction of developing
weeds of previous crops during fallows are essential if purity is to be
maintained; each crop would, therefore, be rogued two or three times.
24.       Harvesting.  Harvesting would take place when the rice had a
moisture content of about 20% (17-24%).
D. Phasing of Seed Production
25.       Table 3 shows phased development of certified seed production
and build-up of yields. The latter would rise from an initial 3.0
tons/ha to 4.0 tons at full development, reflecting experience in seed
production, and also a higher percentage of high yielding varieties in
the seed mix. In the estimates, it is assumed that only 80% would actually
be sold as seed, and that the residue would be sold as consumption grain.
26.       Total ex-plant seed production at full development would be
11,790 tons annually.
27.       Stock seed requirements are shown in Table 3.

SEEDS PROJECT
Seed Drying, Processing and Storage
General
1.        Seed processing plants and associated drying and storage
facilities may be designed and operated in several ways, depending upon
seed type and quantity, number of varieties, degree of mechanization
desired, type and amount of available labor, ease of construction and
cost of total installation. The system of seed processing selected as
being most suited to Indonesian conditions involves drying, storage in
bulk and processing in that order. This sequence reduces dangers of
damage to seed from high temperatures, humidity and rodent and insect
damage.
2.        Seed must be dried fairly rapidly soon after ripening to slow
metabolic activity and maintain vigor and viability. Any drying method
is satisfactory, providing the temperatures used and the duration of
drying period would not damage the seed physically or morphologically.
The method of storing after drying and before shipping, maintenance of
identity of lots and varieties, cost, and management usually influence
the method chosen for drying.
3.        Processing is straightforward.  The first operation is
cleaning -- the removal of as much weed seeds, inert material, and
other mixtures as possible with the use of an air and screen type
cleaner. Further separating of impurities is performed by special
equipment.
4.        Following the cleaning and separating operations seed is
treated with fungicides and/or insecticides, packaged for sale, and
distributed (see also Appendix 1).
Suggested Procedure of Operation
5.        To better accommodate phasing, flexibility and management the
drying, storage, and processing installations would be constructed and
operated in modules one each in the Klaten and Batang districts and two
at Kepandjen. The Sukamandi units are to be constructed for initial use
in 1971/72, 1973/74 and 1974/75. The Klaten district unit would be con-
structed for use in 1972/73, Kepandjen in 1974/75, and Batang in 1975/76.



ANNEX 1 0
Page 2
6.        Specifications for equipment and plan of operation are based on
the following plans per modular unit (see also Appendix 2):
Total production per season          2,000 - 2,400 tons
of dry seed
Harvest period per season            35 days
Average daily intake                60 tons
Number of varieties                 4 to 6
Moisture content of seed
at harvest (average)              22 percent
Period for processing               100 days
To meet these requirements the equipment must have the following charac-
teristics:
Minimum Working Capabilities:
Precleaner, weigher, elevators,
and conveyors leading to bulk
drying and storage bins             20 tons/hr
Bulk storage, capacity of
drying-storage bins                 2,000 tons
Working capacity of each
equipment item in processing
plant                                2 - 2-1/2 tons/hr
7.        The in-bin drying and storage system with individual fan-heater
units is more suited to the project and better than single heater unit, con-
tinuous flow or tower drier types; it is simpler to build and use, requires
less seed handling and is very flexible. In such a system, individual
galvanized metal circular bins equipped with a perforated floor are set
on foundations about two feet above ground level. The area between the
perforated floor and the ground forms a plenum chamber into which heated
air is blown from a single fan-heater unit. The air pressure created by
the special type fan forces air through the perforated floor and up through
the seed. 28 bins will be required to dry 2,000 tons of threshed rice over
35 consecutive days. Table 1 shows the use of the bins during the receiving
period, based upon a three-day drying schedule.
8.        Precleaned seed is delivered to the unit at the rate of 60 tons
per day and divided into two empty bins filling each about 1/3 full. During
the day while the seed is being added to the bins, only the fan is operating
in order to keep the seed from heating. At the end of the day when 30 tons
(approximate) have been placed in each bin, heat is added to the air. Heated
air is continually forced through the bulk of seed until a sample from the
top of the seed mass shows a moisture content of 12%. With air flow at
11-15 CFM per bushel, air temperature controlled within the range of

Page 3
40-430C and the relative humidity of the drying air no lower than 55%,
the 1.7 meter depth of seed should dry almost uniformly from top to bottom
in three days. The dried batches are then combined for storage. As drying
of successive daily harvests progresses, like lots are combined to fill the
90 ton bins (three drying batches per storage bin).

Total of 28 bins required for drying and storage.
9.        In this fashion drying progresses, so that on the 35th conse-
cutive day 28 bins are in use - 21-1/3 are full of dried seed and 6 are
being used for drying the harvest of the past 3 days. To save expendi-
tures for fan-heater units, one unit serves two adjacent bins. Selec-
tion of bins during the drying period is such that one fan-heater unit
delivers air to only one bin at a time.
10.       Soon after the seed is dry, it should be fumigated to kill
stored-grain insects which may have infested the seed prior to harvest.
Any fumigant used should have the ability to penetrate the entire seed



ANNEX 10
Page 4
mass, have the capability of killing the insects, be safe to use and
not damage vigor or viability of the seed during fumigation.  One of the
best fumigants for seed is phostoxin. Ethylene dichloride-based mixtures
are also satisfactory. Extremely toxic or inflammable substances are not
recommended. Methyl bromide is not recommended for seed.
Processing
11.       From the drying-storage bins the seed is conveyed to the
processing plant where cleaning, separating, and treating procedures
produce the highest quality seed possible, with a minimum of loss through
clean-out.
12.       Weed seeds, inert material, other crop seeds, and other
varieties, are removed from the original seed lot as a part of
the processing operation. The air and screen cleaner removes by air
all light materials; by screens, materials significantly smaller
than acceptable seeds. The length separator removes materials longer
or shorter than the seed being processed. The width and thickness
separator recommended is of a special type for removing wide grain
rice (usually short-grained including red rice varieties) from narrow
grain rice (usually long-grained varieties).
13.       After cleaning and separating a seed lot passes through the
treater which applies fungicides and/or insecticides in liquid or slurry
form. Chemicals used should be those recommended by the research unit.
The treated seeds are then routed to the packaging operation.
14.       Early pathological research should give attention to the need
for fungicidal treatment. In the meantime organic mercurial fungicides
are recommended although non-mercurial insecticides (thiram or captan)
may be preferred; treatment against stored-grain insects is,also advisable.
Packaging and Distribution
15.       In order to better promote the sale of National Seeds Corpora-
tion (NSC) seed and to assure the farmer that he gets what he pays for, it
is necessary that rice seed be available to the farmer in sealed packages
commensurate with the size of the field to be planted. Since rice fields
per farm vary between 0.25 and 0.5 ha, conventional sized bags of 100 kg
are not suitable. Package size, therefore, should be either 5 or 7 kg,
or perhaps some of each size. 7 kg will plant about 0.3 ha. Although
packaging rice in this size will be more expensive than larger conventional
bags, it nonetheless is the only satisfactory answer. A semi-automatic
machine would be used for packing and polyethylene bags filled to the
prescribed weight, and heat-sealed. Certification and analysis informa-
tion may either be placed on tags inside the bags prior to sealing, or
printed on the bag. After packaging, seed would be placed in storage
awaiting distribution.



ANNEX 10
Page 5
Drying, Processing and Storage of Foundation and Stock Seed
16.       Drying, processing and storage would be accomplished in the
first module set up on Sukamandi seed farm. Unlike the procedure to
be used for certified seed, foundation and stock seed would be dried,
cleaned, treated, bagged and stored in a specially constructed dehumidified
storage room within the plant; the use of such a procedure would better
accommodate small lots of seed. Cleaning and bagging would be done in
the same processing plant as certified seed, but at a time when certified
seed is either drying or in bulk storage. Although processing foundation
and stock seed would not interfere with other operations, some additional
equipment is required, including two additional air and screen cleaners -
a small one for foundation seed lots and a medium-sized one for stock
seed lots.
17.       Production of varietally pure, high quality seed requires
care in every stage. It is doubly true in stock seed production.
Extreme care must be exercised to insure that all equipment has been
cleaned and inspected thoroughly before seed is introduced into the sys-
tem. Floors should be clean and only new bags should be used. Only one
seed lot should be worked at a time and equipment thoroughly cleaned be-
tween varieties. Each bag of seed should be labeled as to variety and lot
number at the time of bagging and stored according to variety and lot
to minimize mix-ups.
Equipment Requirements
18.       Equipment requirements are based upon the construction of
seven modular units at four locations including drying, storage and
processing facilities with ancillary buildings. Each module would
have the capacity to receive 2,000 metric tons of rice seed within a
period of 35 consecutive days and to dry this amount to a seed moisture
level between 11 and 12%; at no time should seed temperatures rise above
400C until a moisture content below 14% is reached, after which the seed
temperature may be allowed to rise to 430C. Further, when the seed has
completed drying, no seed sample drawn should contain more than 12% nor
less than 10% moisture. Drying must proceed rapidly to prevent growth of
mold or other organisms associated with wet grain and the entire drying
period should not exceed one week.
19.       Horizontal conveyors, which should be reversible, would be used
to fill and empty drying-storage bins; they should have a working capacity
of at least 20 tons per hour. Horizontal conveyors and elevators and motors
located outside the building Imust be weather proof and drying-storage bins
must be rain proof. The sides should be airtight to prevent loss of air
during drying and to ensure successful fumigation. Storage foundations
must be of sufficient strength to prevent damage to the floor. Special
provisions should also be made to insure a tight fit around spouting to
and from the bins.



ANNEX 10
Page 6
20.       Harvested and threshed seed is received from the fields in 4-ton
trailers, dumped into the intake pit, precleaned, weighed, dried, stored
in bulk, processed, and temporarily stored awaiting shipment. The processing
unit (cleaning, sizing, treating, bagging) would have a capacity to
process 2,000 to 2,400 tons of seed within a period of 100 days, that is,
20 tons per 8 or 10 hour day; packaging would be based upon a 16 hour day.
Processing equipment should be so constructed as to permit ready access to
any part of it for complete cleaning. Similarly, construction of the
installation, fitting of conveyor to storage bins, and connections between
conveying units and equipment must be accomplished in such a way as to
insure a rapid clean-up between seed lots. Finally the entire system
should be constructed and installed to minimize mechanical injury to seed.
21.       Flexibility in moving seed from one machine to another is
essential; distributor heads, valves and spouting would be provided to
insure that seed leaving the air and screen cleaner may enter any other
machine, by-passing those not required for a particular cleaning operation.
Additionally, adequately sized, hopper-bottomed surge bins would serve each
machine, providing flexibility among equipment in the processing line. These
bins should be of metal construction, self cleaning and of 1-ton capacity,
except that the surge bin serving the air and screen cleaner must be of 10-ton
capacity and the one serving the packaging unit, 5-ton.
22.       Foundation and slabbing for the drying and storage units would
be constructed of concrete in accordance with the specifications of the
supplier of the drying and storage equipment. Building materials and
specifications for processing plant and warehouse shall meet those pres-
cribed by the firm designing this unit.

Draft Terms of Reference
Employment of Consultants for the Planning and Design of Seed Processing
Plants for the National Seeds Corporation
1.        The National Seeds Corporation would employ a consultant to
plan, design, draw up tender documents and supervise the construction
of seed processing plants required by the Corporation. In view of the
specialized nature of seed processing plants, it is intended that tender
documents would specify a turnkey operation to include the final plant
design, all seed processing equipment, storage bins, buildings, and
installation.
2.        The consultant to be appointed would:
(a)    design and make engineering drawings of one module of
the drying, storage and processing installations; the
plans should generally follow the recommendations set

SEEDS PROJECT
Agricultural Research and Plant Breeding
1.        The Government of Indonesia recognizes the importance of a
regular flow of good quality high yielding seed varieties (HYV) and appre-
ciates that they form the backbone of a viable seed industry. The exist-
ing program of research and plant breeding is the responsibility of the
Central Research Institute of Agriculture (CRIA) with its headquarters
and plant breeding facilities at Bogor and with 22 field stations distrib-
uted throughout Indonesia. The plant breeding program at Bogor operates
under severe constraints including:
(1) limited land is available for trials and has been cropped
so intensively that it is difficult to establish the
true significance of experimental results; the land is
also subject to repeated trespass resulting in loss of
breeder seed and contamination;
(2) the soil types at Bogor are not typical of the main rice
soils of Indonesia;
(3) the facilities are old and generally inadequately equipped;
(4) the salaries and living conditions of staff are inadequate
and there is some absenteeism and wastage; and
(5) CRIA has an inadequate budget.
2.        Despite these difficulties, 10 improved varieties of rice seed
have been released, although of these only 3 can be classified as HYV.
They originate from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in
the Philippines; two other HYV from IRRI would be released shortly.

The yield potential of varieties Nos. 1-8 is about half that of the HYV
IR5 and IR8 released by IRRI. The popularity of a variety, besides the
yield potential, depends on a number of factors including resistance to
disease and insects; lodging; quality of grain; palatability; duration of
maturity; and milling yields.
3.        In 1969, Government appointed a Joint Agricultural Research
Survey Team 1/, to examine and report on the present agricultural research
arrangements in Indonesia. The Joint Survey Team, in their report published
in July 1969, concluded that:
(1) to coordinate national agricultural research programs and
to advise Government an Indonesian Agricultural Research
Organization (IARO) at the national level was required;
(2) a National Rice Research Program (NRRP) with similar pro-
grams for other crops should be established; and
(3) a national cadre of scientists should be created with
appropriate emoluments and incentives.
1/   Comprising 7 eminent scientists from outside Indonesia and 11 local
scientists.



ANNEX 11
Page 3
Thene proposals have been accepted in principle by Government but it
would be some time before they are fully implemented. NRRP has however
been formed and a coordinator made available through Ford Foundation
and IRRI. Dutch and Japanese technical assistance programs have been
prepared and agreements signed with Government; in addition, a program
with USAID is under preparation.
4.        The success of any seed production program would depend on a
regular flow of HYV. It is essential that plant breeding and supporting
facilities are made available, and since those at Bogor are inadequate
a Research Branch has been established at Sukamandi on 250 ha of irrigated
land; it would be a branch of CRIA. Sukamandi is located in the largest
rice producing region in Java (the northern plain is well suited to rice
production and is provided with an adequate supply of irrigation water
from the Djatiluhur and other Irrigation Projects). Soils are more
representative of rice producing areas of Java than at Bogor.
CRIA, Sukamandi Branch - Functions and Administration
5.        CRIA, Sukamandi Branch would perform the following functions:
(1) produce a regular flow of new HYV in rice, maize and
soybeans in cooperation with national and international
research agencies;
(2) multiply and make available basic seeds (breeder foundation
and stock) to the National Seeds Corporation (NSC);
(3) provide technical assistance to producers of certified seed;
(4) undertake the certification of seed until the Seeds Control
and Certification Service has been fully established;
(5) cooperate in the training of staff engaged in seed-production,
processing and marketing; and
(6) provide seed testing facilities including post control testing.
Although forming a branch of CRIA, the Research Branch would be semi-auto-
nomous, responsible to the Director General of Agriculture, and similar
in composition to the organization, PROSIDA, established by the Minister
of Public Works to facilitate the implementation of the IDA-financed
irrigation rehabilitation projects. The station would be established by
Decree of the Minister of Agriculture which would provide for; a manage-
ment board and a technical advisory committee; a statute setting out the
Station's objectives and priorities; staffing arrangements including
details of conditions of service and salaries; and financing arrangements.
It would operate in accordance with the Minister's general directions in
regard to the seed program. The management board would comprise: the

Director of CRIA (Chairman); a representative of the Director-General
of Agriculture; the- Presidetnt Director of NSC; the Head of the RIA
Sukamandi Branch; and the Section Head of the Seeds Control and Certifi-
cation Service.  There would also be a technical advisory committee. com-
posed of:  the Director- General of Agriculture (Chairman); the Director
of CRIA; representatives of the agricultural universities of Indonesia;
the Read of CRIA, Sukamandi Rranch; the Section Head of the Seeds Control
and Certification Service; representatives of Indonesian and foreign
research agencies; and other agricultural scientists as considered
necessary-.
Program of Rsearch
6.        The program of research for the station would be project
oriented; an outline is included in Appendix:1 to this Annex.  Rice would
receive first priority, followed by maize and soybeans; seed of the latter
two crops i- unlikely to be produced in any quantity during the project
period.  The station, in. the first instance, would employ 7 experienced
specialis-ts and where these were recruited outside Indonesia, they would
be supported bytIndonesian counterpart statf.  There would also be a
cadre of technical staff and provision for studen-t assistants; details
of staffing for the ettation are included in Appendix 2.  Provision has
also been made for overseas training.

SEEDS PROJECT
-ational Seeds Corporation (NSC)
1.        NSC would be established by Government regulation as a
Perusahaan Negara Umum (PERUM), a state enterprise in which all the shares
would be held by Government. Its objectives would include:
-    the management of the Sukamandi estate with the exception of
that portion of the estate allocated to the Plant Breeding
Station;
-    the mechanized cultivation of seed on 2,450 ha at Sukamandi;
-    management of seed production in the three seed districts;
-    the installation and operation of seed processing plants at
Sukamandi and the three seed districts, together with the
storage and packaging of seed;
-    the marketing and distribution of certified seed produced
at Sukamandi and in the seed districts;
-    the training of personnel to meet the Corporation's staffing
requirements; and
-    the administration of subsidiary operations at Sukamandi
including rental farms of 800 ha, a rice mill, an existing
ice factory and essential utility services.
Organization and Management
2.        Overall control of NSC would rest with the Minister of Agricul-
ture. NSC would have a Board of Management, consisting of a President
Director and three Directors, all full time employees of NSC. The Direc-
tors would administer NSC's affairs under three departments: Production
and Processing; Commercial Services; and Finance and Administration. Dur-
ing the first five years of the project supporting technical management
with executive powers would be provided under technical assistance (terms
of reference for the Managing Agents are at Appendix 1): a Senior Con-
sultant Technical Adviser to the President Director; a Chief of Farm Opera-
tions for the Sukamandl seed farm, assisted by a farm mechanization expert;
a Chief of Commercial Services to be in charge of promotional activities,
sales and distribution; and a Chief of Finance and Administration to design
and implement all administrative and accounting procedures.



ANNEX 12
Page   2
3.        The Chief of the Seed Districts would be responsible for the
administration of the three seed districts; he would be assisted by 3
managers with technical staff to run the seed processing plants and exten-
sion staff seconded frow the Provincial Agricultural Services (see Chart 2).
Physical Development and Phasing
4.        Production in 1972 of certified seed from the project would be
some 1,211 tons (all from Sukamandi); seed district production (at Klaten)
would not commence till 1973. By 1977/78, the first year of full produc-
tion from Sukamandi and the Seed Districts, total production would be bet-
ween 21,000 and 22,000 tons; processing plants would be installed as
required.  For further details of development and production in the Sukamandi
Estate and the Seed Districts, see Annexes 7, 8 and 9.
Distribution and Marketing of Seed
5.        Marketing of the new seed stream would be the responsibility of
the Director of Commercial Services; until 1976, he would be advised and
assisted by a qualified and experienced seeds marketing specialist (Chief
of Commercial Services) who would have executive responsibility for setting
up and supervising the department's principal activities: sales promotion,
order and despatch, sales representation.
6.        Tne development of an adequate marketing organization for the
new seeds industry would be of major importance. The difficulties to be
overcome include: the need to remove the distrust of the farming commu-
nity of the so-called high-yielding varieties of rice seed supplied as
a part of the BIMAS input package; the need to determine the real seed
demand initially itn Java and later in Indonesia; and the introduction of
a marketing and distribution system which would make seed available to
farmers at the right time and place and at a reasonable price.
7.        A detald marketing study is required to investigate and recom-
mend methods and practices which would ensure successful introduction of
new seed -xarieties as they become available; funds for a three-month study
have been included i: texe project under Technical Assistance. Draft terms
of reference are inmiude4 in Appendix 2 of this Annex.
Resource3
8.        UsWig NSC's  ne-ome and expense projections (see the NSC Cash
Flow, Annex 15, Tble 1) es the determinant of its capital structure, NSC
would be able to service oiily a small proportion of its capital at the
standard Indionesian initerest race of 1%. It has therefore been assumed
that the Government tontributioni would be made in the form of equity
amounting to kV 2,589 Piil1iou (US$6.85 Million equivalent). On this
basis the capital structure would be:

Equity Capital
Proposed IDA Credit                       1,614             4.30

Total                  2,589             6.85
9.        NSC's income would cover its expenses from inception pro-
vided Government subscribed by way of annual contributions, over a
period of five years, some Rp 210 million (US$550,000 equivalent) to the
CRIA, Sukamandi Branch. NSC would then be in a position to cover the re-
mainder of the Research Branch's recurrent expenditure.
10.       This structure has not attempted to introduce the various
assets already at Sukamandi which would need to be valued and included
in the capital structure.
11.       The cash flows are in balance, on the assumption that the price
of rice seed at Sukamandi and the seed districts would remain at Rp 45/kg
during the first 5 years of the project and Rp 55/kg thereafter.
Accounts and Audit
12.       The accounts would be set up by the Chief of Finance and Adminis-
tration. In view of the high standard of commercial accounting principles
to be applied, the audit would be performed by a professional accountant
whose appointment would be subject to IDA approval. The audit report
would be required within four months of the end of the financial year,
suggested to run from July 1 to June 30.

seed; the balance would be used for research and plant
breeding and as rental farms. The irrigation infra-
structure would be installed by the Djatiluhur Irrigation
Authority. NSC would manage the mechanized rice farm
and produce certified rice seed using stock seed derived
from foundation seed produced by the new Research Branch
and such other sources as may be deemed appropriate;
(c) three seed production districts have been selected in
Central and East Java where NSC would make contractual
arrangements with groups of farmers for the production of
certified seed. Agricultural extension staff would be
obtained by secondment of suitable Provincial Agricultural
Services staff; other staff would be directly employed;
(d) NSC would be responsible for the training of all staff,
including counterparts to experienced specialists recruited
overseas. Qualified Indonesian staff should occupy all
posts within NSC by the end of 1976; and
(e) a new marketing and distribution system must be developed.
Provision is made for consultants to carry out the requisite
study.
4.        The Managing Consultants would be responsible for administration
of NSC under the policy direction of the NSC Board consisting of a President
Director and a Director of Production, a Director of Commercial Services
and a Director of Finance and Administration. The Managing Consultants
would provide qualified and experienced staff, from abroad if necessary,
to fill the executive posts below the level of policy management. To
provide for a gradual shift of responsibility from Managing Consultants
to Indonesian nationals, the Managing Consultants' contract would last for
three years, renewable for another two years at the Covernment's option
exercised by the Government unless IDA agreed otherwise.
5.        The following executive posts will require special skills;
candidates are unlikely to be available in Indonesia during the time
periods indicated and would have to be provided by the Managing Agency.
All would be engaged for 36 months in the first instance with option for

7.        The Directorate of Production and Processing would have three
branches (see Annex 1):
-    Farm Operations, in charge of Sukamandi Seed Farm;
-    Seed Processing, in charge of Sukamandi Processing
Plant; and
-    Seed Districts, responsible for the three seed
districts.
8.        The Chief of Farm Operations, Sukamandi, would be helped in
running the seed farm by an assistant (experienced in mechanized rice
farming operations) and six superintendents, two with functional responsi-
bilities (irrigation and workshops) and the remainder in charge of field
operations. Seed processing and storage at Sukamandi would be the direct
responsibility of the Chief of Seed Processing who would be assisted by
two superintendents. The Chief of Operations, Seed Districts, would be
responsible for the three seed districts; in each of the districts there
would be one seed district manager, two extension officers seconded from
the local Provincial Agricultural Services, and supporting processing plant
technicians and clerical staff. The seed district manager, in addition
to his responsibility for the plant, would make contractual arrangements
with village farm groups for the production of seed; the contracts would
specify area to be cultivated, variety to be grown, planting date, basis
of payment and any special treatments considered necessary. Roguing of
each farm would be supervised by the Chief Manager, Seed Districts, and
his staff.



&NNEX 12
Appendix 1

responsible for seed marketing; the Chief of Commercial Services would be
supported by sales staff and his initial responsibility would be to establish
the marketing system which would be the subject of a consultant's study.
11.       The Directorate of Administration and Finance would provide
administrative and accounting services and manage non-farming activities

responsibilities would include provision of specialists as indicated below
during the first three years of the project and such extension up to five
years as may be considered necessary, and the recruitment of suitable NSC
staff, including counterparts, to ensure efficient implementation of the
project. The enterprise would be run on commercial lines and it would be
necessary to establish a commercially orientated administration based on
modern cost accounting and management principles. The Managing Consultants

SEEDS PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis
that:
-    the project would have a life of 15 years commencing in
1971/72 when first investments are made;
-    the price of imported coarse rice 1/ would be US$87/ton CIF
Djakarta in the late 1970's; and
-    all costs are net of import duties.
Benefits
2.        These derive from the increased yields of farmers using the high
yielding varieties of rice seed of the new seed stream. They are estimated
conservatively to be:
Yields with the HYV from Yields with Saved
the New Seed Stream           Non HYV
First crop after seeding                 110%                   100%
Second crop after seeding                107-1/2%               100%
Third crop after seeding                 105%                   100%
All seed produced would be sold in areas served by the BIMAS NASIONAL and
INMAS programs where current yields are about 1.7 ton/ha. Other benefits
derive from increased milling yields resulting from a more homogeneous grain
(estimated to be 4%); the better utilization of farm inputs; seed require-
ments reduced from 40 kg/ha to 25 kg/ha; and additional research facilities
at CRIA, Sukamandi Branch. These additional benefits have not been taken
into account.
1/   Unpolished rice between 35% and 42% brokens sirilar to Indonesian
consumption rice.

Costs
3.        All project costs (including those financed by Credit 195-IND),
both investment and recurrent, are included together with equipment and
vehicles purchased in 1970 (but not financed by the project). An item
has also been included to cover the cost of seed distribution (Rp 10/kg
or US$26/ton) and for additional milling and handling charges (Rp 7/kg
or US$19/ton).
Economic Rate of Return
4.        Assuming these costs and benefits, the rate of return of the
project is 58%. With a drop in price to US$80/ton and US$70/ton the rate
of return would be 53% and 45% respectively.
5.        Sensitivity tests have been made:
(a) assuming that: seed production at Sukamandi only is success-
ful and by year 1977/78 has reached 11,790 tons; seed produc-
tion in the seed districts is found to be a failure after the
full investment is made at Klaten; the consequent rate of
return would be 47%.
(b)  assuming that:  only 50% of Sukamandi production is sold as
seed, 5,900 tons, the balance being disposed of as consumption
grain; there is no production from the seed districts and
that the full investment is made at Klaten; the rate of
return would be 23%.
