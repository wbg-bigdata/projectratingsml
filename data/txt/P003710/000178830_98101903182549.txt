EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVThOPIENT
CREDIT TO TIHE REPUBLIC OF INDONEIA FOR A
SEES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reconrmendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$7.5 million to
the Republic of Indonesia for a seeds project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In 1969, Indonesia asked the Association to assist in financing
a seeds project.   The project was prepared with the help of missions fror
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program in 1969 and August/September 1970,
assisted by consultants from Louisiana State University, financed under
Credit 135-Tlf  (Technical Assistance Project).  The project was appraised
in November 1970.    ;  -
3.        Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington
from April 5 to 16, 1971.   The Government was represented by Messrs.
Sadikin Sumintawikarta, Director-General of Agriculture; Saleh Afiff,
BAPPENAS; Djatijanto, Department of Agriculture; Soehaedi, Department
of Agriculture;  Ismail Saleh, Cabinet Secretariat; Sidarto, Department
of Agriculture;  and Silalahi, Indonesian ftbassy, Washington;  and by Miss
Buly Lubis, Department of Finance.
4.        The proposed credit would be the fourteenth for Indonesia.
Since the Association started operations in Indonesia, it has given
emphasis to the physical rehabilitation of infrastructure and to means
of increasing agricultural production.   The thirteen credits to date
are to help finance projects for rehabilitation of irrigation and of
agricultural estates for fisheries, fertilizer production, telecommunications,
technical education, power, highways and to help finance technical assistanrce
The Government's development program (1969-1974) gives highest priority to
agriculture, with particular emphasis on rice production as rice imports
are a severe foreign exchange drain.   The Association1s lending program
is providing substantial assistance towards Indonesia's drive towards food
self-sufficiency.   In addition to financing,together with a consortium of
lenders, the expansion of the Pusri fertilizer plant (Credit 193-IND), the
Association has made three credits to assist projects to rehabilitate
irrigation systems covering about one-third of Indonesia's irrigated rice-
land.   In the interests of more systematic planning and policy, we are
also financing a national fertilizer study, an evaluation of the rice
production and intensification program, and studies of the availability
of groundwater and its potential use for irrigation.   A sector survey
mission to assess further needs in agriculture in coordination with the
Resident Staff has been scheduled for the second half of FY 1972.

6.        The first and second Agricultural Estates Projects (Credits
155-IND and 194-IND) have experienced some delay in implementation, mainly
due to problems of organization; progress is being made and the problems
are gradually being resolved.   Disbursements from Credit 155-IND are
behind schedule, but the position is expected to improve soon, as contracts
have been awarded for an additional US$4.1 million.   Credit 194-IMD was
made effective on February 9, 1971, and disbursements are expected to start
shortly.   After a slow start, disbursements from the other six credits maro
in FY 1969 and FY 1970 are now proceeding satisfactorily.   The remaining
five credits were signed in FY 1971 and they are all effective.   During
the remaining part of FY 1971, I expect to present to the Executive
Directors a prnptsad credit for a secri-d highway project.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An Appraisal Report on the proposed project is attached, entitled
"Indonesia - Seeds Project" (PA-85a) dated April   , 1971.   The project
would establish a modern seed industry mainly for rice, which at full output
would produce about 22,000 tons yearly of high yielding varieties and make
possible an increase in rice production in Indonesia by about 320,000 tons
yearly.   The project would principally consist of the establishment and
operation of' (i) a National Seeds Corporation (NSC) which would develop a
mechanized and irrigated seed farm on part of the Government-owned Sukamandi
area in West Java and be responsible for production, processing and marketirn2
of seed; (ii) a semi-autonomous plant breeding station at Sukamandi as a
branch of the Central Research Institute of Agriculture (CRIA) to ensure an
adequate flow of high yielding plant varieties to support the NSC's seed
production program; and (iii) a seeds control and certification service.
Appropriate seeds legislation would be promulgated to establish standards
for seed purity and certification.   A seed production district in Central
Java has been selected where farmers would produce seed on contract for
NSC and, if this is successful, two other districts - already selected -
would be established in Central and East Java.   Staff and farmer training
would also be provided.   NSC would administer the remaining
land in the Sukamandi area as a rental farm until the land is needed for
extension of research or seed-growing.
9.        The Sukamandi area lies within the Djatiluhur irrigation system
whose rehabilitation is being planned and inplemented by the Djatiluhur
Authority and financed by Credit 195-IND (Second Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project).   To enable seed breeding and farming to start as soon as possible,
it is proposed that an estimated US$377,000 equivalent be disbursed out of
Credit 195-IND to help finance irrigation works on about 750 ha at Sukamandi
during the first year of the proposed seeds project.   Such works are not
now included in the Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, and therefor:
the credit agreement for that project would need to be amended.
The additional financing would also cover consulting services to assist the
Djatiluhur Authority in planning and implementing the proposed works.
Sufficient credit funds are available for this purpose.
10.       The Minister of Agriculture would be responsible for the project.
The Minister would be advised by a National Seeds Board (NSB), concerned
with planning and formulating policies for development and operation of a
national seeds industry.   The NSB, NSC, the Sukamandi branch of ClIA, and
the Government seeds control and certification service have just been
formally established under legislation satisfactory to the Association.
Signature of a Presidential decree acceptable to the Association promulgating
the seeds law is expected shortly and is a condition of effectiveness.



11.       There would be one other condition of effectiveress. Because
of the lack of experience in Indonesia in processing and marketing improved
rice seed varieties, a firm of management consultants would be engaged to
assist in running NSG under the policy direction of NSC's Board.  The fiim
would provide qualified and experienced staff, from abroad if necessary, to
fill executive positions below the level of policy management; under
Indonesian law, the latter must be held by Indoneslan nationals.  To aIllow
for a grdual shift of responsibiliti.es from consultants' staff to
nationals as the latter become more experienced and capable, the contract
would last for three years and, after review by the Govermnent and
Asscciationri wiould then be renewable for another twc years with appropriate
modification.
12.       The existing plant breeding program is conducted by the Central
Research Institute of Agriculture (CREA), mainly at Bogor near Djakarta.
This program operates under severe constrajnts, including soils which are
not typical of the rice-growing areas of Java, and inadequ2te facilities,
tudget, staff salary levels and conditions of service.  The new research
station, which would be established under the project would be established
as a branch of CRIA at Sukamandi, would have adequate land, typical soils
and good facilities.   DIring negotiations agreement was reached that staff
employed br the branch, the seeds control and certification service and the
NSC would be paid emoluments - including allowances and benefits - adequate
to ensure the recruitment of staff of the desired calibre and to allow them
to work exclusively f£or these organisations (Section 4.09 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
13.       At present about 860 families are settled in the Sukamandi area,
most of whom are ex-employces of the original private estate there.  To
enable development of the project at Sukanendi, they would hare to be
resettled, and they have already received notice that they will be mioved.
The project wiould eamploy most of the famnilies on the seed farm , plant
breeding station and rental farm.  Resettlement would be carried out in
twxo stages, in August/September 1971 and in MTay/June 1272; the plan of
resettlement is equitable.
14.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$J125
million equivalent.  The Association would finance US$7.9 million or 66%
of total cost, of which US$377,000 (including US$100,000 local cests)
would be financed from Credit 195-flm and US$7.5 million (covering the
remaining foreign exchange cost) from the proposed credit.  The Goverrmenat
would cover the teiatning loal cBurrency expenditures equivalent to
US$4.1 million.
15.       The Government plans to channel US$l.5 million equivalent of the
prcposed credit into CRPIhs azkamandi branch and the seeds control and
certification service as a grant.  Of the balance of US$64O) million
equivalent to be passed on to the NS0, US$1.7 million would be in the form
of a grant for technical assistance.  The remnainder of US$4.3 million
equivalent, together with a contribution by the Goverunent from other
sources of US$2,6 million, would in the first instance be made available
to NSC as a contribution to capital; by law the Government wouldi be



entitled to 55% of NSC's net profits after payment of corporation tax.
These funds would be provided as a contribution to capital and not debt,
because of the uncertainties inherent in establishing an entirely new
industry and because cash flow projections indicate that during the first
five years the NSC would not be able to service debt on the usual
Government terms for loans to enterprises (interest at 12% per year and
principal repayable over the life of the project) without jeopardising
its financial position.   However, NSC's capital structure would be
reviewed in 1975 and be converted to debt thereafter to the extent and
upon terms and conditions to be agreed with the Association (Section
3.03(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).   In addition to the
foregoing capital contributions, the Government would transfer to the
NSC unencumbered assets of the agency now running the Sukamandi area,
Lembaga Sang Hyang Seri.
16.       Procurement of goods and services would be in accordance with
the Association's guidelines.   All materials, components and finished
goods specifically imported for the project are expected to be exempted
from duty under a decree from the Minister of Finance, in line with the
Government's general policy for goods financed from project aid.   Since
it is also Government policy to encourage manufacturing industry in
Indonesia, it is proposed that a margin of preference of 15%, or the
customs duty applicable to non-exempt imports, whichever is less, would
be granted in favor of local bids for goods manufactured or processed in
Indonesia to a substantial extent.   Bids for goods which were no more
than assembled there and had only an insubstantial value added to them,
would be treated in the same way as foreign bids and would receive no
margin of preference.   Contracts for new buildings and the renovation
of existing buildings, estimated at US$660,000 equivalent, are small and
diversified and would be awarded after local advertisement only, although
they would be open to international corpetition.
17.      The Association would disburse against the c.i.f. price of
imported goods and the foreign exchange cost of contracts for technical
assistance and scholarships.   Where an award is made to a local
manufacturer or assembler, disbursement would be made for the ex-factory
price net of taxes on the sale of the goods involved.   Only a relatively
small local currency component would be involved (US$200,000 at most),
and the economic case for local currency financing in Indonesia has been
described in previous credit documents.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Indonesia and the Association, the draft letter agreement between the
Republic of Indonesia and the Association for the amendment of Develop-
ment Credit Agreement 195-IND referred to in paragraph 9 above, the
recommendation of the Committee referred to in Article V Section 1(d)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a draft
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.

19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement is in the usual form
for this type of project.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A special economic report (EAP-22), prepared for the meeting
of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia held in Amsterdam on
April 19 and 20, was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 16,
1971.   This report bears evidence to the continued economic inprovement
described in more detail in the last full report (EAP-19a) on the
current economic position and prospects of the economy which was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on January 21, 1971.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit and the proposed amendment of the Development Credit
Agreement 195-IND (Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Project), dated
June 15, 1970, between the Republic of Indonesia and the Association.
