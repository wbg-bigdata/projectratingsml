F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The higher-level objective of the Ceara SWAp II project is to contribute to expanding and
consolidating the social advances and institutional modernization of the State of Ceara.
The project will achieve this by supporting nine key government investment programs in
five sectors, selected to optimize development impact. A series of disbursement-linked
indicators (14) are mapped to the five sectors: public sector management, education,
health, water & sanitation, and business environment & innovation to strengthen the
incentives to achieve results.

  Specifically, the project development objectives are to:

  - help the Government of Ceara to improve its fiscal situation;
  - strengthen the state's system of results-based management;
  - promote better service quality in education (particularly early-childhood literacy) and
health;
  - improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency of the
government autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery; and
  - reduce barriers to business investment.

1.         Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.       This operation was the second in an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) sequence supporting
institutional modernization and social advances in the State of Ceará. The social development agenda of the
Government of Ceará (GoC) in education, health, and water and sanitation was supported under the US$150
million SWAp I loan (effective from 2004−2007). Those three sectors received continued assistance under
the SWAp II. In addition, the SWAp II supported the government’s “inclusive growth? strategy to strengthen
the business climate for investment and innovation. Results-based management was a cross-cutting lynchpin
of both SWAp loans.

2.       The specific activities and performance targets of the SWAp II built upon prior GoC achievements.
By 2007 the government had achieved relatively high levels of service coverage in education, health and
water and sanitation. Under the SWAp II the GoC largely sought to emphasize quality improvements (while
also expanding water and sanitation coverage). That emphasis guided the choice of government investment
programs supported by the loan, and also directed the design of performance metrics for loan disbursements
(discussed below). Meanwhile, the GoC “inclusive growth? strategy sought to address income poverty: the
state’s growth rate from 1985 to 2006 exceeded Brazil’s average, but the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
noted that in 2007 more than half of the state population (53%) lived below the poverty line (½ minimum
wage).

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.       The higher-level objective of the Ceará SWAp II project was to help expand and consolidate the
social advances and institutional modernization of the State of Ceará. The project supported ten government
investment programs in five sectors: public sector management, education, health, water supply and
sanitation, and business environment and innovation. Fourteen disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) were
mapped to these five sectors, and Technical Assistance (TA) funding was included in the SWAp II design to
support the achievement of some DLI targets.

4.       The specific project development objectives were:
      1. help the Government of Ceará to improve its fiscal situation
      2. strengthen the state’s system of results-based management
      3. promote better service quality in education (particularly early-childhood literacy) and health
      4. improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency of the government
         autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery
      5. reduce barriers to business investment

5.      The World Bank Board approved the Ceará SWAp II on August 29, 2008, and loan became effective
on May 14, 2009. DLI targets were agreed for the years 2008-2011. However, given the date of project
effectiveness, only the 2009-2011 targets were used.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification: N/A

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

6.       The primary project beneficiaries were the users of public education, health, and water supply and
sanitation services in Ceará. These service users would benefit from improvements in service reach and
quality. In addition, small businesses and individual citizens would benefit from improved (and less costly)


                                                      1
internet access, as well as from simplified procedures for business registration. As intermediaries, the
government secretariats would obtain TA funds to improve their internal processes and strengthen results-
based management skills. In addition, public sector managers would benefit from reliable access to budget
funding for their priority programs.

1.5         Original Components

7.      GoC policy priorities were reflected in its Multi-Year Budget Plan (Plano Plurianual 2008-2011 –
PPA), approved by the legislature in December 2007. The SWAp II supported budget programs selected
from the PPA—these were called “Eligible Expenditure Programs?—but loan disbursements were linked to
performance targets. The targets were of two types:

      i)       A “70% rule? required the GoC to disburse at least 70 percent of the approved annual budget in
               each Eligible Expenditure Program (EEP) budget line;
      ii)      DLIs with annual performance targets were defined for each sector.

8.      In addition to these disbursement metrics, a set of “secondary indicators? was crafted to focus GoC
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and to enrich professional dialogue between World Bank sector experts
and GoC counterparts during project implementation. The DLIs and original secondary indicators are listed
in Table 1. Performance against secondary indicator targets did not affect loan disbursements.

9.      A separate TA component (US$3.67 million) under the loan supported activities in each of the
project’s five priority sectors. A list of all final TA activities is provided in Annex 2, Table 5. In contrast to
the SWAp component of the loan, these TA funds disbursed according to standard World Bank procurement
and financial management rules for technical assistance operations. Select TA activities explicitly supported
the achievement of DLIs; others were for more general institutional strengthening, including safeguards.

1.6         Revised Components: N/A

1.7         Other significant changes

10.      Three DLI targets concerning water supply and sanitation were changed to raise the required
performance level (see Table 2). Timeline extensions were approved by the World Bank to enable the GoC to
meet SWAp II targets for disbursements. In addition, several secondary indicators were modified during
project implementation (see Table 1). These specific changes are discussed in section 2.2 below.

2.          Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1         Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11.     Crafting DLIs and quantifying the annual targets for each one was the centerpiece of the SWAp II
design. A core lesson from the SWAp I was to avoid indicators that could not reliably be attributed to the
actions of the pertinent government secretariat. That lesson was heeded, with one exception: an EEP
included budget funds transferred by the GoC to the municipal government of Fortaleza for execution (see
section 2.2(a)).

12.     DLIs were crafted with the direct participation of GoC secretariat heads and their technical staffs.
Participation was critical to encourage “buy-in? from the personnel who would be responsible for project
implementation. Moreover, to strengthen the performance culture in government, DLIs and their targets were
aligned, whenever possible, with existing program management indicators in the secretariats. Nonetheless,
collaboration did not eliminate all information asymmetries between line secretariats, the Project Management

                                                        2
Unit (Ceará Economic Research Institute – IPECE) and World Bank staff. During interviews conducted for
this ICR it was learned that CAGEGE used annual EBTIDA targets as part of an employee bonus program;
but the target values were more demanding than the EBITIDA targets agreed for the SWAp II. There are
credible arguments to justify different target values given the different uses of the indicator. However, the
EBITDA targets used internally by CAGECE were not presented to the World Bank or IPECE personnel
during project preparation.

13.      “Secondary indicators? were a SWAp II innovation. When a performance area was deemed
important to the GoC and the World Bank, but success in meeting the target would depend significantly on
factors outside GoC control, then a “secondary indicator? was included to maintain a focus on that target
without impacting project disbursements. In this way, secondary indicators were an explicit response to
performance-attribution problems.

14.      Secondary indicators also were recruited for a second purpose: as a place-holder for activities that
could not be defined with precision during project preparation. For instance, one SWAp II secondary
indicator was “Implementation of select procurement reform recommendations (based on OECD Indicators
diagnostic).? The OECD Indicators diagnostic was conducted during project preparation as part of the long-
standing engagement between the GoC and World Bank. However, translating the findings of that diagnostic
into a set of GoC-agreed reform activities would necessarily exceed the project preparation period.
Consequently, this activity appeared without further detail or comment in the PAD. However, the precise
indicator and measurement protocol then had to be agreed during project implementation.

2.2     Implementation

15.      Project implementation was broadly successful. The project was never classified “at risk.? Several
tailored interventions were devised to address specific performance problems that arose during project
implementation.

(a) Satisfying the “70% rule?

16.      At project closing the GoC succeeded in meeting the “70% rule? for all ten EEPs. (The EEPs and
their initial budgets are listed in Annex 3). This result reflects a strong performance by the GoC, but also is
attributable to the flexibility afforded by the World Bank.

17.     According to the project design, for each of the ten EEPs that failed to satisfy the “70% rule? before
the project’s final fiscal year, ten percent of the projected disbursement would be “rolled over? and added to
the amount programmed for disbursement the following year. EEP budget execution often exceeded 100
percent (due to in-year budget supplements); in 2012 a plurality of EEPs executed 71-79 percent of their
budgets. However, when failing to meet the “70% rule? the shortfall was typically dramatic (viz., budget
execution ranging from 0–18 percent). In 2009 two EEPs related to Business Environment & Innovation
(#033 and #196) failed to meet the “70% rule,? and in 2010 a health sector EEP (#554) fell short of the 70%
budget execution requirement. The corresponding loan disbursements were reduced accordingly.

18.     During the April 2011 project supervision mission the GoC explained that EEPs #033 and #196
would again fail to meet the “70% rule? in fiscal year 2011 unless new budget subprograms were considered
to be part of those EEPs. The GoC proposal to modify the two EEPs was subsequently accepted formally by
the World Bank. At year end, three EEPs still failed to meet the “70% rule? threshold for fiscal year 2011
(Jan.-Dec.). According to project rules, the programmed disbursement for March 2012 would be reduced by
30 percent, and those funds would be canceled from the loan. However, at GoC request, the World Bank
ultimately agreed to accept expenditures against the three non-compliant EEPs until March 2012 (EEP #048),
May 2012 (EEP #196), and October 2012 (EEP #033) for purposes of meeting the “70% rule.?

19.     An unforeseen problem occurred in August 2012 when, for reasons unrelated to the project, the
Municipal Government of Fortaleza decided to return the funds it received from the GoC in 2011 as an
intergovernmental transfer under EEP #554 to support Family Health Teams. Should the return of those
funds signify that the GoC was in ex post non-compliance with the 2011 “70% rule? for that EEP? The GoC
proposed, and the World Bank accepted, the ex post substitution of expenditures from a different budget
program to meet the expenditure requirements.

(b) Performance against Disbursement-Linked Indicators

20.      A summary of overall DLI performance is provided in Table 2. There were 14 project DLIs. Thus, if
the GoC failed to meet a DLI target, then 1/14th of the funds eligible for disbursement would be withheld. 1
Any amount withheld was carried over to the next disbursement period (until the project’s final year). Three
health sector DLIs were unmet during project implementation, requiring the GoC to “play catch-up.?
However, at project closing, only the health sector ONA indicator was unmet, representing 50 percent of a
single DLI. 2 The amount of the loan linked to that performance metric (US$1,077,620) was cancelled at
project closing.

  A consulting company was to be contracted to help prepare a selected hospital for accreditation. However, the contract
was never issued. An ONA assessment team visited São Vicente de Paulo Hospital in June 2011 for a pre-evaluation,
and then returned in January 2012. Despite progress, the ONA team judged that the hospital did not meet all the
standards required for ONA Level 1 certification.

21.     The DLI to install hospital cost-accounting systems was unmet in 2009 and 2010 largely due to TA
contracting delays. Meeting this indicator was contingent upon TA to support for the system methodology,
software installation and training (see Annex 2, Table 5). When contracting for those services was delayed,
the DLI was necessarily unmet. Also in the health sector the target for AMQ classification of Family Health
Teams was unmet in 2009. Performance accelerated to meet the 2010 and 2011 targets after a SESA staff
person was assigned directly as a liaison to the Family Health Teams to facilitate their participation.

22.     Concerning water supply and sanitation, the 2009 performance report submitted to the World Bank
revealed that the CAGECE targets for urban water and sewer connections were set at too low a level to
represent a genuine challenge. Consequently, at the World Bank’s request, the numerical targets for this DLI
were formally increased for 2010 and 2011 to ensure that further disbursements against those indicators
would require, at a minimum, continuation of the performance level reached in 2009 (see Table 3).

(c) Tracking “Secondary Indicators?

23.     At each monthly project management meeting the GoC tracked performance against 14 “secondary
indicators,? involving ten different government entities (Table 1). Government M&E of these indicators
clearly was heightened by their inclusion in the SWAp II; and there is considerable anecdotal evidence that
monitoring had an impact on government actions. For example, in 2010 the water quality indicator
underperformed significantly. Consequently, COGERF called a meeting in early 2011 with ARCE,
CAGECE, CIDADES, COGERH, CONPAM, SESA and SRH to discuss the turbidity problem. Subsequent
analysis suggested the problem was attributable largely to increased pollution in the watersheds that feed
urban water supplies. Policy steps to reduce the problem are under development and will likely be a focus of
the PforR operation.

24.     In another example, rigorous tracking of infant weight/height revealed a worrisome trend that may not
have been detected promptly without the secondary indicator: obesity is an emergent problem among Ceará’s
poor. GoC officials suspect the federal government’s income support program Bolsa Família has altered
consumption patterns, including an increase in the purchase of processed foods and sugars. A public health
education program may be launched in response.

25.     Although secondary indicators had no impact on disbursements, the GoC requested changes to the
secondary indicator targets established in the PAD when a technical factor beyond GoC control could explain
poor performance. In response, the water quality target and EBTIDA targets were formally revised in 2011.



                                                         6
(d) Technical Assistance

26.     An additional lesson of the first SWAp was that the amount of TA funding was overly ambitious—
notwithstanding the fact that in Northeast Brazil the GoC has a relatively high-performing government
administration. That lesson was incorporated into the SWAp II design, which reduced the amount of TA in
absolute terms (to US$3.67 million) and as a share of overall project financing (1.5 percent). Nevertheless,
the GoC again had difficulty moving forward with all of the programmed TA procurement, which ultimately
entailed 32 activities (31 completed) under the responsibility of 12 separate government entities. (A list of all
TA activities and their contract amounts are listed in Annex 2, Table 5.)

27.       Implementation of the TA component improved significantly in 2011 after the GoC recruited new
staff to the project management unit to work solely on TA procurement. A focused procurement training
event also was offered by the World Bank from May 30-June 3, 2011. Attendees included both members of
the Project Implementation Unit as well as the State Audit Court (TCE) and the State Office of the
Comptroller General (CGE).

28.     The opportunity to reallocate TA resources from non-performing activities to new ones was built into
the SWAp II design. At project closing the GoC had executed nearly 93 percent of the funds originally
allocated to TA. As provided in the SWAp II design, the remaining undisbursed TA funds (US$264,800)
were “rolled over? to the SWAp component of the loan for the final 2012 disbursement. Then, those funds
could have been subjected to the application of the 2012 performance targets to determine the amount for
disbursement to the GoC (with the remainder designated for cancellation). However, all of the unused TA
funds were disbursed to the GoC treasury without a performance filter.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.     Consistent with the project goals, GoC systems were used to report projected and actual EEP
expenditures, as well as annual DLI performance. The PAD included a proviso allowing the World Bank to
request an independent verification audit if the reported data were ever deemed unreliable; but the
performance data provided by the GoC were considered credible.

30.     Each secretary/sector was represented by a key technical staff person on a SWAp II Committee. The
Committee met monthly (38 meetings in all) for each representative to report on progress in achieving
indicators, budget execution and technical assistance. Several of those interviewed for the ICR spoke
favorably of the monthly meetings, saying they came away from the experience with a fuller understanding of
interconnected activities of the state government and an appreciation of the positive effects spurred by
working toward explicit performance targets.

31.     In contrast, there is little evidence for the spread of results-based-management precepts beyond
the technical staff directly involved in the SWAp II. Performance data by secretariat were reported in the
governor’s annual budget submission to the legislature, as required by a DLI. In addition, Outputs-Results
Reports (ORRs) were introduced to examine in depth the effectiveness of public expenditure to achieve
outcomes of concern. 3 However, both World Bank supervision staff and IPECE believe the quality of the
ORRs has been mixed. There is no evidence to date that secretariat performance data or ORR findings have
been part of budget debates. SEPLAG observed that many secretariats would benefit from training in results-



3
 The selection of programs to be assessed each year via an ORR was determined by the Committee for Fiscal and
Results-Based Management (COGERF), a type of “supercabinet? composed of the four most powerful state secretaries:
Planning and Management, Fazenda, Controladoria, and Casa Civil.


                                                       7
based management to support a broader adoption of these precepts. Institutionalizing results-based
management at the level of sector agencies will be a focus of the follow-up PforR operation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     The project triggered OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment, Category B), OP/BP 4.10 (Indigenous
Peoples), and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). Medical waste disposal triggered the Environmental
Assessment. No project activities or indicators focused on medical waste, per se; but hospital quality
licensing standards include an examination of waste disposal. A Health Waste Management Strategy and an
Environmental and Social Management Framework were prepared during project preparation to describe
appropriate steps and principles to address medical waste disposal. This was followed by TA support under
the project to prepare a plan to integrate medical waste disposal with the state’s overall policy for solid waste
disposal.

33.      As a direct result of the SWAp the Health Secretariat undertook a series of activities to enable the
safe handling of health care waste. These included: 1) Basic training on health waste management for 33
technical staff of the health compliance agency; 2) Participation in the Technical Committee on Urban Solid
Waste which resulted in the joint evaluation (with SEMACE, SCIDADES, CONPAM) of municipalities’
compliance with the state Decree obliging the use of appropriate equipment for the selective collection and
final disposal of health and contaminated waste; 3) Participation in the Technical Committee on
Pharmaceutical Products resulting in finding solutions for the final destination and treatment of medical
products (Group B - chemicals); 4) Inspection of Health Care facilities.

34.      Recognizing the importance of finding a definitive solution for solid waste disposal, the state also
prepared a planning document which has served to guide the identification of appropriate solutions in all
municipalities and districts. This proposal serves as a vehicle for updating local governments with current
policies and legislation such as Federal legislation which obliges all municipalities to have their Solid Waste
Management Plan in effect by 2014.

35.      The solid waste management model adopted allows each municipality to directly administer the
collection and final disposition of waste. This is being implemented through third parties who collect waste in
and urban and rural settings. The Cities Secretariat anticipates the formation of 23 public solid waste consortia.
As of October 2012, eight have already been concluded and those remaining are being prepared with the
direct assistance of the state. Also being concluded is the Regionalization of Solid Waste Management
proposal. The state and regional Solid Waste Management Plans will follow. The State Solid Waste Policy
has been revised and the draft law is being finalized for submission to the legislature.

36.     The state has also undertaken a qualitative and quantitative inventory of industrial waste which has
allowed for implementing a policy that supports waste minimization, reutilization, recycling, treatment and
appropriate final disposition.

37.    Ceará citizens who self-identify as indigenous peoples were potential beneficiaries of the service
improvements supported by the SWAp II. This triggered OP/BP 4.10. During project preparation an
Indigenous People’s Framework was drafted following input from a meeting with the Kanidés in Aratuba.
TA resources were subsequently used prepare a document describing traditional medicinal plants and a
second documents on indigenous art and handicrafts in Ceará. In April 2011 these documents were launched




                                                       8
at an event with the indigenous leaders of the Tremembé de Almofala, Pitaguary, Tapeba, Kanindé, Jenipapo-
Kanindé e Anacé. Copies of both documents were delivered to all indigenous schools in Ceará.4

38.     Basic infrastructure services financed by the project focused on connecting existing households to
water and sewerage networks. These investments were not expected to cause physical displacement of
people. However, OP/BP for Involuntary Resettlement was triggered as a precaution. As it happened,
however, the works required for the SANEAR II program led to the resettlement of 114 families in Fortaleza
and the interior of the state. The appropriate framework, involving both consultation and compensation, was
applied and the physical and symbolic impact of the resettlement was kept to a minimum. As required, the
GoC notified the World Bank before the actions were taken.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.      The World Bank and GoC began to discuss a follow-up operation in 2012, months before the SWAp
II closed. A workshop was held in Fortaleza on May 24-25, 2012, where the World Bank presented a new
lending model, the “Program for Results? (PforR), to the governor and staff from all government sectors.
Under the PforR model, disbursements again will be tied to performance indicators.

40.      There is tentative agreement that a new operation will support GoC programs in (i) public sector
management, (ii) private sector development, (iii) poverty reduction, and (iv) water management. The
specific activities to be supported in the Ceará PforR reflect an effort to build upon the accomplishments of
the previous Ceará SWAps, while focusing on specific weaknesses. For example, regarding results-based
management the draft PforR Project Concept Note (PCN) proposes to focus on RBM adoption in line
secretariats (i.e., below the level of department heads and senior technical staff). Similarly, in the water
sector the PCN proposes a focus on improved water quality via strengthened watershed management and
solid waste management. Both issues were identified and studied during the SWAp II (see section 2.2(c) and
section 2.4).

41.     Improved investment planning, innovation support, targeted vocational training and early childhood
development are likely to be part of a Ceará PforR. It is expected that loan disbursements will be linked only
to DLI performance triggers, and no longer to a “70% rule? for budget execution – as the credibility of budget
execution is no longer in question. Still, consistent with the two prior SWAps, the supported activities will be
mapped to planned budget expenditures in the GoC PPA. The financial management requirements for GoC
budget expenditures included in the PforR program will be a key subject of discussion/ negotiation both
within the World Bank and with the client.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High

42.     The SWAp II loan fit squarely within the stated priorities of the last Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS), including expanding World Bank support for state-level governments in Brazil and tackling complex
development challenges in an integrated, multi-sector fashion. The project activities aligned with four of the
six “paradigmatic challenges? identified in the CPS, namely, “fiscal and public sector management,? “private
sector development,? “infrastructure,? and “human development & education.?

43.     The project design also aligned well with the World Bank’s results focus. Except for the small TA
component, loan funds disbursed only against monitored performance outputs. The DLIs featured outputs
(not outcomes), which maintained a close linkage between GoC activities and SWAp II targets.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory
44.     The project DLIs and secondary indicators may be assigned to the five specific project development
objectives. Successful performance against DLI targets—only one half of one DLI was unmet by project
closing—is suggestive that the specific PDOs were at least partially achieved:

      1. help the Government of Ceará to improve its fiscal situation
         The state’s current fiscal balance increased from R$1,296 million in 2007 to R$1,882 million in 2011,
         and without increasing the burden of any particular sector for tax revenues (tax concentration).
      2. strengthen the state’s system of results-based management
         Annual Performance Reports and ORRs were produced, although with limited utilization to date.
         RBM precepts are increasingly commonplace in work of senior staff.
      3. promote better service quality in education (particularly early-childhood literacy) and health
         The early-childhood literacy program was installed. Second-grade literacy increased from 56.0 to
         81.4 percent of students tested from 2009 to 2011 (Annex 2, Table 4).
         Ceara’s performance on Brazil’s Basic Education Development Index (Ideb) for 4th grade students
         was 4.9 in 2011. The score for schools in the state network (excluding municipal and private schools)
         rose 0.7 points from 2007-2009 and 0.2 points from 2009 to 2011. 5 Attribution of Ideb improvements
         to the SWAp II has not been demonstrated.
         Hospital cost-accounting systems have reduced unnecessary expenditures and led to increases in the
         number of patients treated per month (see Annex 3). Family Health Teams have improved their
         quality ratings. There is no direct evidence of health improvements resulting from improved Family
         Health Teams.
      4. improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency of the government
         autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery
         Urban water connections grew from 51,300 in 2007 to 315,800 in 2011. Sewer connections rose from
         22,400 to 139,800 over the same period. Water losses remained under 27 percent. The CAGECE
         EBTIDA margin, a secondary indicator, did not display a clear trend but fluctuated between 25 and
         30 percent (Annex 2, Table 4).
      5. reduce barriers to business investment
         The share of new businesses registered in less than 72 hours grew from 19 percent to 80 percent. The
         population within reach of high-speed internet service increased by over 4 million. The cost of data
         transmission fell sharply (see Annex 3) and teleconferencing in the health sector has reduced
         operational costs (see Annex 3).

45.      The overall outcome of the loan is rated satisfactory. All PDOs were advanced under this
operation (section 3.2). Some activities clearly were “highly satisfactory,? as the change brought about
during the project was very positive and the role of the project in achieving that outcome was unambiguous.
In other instances the government achievement was positive, but the same outcome may have occurred even
without the SWAp II (see Table 3).

* Subjective judgments by the author based on interviews and project reports. “Achievement? refers to the period 2007-
2011. “Attribution? refers to the importance of the SWAp II in realizing a given achievement. A “High? rating indicates
the change very likely would not have occurred without the SWAp II. A “Low? rating suggests the GoC may have
reasonably achieved the same result without the SWAp II project.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


46.   From 2007 to 2011 the share of Cearenses living below the poverty line (defined as ½ the 2011
minimum wage, adjusted for inflation) fell from 60.9 to 49.4 percent.6 That is a highly significant reduction.
However, it is impossible to disentangle the effect of the GoC “inclusive growth? strategy from the positive
economic growth and poverty reduction trajectory achieved in Brazil during this period.

47.     The social development improvements in education and health are discussed above (section 3.2).
There were no explicit gender aspects in the SWAp II design. However, women constituted a clear majority
of the parents who met with the author in August 2012 to share their opinions (highly positive overall) of
GoC actions to improve primary education.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
48.     In addition to the institutional modernization of the state demonstrated by annual, state-wide student
exams, the introduction of Annual Performance Reports and ORRs, Family Health Team quality certification,
and revised procedures for business registration, the SWAp II appears to have made a fundamental
contribution, via the “70% rule,? to greater state budget credibility. (The approved budget has become
increasingly reliable as a signal of actual government spending.) 7 If continued under future elected
governments, this change will constitute one of the most important management improvements
fomented by the SWAp II.

49.      In addition, utilizing the TCE for the project’s financial audit led to positive institutional development
externalities. Several government personnel in line departments praised a newfound cooperative relationship
with the TCE, with the State Tribunal focused on a preventive audit to avoid problems from occurring in the
first place. (When SECITECE had a question about a Terms of Reference, they contacted the TCE in
advance to determine the proper course to follow.) The TCE also would present its preliminary audit findings
in formal meeting with IPECE and the respective line department. Some issues then could be resolved easily
before appearing in the TCE final findings (which could trigger the need for obligatory and more burdensome
responses). TCE staff also spoke highly favorably of their participation in the SWAp II—though as this audit
role represents an addition to the Tribunal’s work program, TCE officials also conveyed their hope that the
TCE would benefit from additional TA funding if the TCE is to perform a similar role under a new lending
operation.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative): N/A

  No beneficiary survey was conducted. In August 2012 a meeting of parents, attended by the author, was convened by
the SEDUC for parents to share their opinions of recent advances with student exams, literacy programs, and technical
education. This was not a randomly-selected group of parents, but rather a group with a high level of participation in
meetings/activities concerning the schools in their neighborhood.

50.     GoC fiscal performance has been strong and steady (see Table 2). Governor Cid Gomes was
reelected to a four-year term in 2010 during SWAp II implementation. RBM progress has been modest, as
the discussion of Secretariat Annual Performance Reports and ORRs attests. Indicator-driven management
has grown more prevalent in GoC administration, but RBM is a task to be promoted further in a follow-up
operation rather than a strong result at risk of backsliding.

51.      The benefits of the broadband internet backbone are, practically speaking, irreversible. Moreover,
certain project outcomes are now fully incorporated into the government practices with staff and citizens. For
example, SPAECE exams in education were formally given to only a sample of students. Now the exam is
given to all students in a given grade. And grade by grade within the state education network teachers,
administrators meet to go over the results to identify weaknesses and focus on areas for improvement.

52.      Reducing the time required to register a business has involved non-state actors as well as work
processes by SEFAZ staff. The Regional Accounting Council (Conselho Regional de Contabilidade) is an
organization representing professional accountants of the public and private sectors. These professionals used
to assist businesses to register with the GoC by carrying a set of physical documents to SEFAZ, waiting for an
appointment to receive an authorization (usually 15 days). Now the list of required documents has been
reduced, and many may be accessed and returned online. Thus, the services of these professionals, as well as
the internal practices of SEFAZ staff, have been transformed. A return to previous rules and procedures is
highly unlikely and would face opposition.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

See discussion in Section 2.1.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

53.      Reliance on government systems simplified the supervision process and also contributed directly to
strengthening government administration (which was an overarching goal of the project). The World Bank
financial management specialists worked diligently to enable the TCE to perform the financial auditing role
under the project. Those actions contributed to strengthening the TCE while simultaneously improving the
relationship between the TCE and line secretariats.

54.     The health sector faced several challenges during the project to meet their DLIs. In response, a
special mission was carried out by André Medici to identify a way forward. In hindsight, SESA viewed
favorably the World Bank demand for validation of the hospital costing system before it was put in place.
When serious delays surfaced in TA contracting, the World Bank TTL was proactive in finding solutions,
including new staff and specialized training.




                                                     13
55.       A formal mid-term review was not carried out for this project. That was perhaps a missed
opportunity to agree formally any project changes while simultaneously precluding further changes during the
life of the project.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
56.     Overall World Bank performance is deemed “satisfactory? given the strong quality at entry and
several estimable actions during supervision. However, this review considers excessive the extension allowed
by the Bank (from December 2011 until October 2012) for the GoC to satisfy the “70% rule? for fiscal year
2011. This degree of flexibility was welcomed by the client, and improved loan disbursement, but undermines
the incentives embedded in the distribution rules.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

See discussion in sections 2.2 and 2.3.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
See section 2.2(c) and section 2.3.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

57.     Overall performance was strong. Early delays in TA contracting were overcome. Almost all
performance indicators were met, but not without the need for a significant extension in 2012. A few targets
proved to be unambitious (e.g., water and sanitation) or have yet to demonstrate an impact (e.g., Output-
Results Reports).

6. Lessons Learned

58.      Coordination is a challenge. There were fifteen partners in the SWAp II, in addition to the Project
Management Unit. Given the SWAp II PDOs, the project was necessarily multi-sector, with multiple
implementation partners. The project’s success owed much to the strong role played by IPECE in conducting
monthly project meetings and following up as problems arose. Nevertheless, fifteen partners pushed the
limits of what could be managed effectively.

59.      Beware the use of outcome indicators that may readily escape government control. There is often a
tension between the desire to incentivize outcomes and the need to maintain what may be called “attribution
fidelity.? This fidelity exists when specific government units and personnel are responsible for carrying out
activities that are linked, in a well-understood causal chain, to the outcome of interest. If a desired outcome
cannot be linked fundamentally to the actions of project partners (perhaps because the indicator is highly
sensitive to factors outside the control of those partners), then output measures are likely to be more
appropriate.

60.    Secondary indicators proved to be a useful innovation of the SWAp II to retain a focus on an
important outcome metric (e.g., water quality) when “attribution fidelity? was lacking (e.g., water quality
measures were only partially impacted by the actions of CAGECE).



                                                      14
61.      Coordination between distinct levels of government can be particularly fraught. At the 11th hour the
Municipality of Fortaleza decided to return to the state government budget funds that had been transferred in
support of the Family Health Program (see section 2.2a). This problem underscores the importance of
restricting indicators, so far as possible, to actions/activities substantially controlled by the client.

62.      Extraordinary efforts are warranted during project design to reduce information asymmetries. To
strengthen RBM it is useful to employ internal secretariat management indicators as project disbursement
triggers … and vice versa. The client should be reassured that targets for performance under the project do
not necessarily have to match the internal management target, given the different uses of the indicators.

63.      A single indicator may hide other relevant data. SEMACE succeeded in meeting its secondary
indicator targets to reduce the average time to issue an environmental license (Annex 2, Table 4). Changes in
workflow, a reduction in the number of required documents, and an electronic appointments system were all
significant improvements. “Self-declaration? (subject to ex post audit) by small agricultural producers was
another innovation that eliminated the need for approximately 3,000 licenses over a 6-month period.
Nevertheless, to meet the SWAp II target, older license requests (which would not meet the time target) were
allowed to accumulate. The backlog of old requests grew to over 9,200 in March 2012, though the SWAp II
target was met.

64.    How much flexibility is too much? Some flexibility is warranted for the World Bank to approve
modifications or extensions to meet performance targets. However, a high degree of flexibility risks
undermining the performance incentives of the targets. The Bank should consider stipulating in the project
documentation that major accommodations must be justified by factors fully beyond GoC control (e.g., the
Municipality of Fortaleza decision discussed above).

65.      World Bank financial management rules and reporting systems remained a burden, even for a
relatively sophisticated client like the GoC. Notwithstanding the “country systems? mindset that
characterized the SWAp II, the anti-fraud and anti-corruption clauses demanded by the Bank posed
difficulties for the GoC, as a number of EEP contracts predated the project (and thus lacked the clauses).
Moreover, the obligation to comply with World Bank financial requirements for an amount of budget
expenditure that dwarfed the size of the SWAp transfers was clearly unappreciated by the client. The same
antipathy did not arise concerning TA expenditures.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

66.     A few technical staff in line secretariats expressed disappointment at not having participated in the
discussion of specific indicators and activities that were committed to under the SWAp II. While all
indicators, including their protocols and targets, were agreed with representatives of each secretariat, this
comment indicates that, in some instances, discussions should have included a somewhat larger group.
During project preparation World Bank staff might underscore, at the risk of being redundant, that the client
should attempt to identify all lead technical staff that will be responsible for implementation tasks, and to
have them present at discussions.

                                 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The government priority programs included under the SWAp II project as EEPs, as well as their projected
budgets, are listed in Error! Reference source not found.. Many of the DLI achievements promoted by the
loan, as well as related TA activities, are not amenable to a direct economic and financial analysis. (For
example, what are the specific savings that result from improved government contracting?) At one extreme,
the economic benefit of the output/outcome will be long-term (e.g., improved childhood literacy; a distance
learning center opening in Sobral following the spread of broadband internet; improved quality of Family
Health Teams). Meanwhile, there are SWAp II activities that produced a near-immediate impact, but for
which it is difficult to quantify the economic benefit precisely. In this category we can include the reduction
in days required to register a business. That change has reduced the costs associated with starting a new
business; but it is difficult to quantify the savings.

As a second example, the Regional Hospital in Juazeiro (located approximately 600 kilometers from
Fortaleza) now conducts virtual meetings between officers in the capital and staff on site using the broadband
infrastructure of the Cinturão Digital. Previously, 8-9 people from the management team traveled weekly
from Fortaleza to Juazeiro. Today a physical trip happens approximately once every 2 months. The
associated cost savings could be quantified, but was beyond the time/resource limitations of the ICR.

Still, there is a set of SWAp II activities to which we can already assign specific financial costs and benefits.
These activities include broadband internet, hospital cost systems, and CPREV.
Public investment in the broadband internet backbone totaled approximately R$72 million. One consequence
is that the cost of data transmission for government has dropped precipitously (from R$20 million/year in
2007 to only R$4 million/year in 2011). Moreover, the GoC is expected to recover more than its total
investment in 2012 by auctioning access to the network to private internet providers. The auction will take
place in three lots. The minimum price for all three lots together is R$39 million; and the true auction price is
expected to be much higher.

In addition, a SWAp II secondary indicator tracked GoC actions to cross state pension records with federal
data bases to identify irregularities. The average time to remove the deceased from the state pension roles
declined from 2.75 months in 2009 to 1.99 months in 2011. The financial return from a TA activity regarding
pensions was more dramatic. By contracting with a firm to search state pension records for public employees
that formerly worked for the federal government (and thus should have part of their pension cost covered by
the federal INSS system), more than 2,100 cases were identified for submission to INSS. Of these, 961 cases
already have been vetted and approved by INSS, leading to a payment of R$26,000,000 to the GoC to cover
payments already made to pensioners from the GoC budget. Moreover, an additional R$302,000/month is
received to cover ongoing pension payments.

In the health sector, the cost-accounting system implemented in select hospitals has led to financial savings,
as well. By generating comparable cost data, the Regional Hospital of Iguatu discovered that patients were
waiting too many days in the hospital for surgeries. The average time was reduced from 8.19 days in 2011 to
6.98 days in 2012, enabling a 20 percent increase in the overall number of patients served and reducing the
total cost per patient by approximately 20 percent. The São Vicente Hospital uncovered that their overtime
costs in their radiology unit was much higher than the norm in other hospitals. With further investigation the
managers discovered that radiologists were doing a lot of administrative work; an administrative employee
was hired to handle the administrative burden and overtime costs were cut sharply.

The Borrower’s ICR offers a positive account of the SWAp II, very similar to the present ICR. In addition to
recounting the financial flows and mission schedules, the Borrower’s account provides final commentary
from each of the fifteen project counterparts. The positive observations are largely captured in the ICR text
above. Critical views, or “lessons learned,? include the following:

    •   As cited above in section 7(a), a few technical staff in line secretariats expressed disappointment at
        not having participated in the discussion of specific indicators and activities that were committed to
        under the SWAp II.
    •   In addition, SESA was disappointed that one of the health sector indicators concerned ONA
        accreditation of a hospital that is a philanthropic hospital managed by a “Social Organization? (quasi-
        public), and not under the direct authority of SESA. (This echoes the ICR recommendation to avoid
        indicators that are not under the direct influence of the project counterparts.)
    •   Avoid indicators that depend upon TA activities (in case the TA contracting encounters problems of
        its own).
    •   The GoC departments/agencies involved in the project should develop procedures to transmit project-
        related commitments and information to all levels of the organization.
    •   Make a greater effort to disseminate the Secretariat Annual Performance Reports and the Output-
        Results Reports, though the press but particularly to the relevant legislative Commissions.
    •   Use existing government contracting rules for Project Management Unit consultants rather than short-
        term arrangements that lead to excessive turnover.
    •   The role of COGERF in the project could have been specified and understood better by the parties.
    •   Audit of the EEPs should be carried out before disbursements, if possible.
    •   EEP expenditures ideally should be in line with project financing. That is, in one case an EEP was
        8.2 times greater than the overall size of the loan, but the reporting “burden? applied to the EEP as a
        whole.
    •   Expenditures to satisfy the 70% rule should not have to comply with World Bank norms for
        procurement and financial reporting. Rather, these World Bank rules should apply only to TA funds.

This final critique surfaced multiple times from the project preparation and negotiation phase though to the
project’s final year. The client presently anticipates that the PforR model will address this concern in a future
operation.
