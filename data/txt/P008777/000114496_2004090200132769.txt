employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be
selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the
Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World

Bank, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where
no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, the

exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of reference for
such contracts nor to the employment of individuals, to single source
selection of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as reasonably
determined by the Bank and to amendments of contracts raising the contract
value to $100,000 equivalent or above.

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice

or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

                 Outline of the Petroleum Sector Strategy
    The basic elements of the Petroleum Sector Strategy comprise:
1.  institutional reforms of the oil and gas sector aimed at enhancing the
effectiveness of oil and gas exploration and production, especially by
facilitating the entry of foreign investors;
2.  development of a petroleum law and establishment of a national
regulatory agency for mineral resources (NAMR) independent of the oil and
gas entities operating in the sector; with said agency to be responsible for
granting concessions, regulating corporate activities in the sector and
enforcing pricing policies;
3.  restructuring of the main entities operating in the sector as a means
of ensuring efficient management, corporate planning and commercial
orientation;
4.  development of a national social safety net program to cater for surplus
staff that may occur as a result of the corporate restructuring of the
entities operating in the sector;
5.  rehabilitation and modernization of the oil and gas transmission and
distribution pipeline networks as a means of enhancing the capability and
efficiency of the systems;
6.  instituting, by the entities operating in the sector, of acceptable
accounting principles to ensure financial accountability through the setting
up of financial criteria to which said entities will be held accountable;
7.  development of a fuel policy for the rationalization of supply and
demand of energy resources including modification of producer and consumer
pricing policies of energy resources as a means of resource mobilization for
the development of the sector;
8.  development of a comprehensive program for addressing environmental
issues; and
9.  undertaking a program for the promotion of oil and gas exploration and
of enhanced oil recovery, and establish model production sharing agreements
and contracts with foreign oil companies, either alone or in joint ventures
with the entities operating in the sector.
