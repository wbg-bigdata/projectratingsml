c/       This percentage represents the share of private interests in the capital structure of the distribution
companies. By end-2002, for each distribution company, the private sector is expected to have at least 51
percent of the equity; by end-2007, for each distribution company, the share of the private sector is
expected to increase to at least 70 percent.
This development objective will be achieved with steady progress over an agreed 10-year program
including the following phases:
Phase I        Establishment of a new legal, regulatory and institutional framework, and removal of some of
the most critical bottlenecks of the power system (1998-99);
Phase ll       Privatization of the distribution business; achievement of financial sustainability in the sector,
and improvements in system efficiency (1999-2002);
Phase 111    Consolidation of the functioning and financial situation of the new power utilities, and
achievement of more reliable power supplies (2002-04);
Phase IV       Achievement of higher consumer satisfaction through the reduction of the power deficit,
attainment of higher quality and efficiency in electricity services, and furtherance of power
sector reforms to increase competition and private participation (2004-2007).
2. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The development objective of the Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project is to support the first
phase of the reform process by establishing the new legal, regulatory and institutional framework
(including the creation of an independent regulatory commission and of the new power corporations),
initiating the privatization of the distribution business, and removing the most critical bottlenecks of the
power system with a view to demonstrating - in a few selected areas - the benefits which could be
expected from a successful reform of the power sector.

B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related CAS goal supported by the program (see Annex 1):
The sector-related goal stated in the CAS is to contain power infrastructure bottlenecks by promoting and
implementing comprehensive state power sector reforms. The promotion of sectoral reforms at the state
level contributes to state finance adjustment, and aims at building institutional capability and increasing
resource mobilization for public and private infrastructure investment. By reducing pressures on the
State's public finances, and removing sectoral constraints to the State's economic growth, power sector
reforms will facilitate sustainable poverty reduction.
Document Name: India: Country Assistance Strategy (Report 14509-IN of May 19,1995). Date of latest
CAS discussion: India: GAS Progress Report of May 9, 1996. The executive directors will discuss the
latest joint Bank and IFC CAS for India at the same time as this project on Jaruary 15, 1998.
2. Main Sector issues and Government's strategy:
India's Power Industry
India's power industry is characterized by inadequate and inefficient power supply. Peak capacity and
energy supply shortages are estimated to be over 20 percent and 15 percent respectively. The sector is
plagued by major revenue shortfalls due to low tariffs, heavy cross-subsidies, and extremely poor
collection performance. The sector's heavy reliance on increasingly tight state budget resources has
constrained power expansion and systems upgrading. In 1991, in an effort to mobilize resources for
power plant additions, the Government of India has opened the power generation to private sector
investments. However, private investments have not been readily forthcoming without Central
Government assurances of counter guarantees. It has since become evident that in the absence of major
structural and regulatory reforms in the power sector, notably at the state level, no revenue enhancement
and investment mobilization would be sustainable. Accordingly, the Government of India, with the
assistance of the Bank, has been encouraging States to undertake in depth power sector reforms.
Selected state governments, including Haryana, have decided to embark on such reforms. (This has
been documented in the recent CEMs, the ESW report on "India: Energy Sector Issues and Options", and
the SAR for the Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project.)
Main Sector Issues in Haryana
Haryana's power sector is in a poor physical and financial situation, which affects the economic growth of
the state and the welfare of its population. Over the last 8 years, there has been no addition in generating



Project Appraisal Document                                                            Page 4
India                                                         Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
capacity and maintenance has been kept to a minimum. In 1997, the energy deficit exceeded 25 percent.
Technical and non-technical losses are estimated conservatively at 3540 percent. The Haryana State
Electricity Board (HSEB), the vertically integrated, state-owned utility, is in a critical financial situation. The
accumulated commercial losses of HSEB (excluding State's subsidies) have reached Rs. 34 billion (US$
940 million); HSEB's negative net worth (Rs. 2.9 billion in 1997) reflects the magnitude of the financial
crisis. This situation is largely due to abnormally high distribution losses and to low tariffs charged to
agricultural and residential consumers. The State government has heavily subsidized HSEB, directly and
indirectly (see section E.2 and Annexes 5 and 12). Given the deterioration of its fiscal situation, it is no
longer possible for the Government to support the functioning and development of the power sector.
Causes
The root cause of this situation - now largely recognized and accepted by Haryana's policymakers - is the
pervasive politicization of most decisions affecting HSEB!s operations and expansion, and the resulting
lack of a commercial outlook in its functioning. The state has regarded HSEB as an extension of the
government and has exerted influence over its tariff, operational, personnel, procurement and investment
decisions to further political objectives. As a consequence, HSEB has been required to charge low tariffs
to agriculture and residential consumers, and to undertake or continue unremunerative activities on behalf
of the state government without proper compensation; HSEB has not been able to enforce normal
remedies to collect bills, and to take bold measures to eliminate the large system non-technical losses.
HSEB, impeded for many years from behaving as a commercial entity, has thus been progressively
transformed into an extension of the state government, unable to meet the power requirements of the
state.
Challenge and Government Strategy
The demand for power is expected to grow at about 8 percent per year. Eliminating the power deficit and
meeting this potential demand - through supply and end-use efficiency improvements and additional
capacities- require overall capital expenditures in excess of US$ 4 billion in generation, transmission and
distribution facilities over the next ten years (either by Haryana's utilities or bulk power suppliers such as
NTPC and IPPs). This is the challenge that Haryana's political leaders have decided to address.
Haryana's long-term vision is that of a financially healthy sector, securing enough power - by purchase
from NTPC and other central or regional utilities, from private IPPs, or from State sector companies;
power utilities focusing on their clients' needs and providing high quality services; the Government no
longer needing to provide subsidies, loans and guarantees-and actually deriving a net income from the
power sector, and an incentive system rewarding efficiency and success. The Govemment of Haryana is
now convinced that the State's power requirements cannot be met without a massive mobilization of
private financial resources, the restoration of the creditworthiness of the power utilities, and the
establishment of a proper enabling environment, notably a regulatory framework, which would insulate the
power sector from external influences and provide the appropriate incentives for efficiency. The ultimate
objective of the reforms decided by Haryana is for the Government to withdraw from the power sector as
an operator and regulator of utilities and to have commercially operated, largely privately-owned utilities
functioning in a competitive and appropriately regulated power market.
3. Sector issues to be Addressed by the Program and Strategic Choices
The Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program is designed to address the above
issues. In shaping the strategy which underpins this program, Haryana has made a number of strategic
choices relating to the structure, regulation, and ownership of the power industry, and the implementation
approach.
a.     Unbundled power industry versus integrated monopoly. Haryana has decided to unbundle its
power industry into separate generation, transmission and distribution activities. The new
structure of the industry is expected to facilitate: (i) functional specialization; (ii) private
participation in each of the activities of the sector; (iii) efficient regulation of the sector; (iv)
transparency, autonomy and accountability in the governance of the sector; and (v) in the longer

India                                                        Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
term, competition in the power industry. As an initial step, the industry will be structured along the
"single buyer model"; at later stage, the industry structure is expected to evolve to allow wholesale
competition.
b.    Independent regulation versus state regulation. Haryana has decided to provide for an
independent regulation of the sector to minimize the interference of the State's Government, and
the politicization of key sector decisions (for example, on tariffs).
c.     Private versus public ownership. Given the massive financing requirements, Haryana has
decided that new generation facilities, except when developed by regional or central utilities,
would be developed by independent private power producers. Haryana has decided to privatize its
distribution business since this appears to be the best (if not the only) solution to reduce the huge
non-technical losses, which plague the sector; in addition, Haryana expects that, in the longer
term, private distributors would contribute to financing the large required investments.
d.    Integrated planning versus supply side planning. Hitherto, in Haryana, power sector plans
focused almost exclusively on new supply. To encourage the most economically efficient
allocation of resources, emphasis will be laid on integrating all resources including energy
efficiency and DSM in the power planning process to effectively manage demand and optimize
generation capacity.
e.    Aggressive implementation versus gradualism. Haryana has decided to implement the reform
program aggressively, notably to create the new institutional and regulatory framework in 1998;
and to privatize most of the distribution business by 2001. Besides political considerations (the
next state elections are due in 2001), this strategy aims at reducing uncertainty periods, and at
generating quickly efficiency improvements, which would minimize the tariff adjustments needed
to restore the creditworthiness of the utilities.
4. The Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program
4.1. Reform Program
Industry and Market Structure
Initially two corporations will be created out of HSEB. Generation functions will be transferred to Haryana
Generation Company (GENCO). Transmission, distribution and system operation functions will be
transferred to Haryana Transmission Company (TRANSCO). GENCO and TRANSCO will be established
as state-owned corporations. TRANSCO will subsequently transfer the distribution functions to a number
of distribution companies. The distribution companies will initially be state-owned corporations.
GENCO and TRANSCO would enter into long term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Following the
establishment of the separate distribution companies, TRANSCO would become their bulk supplier. Over
time, the distribution companies would also be expected to enter into direct power purchase agreements
with generators and other bulk suppliers, TRANSCO increasingly focusing on transmission and system
operations. The pace of movement from the single-buyer model to multi-buyer model would be
determined inter-alia by the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission based on the creditworthiness of
the individual distributors, the experience and knowledge gained on the functioning of the restructured
industry, and the potential for wholesale competition.
Reform Legislkition and Regulatory Framework
A complete reform legislation (the Haryana Electricity Reform Bill) has been approved by the State
Assembly in July 1997 for the restructuring of the electricity industry and the establishment of the Haryana
Electricity Regulatory Commission. Haryana will enact the Bill when the President of India's Assent has
been granted. Haryana expects to make the Act effective in April 1998, and establish GENCO,
TRANSCO and the Regulatory Commission at the same time. The Regulatory Commission will be fully
functional by end 1998. The distribution companies are expected to be established in September 1998.

India                                                       Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
Privatization of Distribution
The distribution companies will be progressively privatized through the sale of equity shares to strategic
private investors. Haryana expects that the privatization of the first distribution company will be completed
between end 1998 and mid 1999. The other companies are expected to be privatized before end CY
2001. Given the lack of experience in privatization of distribution and the uncertainties surrounding such
transactions, it would be unrealistic for Haryana to set a more precise schedule. The reactions of private
investors to the new institutional, legal and regulatory regime will also need to be assessed, in Haryana
but also in other states, like Orissa and Rajasthan. Based on these reactions, Haryana, like other states,
may have to take additional measures (including amending the Haryana Electricity Reform Act) to attract
private sector in the distribution business.
4.2. Investment Program (see Annex 12 for more detailed description)
Investment in generation would be carried out essentially by IPPs, central and regional power utilities, and,
in the case of imports of power from neighboring countries, by foreign power utilities and developers.
Haryana's utilities would purchase the additional power, and would not incur any investment expenditures
in generation (except for the rehabilitation of the existing power stations). The proposed APLs would
support, to the extent of US$ 600 million, the investment program that Haryana's utilities would implement,
and which amounts to about US$ 1.8 billion (see Annex 12). This program would focus on the
rehabilitation and modernization of the existing power stations at Panipat and Faridabad (US$ 235 million),
the rehabilitation and expansion of the transmission and distribution systems, and DSM and energy
efficiency measures. The proposed APLs would notably contribute to financing:
a.    The rehabilitation and expansion of the transmission system (indicative cost of the component
over the program implementation period: US$ 330 million). The objective of this component would
be to: (i) evacuate power from the proposed power plants and bulk supply points to the load
centers; (ii) ensure a high level of reliability of the transmission system; (iii) expand the system to
meet the growing load demand; and (iv) ensure that the transmission losses and voltage
regulation are within permissible limits;
b.    The rehabilitation and expansion of the sub-transmission and distribution system (indicative cost
of the component over the program implementation period: US $ 1,140 million). The objective of
this component would be to: (i) achieve significant reduction in technical and non-technical losses;
(ii) improve the voltage profile, system reliability and efficiency; and (iii) expand the system to
meet the growing demand. IBRD financing would be available essentially during a transition
period, until private distribution companies are in a position to finance on their own the expansion
of the distribution network. If needed, IBRD financing from the APLs could be made available to
the private distribution companies during the initial years of their operations;
c.    The implementation of demand-side management measures (indicative cost of the component
over the program implementation period: US$ 70 million). The objective of this component would
be to: (i) improve the end-use efficiency; (ii) minimize the consequences of the power deficit
through rational load management and power curtailment and demand side management; and (iii)
mitigate the impact of raising retail tariffs. This component would include: (i) the procurement and
installation of load research equipment; (ii) the implementation of specific load management and
energy efficiency investments by the utilities and end-users (such as efficient motors and lighting
equipment in industries, reactive power compensation improvement in industries, co-generation
projects, or efficiency improvements in pumpsets); and (iii) fostering private sector provision of
energy efficiency services; and
d.    Technical assistance and engineering services to assist Haryana power sector's entities in
implementing the reform measures and the investment program (indicative cost of the component
over the program implementation period: US$ 21 million); and, in adddition, compensatory and
redeployment costs which would be determined during project implementation and be, possibly,

proposed for financing through APL 2 and/or subsequent loans.
In addition to APLs, the World Bank Group's support could also include the provision of guarantee to IPPs
and the participation of IFC and/or MIGA in private power generation and/or distribution. Any such
operations would be processed as separate operations.
4.3. Key Conditions for Subsequent Loans (see Annex 13)
The subsequent loans would be considered when the following key milestones agreed with India and
Haryana have been achieved, and would be processed based on the relevant standard Bank's policies
and procedures. Because APLs are intended to allow for adjustments to the program in the light of
experience, the milestones become increasingly uncertain over time. Adjustments to the milestones and
corresponding changes in APL amounts and timing are likely as the program unfolds.
The Second Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project (APL2; indicative amount of $ 150
million) would be considered when:
a.    The Government of Haryana has:
* caused the Haryana Electricity Reform Act to become effective;
* established the new power utilities (GENCO, TRANSCO, and the distribution companies);
* entered into corporatization agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with GENCO, TRANSCO
and the distribution companies;
* implemented measures, included in the Financial Restructuring Plan prepared by Haryana
(see section E.2) as per the schedule provided by this Plan and the Financial Commitment
Letter sent by the Govemment of Haryana to the Bank (see section E.2);
* updated and approved its part of the Program and Project Implementation Plan (PPIP)
satisfactory to the Bank. The revised PPIP would in particular detail the reform measures and
milestones expected to be achieved before APL3 would be committed; and
* achieved satisfactory progress in privatizing one of the distribution companies (East Zone) as
a joint venture with private majority ownership; more specifically when: (i) Haryana has
selected a strategic joint venture private investor following a selection procedure satisfactory
to the Bank, and; (ii) the Bank has been satisfied that the sale of equity to this private investor
can reasonably take place within six months following the approval of the loan.
b.    The Regulatory Commission has been established, has become functional, and has issued
licenses to TRANSCO and the distribution companies. The Regulatory Commission will be considered
functional when: (i) all the Commissioners have been appointed; (ii) the regulations regarding the
Commission proceedings have been notified; (iii) the key professional staff have been appointed; (iv) an
institutional development (or capacity building) plan has been approved by the Commissioners; and (v)
funding of the Regulatory Commission has been provided for in the State's budget.
c.    The beneficiary power utilities (TRANSCO and the distribution companies as the case may be)
have:
* Approved corporate business plans, satisfactory to the Bank, and including measures relating
to, inter alia: (i) the company's institutional strengthening and development; (ii) operational
A distribution company is considered privatised when a private investor owns at least 51% of the
equity shares.

and managerial efficiency improvements; (iii) financial performance; and (iv) privatization (for
the state-owned distribution companies); and
Updated and approved their parts of the PPIP, satisfactory to the Bank.
d.     Retail tariffs have been increased to an extent not less than that provided in the Financial
Restructuring Plan (see section E.2), subject to the procedures set up by the Regulatory
Commission when relevant.
The Third Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project (APL3) (indicative amount: $ 200 million)
would be considered when:
a.     The Government of Haryana has:
*  privatized at least two-thirds of the distribution system, e.g., at least about two-thirds of the
electricity is distributed by private companies, licensed by the Regulatory Commission;
*  updated and approved its part of the PPIP, satisfactory to the Bank. The revised PPIP would
in particular detail the reform measures and milestones expected to be achieved before the
APL4/APL5 would be committed; and
.  taken all the measures within its purview, included in the Financial Restructuring Plan and as
per the schedule provided in this Plan and the Financial Commitment Letter (see section E.2).
b.    The beneficiary power utilities (TRANSCO and the distribution companies as the case may be)
have:
.  complied with the provisions of the corporate business plans presented before the approval of
the Second Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project, and substantially met the objectives
and targets set in these plans;
*  updated and approved corporate business plans satisfactory to the Bank; and
*  updated and approved their parts of the PPIP, satisfactory to the Bank.
c.     Retail tariffs, including to agricultural consumers, have been increased to an extent not less than
that provided in the Financial Restructuring Plan.
One or two additional loans (APL4 and APL5) (tentative total amount: $ 190 million) would be
considered when:
*  the distribution business has been fully privatized;
*  Haryana's power sector functions along the principles stated in the Detailed Haryana's Power
Sector Policy Statement (see Annex 11) and underlying the Reform Program;
*  the Regulatory Commission operates in accordance with the Haryana Electricity Reform Act
and the relevant rules and regulations;
*  the power utilities operate in accordance with their business plans;
.  the beneficiaries have presented business plans acceptable to the Bank; and
*  the tariffs paid by the agricultural consumers have been adjusted to cover at least half of the
average supply cost, subject to the procedures set up by the Regulatory Commission.
The milestones that would have to be achieved before the APL4/5 are committed, would be further
defined and agreed during the appraisal of the APL3 and APL4.
In addition to the above project-specific milestones, it is expected that before considering any
loan:

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Channeling of IBRD Assistance
The borrower will be the Government of India. The Govemment of India will onlend the proceeds of the
Bank loan, under the Government of India's standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the
States, and fully additional to Haryana's regular assistance. The Government of Haryana will onlend the
proceeds to HSEB, in the first instance and until Haryana Electricity Reform Act is brought into effect; and
then to the new power companies (TRANSCO and the distribution companies), at terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. The Government of Haryana will release funds simultaneously with releases by
the Government of India.
Executing agencies
The Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB) will be the executing agency in the first instance. After the
restructuring of HSEB into separate companies (GENCO for generation, TRANSCO for transmission, and
the distribution companies) and the establishment of the regulatory commission, TRANSCO, the
distribution companies and the regulatory commission will take over the execution of the project as
follows:

Transfer and Assignment of Obligations
All contracts signed by HSEB will be transferred to TRANSCO (including, inter alia, contracts relating to
distribution items) as per the Transfer Scheme rules (as provided by the Haryana Electricity Reform Act).
When the new distribution companies are created, TRANSCO will enter into back-to-back agreements
with them in respect of equipment/goods supplied in each particular distribution area. The distribution
companies will discharge the obligations to TRANSCO and TRANSCO will discharge the obligation to the
suppliers. The suppliers will continue to hold TRANSCO as liable.
Project Monitoring and Coordination
Haryana has created a Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary and attended by the
Secretaries in charge of energy and finance, and the Chairman, HSEB. The role of the Steering
Committee is to: (i) guide and evaluate the implementation of the reform program and the execution of the
Bank-supported project; and (ii) advise the Cabinet. If needed, the Steering Committee may invite
independent reputed experts to assess the progress of the implementation of the reform program. In
addition, an Implementation Committee chaired by the Secretary (Energy) to the Government of Haryana
will co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the reform program. At the operational level, HSEB
has established a Reform and Restructuring Team to prepare and conduct the implementation of the first
steps of the reform measures and of the investment program.
When the new power entities (Regulatory Commission, power utilities) are established, the composition of
the above Steering and Implementation Committees will be modified to include the chairpersons of
GENCO, TRANSCO and the distribution companies. The role of these committees will also be revisited to
reflect the change in the role of the State in the governance and regulation of the power sector. At the
operational level, each of the executing agencies will implement its own institutional development and
strengthening program with the assistance of reputed consultants; they will have also project management
units to carry out the implementation of the investment measures. These project management units will
be assisted by reputed engineering consultants.
Project Supervision
Given its complexity, the project will be closely supervised. The supervision will be essentially carried out
by field-based staff (through short visits to Haryana and supervision missions); specialized senior staff
from Washington would also visit Haryana about every four months. The missions will supervise the
implementation of the reform program and the execution of the project. While supervising the
implementation of the project, the same missions will also prepare and appraise the Second
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project.
Accounting and Auditing
HSEB currently maintains its accounts in accordance with the required provisions of the Electricity Act;
there is no comprehensive system of internal controls in place and the financial planning and budgeting
functions appear to be more perfunctory than functional (see Financial Appraisal Report). Certain
accounting system modifications will be necessary for HSEB's successors to be in compliance with the
requirements of the Companies Act; in addition, for making the financial, budgeting and accounting
systems responsive to the needs of the emerging commercial environment in which the new entities shall
have to operate, HSEB's successor entities will need to improve financial controls, professionalize the
organization, upgrade the skills, and improve the technology. As part of the institutional strengthening and
development program of HSEB's successor entities, Haryana has agreed to engage reputed consultants
to assist in developing appropriate systems and procedures, and strengthening the organization.
HSEB and its successors will prepare quarterly financial statements on the project in a manner that will
show expenditures compared to the amounts budgeted with an analysis of the variance. The Government
of India will: (i) have the records and accounts for the project and those for the Special Account for each

fiscal year audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later
than six months after the end of such fiscal year, the report by the auditors of sufficient scope and detail
as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the
statements of expenditures submitted during such fiscal year together with the procedures and internal
controls involved in their preparation can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.
Co-Financing
UK Department For International Development (DFID), has agreed in-principle to finance (parallel
financing) specific technical assistance activities (see Annex 12). Consultants will be hired directly by
DFID based on terms of reference agreed between DFID and Haryana and discussed with the Bank.
DFID's own procurement policy, guidelines and procedures will apply. It is expected that the other
technical assistance activities will be financed by bilateral donors (CIDA and USAID have expressed
interest in assisting Haryana); should bilateral funding not be available, these activities could be financed
by the proposed loan.
KfW and OECF have also expressed interest in supporting Haryana's reform program and financing,
notably, the rehabilitation of the Faridabad power station (KfW), and transmission and distribution
investment (OECF) for the subsequent projects.
D: Program and Project Rationale
1. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
a.    The Bank considered supporting state power sector reforms through "wholesaling" arrangements
where Bank's loans would be channeled through a financial intermediary, such as PFC, to assist several
candidate reforming states (including Haryana). For the time being, this option has been rejected because
the experience in state power sector reform in India is very limited; and a direct relationship between the
Bank and the reforming states was considered essential, at least for the first few states, for the transfer of
global knowledge and for adapting the approach to reforms in the light of experience. Also, financial
intermediaries have limited experience in facilitating sector reforms.
b.     The Bank also considered providing a single larger loan (of about US$ 350-400 million) to finance
a 5-year investment time slice. The loan would have been committed after Haryana would have
implemented various agreed upfront measures, ensuring a reasonable degree of irreversibility in the
reform process, following an approach similar to the Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Loan (Ln. 4014).
A variant of this approach would have been to wait until HSEB negotiates and agrees with its financial and
commercial creditors a rescheduling of the overdue commercial liabilities and debt servicing obligations
before committing a first loan. The above alternatives have been rejected since the proposed approach,
based on the new adaptable lending instruments, provides more flexibility than the traditional instruments
to support long-term, complex reforms. In particular, it makes it possible to: (i) demonstrate and
materialize the Bank's support at an early stage of the reform process; (ii) assist Haryana in carrying out
its financial restructuring (by providing comfort to HSEB's creditors on the governance and management
of the power industry); and (iii) adapt further support from the Bank to actual progress in reform
implementation and financing requirements.
c.     Generation has been excluded from the physical scope of the proposed loan. The rehabilitation
and modernization of the existing state-owned power stations would be carried out under commercial
arrangements with private parties (at Panipat) or proposed for support by KfW (at Faridabad). For future
power generation, Haryana's policy is to promote the development of private investment and purchase
from central/regional utilities. The program will focus on very cost-effective measures in transmission,
distribution, and demand-side management, needed to remove the system bottlenecks, reduce the
technical and non-technical losses, and improve the quality of supply. This is a priority area to ensure that
the tariff adjustments required to recover costs are kept minimum, and are accompanied with actions
aiming at improving the service to consumers. By focusing on these physical investments, the program

India                                                        Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
will directly contribute to increasing the acceptance of the reform measures. Although it is expected that
the private sector will progressively participate in distribution and will ultimately finance and carry out the
required investments, in the short and medium term, when large investments are required, the contribution
of the private sector will remain limited.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design:
Over the 1980s and up to the early 1990s, the Bank followed a three-pronged strategy in its lending to the
power sector in India. It supported Government-owned agencies - NTPC in particular - as a means of



Project Appraisal Document                                                          Page 14
India                                                        Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
effecting sector-wide improvements. It financed a selected number of SEBs whose management and
state governments appeared to be committed to revitalization e.g., improving their performance in a
gradual fashion. In cooperation with IFC, it financed existing private power utilities and encouraged the
Government to lower entry barriers for new investors. The success of this strategy has been uneven,
reflecting fundamental sectoral weaknesses. Operations with central and private utilities have been
generally successful; state-oriented activities have not. The revitalization of institutionally and financially
weak SEBs did not turn out to be feasible. Furthermore, the weak financial conditions of SEBs created
receivables problems for the central utilities, and threatened to undermine the generally effective
performance of central utilities. Projects in these states failed to meet expectations beyond the physical
construction of facilities, and the Bank was forced to take such strong measures as suspension of
disbursements and subsequently loan cancellation.
Based on the lessons of the past, the Bank decided in 1993 to lend its financial support to only those
states that demonstrate a commitment to implement a comprehensive reform of their power sector. The
first state to move along these lines was Orissa. The SEB has been unbundled and OHPC, the hydro
power corporation, and GRIDCO, the transmission company, have started operating on their own. One
distribution zone was placed under private control through a management contract but GRIDCO has
recently terminated the contract, and envisages now to fully privatize its entire distribution system
(through a sale of business) in a single shot. The Regulatory Commission has been established and is
now up and running. Although it is too early to draw definite lessons about this operation, the reform
program in Haryana and the design of the proposed project have benefited extensively from a close
observation of this first state power restructuring operation. For example, the Haryana Electricity Reform
Bill has extensively drawn upon the Orissa Electricity Reform Act; based on Orissa's experience, in
particular, Haryana has decided to avoid a management contract phase as a first step toward privatization
of distribution and to move directly for full privatization. In the future, the project will also benefit from the
experience and lessons gained in Orissa on the functioning of the regulatory regime and privatization as
they unfold.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Since November 1993 the Government of Haryana, HSEB and the Bank have discussed problems
affecting the development of power sector and reviewed a variety of possible solutions to address them.
In 1994, Haryana initiated studies to review and recommend reform options, and identify investment
requirements. The consultants, funded by a US$ 2 million Project Preparation Facility advance,
completed their assignment in 1995. The reform program was formally approved by Haryana's Council of
Ministers in December 1995 and, on January 1, 1996, Haryana issued a general policy statement outlining
its power sector policy. The new government, which came to power after the state elections in May 1996,
confirmed, after several deliberations, its commitment to power sector reforms in October 1996. A
comprehensive reform legislation has been prepared by Haryana and approved by the State's Legislature
in July 1997. A detailed policy statement and implementation plans, including a far-reaching financial
restructuring plan, acceptable to the Bank have been approved by the Government of Haryana (see
Annexes 11 and 12).
Political Context
The political debate on the situation of the power sector and the Government's policy has been intense
during the first quarter of 1997, particularly during the session of the State Assembly, when the
Government announced its reform policy. The debate has been exacerbated by the decision of the
recently appointed Government in Punjab, a neighboring state, to provide free water and power to
farmers, and by similar pronouncements in other states (for example Bihar). Haryana's Chief Minister has
persistently defended the Government's power policy, expressed his support for the privatization of the
distribution business through joint venture arrangements, and affirmed his commitment to implement the
reform agenda in "total transparency" and in an "orderly" way. Haryana has now started a comprehensive
campaign of communication and sensitization. Haryana is also resisting the increasing pressure from
political opposition requesting that Haryana's farmers be treated at par with the farmers across the border

India                                                        Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
in Punjab3; and Haryana's Government has repeatedly stated that there will be no free power to Haryana's
farmers.
Haryana is one of the very few states in India to charge the power supplied to farmers at an average of
more than 50 paise/kWh, which is the minimum level agreed in the Common Minimum National Action
Plan for Power endorsed by a Conference of State Chief Ministers at the end of 1996. Most other states
either provide their farmers with free power (Punjab, Tamil Nadu) or at less than 50 paise/kWh.
Intemalization
The reform efforts have been led by the senior management of HSEB, with support of the senior
Government officials (Chief Secretary and Energy Secretary). A Steering Committee chaired by the Chief
Secretary has reviewed and endorsed all major policy options before their submission to the Cabinet.
Within HSEB several working groups have been constituted. HSEB's senior management had numerous
meetings with staff at different levels to explain the reform agenda and consult them about its
implementation.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project
Since 1993 the Bank has been extensively involved in a policy dialogue with the central and state
Governments to promote systemic power sector reforms at the state level. The Bank is already
supporting the power sector reform in Orissa, and has gained a significant understanding and experience
of these reforms in the Indian context. The Bank can use different instruments (loans and guarantees)
concomitantly while IFC and/or MIGA could also participate in private power development. Haryana will,
therefore, benefit to a large extent from the synergy between a variety of instruments and approaches.
The Bank Group is particularly well positioned to respond to the opportunity and challenges posed by
Haryana today, by:
. providing and catalyzing the critical long term capital needed to support the much needed growth of
Haryana's power sector until the reforms progress far enough to attract a sufficient volume of private
capital;
. using the leverage of its lending volume and its advisory capability to further and accelerate the reform
process and create an enabling environment for private investment; and
. providing the lessons of its global experience in power sector reforms to help Haryana deal with the
issues of design, implementation and adaptation of its reform program.
3    Since October 1997, the Govemment has been confronted with widespread agitation among
farmers regarding the issue of power tariffs for agriculture and collection of dues.

E: Summary Program and Project Analyses(Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4 and Economic Appraisal Report): [X] Cost-Benefit Analysis
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program
The economic benefits of the program are considerable and derive essentially from: (i) the elimination of
the power deficit; and (ii) efficiency improvements (notably reduction of technical losses), that both the
reform measures and the large investment program are expected to bring about. In the absence of the
reforms, the power sector would continue to deteriorate: the sector will be less able to meet the needs of
the consumers and the imperatives of economic development; and transmission and distribution losses
are likely to increase. Based on consumer surplus analysis4, the program net present value (NPV)5 is
estimated at about Rs. 85 billion (US$ 2.4 billion). The economic benefits are robust with respect to
critical assumptions: under a wide range of assumptions on the load growth, expansion program, pace at
which system losses will be reduced and other efficiency improvements will take place, and fuel prices,
the program NPV remains largely positive.
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
The economic benefits of the first project are proportionally higher than for the overall program since this
project focuses on the most inefficient and critical segments of the transmission and distribution systems
and low-cost, quick-yielding investments. The net benefits (NPV using 12 percent discount rate at 1997
price levels) are estimated at about Rs. 9.3 billion (US$ 258 million), and the economic rate of return
(ERR) at 52 percent (see Annex 4 and "Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development:
Economic Analysis" report).
2. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5 and Financial Appraisal Report):
The financial turn-around of Haryana's power sector from bankruptcy depends on the successor entities
being allowed adequate tariffs, operational autonomy and accountability of the management for improving
financial and operational efficiencies, a healthy capital structure, and financing of investments required for
rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution system. Efficiency improvements and
tariff increases assumed in the financial analysis are conservative, and given the changes in legal and
institutional framework and privatization of distribution, within the realm of possibility. In particular, there
would be ample opportunities for the new power utilities to improve their operational efficiency at a faster
pace. Annex 5 provides summary financial projections of the successor entities on an aggregated basis
and demonstrates the financial viability of the aggregate entities. Within this framework, the financial
soundness of the desegregated entities would depend on allocation of assets and liabilities and transfer
pricing (i.e. generation, bulk supply, and transmission tariffs). The Bank would get an opportunity to
review the relevant decisions of tariffs of GENCO, bulk supply and transmission tariffs of TRANSCO, and
the transfer scheme, to ensure that the successor companies emerge as financially viable entities6.
In order to provide satisfactory levels of assets and capital structure to the new companies, Haryana plans
to (i) write off HSEB's accumulated losses of Rs. 21.3 billion against its equity and loans amounting to Rs.
4    See Annex 4 and the economic appraisal report: "Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and
Development Program: Economic Analysis" report, in project files.
5    An economic rate of return (ERR) for the reform program has not been reported because, inter-alia,
the signs of the economic net flows are changing over time, which makes the solution to the ERR
indeterminate (see "Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program: Economic
Analysis", Chapter 10).
6    Financial projections of individual entities are being prepared by Haryana with the help of its
financial consultants and shall be available before the transfer of assets and liabilities to the
companies.

24 billion; (ii) recognize the unfunded liabilities, on account of retirement dues of the staff, estimated at Rs.
8.7 billion, by issuing government guaranteed bonds to employee-managed Pension and Provident Fund
Trusts; (iii) adequately capitalize the companies and provide future financing from the State as equity; (iv)
make adequate provision for uncollectible receivables, obsolete inventories, and contingent liabilities likely
to devolve; and (v) retain with the State contingent liabilities of Rs. 6 billion not expected to devolve. Draft
Transfer Scheme, embodying these decisions shall be submitted to the Bank for review before its
finalization.
To reduce distortions in the tariff structure and partially eliminate cross subsidies, Haryana has decided
that tariffs paid by agricultural consumers should increase starting FY 2000, at least, by Rs. 0.25/ kWh for
the next three years to reach a level of Rs. 1.38/kWh by FY 2003, an average annual increase of about 33
percent. For other categories (i.e. industry, commercial, and domestic) the tariff adjustments are assumed
at about 15 percent for FY 1999, 10 percent in FY 2000 and FY 2001, and 8 percent in FY 2002. This is
considered a politically feasible pace of tariff adjustments, though not adequate for the companies to earn
their rate of return without subsidy. Haryana had made a provision for giving subsidy of about Rs. 2 billion
(about US$ 60 million) per year during the current five year plan, which is not considered adequate. To
meet the shortfall in rate of return, Haryana has agreed to provide additional subsidy during the transition
period but completely eliminate the need for subsidy within the next four years. Commitments of Haryana
for financial support to the successor companies will be covenanted through appropriate financial
covenants (rate of retum, debt service coverage, accounts receivables and payables). Annex 5(a) details
the financial support of the State's Government to the power sector and the flow of funds between the
power industry and the State.
Haryana's ten-year investment program of Rs. 80 billion, including contingencies and interest during
construction, for rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution system is considered
reasonable. Its financing plan includes IBRD (33%), private equity (2%), bilateral sources (14%), state
government (16%), internal resource generation (12%), and the balance from Indian Financial Institutions/
Commercial lenders including borrowings raised by the private investors. Low internal resource generation
in the first three years, due to low tariffs and small capital base, would be compensated through higher
support from Haryana government. Significant private capital flows in distribution business would also be
expected to emerge once the distribution is privatized.
The financing plan is feasible and commitment has been obtained from Haryana government for
providing the estimated financing partly as subsidy and partly as equity (letter from the
Government of Haryana dated November 12, 1997). In addition Haryana will negotiate with its
creditors, suppliers, and lenders, for restructuring HSEB's overdue payables and liabilities, and debt
service falling due in the next two years- the most critical period for its successor entities. Haryana has
agreed to provide a detailed, duly negotiated, rescheduling plan, before 30 June, 1998.
Fiscal impact
Expected improvements in financial performance of the successor entities would not only eliminate the
need for state subsidy but also reduce their dependence on the state's plan resources for financing their
investments. In the past the government had to provide subsidy, and financing support ( which is virtual
subsidy since accumulated losses would almost completely wipe off the state loans and equity). The net
negative budgetary impact of the sector (Annex 5 (a)) between FY 1993 to FY 1997 was about Rs. 18
billion (approx. US$ 575 million). The sector is expected to reverse the budgetary flows within four years
and start contributing about US$ 65 million every year between FY 2003 and FY 2007. This does not
include likely proceeds of sale of equity in distribution companies.
The burden of the financial restructuring of the sector falls essentially on the State's finances, which is a
deliberate decision from the Government of Haryana, following a systematic and detailed review of all the
options realistically available to Haryana (see Financial Appraisal Report and Haryana's Financial
Restructuring Plan). Financial and operational efficiency improvements have been reflected in the
financial projections; sales of assets would have been a complex and lengthy process, and, politically,
were not considered feasible; curtailment of power supply in the next years will favor high-tariff consumer

categories. In the current political context (see section D.4) and when most of the other states have
decided to provide free power to farmers or to sell it at less than 50 paise/kWh, immediate increases in
tariffs to agricultural consumers have been ruled out; additional tariff increases to industries and
commercial consumers can only be limited to avoid aggravating tariff distortions and shifting towards
captive generation. Going through a standard bankruptcy procedure as for a commercial entity is not
feasible for a State Electricity Board; and none of HSEB's commercial or financial creditors would have
willingly foregone their claims on HSEB as most of the debt is guaranteed by the State government.
Haryana considers that the State's finances can support this contribution to the power sector's financial
restructuring, has agreed to make the necessary budgetary provision, and has formally confirmed its
commitments to the Bank (letter from the Government of Haryana dated November 12, 1997) before loan
negotiations. It should be noted that:
a.    The cumulative contribution of the govemment between FY 1999 to FY 2002 would be equivalent
to what it has planned for the sector. However in the timing of these flows, there is a mismatch
between the requirements of the companies and what is planned by the government. Successor
companies will need higher than planned support in the first two years (Rs. 15 billion instead of
Rs. 10 billion) but lower support in FY 2001 and 2002 (Rs. 7 billion instead of Rs. 12 billion); and
b.    The actual contribution of the State govemment may be lower than what it has agreed to provide,
to the extent that any rescheduling of the payment of overdue commercial liabilities and debt
servicing will reduce the need for cash support to the utilities (see Financial Appraisal Report).
Furthermore, the State government is confident that it could raise through borrowings the
additional resources needed in FYs 99 and 00.
3. Technical Assessment:
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program
HSEB has a long experience in the design and execution of transmission and distribution projects. The
proposed investment program is technically sound, does not involve any complex and non-proven
technology, has been prepared with the assistance of reputed consultants (see reports of Kennedy,
Donkin, and Rust listed in Annex 8) on a least-cost basis, and has been reviewed in detail by the Bank
project team. The rehabilitation and expansion program in transmission has been defined after detailed
load flow analysis carried out with the model and software provided by Haryana's consultants. The
investments in distribution have been defined following extensive interaction between HSEB and their
consultants, and based on detailed sample field studies and a set of criteria aiming at optimizing their
technical design and benefits. During the implementation of the program, engineering consultants will also
assist HSEB and its successors in updating and implementing the investment program (see section 4
below).
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
The project will include the construction of short transmission lines and sub-stations urgently needed to
evacuate power to the Haryana's grid; the design and construction of these transmission lines and sub-
stations does not raise any difficulty. The project will also focus on the rehabilitation of the fifty most
critically affected feeders; with the assistance of its consultants, HSEB has carried out detailed
engineering analyses, and no technical problem is anticipated.
4. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies
The investment program HSEB and its successors (TRANSCO and the distribution companies) will
execute the investment projects. Although there is no particular technological
difficulty associated with the investment measures, the volume of work to be

India                                                        Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project
designed and executed is large compared to previous years. HSEB has
agreed to engage engineering consultants to assist in investment design and
execution activities; POWERGRID has already been commissioned to assist
in the preparation of selected priority investments in transmission. HSEB and
its successors will hire additional engineering consultants, and have already
started the commissioning process (see Annex 12).
The reform program      Haryana and HSEB have very limited experience in the areas covered by the
reform measures, notably on: (i) regulatory issues; (ii) functioning of the
"single-buyer model" (the new structure of the power industry that Haryana is
creating); (iii) privatization transactions; (iv) financial restructuring; and (v)
corporate management. To mitigate this lack of experience, the proposed
project includes a significant technical assistance (TA) and capacity building
component. The terms of reference have been agreed with Haryana, the
procurement process has started and the consultants are expected to start
their assignment during the first quarter of CY 1998. UK-DFID has agreed to
finance part of the TA program; other bilateral agencies (USAID, CIDA) have
also expressed interest in supporting the TA program. The rest will be
financed by the proposed loan.
Program and project implementation strategy and management
Haryana's strategy is to create the new power entities (Regulatory Commission and power utilities) as
early as possible after the passing of the reform legislation. This will minimize the transition period and the
associated uncertainties; this will also provide an opportunity to constitute the new management teams,
give clear and focused mandates based on institutional and corporate goals, and establish more
responsive counterpart teams for the provision of technical assistance. A major task of the high-level
Steering Committee will be to review the implementation of the reform program as defined in the Program
and Project Implementation Plan, gauge the performance of the new institutions, and assess the
effectiveness of the technical assistance and institutional development/strengthening programs. Haryana
has agreed to get a wide range of views and, as needed, to get assessment from independent and
recognized high-level experts.
5. Social Assessment:
Investment Program
No resettlement is expected and no major social issues are involved as evidenced by the socio-economic
surveys carried out for a sample of transmission lines and sub-stations. HSEB has prepared its Social
Policies and Procedures (including an Entitlement Framework) to deal with land acquisition and other
matters, which may have a negative social impact. The main thrust of the policy is to: (i) avoid land
acquisition and subsequent displacement; (ii) recognize non-title holders for entitlement; (iii) and provide
for transitional allowances and replacement of common properties and amenities. HSEB's Social Policies
and Procedures have been reviewed by the Bank before loan negotiation (see section 23) and are
consistent with the Bank's OD. 4.20 (Indigenous People) and 4.30 (Involuntary Resettlement).
HSEB has conducted a survey to determine the impact of the physical component of the Haryana Power
Sector Restructuring project. No land will have to be acquired, and no person will suffer any significant
adverse impact. The land for sub-stations is already under the possession of HSEB and free from all
encroachments. In the case of transmission towers and evacuation lines, about 300 persons will suffer
temporary crop losses during the erection of the transmission towers. A Resettlement Action Plan,
satisfactory to the Bank, has been prepared by HSEB.

Reform Program
The extremely high degree of inefficiency and waste in the present situation makes possible a situation in
which most groups benefit from the proposed reform and restructuring program. The State government
benefits by being able to devote resources currently used for subsidizing HSEB to other social programs;
and through its equity stake in the commercialized and privatized successor entities will derive a return
from its investment. All consumer groups will benefit from the increased quantity and quality of power, and
the State as a whole will benefit from the elimination of power shortages and the concomitant removal of
an important constraint to the economic development of the State. HSEB's successor entities (and IPPs
and other engaged in the supply of electricity) will benefit from adequate financial returns to their
investment7.
However, there are three groups of individuals who may potentially suffer some loss:
a.    The first is those individuals presently profiting from the high levels of electricity theft (and
associated opportunities for corruption). However, elimination of this externality must be viewed
as a benefit rather than as a cost from society's standpoint.
b.    The second group constitutes those members of HSEB's present staff who may ultimately loose
their job as a result of lower manning levels in the reformed entities. However, this is more
apparent than real and may be minimized by appropriate policies that safeguard employee rights.8
Moreover, even at the more efficient staffing levels to be expected as a result of reform, total
employment in the sector may not be very different due to the customer growth that can be
expected once the constraints that presently limit the sectors growth, are removed by the
reforms.
c.    The final group that may be adversely affected by the reform program are low income farmers and
low-income domestic consumers who presently benefit from the highly subsidized tariff, or the
deficient metering, billing and collection procedures. Once these deficiencies are corrected, these
consumers may suffer economic and financial loss although the benefits of improved quality and
availability of power may largely offset these losses9. The formulation and implementation of the
mitigating measures to appropriately protect these individuals will be one of the functions and
responsibilities of the new regulatory commission. For example, an appropriate lifeline tariff can
mitigate the impacts of tariff reform for low-income domestic and agricultural consumers.
6. Environmental Assessment:      Environmental Category:     [ ] A   [xl B    I I C
The project is expected to have positive environmental impacts through improved efficiency in supply and
demand sides. The design of lines and substations would incorporate safety features, and their
route/location be defined to minimize any adverse environmental impact. With the assistance of a Bank-
funded consultant, HSEB has carried out detailed environmental analyses (see project files) for 15
transmission lines and sub-stations (including the lines and sub-stations to be funded by the proposed
project); regarding the evacuation lines (average length: 4-5 km), HSEB has carried out an environmental
analysis on a sample of lines. The Bank has reviewed HSEB's analyses and concluded that the
construction of the proposed transmission lines and sub-stations would have no significant adverse
environmental impact, and that their design and construction were consistent with the Bank's OD. 4.01
7    This producer's surplus is presently dissipated in inefficient subsidies to agriculture.
8    Haryana's policy is to avoid any involuntary retrenchment and to provide, when the new utilities are
established, Voluntary Retirement Scheme facilities (which might be funded under subsequent
APLs).

(Environmental Assessment). On the generation side, HSEB has initiated the rehabilitation of the Panipat
power station with a private company with financing from KfW (Germany). Haryana has also engaged a
dialogue with KfW for financing the rehabilitation of the Faridabad power station. In both cases, the
rehabilitation will aim at bringing the stations into compliance with environmental standards. Haryana has
agreed to strengthen the environmental management capabilities of HSEB's successors; and terms of
reference for consulting services (including, interalia, management of PCB related issues, if required after
investigation) have been agreed. TRANSCO will also be proposed to use the planning model developed
under the ESW on "Environmental Issues in the Power Sector", which assesses the various environmental
implications of policy and expansion options.
7. Participatory Approach:
The key stakeholder groups are: (i) the consumers of electricity and the population at large in Haryana; (ii)
HSEB staff; (iii) persons which may be affected by land utilization; and (iv) Government and administration
staff.
a.    Consumers have been represented in a Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary (see
section 4 "Project Monitoring and Coordination"), and which provided guidance for the design of
the reform measures and implementation program. Professional organizations have also been
extensively consulted by Haryana and HSEB. A large political debate has taken place before the
Haryana had confirmed its decision to embark upon the reform program. The overall result of
these consultations has been to increase Haryana's awareness to develop a larger constituency
for change, communicate more openly, develop an Emergency Action plan, and phase the
implementation of the reform program;
b.    HSEB staff has been also extensively informed and consulted. HSEB's senior management has
had several meetings to explain the reform program and its implications on personnel. This has
helped reduce (but not eliminate) the opposition to reform among staff. As a result of these
consultations, Haryana/HSEB have decided to: (i) include a human resource development
component into the program; and (ii) ensure, through the Haryana Electricity Reform Bill and the
transfer schemes, that staff situation will not deteriorate as a consequence of the restructuring;
c.    The draft Social Policy and Procedures (SPP) prepared by HSEB to deal with the social
consequences of land acquisition have been discussed and reviewed with a group of
stakeholders; their comments have been reflected into the final SPP, when relevant. The SPP
also define the participatory approach that Haryana and HSEB plan to follow (see section E.5);
and
d.     Following the passing of the Reform Legislation, Haryana has undertaken a campaign to explain
the reform concepts and measures at various levels of the administration.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program. By implementing the proposed
reform agenda, Haryana can make its utilities commercially viable and mobilize resources to finance the
rehabilitation and expansion of its power system. Investments will not only contribute to reducing today's
power gap, but will also create the basis for sustainable future growth of the system. Closing the chronic
supply-demand gap will benefit all electricity consumers. Haryana expects that the State's improved
power supply position would contribute to attracting additional investment and encourage existing
industries to expand their production facilities.
Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project. The project, which will facilitate the execution of the
above program, will therefore contribute to the sustainability of Haryana's measures. Even if the next
phases of the program were not to take place the project would lead, under reasonable assumptions, to

Risk Rating - H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), N (Negligible or Low Risk)
Overall risk rating
The risks associated with the Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program are
moderate to substantial, but would be considerably mitigated by the utilization of the adaptable lending
instrument, and the implementation of the proposed Haryana Power Sector Restructuring project. The
risks specifically associated with the proposed project are moderate, and can be mitigated through normal
project preparation, execution and supervision procedures.
3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The implementation of the reform will face strong opposition. It will impinge on large and powerful vested
interests. The reform measures will also change the framework under which staff and Government
officials have been operating: fears about employment generate opposition to change. The political
opposition and vested interest groups have used and will continue to use measures like privatization of
distribution and tariff adjustments as points of contention. Simultaneously, the reform process will not lead
to immediate results: efficiency improvements will come when the investment measures are implemented;
reduction in losses and improvement in quality of supply will come when the physical system is
rehabilitated and the distribution business is restructured and privatized. End-users and other
stakeholders will be ready to accept the reforms and the consequences provided that they

perceive real prospects for an improved situation. The implementation strategy designed by Haryana
has taken into account the obstacles to be overcome; and will be based on realistic targets,
communication, participation and consensus-building. The reform program will be implemented in phases,
tariffs will be adjusted progressively; and HSEB's successors will implement aggressive strategies to
reduce losses - which would minimize the required tariff adjustments and improve the quality of service.

3. Proposed Covenants Upon Restructuring. Agreements were reached at negotiations that once
HSEB's successor companies come into existence (defined as having received assets, liabilities, staff,
license to operate as applicable) and the transfer schemes become effective, the HSEB Project
Agreement and other legal documents shall be adjusted to reflect the emergence of the new entities, and
to include, inter alia, the following:
a.     Haryana shall onlend the proceeds of the Loan to TRANSCO and the state-owned DISCOMs
under Subsidiary Loan Agreements to be entered into between Haryana, and each of TRANSCO/
DISCOMs, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Under the current policy of the
Borrower, TRANSCO and DISCOMs shall pay interest on the principal amount so onlent and
withdrawn and outstanding from time to time at a rate of not less than 13% per annum, and repay
the principal amount so onlent over a period of 18 years including a period of grace of three years.

Detailed Project Description
HARYANA POWER RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
HARYANA POWER RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Project Component 1: Emergency Investment Measures.
Project Component 1.a. Construction of critically needed high voltage evacuation lines and
transmission lines and sub-stations. US$ 15.0 million.
HSEB's investment program includes three 220 kV, three 132 kV and six 66 kV lines, and three 220 kV,
two 132 kV and five 66 kV substations. These works are needed to stabilize the grid voltage, to improve
the system stability and to evacuate power: (i) from Nathpa Jhakri Hydro Project, (ii) NTPC thermal power
and (iii) a number of small (25MW) liquid-fuel based power stations. Power Grid is constructing new
transmission works to interconnect hydro and thermal power plants respectively to the Northem system.
Based on system studies, HSEB would construct its portion of transmission works to wheel additional
power to its grid system. The details of the lines and substations are:
1.a.1. Transmission lines and sub-stations (US$ 12.5 million)
1. 220 kV 80 km. long double circuit (DC) line from Yamunanagar to Shahbad;
2. 220 kV 30 km. long DC line from Palli to Palla;
3. 220 kV 20 km. long line DC from Palli to Samaypur;
4. Augmentation of 220 kV substations at Shahbad, Palla (presently 66 kV, to be upgraded to 220 kV)
and Samaypur.
1.a.2. Evacuation lines from liquid-fuel based power stations (US$ 2.5 million)
This sub-component will include a number of 132/66 kV lines to evacuate power from small (25MW) liquid-
fuel power stations to the Haryana's grid. The average line length is about 4-5 km. The evacuation lines
to be actually funded by the proposed loan will be defined based on the progress achieved in the
construction of the power stations by their promoters. Only lines for which the promoters have reached
financial closure will be eligible for financing under the loan.
Project Component 1.b. Rehabilitation of sub-transmission and distribution systems. US$ 47.3
million.
HSEB has identified 24 substations (33 kV) and 50 feeders (11 kV), which are critically overloaded and
need to be augmented and rehabilitated immediately. HSEB has prepared a detailed bill of material for
these works. This component would also include tools and safety equipment, meters, utility vehicles and
spares (11 kV switchgear, distribution transformers, LT circuit breakers, LT capacitors, line materials, etc.)
for strengthening the distribution system.
Project Component 2. Improvement of commercial and technical services to the consumers. US$
1.2 million.
HSEB has decided to introduce decentralized computerized billing systems at all sub-divisional offices
(about 400). Under the proposed loan, HSEB plans to introduce the above facility at 20 selected places. It
will benefit from the support of competent consultants.
HSEB has also decided to improve and upgrade the complaint centers at all district headquarters (17) and
operation division headquarters (45). All the above places will have base and mobile radio complaint
systems equipped with radio communication. Further, at the district headquarters, there will be tape

recorded complaint registering system, and pagers will be provided to the supervisory staff. All these
measures are expected to enhance the efficiency and quality of service and have a significant impact on
the consumers.
Project Component 3. Technical assistance and engineering services. USS 13.5 million.
This component includes the PPF advance (US$ 2 million) granted to Haryana. Haryana, HSEB and the
emerging new entities of the power sector will get technical assistance as follows:
1.    Reform program management and communication: Estimated costs: US$ 500,000;
2.    Establishment and institutional development of the Regulatory Commission. Estimated costs: US$
3 million;
3.    Privatization of one distribution company. Estimated costs: US$ 1.5 million;
4.    Institutional strengthening of TRANSCO. Estimated costs: US$ 1.5 million;
5.    Enhancement of the metering, billing, and collection functions of the distribution companies before
their privatization; and improvement of the efficiency of their commercial and technical services to
consumers. Estimated costs: US$ 1.5 million;
6.    Demand-Side management and promotion of non-conventional energies. Estimated costs: US$
1.0 million;
7.    Engineering services (preparation of bidding documents, evaluation of bids of complex technical
works, project management and supervision of investment execution). Estimated costs: US$ 1.5
million;
8.    Miscellaneous. US$ 1.0 million.

Methodology
The net economic benefits of each case (BAU, Reform, as well as the sensitivity analysis cases) are
estimated as the differences between the demand curve (willingness to pay) to the point of the
consumption level (which is supply-constrained at least until 2005), and the economic costs of supplying
that level of consumption. The benefits of the reform and restructuring scenario follow as the difference in
the net economic benefits (change in consumer and producer surplus). The specific assumptions
underlying the economic and financial analyses (tariffs, capital costs etc.) are detailed in the economic
appraisal report ("Haryana Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program: Economic Analysis")
in the Project File.
Results
The net economic benefits (NEB) of the overall reform and investment program are estimated at Rs.
81,500 million or 8,150 crores (NPV discounted at 12%) relative to a "business-as-usual" case (BAU case)
that is characterized by increasing levels of unserved energy, system losses and inadequate investment.
The financial benefits are estimated at Rs. 75,000 million or 7,500 crores (NPV discounted at 12%). The
table below summarizes the economic (E) and financial (F) benefits (in Rs. 1,000 crores at 1997 price
level).

These results show that for the reform program to succeed, Haryana must still provide support for the next
four years (even though the flow of funds reverses after FY 2002) as the first dividends are paid to HSEB's
successor organizations). However, for every crore that Haryana provides to enable the financial
restructuring and reform program to move forward, Haryana receives almost 10 crores in benefits (800
crores of subsidy support would generate 7,500 crores of benefits). In the case of business as usual, the
Haryana support is Rs. 4,200 million for no corresponding net benefit.
Sensitivity Analysis
The robustness of the economic and financial benefits has been tested by a sensitivity analysis. Under
wide range of input assumptions, the economic and financial benefits of reforms are demonstrably
superior to no reform. The economic benefits of the reform scenario would vary as follows (NPV in Rs.
1,000 crores at 1997 price level).

In all cases, the variations of the economic benefits associated with a reform scenario are lower than the
net economic benefits brought by the reform program (Rs. 8,500 crores).

Main Assumptions
1.    Costs include power purchased from generating stations for which evacuation lines are being
built.
2.     Benefits of power evacuation are taken as the willingness to pay (economic) or tariff (financial). In
the base case it is assumed that the tariff is equal to the cost of the marginal supply source (liquid-fuel
based power stations) adjusted for transmission losses; and that the willingness to pay (WTP) is equal to
this tariff. These are conservative assumptions (resulting in a WTP of Rs. 3.00/kwh levelised at 1997
price levels); the economic returns are significantly higher if the consumer surplus change methodology is
applied (resulting in a VVTP of Rs. 3.4/kwh).
Explanation of Results
The IRRs are unusually high because of the extremely poor condition of the distribution system (and
because the proposed project addresses the worst segments of the distribution system); and because of
the high level of unserved demand eliminated by the evacuation lines.
The economic benefits exceed the financial benefits because the economic benefits of reducing unserved
energy substantially exceed the tariffs.
The benefits exclude quantification of the reduction in the following externalities:
1.    The reduction in accident and mortality rates consequent to the purchase of safety equipment for
staff.
2.    The reduction in damage to equipment owned by consumers consequent to the improvement in
supply quantity in the rehabilitated feeders.
3.    Reduction in damage to distribution transformers consequent to the improvement in feeder
loading.
4.     Long term benefits of the reform program (of which the Emergency Action Plan funded by this
loan is just the first step).
Risk Assessment
A comprehensive risk assessment was conducted to test the sensitivity of returns to input assumptions.
The economic and financial returns of the feeder rehabilitation and the economic returns of the power
evacuation component are highly robust. The only major risk identified is if the power from the liquid-fuel
power stations (for which the Emergency Action Plan is providing power evacuation lines) were sold to
agricultural consumers at unremunerative tariffs, which obviously would result in negative financial returns.
The curtailment policy that underpins the financial restructuring plan decided by Haryana excludes such
an assumption.

10    The flows in FY 96 and FY 97 appear skewed because of a time lag in the payment of subsidies to HSEB. While part of the subsidy
receivable by HSEB in FY 96 was actually received in FY 97, HSEB reflected this amount in its FY 96 accounts. If the flows are apjusted for
this time lag, the acjusted flows would be Rs. 4,100 million and Rs. 6,200 million in FY 96 and FY 97 respectively.                                    go

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
HARYANA POWER RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
HARYANA POWER RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Procurement
Institutional capability
None of the project component involves complex procurement issues; and HSEB has generally the
capability to carry out the procurement activities. Two engineering groups headed by chief engineers deal
with preparation of design and bidding documents respectively: (i) for 66 kV and higher transmission
system; and (ii) 33 kV and lower subtransmission and distribution systems. However, given the time
constraints and the increase in investment activities, HSEB has decided to use consultants to assist in
procurement activities, as indicated below.
The bidding documents of the transmission lines and sub-stations (see Annex 2, component 1.a. 1) have
been prepared with the assistance of POWERGRID. Similarly HSEB will use short-term consultants to
assist in preparing the bidding documents for the goods to be procured for improving the commercial and
technical services to the consumers (see Annex 2, component 2). The terms of reference for the technical
assistance and engineering services (see Annex 2, component 3) have been prepared with the assistance
of the Bank team and UK-DFID. For all the other project components, HSEB has prepared most of the
bidding documents, which have been reviewed by the Bank.
HSEB will hire national consultants through a very small assignment (less than US$ 50,000) to assist in
evaluating the bids for supply and erect type of contracts (works for transmission lines and sub-stations)
and for goods of technically more complex nature (meter testing equipment, boundary meters, LT
capacitors and switches). In addition, Haryana has decided to get the support of reputed engineering
consultants to assist in the preparation, execution and supervision of the long term program (e.g., APL2
and subsequent ones), including on procurement activities (see attachment 8, Annex 8 of the Program
and Project Implementation Plan); Haryana expects that these consulting services would be funded by
bilateral sources, and would therefore be procured through the funding agency's procurement procedures.
Should these consulting services be funded through the Bank's loan, they would be procured in conformity
with the Bank's guidelines for the selection and employment of consultants by World Bank borrowers
(January 1997).
Procurement methods
Most of the works and goods (94% of the total value of the works and goods contracts) will be procured
through ICB as indicated in Table A. The rest of the works and goods may be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedure. The NCB procedure has been selected for the following cases:
Communication systems (estimated costs: US$ 700,000): the district headquarters are scattered
throughout Haryana, and the contract is of a small size,
*  Poles (estimated costs: US$ 1,100,000): it is not feasible for intemational bidders to manufacture and
transport prestressed concrete poles to Haryana
*  Safety kits (estimated costs: US$ 400,000): the contract value is too small to attract interest from
intemational bidders.



Annex 6
Page 2 of 4
* Erection and rehabilitation works in the distribution network (feeders and sub-stations) (estimated
costs: US$ 1,400,000). These works will be carried out throughout the Haryana state, and would
require a large flexibility from the contractor to adapt to operational constraints.
Technical assistance and engineering services amounting to US$ 10.5 million (78% of the total technical
assistance and engineering services component) are expected to be funded by UK-DFID (US$ 6.5 million)
and other bilateral donors (US$ 4 million). The project also includes services for US$ 2 million, funded
through a Project Preparation Facility advance (3 contracts amounting to US$ 1.840 million have been
awarded through quality-based selection, 1 contract amounting to US$ 62,000 has been awarded on a
single-source basis, and a last contract (less than US$ 100,000) is expected to be awarded before end CY
1997 through quality-based selection). It is expected that under the project, the Bank will finance technical
assistance services for US$ 1 million (quality- and cost-based selection). Tables A(i) and A(ii) summarizes
the procurement arrangements while Annex 6 (a) lists the main contracts.
The following procurement procedures (summarized in Table B(i)) will be followed:
*  Works contracts of US$ 5,000,000 and more will be awarded through ICB
*  Works contracts of US$ 100,000 and more but less than US$ 5,000,000 will be awarded through NCB
*  Works contracts of less than US$ 100,000 will be awarded through quotation
*  Good contracts of US$ 200,000 and more will be awarded through ICB except for the items noted
above
*  Good contracts of US$ 30,000 and more but below US$ 200,000 will be awarded through NCB
*  Good contracts of less than US$ 30,000 will be awarded through shopping.
Prior review thresholds
Prior Bank review of bid documents and approval of all contracts would be mandatory for:
*  All contracts to be awarded through ICB
*  All works contracts of US$ 500,000 and more regardless of the procurement procedure
*  All good contract of US$ 200,000 and more regardless of the procurement procedure
  Consultant contracts (individual) of US$ 50,000 and more
*  Consultant contracts (firms) of US$ 100,000 and more regardless of the procurement procedure.

DETAILED POUCY STATEMENT
HARYANA POWER RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
HARYANA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
The Present Power Scenario in Haryana
1.    Since the creation of the new State of Haryana in 1966, the State's power sector has grown at a
remarkable rate, reflecting the dynamic development in agricultural and industrial sectors. The State
Govemment has given the highest priority to the power sector, and as a result, Haryana has electrified all
its villages in 1970. This was a unique achievement made by a State for the first time in the country.
2.    The installed capacity available to the State has increased from 340 MW in 1967 to about 2400
MW in 1997. The transmission and distribution network has increased nine fold during this period. The
Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB) today serves more than 3.3 million consumers, over ten times
what the Board served in the year 1967. Per capita power consumption has increased from 57 units to
over 460 units during this period.
3.    In spite of these impressive achievements, the power sector has not been able to keep pace with
the increase in power demand in the State. Haryana is currently facing an acute power shortage of about
25 percent. There are long queues of applicants seeking new electricity connections. The power sector is
faced with problems of low plant load factor in its thermal power stations (about 48%), very high
transmission and distribution losses (in excess of 30%), extremely low voltage and frequent interruptions.
This has resulted in an adverse impact on the development and economy of the State and the welfare of
its people. The State Government is very concerned about the continuing power shortage and the
frequent power cuts imposed on various categories of electricity consumers.
4.    The root cause of the declining performance of the power sector is the lack of adequate
investment to meet the sector's capital requirements and the deterioration in sector efficiency. The
primary reason for the lack of investment is the critical financial situation of HSEB. As on 31st March
1997, the accumulated commercial losses of HSEB, excluding the State subsidies, were of the order of
Rs. 3400 crores, and cash liabilities in excess of Rs. 1000 crores. HSEB has not been able to meet its
operational cash requirements, resulting in poor market credibility. The power sector has not been able to
mobilise the resources required to finance development activities. The continuing cash shortfall has also
resulted in inefficient operations and maintenance of the existing system. The State's budgetary
resources are extensively used to support the operations of the power sector, which could altematively
have been used for other social development activities.
5.    Over the next decade, Haryana will need about 2350 MW of additional generation capacity to
meet its power demand. Substantial investments will be required in transmission and distribution to supply
this additional power and rehabilitate the existing transmission and distribution system so as to reduce
system losses and improve quality of power supply. The estimated investment required in the power
sector i.e. for generation, transmission and distribution, over the next 10 years is about Rs. 20000 crores.
The State's power requirements cannot be met without a massive mobilisation of private resources, the
restoration of the creditworthiness of the power utilities, and the establishment of a proper enabling
environment. The Govemment of Haryana is determined to overcome the prevailing problems in the
power sector and to face, without any delay, the huge challenges to achieve this goal. This is why the
Government of Haryana has decided to restructure and reform the State's power sector.

The Vision of the Govemment of Haryana
6.    Being fully conscious of the current power crisis and of its causes, the Government of Haryana
aims to create a financially viable, self-sustaining and healthy power sector, able to meet the power
demand of the consumers in an efficient and economical manner. Upon the implementation of the reform
and development program, power supply interruptions and curtailments will be eliminated. The State will
not be required to provide subsidies to cover the power sector's losses, and the sector will be a net
contributor to the State's resources. The new power entities will operate on commercial principles, under
an independent regulatory framework; they will ensure a high quality of service to consumers, expeditious
release of new connections, supply of quality power at economic rates and expeditious redressal of
complaints of consumers.
The Principles of the Reform and Development Program
7.     The goal of the Haryana power sector reform is to restore and ensure the sustainable
creditworthiness of the power industry, and to create an environment which will attract the investment
needed to meet the growing power demand, promote competition, efficiency and economy, and facilitate
the development of the power sector. The prime principle of the reform is for the State Government to
withdraw from the power sector as an operator and regulator of utilities, and to have commercially
operated utilities functioning in a competitive and appropriately regulated power market, with significant
private sector ownership and participation. In parallel with the reform program, the Government of
Haryana will promote a large investment program to rehabilitate and expand the transmission and
distribution systems.
8.    The State Government confirmed its commitment to the reforms by issuing the "General Power
Sector Policy Statement" on 1st January, 1996. The main components of the reform program outlined in
the Policy Statement are:
*  Segregation of the power generation, transmission and distribution functions into separate services to
be provided by separate companies,
*  Corporatization and commercialisation of the emerging power sector entities,
*  Creation of an independent power regulatory mechanism,
*  Private sector participation in power generation, transmission and distribution,
*  Promotion of efficiency and competition,
*  Adjustment of tariffs to restore the creditworthiness and viability of the power sector, to reduce and
progressively phase out tariff distortions and subsidies across consumer categories, and to promote
end use efficiency; and
*  Development of demand side management measures to conserve energy, promote efficient use of
energy and take suitable measures for environmental protection.
9.    The World Bank confirmed in January, 1996, and again in August, 1997, that it was ready to
support Haryana's efforts to reform and develop its power sector through financing a part of Haryana's
investment requirements up to US$ 600 million, arranging co-financing and, if requested, providing
guarantee.
The New Structure of the Power Sector
10.   The power sector will be restructured to encourage functional specialisation, decentralisation,
autonomy and accountability in decision-making; to facilitate private sector participation; to promote
competition in generation and distribution; and to ensure an effective, efficient and independent regulation
of the sector. The new power companies will operate within an incentive framework which promotes
efficiency and makes the companies and their staff accountable for the quality of the service provided to
the consumers.



Annex I I
Page 3 of 9
11.   The functions presently being performed by the vertically integrated HSEB will be segregated into
separate generation, transmission and distribution companies. The existing generating stations of HSEB
will be grouped under a separate power generation company (GENCO). Transmission of power will be
entrusted to a separate transmission company (TRANSCO). Power distribution will be assigned to a
number of independent power distribution companies. A State Electricity Regulatory Commission will be
created to regulate the operation of the power utilities with the primary objective of ensuring the long term
viability of the sector for the benefit of consumers.
Power Generation
12.   The existing Panipat and Faridabad Thermal Power Stations, and the Western Yamuna Canal
Hydro-Electric Project (including Stage - II which is under construction) will be transferred to a new
generation company called 'Haryana Power Generation Company Ltd' (HPGCL). This Company will start
its operations as a State owned Company. At a later stage, the State Government may invite private
sector participation in this Company. This Company will operate on commercial principles. The Company
will sell power to the transmission company for further sale to the distribution companies. This Company
has already been registered under the Indian Companies Act.
13.   The Government of Haryana has decided not to make any major new investment in power
generation. In future, new power generation projects in Haryana will be developed either by Independent
Power Producers (IPPs), selected through international competitive bidding (ICB), by Central Generating
Corporations or by Joint Venture Companies with private parties, other states or central undertakings as
equity partners. All generating companies will operate in a competitive environment without discrimination
based on ownership structure.
Power Transmission
14.   The power transmission network from 220 kV to 132/66 kV will primarily be entrusted to a power
transmission company called 'Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Ltd' (HVPNL). This company will also start
its operations as a State owned company operating on commercial principles. At a later stage, the State
Government may invite private sector participation in this company. HVPNL will be responsible for
purchasing power from HPGCL and various IPPs in Haryana, importing power from central power
generation corporations, jointly owned projects, regional projects, other SEBs, other power projects within
or outside the country. The pooled power will be supplied to different distribution companies. While
HVPNL will be the principal transmission company in the State, as provided in the Reform Act, in future,
the private sector may also be involved in developing the power transmission network.
15.   HVPNL will take over the entitlements and commitments undertaken by HSEB regarding the
procurement of bulk power and will carry them on in accordance with the its corporate objectives and the
directives of the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC). HVPNL will ensure that the
proposed purchases of bulk power are part of a rational overall expansion program aiming at meeting the
demand of power in the most cost-effective way. The transmission company will purchase power in an
economic manner and under a transparent power purchase and procurement process. HVPNL will allow
power despatches on merit order basis so as to avail the least cost power available in the grid.
Power Distribution
16.   For distribution of power, the State will be geographically divided into a number of distribution
zones (e.g. East, West, North and South zones). Each distribution zone will be managed by an
independent distribution company registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. These companies,
on establishment, will be owned by the State Government and will subsequently be privatised as joint
ventures, with majority share holding and management control by the private investor. These distribution
companies will operate pursuant to the licence granted by HERC, within the overall power policy
framework set by the Government. They will approach HERC individually for fixing their retail tariffs; and
amongst the distribution companies, differential tariffs will progressively emerge based on relative costs.



Annex I I
Page 4 of 9
Corporate Structure
17.   The new companies, which will succeed HSEB, will be incorporated under the Indian Companies
Act. To grant appropriate managerial and operational autonomy to the new companies even while these
are State owned, the Government will ensure that a sizeable number of Directors are from outside
Government entities. The Government of Haryana has decided that for each company, the Directors will
be appointed exclusively on the basis of professional merit. The State Govemment and the new
companies will sign Corporatization Agreements to stipulate and delineate the role, rights and obligations
of the State Government as owner, and ensure that the companies will be given the broadest managerial,
operational and financial autonomy. In addition, each company will be required to develop a human
resource policy more conducive to stimulate and reward efficiency.
Regulation of the Power Sector
18.   The Haryana State Electricity Reform Bill has been passed by the State Legislative Assembly on
22nd July, 1997 to provide for the establishment of a new regulatory framework and restructuring of the
power sector. The Bill will be notified as soon as the assent of the President of India is obtained.
Following the coming into force of the new Legislation, the Govemment of Haryana will establish the
Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC).
19.   The objectives of the HERC will be; to regulate the power sector, promote transparency, efficiency
and economy in the operation and management of the power utilities, encourage competition and help
Haryana attract private capital for development while ensuring fair deal to the consumers. The HERC will
have three members, each having a fixed tenure and appointed by the Government of Haryana based on
the recommendations of an independent Selection Committee as stipulated under the Act.
20.   The main functions of the Commission will be to:
*  regulate the purchase, distribution, supply and utilisation of electricity, the quality of service, the tariff
and charges payable keeping in view the interest of the consumers as well as the electricity
companies;
*  issue licences for power transmission and distribution in the State;
*  regulate the working of licensees and to promote their working in an efficient, economical and
equitable manner;
*  promote efficiency, economy and safety in the use of electricity in the State with particular regard to
quality, continuity and reliability of service to the consumer;
*  promote competition and encourage the participation of the private sector while ensuring fair deal to
the consumers;
*  set an appropriate code of conduct and standards for the electricity industry;
*  require licensees to formulate prospective plans and schemes for the promotion of generation,
transmission, distribution and supply of electricity,
*  aid and advise the State Government in matters concerning electricity generation, transmission,
distribution and supply in the State; and
*  act as arbitrator or adjudicator to settle disputes arising between the licensees.
21.   The Government of Haryana re-affirms its commitment to take all necessary steps to facilitate the
independent functioning of the HERC as per the spirit of the Reform Legislation; notably to ensure the
autonomy of the Commission and the selection of the most qualified and competent members of the
Commission. The Government also re-iterates its commitment to take all necessary measures to abide by
the provisions of the Reform Legislation with regard to fixation of tariff by the Commission; and, whenever
the Government decides to subsidise the supply of power to specific group of consumers, it will pay the
required subsidies as determined by the Commission.



Annex I I
Page 5 of 9
Restructuring and Formation of Joint Venture Companies
22.   The power distribution function will be entrusted to a number of distribution companies e.g. East
Zone, West Zone, South Zone and North Zone. These companies will be incorporated as State owned
companies and will be converted into Joint Venture Companies (JVC) with majority share holding of
private strategic investors. This entire process will be completed by end 2001, although aiming for a more
rapid schedule.
23.   The East Zone comprising the districts of Rohtak, Karnal, Panipat and Sonepat will be the first to
be operated by a JVC. The selection of the private partner will be done through international competitive
bidding route and the JVC is likely to commence its operations by December, 1998. The private partner
will hold the majority shares and will have management control. Similar process in other zones will be
undertaken as rapidly as possible and completed by 2001. Two or more zones may be considered
simultaneously to expedite this process. The shares of the distribution companies will be sold to private
investors through a carefully designed competitive bidding process, to ensure selection of a technical and
financially competent partner. In all these companies the private partners will hold the majority shares and
management control. All the distribution companies will work under the license to be issued and enforced
by HERC. The management of these State owned distribution companies will be given a clear mandate to
prepare for privatization of the companies
24.   These distribution companies will initially get bulk power through HVPNL which will in turn procure
power from various generation sources and transmit to distribution companies. At a later stage, the
distribution companies may enter into direct power purchase agreements with the generating companies.
Development of New Generation Capacity and Private Sector Participation
25.   The Government of Haryana attaches the highest priority for achieving additional generation
capacity within the shortest possible time so as to bridge the gap between power availability and demand.
Over the last one year the Government of Haryana has been able to firm up the allocation of entire power
from Faridabad 400 MW gas based power station to be constructed by National Thermal Power
Corporation. The Government of Haryana has received an allocation of liquid fuel for power generation to
the extent of 860 MW. The process is on for utilization of the liquid fuel allocation by firming up Power
Purchase Agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPP) selected through competitive bidding
route for setting up a number of 25 MW capacity power plants near the load centres. A Memorandum of
Understanding has been signed with an IPP selected through competitive bidding route to complete the
210 MW Unit-6 at Panipat Thermal Station. A comprehensive rehabilitation and life extension project has
been launched for the existing four units of 110 MW each at Panipat Thermal Station with a private
company selected through competitive bidding route. A similar program of rehabilitation and life extension
has also been initiated for the Faridabad Thermal Station.
26.   The Government of Haryana has engaged consultants to assist in preparing bid documents, and
inviting offers following international competitive bidding from IPPs for setting up thermal power stations at
Yamunanagar and Hisar. Negotiations are in progress with M/s Indian Oil Corporation for setting up a 300
MW residual fuel based thermal station at Panipat for supplying power to Haryana on a long term basis.
27.    Haryana State is a share holder (25% equity partnership) inThe inter-State Parbati Hydro-electric
Project (2051 MW) which is being executed as a Joint Venture of Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and
Himachal Pradesh. In addition, the State Government is negotiating power purchase agreement with M/s
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA) for purchasing 500 MW power from the coal based thermal
project being set up at Hirma, in Orissa.
28.   The State is also exploring the possibility of purchasing power from hydel projects like Baspa, in
the neighbouring State of Himachal Pradesh, Snowy Mountains Project in Nepal and the thermal project
proposed at Nabinagar in Bihar.



Annex 1 1
Page 6 of 9
Financial Restructuring and Tariff Rationalisation
29.    Given the present poor financial standing of HSEB, the power sector reform program will include
the implementation of a major financial restructuring plan. Such a restructuring is critical to enable the new
companies to start their operations on a financially viable footing. The financial restructuring will include
rationalisation of tariffs, restructuring of the balance sheets through identification and write-off of and
provisioning for doubfful or non-performing assets, settlement of un-funded liabilities, and design and
implementation of a suitable mechanism to clear the debt overhang and overdue commercial liabilities.
30.    Presently the agricultural sector, and to a lesser extent the domestic sector, are highly subsidized,
resulting in an annual cash shortfall of nearly Rs. 700 crores (FY1998). This shortfall is compensated by
cross-subsidies, direct subsidies from the State Government and long-term borrowings from the open
market and financial Institutions guaranteed by the State Government. The reforms program aims to
eliminate state subsidies in a phased manner and make the power sector self-reliant and in fact, a net
generator of resources for the State economy, over a period of time. Haryana has agreed to the Common
Minimum National Action Plan for Power notified by the Government of India, in December 1996. The
State Government will take the appropriate steps to achieve the targets set in this Plan regarding the
subsidization of specific consumer categories.
31.    To protect the interests of small rural consumers and the poor, appropriate rates will be charged,
based on the socio-economic considerations. Government of Haryana expects that the overall growth of
the state economy and resultant poverty alleviation will steadily reduce the need for subsidies in power
supply.
32.    The State Government has resolved to expeditiously install energy meters on all un-metered
agriculture connections expeditiously so that the consumers are charged on the basis of actual metered
supply.
33.    One of the objectives of power sector reform is to restore the financial viability of the power
utilities as quickly as possible so that the sector ceases to be a burden on the state's budget, becomes a
generator of net resources, and is able to attract the needed investments on its own strength. It is
expected that the revenue from operations, including subsidy where appropriate, of the new companies
(Genco, Transco, and Distribution companies) will be sufficient to cover all their operating expenses, in the
first year of operation (FY 99); and to generate a rate of return on net worth of at least 10 percent in FY
2000, and thereafter earn a rate of return as per tariff notifications applicable to them. In addition, these
companies shall meet all their financial and commercial obligations on time, and generate adequate
resources internally to a level that may be necessary to support financing of their respective investment
programs.
34.    While transferring the assets and liabilities, the government shall set-off cross debts and make
necessary provision for write-offs to provide a satisfactory opening balance sheet to the companies. The
Government will adjust tariffs before the Regulatory Commission comes into operation to the extent
required for enabling the entities to achieve the financial targets envisaged in the financial restructuring
plan. In addition, future financing for investment program and long term working capital needs shall be
provided to the companies in the form of equity instead of loans as in the past. Thus government
contribution will enable HSEB's successor companies to meet their financial performance goals and
finance their investment program. The Government will make adequate budgetary provision for the
estimated financial support required for the year and will provide this support in cash to the companies, in
equal monthly instalments as per the current practice.
35.   In accordance with the proposed Haryana Electricity Reform Act, the government shall take over
all the assets and liabilities of HSEB on the appointed date, and transfer to the new companies assets &
liabilities through a transfer scheme prepared by the Government of Haryana. In particular the
adjustments under the Transfer Scheme shall be done to: (a) set off accumulated losses of HSEB against



Annex I I
Page 7 of 9
government equity and loans, (b) make adequate provision for obsolete stores, uncollectible receivables,
contingent liabilities likely to devolve, (c) recognize and provide for unfunded liabilities related to
pensionary and other retirement dues of the staff, (d) revalue the assets to the extent necessary to carry
out the balance sheet restructuring, and (e) retain with the government disputed contingent liabilities that
are not likely to devolve.
36.   In the post-reform scenario, the power sector will have a modified financial structure under which
every power entity will be required to self sustain its operations and to raise resources from the market on
its own strength for future development activities. However, this will be supplemented by the loans
negotiated under the Reform Program.
37.    The financial restructuring plan drawn up by the State includes an investment of about Rs. 7900
crores including Rs. 927 crores in generation projects and balance Rs. 6974 crores for the Rehabilitation
of T&D works to be spent over the next 10 years. The resources will be mobilized from IBRD (34%), JVC
(23%), GoH (12%), IFIs (10%), KfW (4%), OECF (8%), and Internal (9%). The T&D losses will be
reduced by 10% in technical losses and 5.8% in non-technical losses over the next 10 years. The
collection efficiency will be improved from the present level of 90% to 95%. Necessary steps to bring
improvement in all elements of operations shall be undertaken from the very beginning itself. The State
Government shall provide the transition support so that the new companies shall not face the shortfall in
internal generation of funds. The tariff support will be provided in the transition period.
38.    The State Government commits to make up for gap in the necessary funds, if potential identified
financing sources do not materialize. The State would also provide funds for covering the contingent
liabilities if these devolve at the time of apportionment of assets and liabilities. The pending debts and
payables would be rescheduled to reduce the requirement of funds in the transition phase. The State
Government will set off existing Equity, Loans, etc. of HSEB under the transfer scheme. The Government
of Haryana will provide the Plan Assistance to the power entities as equity contribution instead of the
present system of releasing it as a loan. The State Government also assures to provide necessary
subsidy for the transition stage to cover the costs and meet financial targets by the new power entities.
Demand Side Management
39.    The reform program will also address issues like energy efficiency and demand side management
with the objective to improve efficiency in supply and end use of electricity. The main focus will be on:
*  introduction of incentive linked tariffs such as; time of day tariffs for selected categories of consumers,
peak load tariffs, seasonal tariffs and other related incentives and disincentives;
*  improvement of efficiency of agriculture tubewells and industrial installations by actions such as
rehabilitation of agriculture pump-sets, installation of capacitors, provision of meters on un-metered
connections and advice to consumers on various energy conservation measures. These end-use
efficiency improvement activities in the agricultural sector and the Water Resource Consolidation
Program, initiated by the State Government with the assistance of the World Bank, will complement
each other; they will ultimately result in preventing depletion of the sub-soil water table; and
*  promotion of Energy Service Companies and Energy Service Centres to play advisory role to the
consumers and provide necessary financial assistance and backup.
40.    All resources including energy conservation and use of non-conventional energy sources will be
considered in the process of power planning to manage the power demand effectively and reduce the
need for additional generation capacity. Various options available with the HVPNL and distribution
companies to bring in demand side management measures will be explored and suitable policies will be
notified in consultation with the HERC.
41.    Energy efficiency and DSM programs will be promoted through developing bankable strategies
and programs in consultation with the stake holders. Private sector participation through formation of



Annex I I
Page 8 of 9
Energy Service Centres will be encouraged. Consumer awareness campaigns will be launched to
promote energy conservation.
Environmental and Social Aspects
42.    Government of Haryana is very keen to ensure a fair, efficient and transparent handling of all
matters relating to land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, including loss of assets and other
negative impacts on Project Affected Persons (PAPs) resulting from its transmission investment program,
irrespective of sources of financing. In this context, the State Government has formulated the Social
Policy and Procedures (SPP). This policy not only provides for rehabilitation of the owners of land
acquired for the power projects but also addresses interests of tenants, share croppers, lease holders,
encroachers, squatters etc. There are specific provisions for compensating loss of livelihood, loss of
standing crops and trees, loss during transition period, loss of access to common resources and
properties and even losses to host communities which were hitherto not protected under the law.
43.   The State Government will give utmost importance to the environmental aspects of power
generation and supply under the reform program. Environmental impact will be fully integrated in planning
and implementation of all the generation, transmission and distribution projects. The renovation and
modernisation of existing power generation stations, already undertaken, will minimise the environmental
impacts on the surrounding areas and the population in the adjoining areas. All new projects will be
developed in accordance with applicable environmental standard, and resettlement and rehabilitation
policies. The burgeoning of highly polluting small urban diesel generators will cease. Reform initiatives
such as reduction in transmission and distribution losses, improved metering, billing and collections,
improvement in energy efficiency, promoting DSM will have a positive impact on the environment. Power
sector planning in future will incorporate environmental cost along with economic and financial cost to
draw up the optimal plan.
Human Resource Development
44.    Haryana expects that given the anticipated growth of the system and the superannuation process,
there will not be any need for retrenchment of employees. All the existing employees of HSEB will be
absorbed in the new power utilities. Transfer of employees will be based on a time bound transfer
scheme prepared by the State Government.
45.   The Haryana Electricity Reform Bill, passed by the State Legislature on 22nd July, 1997, clearly
provides for safeguarding the interests of the employees of the HSEB. It ensures that any change in
service conditions or rules will not be less favourable than those available today.
46.   The new power companies may notify an attractive voluntary severance package and provide for
transparent benefits to the employees who might opt to seek alternative employment or seek voluntary
severance.
47.    The reform process will be accompanied by programs to improve skills and work environment.
These will cover various levels of employees to enable them to discharge their responsibilities and
functions in a more efficient manner. A key objective of restructuring is to create a culture where customer
service is paramount. The employees will have new opportunities to undertake greater responsibility; but
they will also be accountable for delivering results.
The Implementation Strategy
48.    The Government of Haryana is aware that the success of the reform process will hinge on its
acceptance by the stakeholders e.g. consumers, employees, State Government. Beyond ensuring that all
the technical aspects of the reform process are properly addressed, the implementation strategy will
develop participatory approaches and will aim at building a broad and durable constituency for change.



Annex 1 1
Page 9 of 9
49.   The Government and the management of HSEB and its successors will continue and intensify the
communications campaigns to explain why the reforms are necessary, what they include, how and when
they will be implemented. The communication efforts will focus on the various groups of HSEB'
employees, end users - notably industrial, agricultural and domestic consumers, Government
functionaries, academics, opinion leaders, NGOs. At the same time, this process will help improve the
design and implementation of the reform measures, as this was already demonstrated during interaction
with HSEB employees for the preparation of the Emergency Action Plan and with various groups for the
preparation of the Social Policy and Procedures (transmission investment).
50.   The Govemment of Haryana is fully committed for ensuring the irreversibility of the process. The
enactment of the Electricity Reform Bill in 1997, the establishment of the HERC and of the new power
corporations in 1998, alongwith the initiation of process of privatisation of the distribution business and of
the financial restructuring of the sector constitute the foundations of the Haryana's new power industry. At
the same time, HSEB and its successors will implement an Emergency Action Program, to be
implemented through 1998 and 1999, to address the most urgent needs of the sector, improve the quality
of power in the most critically affected areas, improve the interface with consumers, and improve the
safety and working conditions of staff.
51.   The prime objective of the implementation strategy will be to ensure that the quality of power
improves and tariff increases are kept to a minimum through improvements in system efficiency. To
achieve this objective, the highest priority will be given in the early years of the reform program to
investment in distribution and transmission, efficiency improvement in generating stations and privatisation
of the distribution business.
52.   A major effort will be needed to establish the new power sector entities, develop the required
skills, and to implement an investment plan of an unprecedented magnitude. Similar reforms in power
industries have been taken or are taking place in India and elsewhere in the world. The Government of
Haryana will welcome exchange of experiences; to learn from the experiences of other States and other
countries, and also to share Haryana's own experience. Private sector participation will contribute in
bringing the required expertise, specially in management and financial efficiencies. In addition, particularly
during the initial and transition phases, Haryana may avail of the services of national and international
experts.
53.   The Government of Haryana has also decided to guide and monitor closely the implementation of
the reform program. The Government will formulate an implementation plan which will spell out clearly the
implementation actions, steps, resources, responsibilities, milestones and schedules. The implementation
plan will constitute the reference framework for monitoring the progress in carrying out the reform
program. A senior level Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary of the Government and
including concerned Secretaries as Members has been constituted to guide and evaluate the
implementation of the reform program. If needed, the Steering Committee may invite independent reputed
experts to assess the progress of the implementation of the reform program. In addition, an
Implementation Committee headed by Secretary/Power will co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of
the reform program.
54.   Government of Haryana is fully committed to reform the power sector in the State. It has taken
several policy initiatives to accomplish this task. The passage of the Haryana Electricity Reform Bill has
put in place the required legislative framework. The institutional changes required to implement the reform
process are under active consideration and it will be possible to maintain the implementation schedule.
The Government of Haryana realises that the reform process will need close co-operation between all
stakeholders: Government of Haryana, power sector employees, consumers, financial institutions. Given
its clear commitment to the people of Haryana to provide quality power, efficiently and at reasonable rates,
Govemment of Haryana dedicates itself to the task of reforming the power sector.

Annex 12
SUMMARY OF HARYANA'S PROGRAM AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Objective of PPIP
1.    The objective of the Program and Project Implementation Plan (PPIP) is to describe how the
Government of Haryana intends to:
implement the reform program and restructure the State's power sector and promote its development
along the lines indicated in the Government's General Power Sector Policy Statement of 1 January,
1996, and further elaborated in the Detailed Power Sector Policy Statement of 4 November, 1997; and
*  carry out its long term investment program (over the next 10 years), and more specifically the
Emergency Action Plan, approved by the State Government and supported by the first World
Bank loan, under the Adaptable Program Loan.
2.    The PPIP is intended to be a dynamic instrument, which will be updated and completed during
various stages of implementation of the Power Sector Reform and Development Program. The first
version of the PPIP defines with precision the steps that will be taken and the milestones that Haryana
expects to achieve in the near-term. It also provides details of the implementation arrangements for the
Emergency Action Plan.
3.    The long-term actions are also stated in the PPIP, although with less detail and precision. Given
the magnitude of changes that the power sector will undergo, it would be illusory to try to define now the
measures or results that would be accomplished in five or seven years hence. However the policy goals,
the reform components, and the sequencing of activities are clearly spelled out in the PPIP.
4.    The PPIP is intended to serve as a monitoring instrument to be used by the Government, the
World Bank and other funding agencies for assessing, from time to time, the progress in implementing
Power Sector Reform and Development Program. This will allow the State Government, the World Bank
and other funding agencies to gauge the achievement of critical milestones in the reform program, to
attend to any need for adjustment to the program, and to complete the appraisal of the subsequent
phases, of the Haryana Power Sector Reform and Development Program.
Implementation of the Reform Program
5.     Phased Approach: The reform program will be undertaken in a phased manner, over a 10 year
period, (1998-2007), with the involvement and participation of the various stakeholders in order to build a
broad and durable constituency of change. In view of the technical complexity and sensitivity of the reform
program, the phased approach of the reform program is aimed to demonstrate the benefits of the reform
at every step and thereby ensure the irreversibility of the process. The various phases of the
implementation of reform program are described below.
*  The initial phase (1998-99) of the reform program will set the legal, regulatory and structural stage for
the reform. At the same time, HSEB and its successors will implement an Emergency Action Plan with
the objective to remove some of the most critical shortcomings of the sector, improve the quality of
power (in few selected areas), improve the interface with consumers, and improve the safety and
working conditions of staff.
* The second phase, (1999-2002), will focus on privatization of distribution business, achievement of
financial sustainability in the sector, institutional development of the new entities and improvements in
system efficiency, quality of power and customer service. The prime objective of the implementation
strategy will be to ensure that in parallel with tariff adjustments there is some improvement in the



Annex 12
Page 2 of 12
quality of power; however, it may be unrealistic to assume that the quality of power would improve
dramatically in the initial years of the program.
*  In the third phase (2002-04), efforts will be made towards consolidation of the functioning and financial
situation of the new entities and achievement of more reliable power supplies. By the end of this
phase, privatization of the entire distribution area would have been completed, most of the financial
restructuring measures would have been implemented, and further investments would have been
made for system expansion and efficiency improvements in distribution.
*  Fourth phase (2004-07), will focus on achievement of higher consumer satisfaction through
progressively ensuring adequate supply of power to meet the power demand, attainment of higher
quality and efficiency in electricity services and furtherance of power sector reforms to increase
competition and private sector participation (for example evolving from the single buyer model to other
models allowing a higher degree of competition at the wholesale and retail levels). It is expected that
during this phase the sector would be in a position to finance its growth and development through
internal resource generation by the entities and through access to capital market.
6.     Reform Act. The enforcement of the Reform Act, will enable the establishment of Haryana
Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) and unbundling of HSEB into new corporate entities based on
functional specialization. The Act provides for a specific time frame from the date of its enforcement for
establishing HERC, GENCO and TRANSCO. The State Government will simultaneously establish the
new entities and therefore link the effective date of the Reform Act to the level of preparedness for
establishment of HERC, GENCO and TRANSCO.

7.    Establishment of HERC: HERC will be established on 3 April 1998, following the enforcement of
the Reform Act on 1 April, 1998. The process for selection of three Commissioners for HERC will be
initiated following the notification of the Reform Act in official gazette in early December 1997. To assist in
the preparation for establishment and operation of HERC as scheduled by early April 1998, Government
of Haryana has set up a Core Working Group. This group will carry out the initial tasks required for
establishing the regulatory commission, e.g. preparation of organizational structure of HERC, assessing
staff requirements, logistical aspects, budget, preparation of institutional development plan, preparation for
the near-term activities that the Commission will have to undertake when established, for example
preparation of code of conduct of the commission, operational and administrative procedures for working
of the commission, procedures for issue of license etc. The schedule of implementation of various
activities for establishment of HERC is given in the Table ES-2 below.

8.     Unbundling and Corporatization. Following the effectiveness of the Reform Act, Government of
Haryana will un-bundle the vertically integrated monopoly power utility - HSEB - into new entities based on
functional specifications. The restructuring process will be carried in two phases: (i) creation of Haryana
Power Generation Company (HPGCL or GENCO) and Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Ltd. (HVPNL or
TRANSCO) (which will initially take care of both transmission and the distribution business); and
subsequently (ii) creation of a number of distribution companies to take over distribution business.
9.    The implementation strategy for creating a reformed power sector is to: (i) proceed with the
creation and corporatization of generation, transmission and distribution companies as soon as it is legally
possible; (ii) develop in parallel an active information and communication campaign for the stakeholders
and notably the staff; (iii) undertake measures to improve the managerial environment in the new
companies; and (iv) undertake a comprehensive institutional development program for the new
companies. The strategy for implementation is to restructure the existing framework with the creation of
new entities with clear mandate and commercial orientation. All efforts will be made to ensure that the
transition period to the new restructured entities is minimized with adequate preparatory work. Schedule
of key steps required for unbundling of HSEB and corporatization of new entities is given in Table ES-3.

10.    Privatization of Distribution: The power distribution business will be entrusted to a number of
distribution companies. The distribution area of HSEB will be segmented into several zones (e.g. North,
South, East and West), based on the financial and technical viability, consumer mix etc. and to ensure
their attractiveness for private investors. The distribution zones on establishment will be incorporated as
the Government owned companies, and will be subsequently converted into joint venture companies with
majority share holding and management control of the private investor. The private joint venture
partner(s) will be selected through international competitive bidding route. The privatization process will
be expeditious and is expected to be completed by December 2001. The schedule of privatization of
distribution is given below.

(*): To facilitate the privatization process some distribution zones will be "grouped" for the transaction. The
approach for "privatization" will be decided by Haryana with the assistance of its consultants.
11.    Technical Assistance: Significant efforts are required to establish the new power sector entities,
develop the required skills, and implement an investment program of an unprecedented magnitude. The
implementation of the reform program will be supported by comprehensive technical assistance program
for HSEB and its successor entities. Important areas for which technical assistance is envisaged are
given in Table ES-5.

Financial Restructuring
12.    Financial turnaround of Haryana's power sector from insolvency depends on HSEB's successor
entities being allowed adequate tariffs, operational autonomy and accountability of the management to
improve financial and operational efficiencies, a healthy capital structure and financing of investments
required for rehabilitation and reinforcement of transmission and distribution system.
13.   In order to provide satisfactory opening balance sheets to the new companies in the restructured
power sector, Government of Haryana plans to (I) write off HSEB's accumulated losses of Rs. 21.3 billion
(expected as on 31 March 1998) against its equity, loans and interest outstanding amounting to Rs. 24
billion (ii) provide for unusable and obsolete stores and uncollectible receivables amounting to Rs. 5.7
billion (iii) recognize the unfunded liabilities, on account of retirement dues of the staff, estimated at Rs.
8.7 billion, by issuing government guaranteed bonds to employee-managed Pension and Provident Fund
Trusts; (iv) adequately capitalize the companies and provide future financing from the State Government
as equity; (v) make adequate provisions for uncollectible receivables, obsolete inventories, and contingent
liabilities likely to devolve; and (vi) retain with Government contingent liabilities of Rs. 6 billion not
expected to devolve.
14.    To increase cost recovery and reduce distortions in tariff structure, Government of Haryana will
support the following tariff measures (i) increase in agriculture tariffs every year starting FY 2000, by Rs.
0.25/kWh every year for the following three years to reach a level of Rs. 1.38/kWh by FY 2003; an
average annual increase of 33 percent and (ii) increase in tariffs for industrial, commercial and domestic
consumer categories by about 15 percent in FY 1999, 10 percent in FY 2000 and FY 2001 and 8 percent
in FY 2002. These tariff revisions will however be subject to the procedures set by HERC. Government of
Haryana plans to completely eliminate the subsidies within next 4 years; however in the transition period
to meet the shortfall in rate of return Government will provide subsidy in addition to the Rs. 200 crores per
annum on average provided in Ninth Plan.
15.    A summary of the projected financial performance of the new entities in the power sector, on an
aggregate basis, is provided in Table ES-6 below.

16.    Expected improvements in financial performance of the successor entities would not only
eliminate the need for state subsidy but also reduce their dependence on the state's plan resources for
financing their investments. The sector is expected to reverse the budgetary flows within four years and
begin contributing about US $ 65 million starting FY 2003.
Power Sector Investment Program - FYI 998- FY2007
17.    Demand for electricity in Haryana state is expected to grow at an annual compounded rate of
about 7.5 percent during the period FY 1998 to FY 2007. Energy demand is estimated to be about 20
billion units in FY 2007, up from 8.8 billion units in FY 1998 (at end-use level). The peak demand is
estimated to reach 4500 MW in FY 2007. Until FY2000, sales to domestic and industrial consumers is
expected to grow annually at about 6 percent and 5 percent respectively, while sales to agriculture sector
is projected to grow at about 2 percent. However from FY 2000 onwards, due to increased availability of
power, the sales mix is expected to change significantly in favor of higher tariff categories. During the
period FY 2000 - FY 2007, among the various consumer categories, sales to industrial sector is expected
to increase at a high rate of 16 percent per annum due to shift from captive generation to grid because of
improvement in grid supply, phasing out of curtailment and release of new connections. Sales to domestic
sector is also projected to grow at about 14 percent per annum with reduction in power curtailment and
wait list. Agriculture demand is not expected to grow fast because the cultivable area and cropping
intensity have reached a peak in Haryana.
18.   Investments of the order of about Rs. 200 billion12 is estimated to be required in the Haryana's
power sector to rehabilitate and expand the system to meet the growing demand for power in the state,
over the next 10 years. Broadly the investments are required for (i) creating new assets in generation,
transmission and distribution (ii) improving the efficiency of existing assets in operation and (iii) introducing
energy efficiency and demand side management activities.

19.    Government of Haryana has taken a conscious decision to minimize its investments in power
generation; to actively encourage private sector participation in the development of additional power
generation; and import power from other states in India and also neighboring countries. Government's
focus in the coming decade will be to rehabilitate and expand the power transmission and distribution
system in the state. The main objectives of the investment program of the State Government are to :(i)
expand the size of transmission and distribution system to meet the growing demand for power; (ii)
improve operational efficiency of the existing assets; (iii) reduce system losses and improve end use
efficiency; (iv) improve the quality of power supply to consumers and (v) support power sector reform
program. Government of Haryana's investment program during the next 10 years is estimated to be of the
order of about Rs. 80,000 million(about US$ 1800 million). Table ES-7 summarizes the Government of
Haryana's investment program for the power sector.

20.    Phased Approach: Government proposes to undertake this investment program in a phased
manner over the next 10 years. The phasing of the investments will be carried out based on: (i)
prioritization of the needs and related investments; (ii) availability of funds; (iii) expected changes in the
ownership keeping in view the new evolving structure of the power sector and (iv) overall power sector
reform program. The four phases of the implementation of investment program are descried below.
*      Initially, the Government plans to implement investment projects which are most critical for the
power sector. The Emergency Action Plan will include investments of US$ 77 million, towards (i)
construction of critically needed high voltage evacuation lines and transmission lines and sub-
stations; (ii) rehabilitation of sub-transmission and distribution systems; (iii) improvement of
commercial and technical services to consumers and (iv) provision of technical assistance and
engineering services.
*      In the second phase, the focus will be on (i) the continuation of the investment program in
transmission (ii) the provision of basic distribution equipment (e.g. meters, transformers,
capacitors etc.) and rehabilitation and expansion of distribution system; (iii) demand side
management measures and rural energy initiatives and (iv) additional technical assistance.
*      In the subsequent phases, the expansion of transmission and distribution system will continue,
with special focus on improving consumer services and quality and reliability of power supply.
The technical assistance to new entities in the power sector will be phased out while demand side
management activities will be expanded.
21.    Financing of Investment Program: State Government proposes to finance its investment
program through support of various multilateral and bilateral funding organizations such as World Bank,
DFID, KfW, OECF etc. The Government of Haryana expects that with improvement in the
creditworthiness of the power sector, it will be able to attract significant resources from private sector and



Annex 12
Page 9 of 12
capital markets. The new entities will also be able to contribute towards investment program through
internal resource generation and borrowings from financial institutions and commercial banks.
22.    The World Bank confirmed in January 1996 and again in August 1997, that it was ready to support
Haryana in its reform and development program on the basis of a long term approach. The Bank is willing
to commit support of up to US $ 600 million for next 10 years. The UK Department for International
Development (DFID) is currently considering financing the technical assistance component of the
investment program. KfW has also expressed interest in financing the rehabilitation of Panipat and
Faridabad power stations to bring them in compliance with environmental standards. OECF and Japan
Exim Bank have also expressed interest in supporting Haryana's program.
23.    The proposed financing plan includes: IBRD (33%), private equity (2%), bilateral sources (14%),
State Government (16%), internal resource generation (12%), and the balance from Indian Financial
Institutions/Commercial lenders including borrowings raised by the private investors (refer Table ES-8).

Emergency Action Plan: (Haryana Power Sector Restructuring Project)
24.    Govemment of Haryana proposes to implement the Haryana Power sector Restructuring Project
with the objective to initiate the reform process by establishing the new legal, regulatory and institutional
framework (including the creation of an independent regulatory commission and new power sector
entities, and initiation of privatization of the distribution business) and to remove the most critical
bottlenecks of the power system (identified under Emergency Action Plan) with a view to demonstrate - in
a few selected areas - the benefits which could be expected from a successful reform of the power sector.
25.    The EAP will be financed by the support of the World Bank, DFID and HSEB. World Bank has
committed US $ 60 million for supporting various components of EAP accounting for 78 percent of the
total investment in EAP. The broad components of EAP and their financing is provided in the Table ES-9
below:

26.   The economic rate of return of EAP is estimated at 52.4 percent (NPV of net benefits being Rs.
9,396 million) and the financial rate of return is estimated at 53 percent (NPV of net benefits being Rs.
11,174 million)13. The extremely high rate of returns are due to (I) the nature of investments which is aimed
at addressing most critical bottlenecks in transmission and some of the worst segments of distribution
system (with large improvement potential) and (ii) because of the high level of unserved demand eliminated
by the evacuation lines. These values of economic and financial rate of return would be even higher if (I) it
was able to quantify benefits of improvement in quality of power as a result of investments in transmission
and distribution system (ii) environmental benefits that derive from reduction of air pollution impacts
associated with self generation and (iii) benefits from technical assistance component of EAP and
improvements in customer service.
27.    HSEB has identified 22 packages for procurement of goods and works for implementation of EAP
works. All procurement packages have been finalized along with their schedule for bidding process. The
preparation of bidding documents for ICB packages is in advance stage of preparation; about US$ 50
million worth of bidding documents have been finalized.
28.   The World Bank Loan (APL 1) for supporting EAP will be lent to GOI. GOI will onlend the
proceeds of the loan to Government of Haryana, under GOI's standard arrangements for developmental
assistance to the states, and fully additional to the GOI's regular assistance loan to Haryana. State
Government will onlend the proceeds to HSEB, which will be the executing agency for APL1. After
restructuring of HSEB, the successor entities will take over the execution of the project. All contracts
signed by HSEB with regard to implementation of EAP, will be transferred to HVPNL (including interalia
contracts relating to distribution items) as per the Transfer Scheme Rules (as provided in Haryana
Electricity Reform Act). When new distribution companies are established, HVPNL will enter into a back-
to-back arrangement with them in respect of equiprnent/goods supplied in particular distribution areas.
Benefits of Reform and Investment Program
29.    Economic and Financial Justification: The economic benefits of the Reform and Restructuring
Program, are estimated at Rs. 81,500 million (net present value discounted at 12%) relative to a
'business-as-usual" case characterized by increasing levels of unserved energy, system losses and
inadequate investments. The financial benefits are estimated at Rs. 75,000 million (NPV discounted at
12%).
30.    Reform and Development Program is expected to bring in significant improvements in the overall
operations and efficiency of the power sector in meeting the demand for power. It is expected that by FY
2007, the power requirements in Haryana will be met, consumers will be provided with reliable, high
quality and cost effective electricity, by creditworthy and commercially operated power utilities functioning
in a competitive and appropriately regulated power market, with significant private sector ownership and
participation. Table ES-1 0 provides the summary of some of the important performance targets expected
due to implementation of the investment program over the next decade. It is however important to note
that the present situation of the performance of the power sector may in fact indicate a
deterioration in the initial 1-2 years of the initiation of the reform program, primarily due to
reflection of more precise performance indicators of the prevailing situation (baseline) and also on
account of the time lag before the benefits of the new investments in rehabilitation and expansion
of the transmission and distribution can be realized.

of the equity; by end 2007 for each distribution company the share of private sector is expected to increase to
alteast 70 percent.
Program Implementation and Monitoring
31     Gov\ernment of Haryana will closely guide and monitor the implementation of the reform and
investment program. A senior level Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary and including the
secretaries in charge of energy and finance, and the Chairman, HSEB has been constituted to guide and
evaluate the implementation of the reform program.
32     At the operational level, HSEB has established a Reform and Restructuring Team to prepare and
coordinate the implementation of the reform measures and the investment program. For the
implementation of Emergency Action Plan, a special group has been constituted to monitor the
implementation of various aspects of Emergency Action Plan. Consultants will be hired to assist and
guide HSEB and its successor entities to undertake complex task of restructuring.
33 -  A Program Implementation Committee, headed by Secretary Power will be constituted to closely
monitor the implementation of the reform and investment program. This committee will include
representatives of the new entities in the power sector - HPGCL, HVPNL and DISCOMs. At the
operational level, each of the executing agencies will have its own project management unit to carry out
the implementation of the investment measures. These project management units may be assisted by
reputed engineering consultants.



Annex 12
Page 12 of 12
34    When required, State Govemment may invite reputed professionals to assess the progress of the
implementation of the reform program and achievement of the basic principles and goals of the reform
policy. Since this will involve assessing how the Government is meeting its commitment in terms of
providing autonomy to the new entities in the power sector, selecting skilled professionals, and
discharging its own financial liabilities and commitment, State Government would ensure that these
professionals are invited as independent observers and not as consultants appointed by the Government.

per the schedule provided in this Plan and the Financial Commitment Letter.
2.     The beneficiary power utilities (TRANSCO and the Distribution companies as the case may be)

buyer market to a multiple-buyer, more competitive market), furthering private participation in the sector
(e.g., transmission); expanding the power system and importing power from large private projects in
India or neighboring countries. Haryana expects that, during the execution of the project, the power
deficit in the state would be eliminated.
Indicative Project Description
