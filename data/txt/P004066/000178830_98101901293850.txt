KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
SUMMARY
i.        The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) was established in
1967 with the active assistance of the Bank Group, including an equity
participation from IFC, which at year-end 1974 owned about 14% of KDFC's share
capital. KDFC has to date received four Bank loans totalling $95 million,
all of which have been fully committed. It also obtained its first loan
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-in October 1974, for $30 million.
KDFC has requested a fifth loan from the Bank for $55 million.
ii.       In 1974 the Korean economy achieved a real growth rate of 8.2%
which, although well below the record growth rate of 16.5% in 1973, was
not far short of the Government's target of 9%. However, most of the growth
was concentrated in the first half of the year, and the economy began to
slow down from mid-1974 under the impact of the worldwide recession and the
energy crisis. This downturn has continued in 1975. Industrial investment
is expected to pick up when economic recovery gets under way in the U.S.
and Japan. In view of the general economic slowdown and the expected dif-
ficulties in the short-term balance of payments situation, the Government
introduced in December 1974 a number of economic measures which included the
devaluation of the won by 17.5% (in dollar terms), the raising of oil prices
and utility rates, and the acceleration of public expenditures to stimulate
the economy. Other measures were aimed at encouraging investment, assisting
export-oriented firms and promoting small- and medium-scale industries. The
Government has not yet changed the interest rate structure significantly in
view of present financial difficulties encountered by businesses and of the
fear that an increase in interest rates at this time would further depress
the industrial sector. The Bank has indicated to the Korean authorities
that it wishes to keep the interest rate levels under review, and they have
agreed to further discussions from time to time.
iii.      Since the previous appraisal in early 1973, KDFC's performance
has continued to be satisfactory from both the developmental and institu-
tional points of view.. The institution remains one of the best organized
and most efficient DFCs with which the Bank Group is associated. It has
a strong management and a competent staff. Its operational standards,
notably in its project appraisal and follow-up work, are high. Its financial
position and portfolio are sound, and its earnings performance satisfactory.
Since its inception, KDFC has approved financial assistance aggregating
W 52.96 billion for the manufacturing, mining, agro-industrial, fishing
and transport sectors. Its disbursements over the 1970-74 period accounted
for about 2.9% of total fixed investment in manufacturing in Korea.



- ii -
iv.       Although it is a relatively small source of finance for Korean
industry, KDFC's qualitative role is important in view of the contributions
it has made toward improving both the resource allocation and resource
mobilization systems in Korea. Its high appraisal standards have ensured
the efficient allocation of Bank funds and other resources available to it
to projects that are economically as well as financially viable.  Data on
a representative sample of KDFC's projects showed an average economic rate
of return of 31% and a financial rate of return of 24%. KDFC-supported
projects are estimated to export annually goods to the value of about $358
million, resulting in a net balance of payments benefit of about $230 mil-
lion, and to generate additional direct employment for some 16,000 persons,
at an average investment cost of $12,400 per job. As a matter of policy,
KDFC's portfolio is highly concentrated in export-oriented projects. KDFC
has been instrumental in identifying investment opportunities in two rela-
tively new sectors, deep-sea fishing and marine transport, and in bringing
into being several projects in these sectors. It has endeavored to improve
the design of projects it finances and has provided to its clients lim-
ited but useful managerial and technical assistance. Its clientele is rea-
sonably well diversified. Finally, it has made a valuable contribution to
improving the Korean financial system through its initiative in promoting
and establishing in 1971 the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC),
a specialized financial institution designed to develop the organized short-
term money market and securities market. KIFC's success led to the estab-
lishmient since 1972 of nine similar institutions, with the consequent ex-
pansion of the money market and improved resource mobilization.
v.        KDFC has formulated a development strategy for the next two years,
1976-77t which includes, inter alia, (a) a proposal to establish a leasing
company whose object will be to lease industrial machinery to smaller firms
which cannot afford outright purchases, thus providing an important finan-
cial service to such enterprises; (b) a program to promote and establish
jointly with the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), the
Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC), with the objective of
advancing and exploiting commercially domestic industrial inventions and
discoveries; (c) a study of the machinery industry, to develop suitable
projects for investment; (d) studies on some agri-business activities,
with a view to expanding KDFC's financial assistance to them; and (e) a
scheme of linkage with selected regional commercial banks for assistance
to smaller projects in backward areas. To carry out the functions noted
above, and more generally its expanding promotional activities, IDFC has
decided to create a separate unit specifically to undertake project promotion
and identification.
vi.       KDFC's requirements of foreign exchange resources for the two and
a half year period ending December 31, 1977, are estimated to be about $103
million. KDFC has made an attempt, both directly and through IFC, to borrow
from the foreign capital markets with a view to reducing its dependence on
official sources of funds (i.e. the Bank and ADB). This attempt, however,
has been unsuccessful, owing to factors outside KDFC's control. On the



- iii -
one hand medium- and long-term money at a fixed rate was and remains un-
available. On the other hand, KDFC's own lending rates for foreign currency
loans are in effect limited to 10.5 or 11%. The latter rates are not unduly
low, considering that sub-borrowers bear the foreign exchange risk which,
through successive devaluations of the won over the past seven years or
more, has added a supplementary cost to the sub-borrowers of at least 8%
per annum (depending on the time span reviewed). In spite of the difficulty
KDFC experienced in its previous attempt, it intends to seek in 1976 a
foreign commercial loan, even at a floating rate, for $10-15 million, with
IFC acting as the syndicate manager, and with the prospective participation
of a number of foreign banks who are also KDFC's shareholders. In the mean-
time, KDFC is in pressing need for new foreign currency resources to enable
it to continue its lending activity without interruption. A Bank loan of
$55 million is proposed, which would cover about one-half of KDFC's projected
foreign resource requirements for the two and a half year period in question,
with the balance expected to be met by a second ADB loan and the above-mentioned
foreign commercial loan.
vii,      The proposed loan would support a major component of the Govern-
ment's development strategy, namely the continued rapid expansion of the
export-oriented industrial sector. It would contribute to relieving the
expected pressure on Korea's balance of payments in the next few years.
It would also continue to foster the mutually beneficial relationship between
KDFC and the Bank Group.
viii.     The terms of the loan should be similar to those of recent Bank
loans to DFCs. In view of the competence of KDFC's management and staff,
and the soundness of its financial position and portfolio, and so as not
to constrain its operations unnecessarily, it is justified to increase the
debt/equity ratio from the present limit of 4.5:1 to 6.0:1 under the exist-
ing definition where the part of the Government subordinated loan of W 2 bil-
lion falling due after the last IBRD loan maturity is treated as equity and
the other part as debt. However, the definition of "equity" and "debt" is
being modified so as to treat the totality of the outstanding Government loan
as debt and to exclude it from the equity base. A 6.0:1 ratio under the
existing definition is equivalent to about 7.0:1 under the revised definition.
The Loan Agreement, therefore, provides for a debt/equity ratio limit of 7.0:1.
The free limit is increased to $2.0 million. Part of the loan proceeds
are to be used to finance a percentage of 60 representing the estimated
foreign exchange component of domestically produced equipment and machinery,
and a percentage of 35 representing the estimated foreign exchange component
of local civil works.






KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) was established in
1967 with the assistance of the Bank Group and the Federation of Korean
Industries (FKI). The Bank has since made four loans to KDFC totalling $95
million, of which the latest ($50 million) was made in July 1973; these have
been fully committed. KDFC has also received its first loan from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) in October 1974, for $30 million, of which less than
$10 million remain available for new commitments as of March 31, 1975. IFC
owned 14.1% of KDFC's share capital at year-end 1974.
1.02     KDFC has requested a fifth Bank loan for $55 million.  Its perform-
ance since the previous appraisal in early 1973 has been good from both the
institutional and developmental standpoints. It has continued to improve
the already high standards of its internal operations, to maintain the quality
of its portfolio, and to exhibit an innovative approach to development bank-
ing. Its short-run developmental objectives are appropriate. KDFC's re-
quirements of foreign exchange resources over the two and a half year period
ending December 31, 1977, are estimated to be about $103 million. In the
international monetary conditions prevailing since early 1974, KDFC has
been unsuccessful so far in its attempts to borrow from the foreign capital
markets. However, it intends to seek in 1976 a foreign commercial loan of
$10-15 million, with IFC acting as the syndicate manager. This together
with the proposed Bank loan and a second ADB loan will cover KDFC's foreign
exchange requirements until December 31, 1977.
II. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
2.01      The recent performance of the Korean economy and industrial sector
is analyzed in Annex 1; and some salient features are summarized in the fol-
lowing paragraphs. The Bank's latest economic report: "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of the Republic of Korea", distributed under cover of
SecM 75-437 dated June 9, 1975, provides a more detailed review of the Korean
economy.
2.02      Recent Economic Performance.  In 1974 the Korean economy achieved
a real growth rate of 8.2% which, although well below the record growth rate
of 16.5% in 1973, was not far short of the Government's target of 9%. How-
ever, most of the growth was concentrated in the first half of the year,



while the economy began to slow down from mid-1974 under the impact of the
world-wide recession and the energy crisis. This slowdown is continuing in
1975. Although the value of commodity exports in 1974 increased by about
39% to $4.5 billion, the greater part of the increase was due to price rises.
Since domestic consumption was also sluggish, manufacturing inventories in
1974 increased by about 40% compared with a decline in 1973. The deterioration
in the terms of trade (18%) was sharper than expected and the current account
deficit is estimated to be $1.8 billion.
2.03      Recent Financial Developments.  In view of the balance of payments
situation and the general economic slowdown, the Government introduced in
December 1974 a number of economic measures which included the devaluation
of the won by 17.5% in dollar terms, the raising of oil prices and utility
rates, price controls on many essential commodities, and the acceleration
of Government expenditures to stimulate the economy. Interest rates on
bank time deposits (which previously ranged from 12 to 15%) were raised
uniformly to 15% to encourage savings. Other measures (paragraph 4, Annex 1)
were aimed at stimulating investment, encouraging export-oriented firms,
and promoting small- and medium-scale industries. For the whole of 1974,
wholesale prices rose by some 44% mainly as a result of higher import prices.
The matter of Korea's interest rate structure has been the subject of dis-
cussions with the Government authorities who, while agreeing that the
general interest rate should be kept under review, considered it would be
unwise to make any substantial revisions of it at this stage. They feel that
an increase in interest rates will further depress the industrial sector
which has been affected quite markedly by the impact of the oil shock and the
other recent international developments. They note that a number of other
countries in the region have recently lowered interest rates applied by
banking and financial institutions in order to help relieve the financial
difficulties facing the industrial sector. 1/ One of the principal elements
in the Government's efforts to cushion the impact of the current recession
has been the extension of easy credit terms on a selective basis to certain
industries and particularly to export-oriented and small- and medium-sized
enterprises. The Bank has indicated to the Korean authorities that it wishes
to keep the interest rate levels under review, and they have agreed to
further discussions from time to time.
2.04      Industrial Investment.  Fixed investment in the manufacturing
sector was estimated to amount to about W 400 billion in 1974 representing
a 18% increase in nominal terms over 1973. Investment in non-manufacturing
industries-(e.g. fisheries, mining, construction, electricity, hotels and
transportation) increased by 17% in nominal terms, to an estimated W 227
billion. Total industrial fixed investment (for both manufacturing and
non-manufacturing industries) is expected to increase by about 25% in 1975,
1/   Taiwan has reduced interest rates three times since later 1974.



to W 780 billion.  Of this amount, about 60% is expected to be financed
from domestic and foreign loans, with the balance coming from equity in-
vestments, bond issues, joint ventures and internally generated funds.
Manufacturing investment, which has recently slowed down, should pick up
as soon as economic recovery gets under way in the US and Japan. Industrial
investment is projected by the Government to grow at 35% per year at current
prices in 1976 and 1977, or 15% in real terms, on the basis of a 9% annual
GNP growth and a 17% growth in the manufacturing sector.
2.05      IFC Operations.  Excluding one project that was subsequently can-
celled, IFC had, by April 30, 1975, entered into eight commitments: five
in the financial/development banking sector and one each in the fields of
textiles, electrical and electronic products, and synthetic fibers, totalling
(net of participations and cancellations) $30.6 million. An investment in a
tourism project has been subsequently approved. Currently IFC has under
advanced consideration a zinc smelting and a leasing project; under pre-
liminary consideration are projects in the fields of steel products, cement
distribution, electronic motors, bearings and tire manufacturing.
III. KDFC - INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
3.01      Share Capital and Ownership. KDFC is a privately owned, reason-
ably broad based company 1/. Its initial paid-in share capital of W 1,350
million has increased since 1969 through a 10% annual stock dividend (ex-
cept in 1973), and a rights issue for cash of W 1,200 million in October
1973, to W 3,000 million as of December 31, 1974. Details of KDFC's
shareholders are given in Annex 2. On December 31, 1974, there were 341
shareholders, of whom 311 private Korean companies and individuals owning
36.4% of the share capital, 20 Korean commercial banks and insurance com-
panies, 24.7%, and 9 foreign banks, 24.8%. IFC owns the remaining 14.1%
of KDFC's share capital. There has been no significant change in the com-
position of shareholders since 1973. All foreign shareholders and IFC
exercised their preemptive rights in the October 1973 share issue.
3.02      Board of Directors.  KDFC's Board comprises 13 members of whom
5 represent foreign private shareholders and IFC. The 8 Korean directors
are leading members of the business and banking community. As before, the
Board continues to be ably led by Mr. C. S. Hong, a prominent industrial-
ist. While the Board lays down policy guidelines and has the ultimate
authority for all investment decisions, it has delegated authority to an
Executive Committee of 4 Board members (including the Chairman, the
President, and two representatives of the Korean and the foreign share-
holders respectively) to approve individual loans and investments up to
$1.5 million. Annex 3 gives the composition of the Board and the Execu-
tive Committee.
1/ Apart from IFC, no single shareholder owns more than 4% of KDFC's share
capital.



-4-
3.03      Organization, Management and Staff.  KDFC remains one of the
best organized and managed DFCs with which the Bank Group is associated.
Mr. C.H. Kim, formerly Governor of the Bank of Korea, continues, as KDFC's
President, to give the company his strong and wise leadership. KDFC's
previous Senior Vice-President, Mr. B.J. Lee, left in 1973 to become
President of the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC), a corpora-
tion promoted and established by KDFC to operate in the money and capital
markets. He was replaced by the other Vice-President, Mr. C.K. Lee, an
experienced commercial banker. The senior management team is completed
by Mr. T.Y. Hahm, formerly manager of the Appraisal Department, who was
appointed Vice-President in February 1974. The management is supported by
four competent department managers. The high quality of KDFC's staff is
evident through all levels of the organization. Up to 1972, turnover of
staff had been minimal. However, and despite KDFC's competitive employ-
ment conditions vis-a-vis other financial and banking institutions, staff
turnover increased considerably in 1973 and 1974, when 19 professional
staff members left KDFC. This high turnover was mainly the result of the
demand in the Korean business community (including some of KDFC's client
companies) for KDFC-trained staff. As a result of this attrition and of
KDFC's policy of limiting new recruits to a number within its capacity to
absorb efficiently and train adequately, KDFC's professional staff increased
only marginally from 42 to 44 in the last two years, including 21 new re-
cruits. KDFC's management believes that turnover of staff will decline in
1975, partly as a result of salary adjustments. Following discussions with
the appraisal mission, KDFC plans to strengthen its professional staff by
9 in 1975 (from 44 to 53) and thereafter by about 6 annually over the next
several years. Annex 4 gives details of KDFC's program for recruiting
additional staff for the 1975-79 period. Its present staff, strengthened
by prospective recruits, will be sufficient both to maintain the high stan-
dards of its operations and to undertake the projected expanded volume of
business mentioned in para 3.15. It is a measure of the strength of KDFC's
management and staff that, in spite of the recent heavy turnover of staff,
there has been no discernible decline in KDFC's operational standards.
Following a recent review of its organizational structure (see Chart 9692),
which has remained basically unchanged since KDFC's inception, KDFC's manage-
ment has decided to create shortly a separate unit specifically to undertake
project identification and promotion work. The latter functions, which to
date had been carried out by KDFC's staff on an ad hoc basis, are expected to
loom large in KDFC's future work program (paragraph 4.18 (g)).  KDFC's manage--
ment is also considering the desirability of establishing one or more regional
offices, at an appropriate time, to facilitate business contacts with existing
and prospective clients outside the greater Seoul area (paragraph 4.18 (e)).
3.04      Operating Policies.  KDFC's Statement of Operating Policies
(Annex 5) continues to provide appropriate guidelines for its operations.
With the Bank's consent, KDFC is in the process of amending the Statement
to increase from 15% to 20% of the sum of paid-in capital, free reserves
and Government subordinated loan, KDFC's normal exposure limit in any
single enterprise, which would raise that limit to about $3.3 million



- 5 -
equivalent. The increased exposure limit is appropriate considering
KDFC's proven ability to make sound investment decisions and the growing
size of industrial projects in Korea. With a view to assisting projects
requiring financing in excess of the above-mentioned amount, KDFC intends
to intensify its efforts at arranging joint financing with other foreign
and domestic institutions, including the Korea Development Bank (KDB).
To supplement the operational guidelines contained in its policy state-
ment and outline its Immediate developmental objectives, KDFC has recently
drafted a statement on its Developmental Strategy, which is discussed in
paragraph 4.18.
3.05      Project Appraisal.  The standards of KDFC's appraisal work
continue to be very high. Several overseas DPCs, to whom KDFC has made
available a number of its appraisal reports, have benefited from KDFC's
appraisal techniques. KDFC's evaluation of the technical, marketing and
financial aspects of projects has always been thorough. In recent years
the Bank and KDFC have engaged in a continuing dialogue aimed primarily
at improving the economic coverage in KDFC's appraisal work, which is now
also satisfactory.  It routinely includes the calculation of the economic
rate of return in its appraisal work.  It has also corrected an earlier
shortcoming in its appraisal work by applying an incremental approach for
appraising expansion projects, whenever feasible.  As in the past, both
XDFC's Appraisal Department and its clients continue to draw substantially
on the expertise of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)
in dealing with technical aspects of projects. KDFC, along with some other
DFCs, is cooperating with the Bank in a pilot scheme to develop a data bank
with the objective of monitoring the performance and benefits of DFC-financed
projects. KDFC's impact as a resource allocator especially its role in
Influencing the design of projects, is analyzed under 'Developmental Role".
3.06      Project Supervision.  KDPC's follow-up work has been considerably
strengthened over the years and is now fully satisfactory. It has suffered
somewhat in the past from the fact that the Operations Department (responsi-
ble for follow-up work) had no engineer of its own and therefore has had to
make do, for its technical supervision of projects, with the limited assis-
tance provided by the engineering staff of the Appraisal Department. Previous
Bank missions commented on these deficiencies, which have largely been reme-
died. The Operations Department was allotted two engineers 1/ in 1974, and
expects to receive several (including one additional engineer) of the 9 pro-
fessionals whom KDFC envisages recruiting in 1975 (paragraph 3.03). Staff
constraints notwithstanding, the Department has recently achieved considera-
ble progress in strengthening its supervision work, which contributed to a
substantial improvement in KDFC's arrears situation and in the satisfactory
resolution of several problem projects in 1974 (paragraph 3.13). Among other
1/   One of whom left the company in late 1974 and has not yet been replaced.



-6-
recent endeavors, the Department has tightened up clients' reporting re-
quirements and has devised a system for monitoring the actual financial and
economic benefits of projects.
3.07      Procurement and Disbursement.  KDFC's procurement and disbursement
practices are appropriate. It usually requires that procurement under its
foreign currency loans be based on three or more competitive quotations
obtained from foreign suppliers, and that the final import contract be sub-
ject to its approval. The price and suitability of the equipment proposed
to be purchased is carefully checked by its staff, based on KDFC's experience
with similar projects.
3.08      Lending Operations.  A summary of KDFC's overall financing activi-
ties up to December 31, 1974, is given in Annex 6, Table 1. Total financial
assistance approved by KDFC for the industrial, mining, agro-industrial,
fishing and transport sectors amounted to W 52.96 billion 1/, with direct
lending accounting for 93.7% of the total, the remainder (6.3%) being accounted
for by equity investments and convertible debentures. Cumulative loan ap-
provals as of December 31, 1974, totalled W 49.6 billion for 163 projects
undertaken by 111 companies. Foreign currency loans (145) amounting to
$109.6 million accounted for 88.1% of KDFC's total lending and for 82.5% of
its total financing. While KDFC's approvals of won loans increased marginal-
ly to W 1.8 billion in 1974, compared with W 1.7 billion in 1973, approvals
of foreign currency loans declined by 16% to $26.8 million ($31.9 million in
1973). This decline was attributable partly to the reduced level of in-
dustrial investment in the second half of 1974 but primarily to the fact that
KDFC experienced an unexpected delay in securing its first ADB loan (which
eventually became effective in October 1974).
3.09      Equity Investments and Convertible Debentures. Cumulative approvals
for these operations (Annex 6, Table 3) amounted to W 3.3 billion for 31
companies. KDFC's equity investment activity expanded considerably during
1974, when it approved W 1,056 million for 12 companies. KDFC's contribution
to the development of the Korean capital market is intended to be achieved
mainly through KIFC (paragraph 4.16, and Annex 14).
3.10      Financial Position. KDFC's financial position remains sound; it
is analyzed in detail in Annex 7, Table 1 of which shows audited balance
sheets for FY 1971-74. Total assets grew by 64% during 1974, reflecting
both the high level of disbursements during the year (W 18.8 billion com-
pared with W 6.4 billion in 1973), and the revaluation of KDFC's foreign
currency assets and liabilities deriving from the change in the exchange
rate from W 400 to W 485 to the US dollar. As of December 31, 1974, KDFC's
net working capital exceeded its undisbursed won commitments by more than
100%, and the current ratio was 1.9:1, indicating a strong liquidity posi-
tion. The debt service coverage, at 1.4 times in 1973 and 1.3 times in
1/   The currency equivalents applied were those prevailing at the time of
KDFC's approval.



- 7 -
1974, was satisfactory. As of December 31, 1974, KDFC's long term debt
outstanding (including the Government subordinated loan of W 2 billion)
was W 37.2 billion, of which W 34 billion ($70 million) represented out-
standing borrowings from IBRD. The latter accounted for 76.4% of KDFC's
total assets. Owing in part to the recent won devaluation and in part to
the growth of its foreign currency loan portfolio, KDFC's long-term debt/
equity ratio, as defined by the Bank, increased sharply from 2.8:1 as of
year-end 1973 to 4.8:1 at December 31, 1974. KDFC has, consequently, asked
for an increase in the contractual limit of 4.5:1 set under the latest Bank
loan agreement. In view of the strength of KDFC's management and staff,
the soundness of its portfolio, its good financial and operational per-
formance, and so as not to constrain its operations, an increase from the
present limit of 4.5:1 to 6.0:1 is justified, under the existing definition
where part of the Government subordinated loan of W 2 billion falling due
after the last IBRD loan maturity is treated as equity and the other part as
debt. However, the definition of "equity" and "debt" is being modified so
as to treat the totality of the outstanding Government loan as debt and
exclude it from the equity base. A 6.0:1 ratio under the existing definition
is equivalent to about 7.0:1 under the proposed definition. The Loan Agree-
ment, therefore, provides for a debt/equity ratio limit of 7.0:1.
3.11      Earnings Performance.  As with its overall financial position,
KDFC's financial performance in 1973 and 1974 was satisfactory. Audited
income statements from 1971 through 1974 are provided in Annex 7, Table 2.
Net income after taxes increased by 23.4% in 1974 to W 911.7 million,
compared to W 738.7 million in the previous year. The 1974 earnings rep-
resented a return of 15.8% on average net worth, about the same as in 1973
(15.7%). Although total administrative expenses (W 298.4 million in 1972)
increased by 39% in 1973 to W 415.3 million and by 35% in 1974 to W 562.1
million, they have declined as a percentage of average total assets to
1.7% in both 1973 and 1974, versus 1.9% in 1972.
3.12      Share Prices and Dividends.  KDFC's net worth as of December 31,
1974, was W 6.1 billion, up 10.7% from year-end 1973. As of the same date,
the book value of its shares was W 10,129 or 203% of par value (W 5,000).
The market value of KDFC's shares, which are lightly traded, has fluctuated
between W 7,310 and W 10,900 in 1974. KDFC has paid a dividend of 20% (10%
in cash, 10% in stock) since 1969 through 1974, except in 1973 when it dis-
tributed a 15% cash dividend. The cash dividend pay-out ratio since 1969
has averaged about 27%, a moderate percentage.
3.13      Quality of Portfolio.  Existing loans in arrears are minimal in
relation to KDFC's total loan portfolio. Annex 7, Table 4 gives the com-
parative situation of loans in arrears from 1972 to 1974.  Following the
rescheduling of 6 loans, only two of the 91 loans on which repayments have
become due (i.e. excluding the 87 loans still in the grace period) were in



-8-
arrears for over three months as of December 31, 1974. Principal and
interest in arrears on these two loans was W 86.1 million, or about 0.2%
of total loan portfolio outstanding. The principal sum affected by arrears
was W 125.4 million, or 0.3% of total loan portfolio. The exceptional
soundness of KDFC's portfolio is attributable more to the quality of its
appraisal and follow-up work, and to the strength of the Korean economy
in recent years, than to any deliberate policy to restrict its financing
to "blue chip" projects undertaken by well-established companies. Of the
six companies in arrears at the end of 1972, some had experienced only
temporary financial difficulties and subsequently regularized their accounts
with KDFC. In one instance (Hankook Titanium Industry Company), KDFC pro-
vided extensive managerial assistance to reorganize the company, which
helped restore its financial strength. In another instance (Shinkwang
Enterprise Company, a fluorescent lamp manufacturer), KDFC helped initiate
a merger of the borrower with a larger manufacturer, and subsequently re-
covered its loan in full. The two examples cited above illustrate KDFC's
diligence in supervising its portfolio and its ability to implement suita-
ble remedial actions for problem projects. So far only one loan has been
written off, for an amount of W 89 million. Following this write-off,
provisions for doubtful accounts stood at W 628 million as of December 31,
1974, which far exceeds likely portfolio losses. Following the December
1974 devaluation of the won, KDFC has carried out a detailed examination
of its portfolio which suggested that most of its existing borrowers were
likely to withstand the impact of the devaluation.
3.14      Audit. KDFC's accounts have been audited from its inception
by Arthur Young and Company whose reports have always been unqualified.
3.15      Business and Financial-Prospects.  Projected operations and fi-
nancial forecasts are analyzed in Annex 8 and summarized in the Tables at-
tached to that Annex. KDFC estimates that, over the two and a half year
period up to December 31, 1977, it will commit financial assistance (loans
and investments) to industry totalling $119 million equivalent, of which
86% or $103 million will be for foreign currency loans. The proposed Bank
loan would thus cover about 53% of KDFC's foreign exchange requirements for
the period and 46% of its overall resource needs. Approvals are projected
at $40.8 million equivalent for 1975 or 23% above the 1974 level, and to
increase thereafter at a rate of about 12% per annum. On the basis of
projected commitments, KDFC's financing, as a percentage of total fixed
industrial investmentl/ in Korea in the 1975-79 period, would decline gradually
to about 2.4% in 19797from a level of about 2.9% in the period 1971-74
(Annex 10). KDFC's forecast was based mainly on its assessment of resources,
especially of foreign exchange, likely to be available to it. It should be
able to exceed its forecast if it succeeds in raising additional foreign
1/   Industrial investment in 1976 and 1977 is projected to increase by
35% annually (see paragraph 2.04).



exchange funds. KDFC's profitability is expected to remain satisfactory
during the projected period, with net earnings going up from W 912 million
in 1974 to W 2,118 million in 1979, at a compounded growth rate of 18.4% a
year. The return on average equity is expected to range from 15% to 18%.
Total assets are expected to grow from W 44.2 billion in 1974 to W 116.3
billion in 1979, a compounded growth of 21.5%; the net worth is estimated to
increase from W 6.1 billion to W 14.8 billion at a compounded rate of 19.4%.
KDFC envisages continuing its present policy of paying a 20% dividend (10%
cash; 10% stock). The long-term debt/equity ratio (revised IBRD formula)
will increase gradually from 6.1 to 6.7:1. The debt service coverage will
remain satisfactory at about or above 1.2 and the current ratio above 2:1.
KDFC's overall financial position, as projected, will remain sound.
3.16      Won Resource Position and Requirements. KDFC's resource position
as of December 31, 1974, is summarized in Annex 9.  Its local currency com-
mitments for the two-year period from July 1, 1975 to June 30, 1977 are esti-
mated to be W 6.1 billion. As of December 31, 1974, KDFC had uncommitted
won resources of W 1,239 million. These resources together with prospective
won collections (W 2,243 million), sales of equity investments (W 160 million),
retained earnings (W 1,667 million) and a share capital increase (W 1,370
million), planned for 1976, should enable KDFC to undertake the commitments
it has projected and at the same time maintain a satisfactory liquidity.
KDFC intends to start mobilizing domestic private resources by issuance of
bonds, beginning in 1977, for an amount of W 1,500 million during 1977-79.
A discussion of the broader issue of KDFC's domestic resource mobilization
is provided in paragraphs 4.15 and 4.16.
3.17      Foreign Exchange Resource Position and Requirements.  As indicated
in Annex 9, KDFC had $17.7 million in foreign currency resources available
for commitment as of December 31; 1974. This amount represented the balance
of the first ADB loan of $30 million made to KDFC in October 1974. (The
latest Bank loan, No. 905-KO, was fully committed around end 1974). KDFC
expects fully to commit the balance of its ADB loan around June 1975. For
the period of two and a half years ending December 31, 1977, it expects to
commit foreign currency loans totalling $103 million (or 86% of its total
financing). The proposed Bank loan of $55 million would thus finance about
one-half of KDFC's estimated foreign exchange requirements for the period
in question, with the balance expected to be provided by ADB and a possible
foreign commercial loan through a syndicated arrangement with IFC (para 4.14).
IV. KDFC'S DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE
4.01      Apart from its efficient operational and financial performance,
noted in the preceding paragraphs, KDFC has generally exhibited an inno-
vative approach to development banking, and shown a commendable record
of developmental achievements. These, as well as KDFC's proposed short-run
development strategy, are analyzed in the following paragraphs.



- 10 -
A.  KDFC's Developmental Impact
4.02      Scale of Operations. Although its disbursements increased rapidly
in 1974 (to W 18.9 billion, from W 6.4 billion in 1973) KDFC remains a rela-
tively small source of term-finance for industry, especially in relation to
the Government-owned KDB. From the start of operations in March 1968, KDFC
had approved, at year-end 1974, loans aggregating W 49.6 billion and in-
vested a further W 3.3 billion in common shares and convertible debentures
of industrial companies (Annex 6, Table 1), for a total of W 52.9 billion.
Within the manufacturing sector, KDFC's disbursements in the 1971-74 period
(Annex 10) accounted for about 2.9% of total fixed investment. In non-
manufacturing sectors such as marine transport and deep-sea fishing, KDFC's
financing is estimated to represent a substantially higher proportion of
total fixed investment, although an accurate calculation is impossible
owing to the lack of investment data for these sectors. KDFC has financed
an average of about 47% of total project costs, and KDFC-supported projects
have accounted for about 6% of total fixed manufacturing investment. By
comparison, KDB directly financed about 16% of total fixed manufacturing
investment in 1973. Being a privately-owned institution with limited fi-
nancial resources, KDFC is unlikely ever to increase significantly its
share of the country's total investment (para 3.15). Its qualitative con-
tribution in terms of improving resource allocation, however, is important
in view of the high quality of its appraisal and follow-up work, its sus-
tained efforts to raise its operational standards and its willingness to
try innovations and to venture into new fields. These aspects of KDFC's
operations, and the performance and characteristics of projects it has
financed, are discussed below.
4.03      Economic Impact of KDFC-Financed Projects. Table 1 in Annex 11
gives partial economic indicators on the 180 projects for which KDFC
had approved loans up to December 31, 1974. KDFC's loan approvals of
W 49.6 billion were part of a total fixed investment sum of about W 96.7
billion. The additional direct employment generated by these projects is
about 16,000, at an investment cost of about W 6 million (US$12,400) per
job, which suggests that KDFC's projects on the whole are not unduly capital
intensive 1/. The incremental annual sales attributable to these projects
are estimated to amount to W 319 billion ($658 million) with a value added
component of W 89.3 billion ($184 million). Of this volume of output, an
estimated amount of US$358 million is exported annually. Taking into
account average annual import requirements of about US$129 million, the
net positive balance of payments effect of these projects is estimated
to average US$229 million annually.
4.04      An ex ante calculation of the economic rates of return (ERR), for
a sample of 22 projects appraised by KDFC since June 1973 (Annex 11, Table
2) showed a weighted average ERR of 31.0% and a weighted financial rate of
1/  The national average in 1972 for all industries including small- and
medium-scale industries was $5,500 equivalent. The average investment
cost for KDB's projects completed between 1970 and 1973 was $17,000.



- 11 -
return of 24.2%. A joint study undertaken earlier in 1972 by KDFC and a
Bank mission, based on ex post data on a representative sample of 10 KDFC
projects already in commercial operation, also showed ERRs in excess of
30% for a large majority of these projects. These returns indicate that
Bank funds, through KDFC, have generally been allocated to economically
efficient projects.
4.05      Diversification of Clientele.  KDFC has been reasonably successful
in diversifying its clientele. Available data (Annex 6, Table 4) on repeat
loans indicate that 47 (or 43%) of KDFC's 111 borrowers have received more
than one loan, and the total amount approved in repeat loans was W 16.1 bil-
lion or 32.4% of total loan approvals. There has been some previous cri-
ticism, not entirely justified, about KDFC's lending to companies which were
members of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the prestigious busi-
ness association that had originally promoted KDFC. The evidence shows
that, up to December 31, 1974, 32 of KDFC's 102 outstanding borrowers were
FKI members and they accounted for 35.9% of total loans outstanding, a per-
centage roughly equivalent to FKI members' share in total private industrial
investment. There is no evidence that KDFC at any time gave any preference
to borrowers who were FKI members nor even that it was aware of which appli-
cants were members of this association. As of December 31, 1974, the largest
10 (or 9%) of KDFC's clients accounted for 23.9% of cumulative approvals.
These data are not indicative of undue portfolio concentration nor of favor-
itism toward the FKI group. In expanding its loan portfolio KDFC has attempt-
ed to strike an appropriate balance between the need for establishing a strong
financial reputation on the one hand and for retaining its development ori-
entation on the other. While KDFC, as a lending financial institution, has
understandably placed due weight on the financial efficiency of projects,
the record indicates that it has also provided finance for several less well
established borrowers and has supported a number of risky ventures in
industries particularly emphasized by Government policies. Its financing
policy has not been guided solely by considerations of profitability.
4.06      Sectoral Diversification.  The characteristics of KDFC's loans are
summarized in Annex 6, Table 2. The sectoral pattern of KDFC's financing
has shifted substantially over time. Its earlier concentration on textiles,
which accounted for as much as 30% of total lending up to 1970, has been
sharply reduced and this sector now accounts for only 18.7% of cumulative
approvals. In 1971, KDFC identified two promising relatively new activi-
ties for investments, both important foreign exchange earners: deep-sea
fishing and marine transport. It carried out useful sector studies, and
was instrumental in bringing into existence several projects in these two
sectors. The existing inter-industry portfolio dispersion is satisfactory,
with marine transport accounting for 19.1% of cumulative approvals, deep-
sea fisheries, 14.8%, textiles, 18.7%, machinery, electronics and metal
products, 9.8%, foods and beverage, 9.4%, chemicals and plastic products,
8.1% and non-metallic mineral products 7.9%. Of the six priority areas
in current Government plans - steel, shipbuilding, petro-chemicals,
non-ferrous metal, electronics and machinery - the first three are practically
outside KDFC's scope of operations because they involve investments too large
for its financing. The scope for financing electronics by KDFC (and other



- 12 -
local institutions) has also been limited, because a large majority of
electronic projects were implemented as joint ventures with foreign investors
who generally brought in the necessary equipment from abroad as a contribution
in kind. The foregoing explains the relatively small share (11 projects for
W 1,483 million accounting for 3% of total approvals) of electronics financ-
ing in KDFC's portfolio. KDFC's financing of the machinery industry has
also been modest (3 projects for W 665 million accounting for 1.3% of total
approvals), owing partly to the difficulties encountered by that sector in
the past and consequently the lack of attractive projects for financing.
KDFC, however, realizes the potential importance of the labor intensive
machinery industry, and has plans for stepping up its assistance to it (para
4.18 (c)) as a part of its future development strategy.
4.07      Regional Dispersal of Investment. KDFC's increasing involvement
since 1971 in the non-manufacturing sectors, especially deep-sea fishing
and marine transport (para 4.06), has brought about a discernible shift
away from Seoul in its overall financing. With deep-sea fishing and marine
transport enterprises being categorized geographically by their area of
activity (the ocean) instead of Seoul or Pusan where most of them have their
head office (Annex 6, Table 2), the Seoul area accounts for only a moderate
proportion (27.7%) of KDFC's overall financing up to December 31, 1974, fol-
lowed by Kyung-Gi (the province surrounding Seoul), 17.3%, Sang-Buk, 9.3%
and Pusan 5.7%. Within the manufacturing sector, 42% of KDFC's financing
has gone to projects in Seoul, about the same percentage as Seoul's share
in total manufacturing activity in the country. KDFC's plans for expanding
its assistance to backward areas (and small industries), through a leasing
project and a linkage with regional commercial banks, are discussed in
para 4.18 (a) and 4.18 (e).
4.08      Contribution to Exports. As a matter of policy, KDFC's portfolio
is highly concentrated in export-oriented projects. As noted in para 4.03,
the 180 projects approved to date by KDFC are expected to export annually
about $358 million equivalent or almost 40% of their output. Of these 180
projects, 79 are expected to export between 50% and 100% of their annual
production, and 19 other projects, up to 50%.
4.09      Size of Operations. KDFC was intended to operate in the medium-
and large-scale sectors of industry. The average size of its operations
since its inception is therefore relatively large, amounting to about
W 100 million (US$210,000 equivalent) for domestic currency and about
$0.75 million for foreign currency loans. It would not serve any useful
purpose for KDFC to shift the main emphasis of its operations to smaller
industries, since the latter are being suitably assisted by other institu-
tions such as the Medium Industry Bank (MIB) and the Citizens National Bank
(CNB). Nevertheless, KDFC believes it can ir the future play a limited but
useful role in assisting small projects in backward areas, through a planned
leasing project (para 4.18 (a)) and a scheme of cooperation with local com-
mercial banks (para 4.18 (e)).



- 13 -
4.10      Influence on Project Design.  KDFC's impact as a resource alloca-
tor is supplemented by its sustained efforts to improve the design of proj-
ects it finances. Annex 12 summarizes several cases in which KDFC has
played a substantial role in influencing the scope and character of proj-
ects. KDFC's suggestions have resulted variously in changes in the scale
of operations, choice of equipment, choice of techniques, and organizational
and management changes. In a few instances, KDFC's suggestions brought
about a shift from imported equipment to domestically produced equipment,
or from imported to domestic raw materials, and resulted in lower invest-
ment costs and greater labor intensiveness. KDFC's efforts to modify the
financial structure of its borrowers are noted in para 4.17. In addition,
as a contribution to project identification, KDFC has undertaken a number
of market studies 1/. Two of these studies led to the establishment of new
investment projects; two other studies led to negative conclusions which
prevented the establishment of projects which, had they been implemented,
would have been unviable. Annex 13 provides the list of new technologies
introduced into Korea by KDFC-financed projects, and data indicating the
substantial amount of technical training of Korean manpower in connection
with these projects.
4.11      Technical Assistance and Training.  KDFC has provided a limited
but useful amount of management and technical assistance to its clients.
It has also become increasingly active in training the staff from DFCs
in other countries (recent trainees being from Indonesia, Philippines
and Viet Nam).
4.12      Promotional Activities.  KDFC's record in this area is in some
ways remarkable. In its early years, KDFC followed a largely passive
financing strategy, in view of tie need to develop staff capability and
build up rapidly a sound portfolio, and because of the abundance of entre-
preneurship in the country and the large number of well-conceived projects
seeking KDFC's financing. KDFC, however, gradually moved into more active
promotional work. As noted earlier, it was instrumental in bringing into
being many projects in the deep-sea fishing and marine transport sectors,
by identifying investment opportunities and carrying out sector studies,
by seeking out entrepreneurs and by assisting them through the project
designing and structuring stages. KDFC's role in establishing KIFC is
described in para 4.16 and in Annex 14. Other projects KDFC is actively
promoting include a hotel (jointly with IFC and some United States in-
vestors), a zinc refinery, a liquid oxygen plant, a leasing operation
(para 4.18 (a)), and the Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC)
project (para 4.18 (b)). In anticipation of its increased involvement in
project promotion and identification, KDFC envisages setting up a separate
unit specifically to undertake this activity (para 3.03).

filament brushes and tooth brushes manufacturing.



- 14 -
4.13      Direct Foreign Resource Mobilization.  Until 1974, KDFC has relied
almost exclusively on the Bank for financing its foreign currency commitments,
and had received four Bank loans totalling $95 million. Additional foreign
resources consisted only of a "tied" $1 million loan from Caterpillar (Far
East) Ltd., and an original loan from USAID of $5 million which was subse-
quently reduced to $3 million. This heavy reliance on Bank funds was attri-
butable mainly to the fact that the Government, in its "aid management"
policy, did not permit KDFC to approach another lending institution, such
as ADB, until 1973. In October 1974, KDFC received its first loan from ADB
for $30 million, thus lessening its reliance on the Bank. However, KDFC
remains heavily dependent on two official sources, the Bank and ADB. KDFC
realizes the importance of further diversifying its resources by mobilizing
foreign commercial funds. Its recent efforts in that direction, however,
have been unsuccessful, owing primarily to factors outside its control.
In late 1973, KDFC resumed its soundings of foreign banks (which were also
its shareholders), but found that medium- and long-term funds at an accept-
table interest rate were simply unavailable. At the same time, KDFC ap-
proached IFC with a request to act as the manager of a syndicate to put
together a loan with the participation of a number of foreign banks. IFC,
however, also found it impossible to raise money on appropriate terms.
4.14      However, KDFC intends in spite of the difficulties mentioned above,
to seek in 1976 a foreign commercial loan, even at a floating ratel/, for
an amount of $10-15 million and with a maturity of up to 7-8 years, with
IFC acting as the syndicate manager and the prospective participation of a
number of foreign banks who are also KDFC's shareholders. If this loan were
forthcoming, KDFC would envisage relending it at a floating rate to selected
projects which do not require terms longer than 7-8 years and which can
financially afford the risk involved in a floating rate. Such a loan would
reduce KDFC's dependence on its official sources of foreign exchange, i.e.
the Bank and ADB. But, in any event, foreign commercial borrowings by KDFC
will remain small, because of (a) the limited amount of foreign commercial
funds likely to be available to Korea as a whole (para 4.13) and (b) KDFC's
limited capacity to on-lend funds at a floating rate without seriously
jeopardizing its competitive position. Consequently, KDFC will have to
continue in the foreseeable future to rely primarily on official sources of
foreign exchange to sustain the volume of operations it has projected.
4.15      Direct Won Resource Mobilization.  As noted in para 3.08, the
demand for KDFC's domestic currency financing has been limited. KDFC has
been able, with successive stock dividends and the 1973 share issue, to
increase its total won resources from W3,375 million at inception to W8,102
1/   The prospective cost is 2 points or more above the London Inter-Bank
rate (presently around 7.5%), plus syndication and other fees, and
the 15% Korean withholding tax. This tax is waived if IFC is the
direct lender.



- 15
million as of December 31, 1974 (inclusive of the Government loan of W2
billion), and its liquid won resources have always been in excess of W1.2
billion. For this reason, KDFC has had no need to raise additional won
resources through borrowings. In view of its present won resource position
and a new share capital increase of W1,370 million planned for next year,
KDFC is in no immediate need of additional won funds. Notwithstarding its
comfortable present and short-run won resource position, KDFC plans to borrow
on the domestic market through issuance of bonds, even if by so doing it
could relend these funds initially, only at a small loss. KDFC's purpose
would be to establish itself in the market for possible future larger
won borrowings.
4.16      Indirect Resource Mobilization.  In 1970, KDFC conducted an im-
portant study of the Korean financial system which identified, among other
deficiencies therein, a lack of institutional short-term (i.e. less than
90 days) credit, and the inadequacy in the marketing of corporate equity
instruments. The study served as the basis for the establishment, in 1971,
of Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC), an institution designed
to help remedy these deficiencies by developing an institutional short-term
money market and fostering the securities market (Annex 14). KDFC played a
vital role in the promotion and establishment of KIFC, with assistance from
IFC which also made an equity investment in KIFC. KDFC subscribed 22% of
KIFC's capital and also made available to KIFC two members of its senior
staff. Starting commercial operation in May 1972, KIFC has become an im-
portant source of working capital funds for industry and is increasingly
active in capital market operations through its underwriting of equity and
debenture issues. KDFC's success led to the establishment of nine similar
institutions, both in Seoul and in other business centers, with a consequent
expansion of the money market and improved mobilization of resources. KDFC's
contribution is expected to be further enhanced by the implementation of its
leasing project (para 4.18 (a)).
4.17      Another aspect of indirect resource mobilization by KDFC has been
the pressure it has applied to its borrowers to increase their equity base.
Of KDFC's 163 existing borrowing companies, 47 have increased their share
capital, many of them by substantial amounts, as a direct result of KDFC's
persuasion. Although that persuasion was motivated primarily by the wish
to improve the client's debt servicing capacity, it was nevertheless a use-
ful contribution to resource mobilization. On the foreign currency side,
KDFC has played an important role in arranging joint financing for 10 projects
(Annex 6, Table 5) to which foreign banks and investors (including IFC) have
contributed an aggregate amount of $22.6 million.
B. KDFC's Future Developmental Role
4.18      Development Strategy.  Following discussions with the appraisal
mission, KDFC has formulated (Annex 15) a development program for the next
two years, 1976-77, which outlines specific activities and areas, on which
KDFC intends to place unusual emphasis. The main elements of the program,
which were reviewed and agreed with KDFC, are noted below:



- 16 -
(a)  Leasing Project.  KDFC has been working actively
since 1973 on, and intends to implement in late 1975,
a proposal to establish a leasing company whose
objective would be to lease industrial machinery
and equipment, primarily to smaller firms which
cannot afford outright purchases. IFC and an ex-
perienced Japanese firm are expected to participate
in this venture with KDFC. This project aims at
providing an important financial service to small
and medium-scale industries. It would therefore
represent another contribution on the part of KDFC
toward improving the Korean financial system, as
well as its first significant step toward assisting
small and medium industries.
(b)  K-TAC.  KDFC plans to promote and establish jointly
with the Korean Institute of Science and Technology
(KIST), the Korea Technology Advancement Corporation
(K-TAC) with the objective of promoting and exploiting
commercially domestic industrial inventions and dis-
coveries. KDFC expects to provide financial (equity
and loan) and technical assistance to K-TAC and projects
sponsored by K-TAC. Some projects have already been
tentatively identified (e.g. development of artificial
fiber for wigs, integrated circuits and transistors,
and freon).
(c)  Machinery Industry.  KDFC's planned involvement
would start with a study of the machine tools
industry, with a view to developing suitable
projects for investment. This industrial activity
ranks high in the Government's priorities, in view
of its labor intensiveness and the opportunity it
offers for deepening Korea's industrial structure.
(d)  Agro-industry.  KDFC plans to undertake feasibility
studies on selected agro-industries, for instance
viticulture and peanuts. This is expected to lead
to an expansion of its financing, so far negligible,
in the agro-business sector.
(e)  Assistance to Small Industries and Backward Areas.
KDFC's scheme of linkage and cooperation with selected
regional commercial banks would enabie it to finance
jointly with these banks some small projects in less
developed areas (with KDFC expected to provide for-
eign exchange, and the banks won funds) and to help
these banks build up their capability for project ap-
praisal and follow-up. This would permit KDFC to make



- 17 -
a useful (mainly qualitative) contribution to small
industries as an apex institution, through existing
local institutions, without altering KDFC's basic
character as a DFC or overtaxing its staff capacity.
(f) Foreign Resource Diversification. KDFC will endeavor
to lessen its dependence on official sources by
attempting to borrow from private foreign markets
as soon as opportunities arise. The extent to which
KDFC will be able to achieve this objective will,
however, depend on extraneous factors such as the
situation of the foreign capital markets.
(g) Project Promotion and Identification Unit. A separate
unit, staffed with specialists, would concentrate speci-
fically on project identification and other promotional
activities, including those noted above. Some promo-
tional activities will derive automatically from the
proposed activities noted above, particularly the K-TAC
proposal and KDFCts intended involvement in the machinery
industry and the agro-business sector. The desirability
of establishing one or more regional offices is also
under consideration by KDFC.
V. THE LOAN - OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPAL FEATURES
5.01      Objectives of the Loan.  The proposed loan will support a major
component of the Government's development strategy, namely the continued
rapid expansion of export-oriented manufacturing and other industries,
by financing direct imports of machinery and equipment, as well as the
foreign exchange component of domestically produced equipment (paragraph
5.03), for a number of sub-projects in the manufacturing, mining, tourism,
agro-industry, fisheries and transport sectors. While small industry
projects are eligible for financing under the loan, it is expected that
the bulk of the loan proceeds would finance medium- and relatively large-
scale projects 1/ (requiring KDFC's financing of between $0.3 million and
$3 million), most of them oriented toward exports. This loan would also
serve to continue the long and mutually beneficial relationship between
the Bank Group and KDFC. As a result of that relationship the Bank Group
has been able, after having helped establish a strong and efficient insti-
tution, to continue to exert its influence in assisting KDFC to sustain
and improve its operational standards, to be innovative in its financing
approach, to put emphasis on the economic merits of projects seeking its
1/   A Bank loan specifically for financing Korean small and medium indus-
tries through the Medium Industry Bank (MIB) is under appraisal.



- 18 -
assistance, and more generally to commit itself to broader developmental
objectives. Over the period of commitment of this loan, KDFC's efforts
along these lines are expected to be intensified with the implementation
of its development program for 1976-77. A Bank loan for financing Korean
industry at this time would also contribute to relieving the expected
pressure on Korea's balance of payments in the next several years.
5.02      Economic Justification.  As stated in paragraph 4.04, the aver-
age economic rate of return on a large sample of KDFC-financed projects
was 31%. Sub-projects to be financed under this loan, although not yet
identified, are expected to show similar economic results. As an inter-
mediary for allocating Bank funds efficiently to projects smaller than
the Bank could finance directly, KDFC's performance has been, and is
expected to remain, very effective.
5.03      Utilization of Loan Proceeds.  Apart from the financing of direct
imports of machinery and equipment, the proceeds of the proposed loan will
be utilized to finance an agreed percentage representing imported material
and components of domestically produced capital goods. The Bank has granted
this facility in the past in its lending to DFCs. No specific proportion
of the loan amount is earmarked for this type of financing, but KDFC estimates
that this will be relatively minor, accounting for about 10% of the total
loan amount. Available data indicate that the average foreign exchange
component is about 60% for machinery and equipment (including transport
equipment) produced in Korea, and 35% for local civil construction expenditures.
These percentages have been discussed and agreed upon at negotiations.
5.04      Relending Rate.  In November 1974, KDFC raised its foreign cur-
rency relending rate from 10% to 11% p.a., with the Government's tacit
approval, in part because of its increased borrowing cost (ADB is
presently charging KDFC a rate of 8.75%). Although the Government does
not formally determine KDFC's interest rates, these are expected to be
in line with those applied by other banking and financial institutions
in Korea. KDFC is expected to relend the proceeds of loan at the rate of
11%. Mindful, however, of the fact that KDB, its much larger competitor,
charges 10.5% on its foreign currency loans, KDFC wants to reserve for
itself the option of charging the same rate as KDB's, 10.5%, if this
becomes necessary for competitive reasons. A relending rate of either
10.5% or 11% is appropriate. On the one hand, the spread to KDFC (2% or
2-1/4%) is not excessive. On the other hand, considering that KDFC's sub-
borrowers assume the foreign exchange risk and that the rate of devaluation
has averaged about 8% annually since 1967, the proposed nominal relending
rate of 10.5% or 11% represents an effective rate of 18.5-19% which does
not appear unduly low.
5.05      Free Limit.  In view of the high quality of KDFC's appraisal work
and the proven ability of its management and Board to make sound investment
decisions, an increase in the free limit from $0.75 million (under the
latest Bank loan, No. 905-KO) to $2.0 million is recommended. There would



- 19 -
be no aggregate free limit under the new loan. Although the Bank has full
confidence in KDFC's appraisal capability, the maintenance of a certain
free limit is mutually desirable in order to continue the dialogue on
project appraisal which both the Bank and KDFC have found useful in the
past. With the proposed free limit, it is estimated that roughly one
fifth of the number of subprojects under this loan (accounting for less than
one-half of the loan amount) would require prior approval by the Bank.
5.06      Amortization Schedule. As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule which would
conform substantially to the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the
sub-loans made by KDFC to its clients. The loan is expected to be fully
repaid within a period of eighteen years including a grace period of about
three years. The estimated disbursement schedule of the loan is shown
in Annex 16.
VI.  AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a) a new debt/equity limit of 7.0:1, using the revised
definition suggested in paragraph 3.10 (paragraph 4.06
of the Loan Agreement);
(b) a percentage of 60% for financing the foreign exchange
component of domestic equipment and 35% for local civil
works (paragraph 2.02(a) of the Loan Agreement);
(c) a new free limit of $2.0 million (paragraph 2.02 (b)
of the Loan Agreement).

Economic and Industrial Environment
A. The Korean Economy 1/
1.       Background.  The Korean economy, spearheaded by the highly export-
oriented manufacturing sector, has shown an impressive performance in
recent years. However, after growing at about 12%' p.a. in real terms in
the second half of the '60ts, the economy began to encounter difficulties
in the 1970-72 period due to the increasingly large deficits on the current
account of the balance of payments and the need to reduce the expansion of
external debt. During that period the average annual real GNP growth rate
dropped sharply to 8%, although this was still a good performance compared
with that of most other developing countries. Business profits were seriously
affected. Excess capacity also began to develop in some industrial sectors even
though the ratio of fixed investment to GNP declined from 29% in 1969 to
20% in 1972. In August 1972 the Government took strong measures which
successfully stabilized the economy and substantially strengthened the finan-
cial structre of many business firms; with relative domestic price stability
and excess capacity as a result of the 1970-72 slowdown, Korean industry
-as able to take full advantage of the remarkable boom in world-wide demand
for industrial goods in 1973. Commodity exports nearly doubled in 1973
reaching $3.2 billion; manufactured goods accounted for about 90% of the
total.  Imports increased by 71% aRd the current account deficit amounted
,to only $309 million or less than_, 3%of GNP. Foreign exchange reserves
exceeded $1 billion and external debt service payments fell to 14% of foreign
exchange receipts frt19.2%in 1972. Real CGP grew at a record rate of 16.5%,
domestic savings for the first time exceeded -M of tIP afi&-?ifed investment
increased by 29% after virtual stagnation in the previous three years.
2.       Performance in 1974.  The remarkable performance in 1973 had
exceeded all expectations; however, such a pace was not sustainable beyond
the short-term and in the fourth quarter of 1973 strains had already begun
to develop. Prices, which had remained relatively stable since the August
1972 measures, began to increase more rapidly, and industrial production
slowed down as raw materials supplies became constrained. In addition the
steep rise in petroleum prices sharply increased Korea's external resource
requirements and clouded the outlook for continued growth in export demand.
3.       Despite these adverse effects the Korean economy achieved a real
growth rate of 8.2% in 1974, not far short of the 9% target contained in the
Government's Long-Term Development Strategy and slightly higher than the

Economic Position and Prospects of the Republic of Korea' No. 768-KO,
dated May 28, 1975.

Page 2
revised Third Plan target of 8%. However most of the growth was con-
centrated in the first half of the year, as the full impact of the energy
crisis and the world-wide economic slowdown began to make itself felt
from mid-1974. Although the value of conmodity exports increased by about
30%, virtually all of that was due to price increases; since domestic
consumption was also sluggish, manufacturing inventories increased by over
40% compared with a decline in 1973. Imports increased by 60% in nominal
terms (7% in real terms) mainly as a result of the sharp increases in oil
and grain prices. The deterioration in the terms of trade (18%) was
sharper than expected and export growth fell considerably short of the 39%
rate projected by the Government. The current account deficit is estimated
to be $1.8 billion, considerably higher than the $1.1 billion projected
at the beginning of the year. The increase in domestic prices which had
begun at the end of 1973 accelerated and the wholesale price index rose by
45% during the year.  Real domestic fixed investment grew by only 7.5% as
finished goods inventories were built up and excess capacity began to reappear.
4.       December 1974 Economic Measures. In view of the balance of payments
situation and the general economic slowdown, the Government introduced in
December 1974 a number of economic measures which included the devaluation
of the won by 17.5% in dollar terms, the raising of public utility rates and
oil prices, price control over many essential commodities, and accelerated
Government budgetary expenditures to stimulate the economy. Interest rates
on bank deposits were raised to a uniform rate of 15% regardless of maturity
in order to promote savings and increase the availability of finance for
business. The Government will also provide business firms with special
loans amounting to about W150 billion, of which W50 billion would be to help
them meet their increased foreign debt service obligations, W50 billion to
replace worn-out equipment and for new investment, and W50 billion for small
and medium industry. New investment using domestically produced goods will
be eligible for special depreciation allowances. The Government will use its
Stockpile Fund to buy excess stocks of certain manufactured goods, such as
textiles and plywood, which have been badly hit by the economic slowdown.
Higher priority will be given to Government procurement of small and medium
industry products.
5.        Prospects for Growth.  Although it is still too early to assess
the impact of these measures, the Government hopes to achieve a GNP growth
rate of 7% in 1975, and to keep the current account deficit below $2 billion.
An ambitious export target of $6 billion has been set, representing a 40%
increase in nominal terms over 1974; import growth is to be held down to
about 25%. These targets represent a considerable downward revision from
the Third Plan projections; actual performance, however, will depend to a
large extent on the speed of recovery of Korea's major trading partners,
particularly Japan and the United States. Indications are that export
firms have used the won devaluation to strengthen their financial position
rather than to reduce prices in the face of inelastic export demand. The
Government is aiming to reduce the rate of inflation to 20% in 1975; this



ANUEX 1
Page 3
is essential if Korea is to maintain the competitiveness of its products
in the international market. Real domestic fixed investment will probably
continue to be sluggish in 1975, but it is expected that when the inter-
national economic outlook improves and export demand revives,industries
will quickly implement plans to expand and modernize production capacity.
On balance the 1974 performance shows that the Korean economy has been able
to withstand the initial imapact of the energy crisis without serious con-
sequences for its long-term growth objectives. Much of that resilience
was due to the exceptional performance of 1973. However, the outlook for
1975 is still uncertain with the balance of payments again giving the main
cause for concern. If external conditions are favorable it can be expected
that the economy could return to its long-term growth path of 8-9% in 1976 and
beyond.
B. The Industrial Sector
6.       The Role of Industry in the Economy. Since the early 1960's
manufacturing has been the fastest growing sector in the Korean economy
with an average annual growth rate of 19% over the last five years, accounting
for 48% of the increase in GNP during that period. Its share of GNP has
increased from 21.6% in 1970 to 30.4% in 1974. In 1973 exports of manu-
factured goods amounted to $2.7 billion or 84% of total commodity exports
compared with $650 million and 77% in 1970. Imports of machinery and equipment
amounted to $1.15 billion and raw materials for export products to $1.55
billion in 1973; imports of raw materials for industrial products sold on the
domestic market added another $791 million to the import bill in the same
year. Nearly two million persons or about 14% of-the labor force were employed
in the manufacturing sector in 1974. Notwithstanding its enormous contribution
to GNP, exports and employment, the manufacturing sector accounted on average
for only about 20% of total domestic fixed capital formation during 1970-73.
As an indication of how efficiently the manufacturing sector has been using
the economy's scarce capital resources the marginal capital-output ratio for
manufacturing investment fell from an already low average level of 1.4 during
1967-71 to 1.2 in 1972.
7.       Current Performance. Manufacturing sector value added
increased by 16.1% in real terms in 1974. Although this was a sharp decline
from the- record growth rate of 31% in 1973, manufacturing still maintained
its dominant position as the leading growth sector in the economy. Excports
of manufactured goods were seriously affected by the world-wide economic
slowdown in 1974 and showed virtually no growth in real terms; however, price
increases raised the value of manufactured goods exports by nearly 35% and
the share of manufactured goods in total exports increased from 84% in 1973
to nearly 90% in 1974. Since the export of manufactured goods more than
doubled in 1973, it was to be expected that growth in real terms in 1974 would
be sluggish; in view of the international economic situation, especially in
the U.S. and Japan, Korean manufacturers have done well to maintain the level
of exports achieved in 1973.

equipment                    -         41.4       13.7    162.8        13.6

Total                    301.4      100.0      1,197      100.0
Although manufacturing value-added grew very rapidly during this five-year
period, the structure of output has not changed significantly. In 1973
manufacturing activity continued to be concentrated mainly in the more labor-
intensive consumption goods sector. The increased share of light industry
in the structure of industry was mainly due to the very rapid growth in
textile production which has traditionally been the leading industry in terms
of production and employment. In 1973 it accounted for nearly a quarter of the
employment in the manufacturing sector. Its growth has essentially been export-
led; exports of textile goods, mainly clothing synthetic yarns and fabrics,
1/ At current prices.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
raw silk and cotton fabrics, increased by 62% in 1973 and amounted to $1.14
billion or about 35% of total exports. Despite this good performance some
parts of the industry, particularly producers of cotton and wool textiles
faced increasing difficulties in 1974. Export demand fell off sharply and
raw material supplies became difficult to obtain at competitive prices. An
additional problem was the obsoleteness of much of the machinery and equipment
uselby the industry.
9.       The chemical industry is another fast-growing component of the
manufacturing sector and accounted for nearly 15% of manufacturing value
added in 1973. In contrast to textiles, the chemical industry is capital-
intensive and its output has been aimed mainly at the domestic market.
Development of the chemical industry was a major aim of the Third Five-Year
Plan and large petrochemical and integrated chemical plants have been
constructed in Ulsan and Yeosu. The industry has become increasingly sophis-
ticated and produces a wide range of chemical products, both in the form of
finished products such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, dyestuffs and
medicines, and in the form of raw materials for the synthetic fiber, synthetic
rubber and plastics industries which had previously imported their raw
material requirements. Imports of chemicals, however, still amounted to $344
million or 8% of total imports in 1973. The Government intends to place
consider,#Ke emphasis on the development of the chemical industry in its
;onr.tf strategy for industry (see paragraph 14).
10.      The Size Distribution of Industry.  The following table shows the
distribution of manufacturing establishments by size of employment in 1972.

About 63% of the small-scale 1/ establishments are in the food, beverages,
textiles, apparel, footwear, metal products and machinery and equipment
industry sub-branches. These account for 64% of the employment and 66% of
the value added of the small-scale industry sector. Medium industry follows
the same pattern of industrial distribution with a slightly larger proportion
1/ .aual and medium industries are defined in the &Sall Industry Basic Act
as enterprises with less than 200 workers or with total assets of less
than W50 million. (The Medium Industry Bank has recently recommended to the
Government that this definition be revised upwards). For convenience,
small industry is defined here as enterprises with 5-49 workers and medium
industry as enterprises with 50-200 workers.



ANNIE 1

involved in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastics industries.
Among large industries, food, beverages, textiles and apparel account
for 48% of employment and 46% of value added. In fact the similar pattern
of industrial distribution of all three groups indicates that small and
medium industries in Korea are competitive with large-scale enterprises
or perform important ancillary functions. Another indication of the
economic viability of small and medium industries is their export perfQrmance.
Exports of small- and medium-scale industries have nearly quadrupled between
1970 and 1973 and their share of total exports increased from 32% in 1970
to 37% in 1973. Despite these positive indications there has been an
overall decline in the share of small and medium industry as the Korean
economy has expanded and modernized. In 1967 small and medium industry
accounted for 59% of employment compared with 45% in 1972, and 39% of value
added compared with 28% in 1972. The Govermnent has recently been inten-
fying its efforts to promote small and medium industry, recognizing its
importance for employment generation, income distribution and industrial
dispersal. These efforts are expected to maintain the small and medium
industry's position in the sector despite the planned rapid expansion of
the heavy and chemical industries.
11.      Geographical Distribution. Korea is a relatively densely populated
country (329 people per square kilometer) with one-third of its population
concentrated in the three largest cities, Seoul, Busan and Taegu., The
regional distribution of industry follows the same pattern and is summarized
in the following table.

There has been no change in the geographical distribution of industry between
1969 and 1972. However the Government has become increasingly aware of the
need for a wider geographical location in order to achieve a better regional
distribution of employment opportunities and to reduce the congestion and
overcroisding in Seoul and Busan. The Government has therefore been promoting
the development of industrial centers outside these two areas. Major
examples are the iron and steel plants in Pohang, the petrochemical complex
in Ulsan, the integrated chemical industry in Yeosu, and the machinery
industry center at Changwon. In addition special incentives are given to
industries locating their factories outside Seoul and Busan, and free trade



Page 7
zones and industrial estates (mainly for small and medium industries)
have been set up to encourage wider industrial dispersal.
12.      Financial Position.   As a result of the remarkable performance of
the Korean economy in 1973 industrial enterprises were able to improve
their financial position and performance considerably. As stated in
paragraph 1, business profits had been seriously affected by the slowdown
in economic activity during 1970-72 and the Government had to take strong
measures to improve the financial position of business enterprises, in
particular their debt structure which had been heavily dependent on the
high cost, short-term 'curb' market for financing. The aggregate debt
ratio 1/ of manufacturing enterprises fell from 4.2 in 1971 to 2.8 in 1972
mainly as the result of these measures. This ratio fell further in 1973
to 2.6. Average interest on borrowed funds fell from 14.1% to 9.3% as a
result of the debt restructuring. Profitability also improved markedly
during the period; net income as a percentage of total liabilities and
net  worth increased from 0.5% in 1971 to 6.9% in 1973.   Increases in
production costs tended to lag behind price increases as demand for Korea's
manufactured goods picked up rapidly. Although many companies again came
under financial strain in 1974 as export demand slackened, capacity
utilization declined, and costs of production, particularly raw materials,
continued to rise, the very profitable operations of 1973 had helped them
to build-up a strong financial position and to withstand temporary setbacks.
13.      Wages and Productivity. As was mentioned earlier, industrial
development in Korea has in the past been concentrated in labor-intensive
light industries producing for the export market. The competitiveness of
these products in the international market has owed much to the high quality
of the Korean labor force and its willingness to work hard for low wages.
Although wages in the manufacturing sector have been rising at about 17% a
year in nominal terms between 1970 and 1973, real wage rates have grown at
only 7% a year, and they are still very low in absolute terms, averaging
about $56 a month in 1973. Labor productivity in manufacturing increased by
10% per year during the same period. The UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics
estimates that the average hourly wage in the manufacturing sector in Korea
was only $o.25 in 1972 compared with $1.55 in Japan and $3.81 in the United States.
14.      Industrial Development Strategy.  During the 1960's Korea's
industrial development has successfully passed through the stages of import
substitution and export-orientation based on labor-intensive light industries.
During thie Second Five-Year Plan (1967-71) the Government decided to shift
the direction of development towards deepening the industrial structure
by promoting the establishment of heavy and chemical industry. Korea's
long-term plans call for an average annual expansion of manufacturing output
by about 17% up to 1981. The share of manufacturing in total output is
expected to increase to over 40% by 1981 compared with 30% in 1973. The
share of heavy and chemical industry in manufacturing output is projected
to rise from 36% in 1973 to 51% in 1981. Over 50% of investment in
manufacturing during 1973 and 1974 went into heavy and chemical industry,
particularly iron and steel, ship-building and petrochemicals. Given the
1/ Liabilities divided by net worth.



ANNEX 1
Page 8
long-run uncertainties regarding the international demand for the products of
Korea's light industries, a deepening of the industrial structure is essential
if the rapid growth of industry is to be maintained. A relative shift toward
heavier industry will also increase net foreign exchange earnings from exports
of light manufactures as imported intermediate and capital goods are replaced
by domestic production. At present, net foreign exchange earnings of Korea's
manufactured exports, on the whole, amount to only 50% of gross foreign ex-
change earnings, and if indirect import requirements are included, the ratio
of net to gross foreign exchange earnings is probably less than 40%.
15.       Government Incentives. 1/ The Government has a large array of incentives
to promote industrial development in line with its policies and priorities.
These include the promotion of export industries, foreign investment, geographical
dispersal of industry, public ownership of companies, and special assistance
for small and medium industry. The incentives include reductions in corporate,
business and income tax rates, easy access to credit and special loans, pre-
ferential interest rates, depreciation and other allowances and protection
through tariffs.
16.       Trends in Industrial Investment.  Fixed investment in the manufac-
turing sector amounted to about W420 billion in 1974 representing an increase
of about 39% in nominal terms over 1973. The bulk of this investment (57%)
took place in the heavy industry sector, mainly oil refining and chemicals
(20%) and iron and steel (12%). Investment in light industries amounted to
W122 billion of which W97 billion was in textile industries. About 60% of
this investment was financed by foreign and domestic loans; the remainder
came from equity investments, bond issues, joint ventures and internally-
generated funds. Over 70% of investment expenditures were for machinery and
equipment (including transport equipment). Investment in non-manufacturing
industries (e.g. fisheries, mining, construction, electricity, hotels, and
transportation) increased by 58% in nominal terms; 70% of the increase was
due to investments in electric power which accounted for 50% of the total in 1974.
J7.       The Government's overall resources budget (ORB), which is prepared
annually, calls for an increase of 55% in current prices in manufacturing invest-
ment in 1975. The bulk of the planned increase is concentrated in the heavy
industries. A recent survey of investment trends by the Korea Development Bank 2/
indicates that investment in the manufacturing sector is expected to increase by
only 21% in nominal terms in 1975. According to the same survey, however,
investment in non-manufacturing industries is expected to double in 1975. Assuming
that fixed investment in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries will
increase-by about 25% in 1975, total industrial fixed investment will amount to
W78O billion. Of this total about 60% is expected to be financed from domestic and
foreign exchange loans. Beyond 1975, industrial investment is projected by the
Government to grow at 35% per year in 1976 and 1977 in current prices, or 15% per
year in real terms, on the basis of a 9% annual growth in GNP and 17% growth in
the manufacturing sector.
C. The Financial Sector
18.       Institutional Set-Up.  The financial sector of Korea consists of
the Bank of Korea, Deposit Money Banks and non-monetary financial institu-
tions. The Bank of Korea performs regular central banking functions,

please refer to Annex 1A of the report entitled 'Appraisal of Korea
Development Bank' (Report No.592-KO dated February 26, 1975).

including the supervision of commercial banks. Deposit Money Banks are
either commercial banks or specialized banks. Commercial banks are those
receiving their funds mainly through deposits from the public. They can
make all kinds of loans; however, they have traditionally concentrated on
short-term lending. Recently they have increased their long-term lending
business, and roll-over of short-term loans is also common. All nationwide
commercial banks have their majority shares held by the Government. All
commercial banks are subject to control and supervision by the Bank of Korea.
Specialized Banks in contrast are directly controlled by the Ministry of
Finance. They were all established under a Special Banking Act and are
subject to only a few specific Articles of the Bank of Korea Act and General
Banking Act. Specialized Banks, as their name implies, were founded for
particular purposes or sectors (such as small-scale industry financing,
agricultural financing) and their major source of funds are loans, mostly
from the Government.
19.      There are five nationwide  commercial banks, ten banks with
localized operations, eight branches of foreign banks and the Korea Trust
Bank, which have all together 511 branches/offices around the country (all
these fall under the term of commercial banks). Specialized Banks include
the Korea Development Bank, 1/ which received its first IBRD Loan of $60
million in February 1975, the Korea Exchange Bank, which in 1967 was
established mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of commercial foreign
exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank (see paragraph 22),the Citizens
National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and financing hou sehold
loans), the Korea Housing Bank, the National Agricultural Cooperative Fund
(NACF) and the Fisheries Cooperative.
20.      Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions (Monetary System)
there are several non-monetary financial institutions, namely trust
accounts of commercial banks, s-ix life insurance companies and the postal
savings system. Other non-banking financial institutions performing
specialized functions, apart from EDFC, are the Korea Investment Corporation
(KIC), primarily a broker for the offering and distribution of corporate
securities, the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC) which
provides short-term finance to the private industrial sector (see Annex 15),
nine other recently established short-term finance corporations and the
Korea Capital Corporation, all of which deal in short-term money market
instruments. In addition, there were 278 mutual savings and finance
companies at the end of June 1974 and some 1,300 authorized credit unions.
21.      As of October 31, 1974, total loans outstanding to industry by
all banking institutions in Korea amounted to almost W1,500 billion ($3.1
billion equivalent), three-fourths of which was for operating funds, mainly
supplied by commercial banks. The largest supplier of equipment fund loans
was KDB which, as of October 31, 1974, had an outstanding portfolio of W95
billion(about $200 million) or about 40% of total outstanding medium- and
long-term credit by banking institutions to industry as of that date.
1/ For a detailed discussion of KDB, please refer to the report entitled
'Appraisal of Korea Development Bank' No. 592-KO, dated February 26, 1975.

22.      Financing for &nall-Scale Industry.  The Medium Industry Bank
was founded in 19o1 as a Government owned and controlled institution to
extend financial and technical assistance to smnall and medium industries.
Its lending is restricted to companies with fixed assets below W600
million or those with less than 200 employees. It stops lending to
those clients that outgrow these limits. Besides its lending operations,
*it is involved in export financing, credit guarantee operations, inter-
national banking, extension services and research of small-medium industries.
As of December 31, 1974,IlB's total resources amounted to W189 billion
including loans from AID, ADB and KfW. As of the same date, it had total
outstanding loans amounting to W57 billion of which W59 billion or 38%
were term loans. About 92% of total loans are to the manufacturing sector.
Small-scale industries can also, and do, obtain funds from, commercial banks.
A :3ank loan to MIB for financing small- and medium-scale industries is
under appraisal.
23-      Capital Market.  The Korea Stock Market which was moribund for
many years showed signs of life in 1972. Before then the yields on stocks
were unattractive as both cormmercial banks and the 'curb' market paid high
interest rates. The market was also thin because closely held companies
were reluctant to go public. With the economic boom that got under way
from about mid-1972 and with additional Government measures, the pu-olic
showed growing interest in the stock market. 'The 'curb' market was severely
checked as a result of August 3, 1972 measures and with decreasing interest
rates at commercial banks, yields on stocks became attractive. In addition,
the overall investment climate became very favorable after August 1972 and
there was a campaign for more stock listings and for companies to go public.
The result was a great increase in stock exchange activity in the second
half of 1972 and in 1973,as the following table shows (figures are as of the
end of each period):
Stock Exchange Activity

1974 (Iay)  112        187.9            383.7         312.9            465.3
24.          The capital market continued to grow and strengthen during
the first half of 1974 as a result of favorable Government policies. However,
stock prices have dropped in recent months after record highs in 1973,
following the economic slow-down and unfavorable international developnents.
The number of shareholders fell considerably, mainly because of withdrawal
of small investors. Over the years the ownership structure has broadened,
though at Decernoer 31, 1973, two thirds of all shareholders still held less



ANNEX 1
Page 11
than 100 shares each, accounting for only 1% of all shares outstanding,
while less than 1% of' all shareholders owned about 70%. The importance
of the Government as a shareholder of industrial companies also decreased.
While the Government (including public bodies) held about 39% of all
listed stocks in 1970, its holding declined to 20% of the total by the
end of 1973. Also, the proportion held by banking institutions decreased
from 15% to 8%.
Interest Rates, Inflation
25.          Interest rates in Korea are determined by the Government
through the Monetary Board and apply to all banking institutions. Specialized
financial institutions such as KDFC or the short-term finance companies
are not legally bound; however, in practice they, too, have to follow
government policies. At present, deposit rates range between 1% p.a.. (for
demand deposits), and 15% p.a. (time deposits). Although not directly
comparable, it may be mentioned that public debentures yield about 21% p.a.
and the average dividend yield on common stock was 13.6% as of June 30, 1974.
General lending rates for loans stand at 15.5% irrespective of duration. 1/
Preferential rates are granted for various sectors or types of loans such
as loans for exports (9%), equipment loans for machine industry production
(10%), loans for equipment to export industries (12%) and loans made from
proceeds of the National Investment Fund (at 12%). Rates in the 'curb'
market, which has reportedly become alive again, could be as high as 35%
p.a. Rates on foreign exchange loans made by KDB, MIB and KDFC are usually
at 9-10.5% with the exchange risk borne by the borrower.
26.          The development of Korea's interest rate structure has, since
about 1968, seen a oontinuous reduction in both deposit and lending rates.
In prescribing preferential rates for various industrial sectors, the-
Government's financial aims were to strengthen the competitive position of
Korea's export industries that figure heavily in its long range development
plans. The lowering of the rates coincided, in general, with the Government's
gradual success in bringing inflation down until late 1973 when the inflation
rate jumped up again. 2/ With the emergence of the oil crisis and the
general world-wide inflation, Korea's price structure was particularly hard-
hit because of its high foreign trade dependence. Between November 1973
and April 1974 wholesale prices shot up by 36%. Since-then domestic inflation
has slowed somewhat reflecting seasonal factors, slower increase in prices
for imported goods and the dampening effect of demand contraction and rising
inventories. For the whole of 1974, wholesale prices rose by 44.6%. In
view of the present difficulties facing the economy and the government's
expectation to succeed in bringing inflation under control, the Government
has not changed the interest rate structure significantly. However, on
December 9, 1974, preferential rates for loans from the NIF and the Industrial
Rationalization Fund were increased from 9% and 8% respectively to 12% for
both, and t.he rates on time deposits for over three months (12%) and over six
months (13.2%) were temporarily 3/ raised to 15%. A complete list of interest
rates charged by the Bank of Korea, KDB, MIB, KDFC and th3 commercial banks as
of December 31, 1974 is given in Table 1 of this Annex.
1/ The lowering of medium-term rates to the level of short-term loans in 1973
was to encourage equipment investment.
2/ Inflation rates between May 1972 and November 1973, when the impact of the
oil crisis could first be felt, grew at only 7.1% p.a.

(Adopted by the Board of Directors on April 25, 1967
and amended on February 29, 1968, February 26, 1973 and February 26, 1974)
The Korea Development Finance Corporation, whose object is to promote
the expansion of private enterprise in the Republic of Korea, will be guided
by the policies set forth below:
I. The Scope of Investment Activities
1) KDFC will invest only in productive enterprises. While its
primary activity will be manufacturing and processing industry,
it may invest also in other types of enterprises, including
transport, tourism, and large-scale commercially oriented agri-
culture. However, trade, real estate and small-scale agriculture
will be excluded.
2) KDFC will finance only private enterprises which are properly
organized and managed. KDFC will not invest in undertakings which
are Government-owned and operated, but a Government holding of not
more than l5% of the voting stock of a private enterprise shall
not make such enterprise ineligible for financial assistance from
KDFC . KDFC will finance both new enterprises and existing ones
for expansion or improvement.
3) In its operations, KDEiC will give due regard to the Government's
general economic plans'and polieies. The following categories of
industries will receive high priority, in accordance with the
Government economic policies and objectives:
a) export industries;
b) import-substitute industries;
c) industries producing raw materials necessary for production
of export commodities and import-substitutes;
d) indigenous local industries which have special advantage in
comparative costs and potential marketability in foreign
markets;
e) participation or assistance in the turn-over of the
Government-owned industries to private ownership.
4) KDFC will assist private enterprises in the following ways:
a) medium and long-term loans;



ANNEX 5
Page 2
b) equity participation (through underwriting, conversion
rights, direct participation in share capital or otherwise);
c) guarantee of payment for machinery and equipment imported
or otherwise;
d) guarantee and underwriting of corporate securities;
e) technical and managerial consultant services; and
f) any other appropriate manner.
5) KDFC will seek through its operation, to broaden the ownership of
private securities in Korea.
6) KDFC's financial assistance will be primarily for expenditures
for fixed assets. KDFC will, however, consider requests for
permanent working capital in conjunction with its financial
assistance for such capital expenditures.
7) KDFC will study periodically the trend of over-all industrial
development and investment opportunities in the private sector
in cooperation with research institutes for promotion of now
enterprises or expansion of the existing ones.
II. Basis for Investment Decisions
8) KDFC will make inveitment decisions only on the basis of sound
investment criteria and standards, and will provide financial
assistance only to those projects which are financially and
economically sound and technically feasible. Special attention
will be given to the ability of management and the profitability
of the enterprise.
III. Diversification of Portfolio
9) KDEC will diversify its portfolio in order to maintain a
reasonable level of risk.
10) KDFC will not provide financial assistance of less than the
Won equivalent of $50,000. The maximum financial commitment
in whatever form, including loan, share capital or guarantee
or any combination thereof, that 'LDFC may,make to any single
enterprise will not normally exceed 15% if of the total of KDFC's
paid-in capital, free reserves and Government loan of 1968.
2/ KDFC is considering raising this figure to 20%. IBRD has already
consented.



P'age 3
;) XDFC will not commit to any single enterpriss  in form of share
capital more than 10% of KDFC's paid-in cailU al nd free reserves.
The aggregate equity inestment of KDFC at 2:. y time will not
exceed the total of its paid-in share capital and free reserves.
12)  In undertaking large-size projects, KDF  will seek cooperation
with other financial institutions, both domestic and foreign.
IV. Turn-over of Portfolio
13)  In order to recover its resources for new commitments and to
encourage widespread ownership of private securities, KDFC
will revolve its portfolio whenever it can do so on satisfactory
terms. In selling an investment it will pay due regard not only
to its own interests but also to the interests of other partici-
pants in such investment, as also to the interest of the concern
whose shares are involved.
V. Relationship with Enterprises Financed
14) KDFC will not take a controlling interest in any enterprise in
which it has invested, or any other interest which would give it
primary responsibility for management, except that in the case
of jeopardy, it may take such action as may be necessary
to protect its interest. To this end it will not take up more
than 25% of the share capital of an enterprise, except as the
result of an underwriting commitment undertaken in the expectation
that the investment would in fact be within the limit cited.
15)  In accordance with normal banking practice, KDFC will require
its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security, to
keep records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting
practices, and to furnish whatever information on their operatiOns
and accounts KDFC deems desirable. KDFC will take the right to
inspect the enterprises it finances as well as their operations
and accounts.
16) Business secrets and other information furnished by applicants
or clients will be treated as confidential.
VI. Financial Guidelines
17) KDFC will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to
maintain the value of its capital. KDFC will pass to its clients
any foreign exchange risk it assumes or find other suitable means
to cover it.
18)  KDFC will not incur any debt (not including as debt the loan made
by Korean Government in 1968) in excess of five times the aggregate
of its paid-in capital, free reserves and the 1968 Government loan
outstanding.
19)  KDFC will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations in accordance with sound and generally accepted
international accounting practices and standards. KDFC will employ
qualified and independent public accountants to audit its books and
certify the accounts annually.

and taxes, to provide reserves adequate to the size and risks of
its portfolio and to protect its equity against erosion and to
pay satisfactory dividends. It will seek profits on. its equity
investments and will impose interest rates, fees and other
charges for its loans and services which will permit it to achieve
that level of profitability. It will build and maintain reserves
consistent with sound financial management. It will set aside
each year from net income before tax. the amount required ty law
as the legal reserve. In addition, it will accumulate other
reserves, including reserve for losses, as considered prudent
by the Board of Directors.
VIII. Staff
21) KDFC will build up a technically qualified staff capable of
carrying the responsibilities which KDFC's objectives create,
and able to provide the services to clients which those ob-
jectives call for.

Financial Position and Performance
Financial Position
1. Assets. As shown in the audited balance sheets for FY71-74 (attached
as Table 1), KDFC's total assets stood at W44,163.4 million as of December
31, 1974. The following table summarizes the composition of KDFC's
assets structure and its recent growth:
KDFC's Assets Structure (W million)
As of December 31,                 1972 a.          1                19774

Debentures and equity
investments                   1,641    7.9    1,583    5.9    2,031    4.6
Less: Provisions               (363)  (1.7)    (466)  (1.7)    (628)  (1.4)
Fixed and other assets          443    2.1   _442    1.6         467    1.1
Total assets            20,766  100.0   26,832  100.0   44,163  100.0
Year-to-year growth           50.5%            29.2%           64.5%
As can be seen from the above, 1974 was a year of remarkable growth for
KDFC's assets. This growth was due primarily to the 87% increase in long-
term foreign currency loans outstanding, which jumped from W18,700 million
at year-end 1973 to W35,049 million at year-end 1974, reflecting the much
higher level of disbursements in 1974, itself a direct consequence of the
record level of commitments in 1973. Local currency loans, debentures and
equity investments also grew in 1974; this growth, however, was not smfficient
to prevent their share of the total portfolio outstanding from declining
to 14.0% in 1974 compared to 17.8% in 1973. Current assets (excluding the
current portion of loans receivable), actually declined in absolute terms in
1974, as a result of the drawdown of local currency funds that had been
1/  Excluding the current portion of loans receivable.
2/ Including time deposits restricted for employees' severance pay.

deposited on a short term basis with commercial baxLks, after the share
capital increase of 1973. Fixed and other assets have remained almost
static at the W450 million level since 1972. Also shown in the above
table is an accumulated allowance for bad debts and for a decline in the
market value of equity investments of W628 million. This allowance is
more than adequate in view of the quality of the portfolio; it represents
nearly 14.1% of the short-term receivables, 1.9% of long-term receivables
and 31% of equity investments and convertible debentures. All in all,
provisions for losses covered close to 1.6% of the total portfolio of
loans and investments outstanding at year-end 1974.
2. Liabilities. KDFC's total debt liabilities as of December 31, 1974
amounted to W38,086 million.  The composition and growth of its liabilities
since December 31, 1972 is shown below:
KDFX>'s Liabilities Structure (W million)

Total liabilities   16256  100.0    21.343  1 08   100.0
Year-to-year growth       61.9%             26.6%            78.4%
The growth pattern of liabilities, as might be expected, is quite similar
to that of assets. The increase in the level of foreign currency loans
outstanding was achieved by substantial drawdowns on foreign currency
borrowings which brought long-term foreign exchange loans payable to a
record W35,204 million equivalent at year-end 1974, an increase of 88%
over the 1973 figure. As a result, the proportion of foreign currency
borrowings to total liabilities reached 92.5% as of December 31, 1974.
Current liabilities, as well as other liabilities, also increased over the
last three years, in line with the growth of total liabilities. The
Government subordinated loan, however, which remained unchanged at W2,025
million, has continued to decline steadily in proportion to total liabili-
ties, falling from 12.0% in 1972 to 5.3% as of December 31, 1974. IBRD
loans have therefore been the primary factor in the expansion of KDFC's
operations. On an outstanding basis these loans grew from W13.3 billion in
1972 to 34.0 billion in 1974, representing about 91% of KDFC's long-term
debt. A decline in the prominence of IBRD loans is expected to take place
in the coming years as KDFC gradually diversifies its sources of foreign
exchange funds. Actually, this decline has already begun, as KDFIC secured
its first loan (IJS$ 30 million) from ADB in October 1974.
1/ Employees' severance liability.

3.  Net Worth.  KDFC's net worth as of Decenber 31, 1974 was W6.1 bijilon;
retained earnings of W2.5 billion accounted for 41% of this amount, having
increased by WO.4 billion (or 21%) from their 1973 level.  Paid-in share
capital was increased, in October 1973, from W1.8 billion to W3.0 billion
through a one-for-two rights issue at par; it is expected to be further
increased in 1975 by a 10% stock dividend out of the 1974 earnings, and in
1976, through an additional rights issue (Annex 8, Table 4).
4. Capital Structure. As Table 3 indicates, KDFC's capital structure has
gradually become more debt-oriented as the total long-term debt/quity ratio
has increased from 4.2:1 in 1971 to its present level of 6.1:1 I . At this
level, KDFC's capital structure can still be considered sound, given this
institution's managerial capabilities and the quality of its portfolio.
Under the Bank's definition, KDFCts debt/equity ratio grew from 2.8:1 in
1972 to 4.8:1 at year-end 1974, exceeding the contractual limit of 4.5:2
set by the Bank under the latest loan agreement, as a result of the devalu-
ation of the won, which drove KDFC's foreign exchange liabilities up by
about 20%. The Bank is considering KDFC's request for an increase in the
existing contractual limit.  KDFC's liquidity position is still quite
satisfactory; the current ratio, however, as a result of the growth in KDFC's
won financing operations, has declined gradually from its 1971 high level of
4.3 and now stands at 1.9, which is still quite all right.  In its projections,
KDFC expects its current ratio to reach a low of 1.3 in 1975 and thereafter
maintain itself at about 1.5, quite an adequate level.

ANNE 7
Page h
KDFC's financial results in 1974 showed an impressive growth, both in terms of
gross income and net earnings, reflecting the substantial increase in loan
and investment assets during the year. As can be seen, the annual rate of
growth in net income reached 23.4% in 1974 compared to 7.3% in 1973; total
gross income for the year was W3,b843 million, 34.3% more than the 1973 figure.
The composition of gross income has not changed significantly over the last
three years, with the exception of the continuous decline, both in absolute
and relative terms of income generated from short-term operations that results
from the decrease in the level of current assets held (para. 1). A further
decline is not anticipated, as it would otherwise reflect negatively on KDFC's
liquidity position.
6. Expenses. KDFC has continued, to the extent possible, to keep a tight
control over its expenses. The increase in total expenses in 1974 (by 44.1)
was mainly attributable to the 42.9% growth of financial charges due to the
expansion in operations. Operating expenses also went up (by 35.4%), in
part as a result of a 40% across-the-board salary increase granted to the
personnel. This step was taken to maintain the competitiveness of KDFC s
salary scale which had been somewhat eroded in 1973. Provisions for losses
for 1974 reached W200 million, including a W39 million write-off, a level
comparable to the 1972 figure and considered quite adequate. As in the past,
these provisions continue to be made annually at a fixed rate of 2% of
incremental loan portfolio and regardless of the actual level of new arrears
(which, in effect, was recently very low), in accordance with Korean tax law.
To that extent, these provisions represent hidden earnings. Interest and
commitment charges accounted for the largest portion (72.3%) of the 1974
total expenses, while operating expenses represented 20.4% and provisions
for losses, 7.3%; these shares are similar to the corresponding 1973 figures.
7. Performance Indicators. As the data in Table 3 suggest, KDFC's overall
financial performance remains satisfactory, despite a declining trend in a
few ratios. While on the whole net earnings are still satisfactory and high
enough to allow adequately for both dividends and increases in retained
earnings, profits before tax and provisions as a percentage of average total
assets have been declining steadily from 7.I% in 1971 to 3.7% in 1974 (after-
tax profits in that year amounted to 2.6% of average assets). In terms of
return on equity, however, the decline has been checked with earnings at a
satisfactory level of 15.7% of average equity both in 1973 and 1974.
Financial expenses accounted for 5.6% of average total assets, similar to
the 1973 figure, while general and administrative expenses have stabilized
at 1.7% of average total assets. Earnings per share have decreased con-
tinuously over the 1971-1974 period and now stand at W1,520. This decline
is largely attributable to the 1973 increase in share capital; in the future,
KDFC expects to maintain earnings per share at their current level (Annex 8,
Table 5). Debt service coverage has only slightly decreased from 1.5 in 1972
to 1.3 in 1974; this level is still perfectly adequate.
8. With the exception of 1973, KDFC has paid annually a dividend of 10% in
cash and 10% in stock, ever since 1969; in 1973 KDFC paid a 15% dividend in
cash. The cash dividend pay-out ratio has averaged 27% since 1969. Trading
in KDFC shares has so far been very moderate; the present depressed state
of the Korean stock market has brought KDFCIs shares down from W10,700 in
January 1974 to a low of W7,310 at year-end 1974, when KDFC's book value
per share amounted to 203% of their par value (w5,00o per share).

Qualityr of Portfolio
9. In 1972, for the first time since its inception, KDFC experienced some
arrears problem. At year-end 1972, six loans were in arrears for over three
months. With KDFC's total loan and convertible debentures portfolio amount-
ting then to approximately W16.8 billion, the "infected" principal of
loans outstanding represented 6.6% of the total, which was by no means an
alarming situation by usual DFC standards.  The most frequent problem
encountered by overdue clients at that time was one of inadequate financial
structure, usually involving excessive borrowing in the short-term curb
market at high rates of interest, aggravated by an economic recession which
had cut into sales. The Government Decree of August 1972 (which ordered
the rescheduling of all private non-banking loans and reduction to 16.2% of interest
rates on these loans) coupled with an export-led boom in the economy in 1973,
resulted in a marked improvement in the arrears situation. As of December
31, 1973, all but one of the six companies that appeared in the previous
year-end past-due list had regularized their position. Only two companies
were delinquent at end-1973 and end-1974; the total principal affected by
arrears represented only 0.4% and 0.3% of year-end portfolio, respectively
(See Table 4).
10. KDFC has studied in detail the impact of the December 7, 1974 Government
measures (that included inter alia a devaluation of the won) on its operations,
and the quality of its portfolio based on an assessment of its borrowers'
short-term prospects. Although it was found that these measures in themselves
were not likely to affect significantly the debt repayment capability of
its clients, KDFC does expect, however, that the current depressed state of
the economy will result in a worsening of loans in arrears. It is anti-
cipated that a number of loans will require rescheduling in early 1975, in
part because of KDFC's past practice of setting somewhat tight repayment
schedules for its sub-borrowers. Nevertheless, the quality of KDFC's port-
folio is expected to remain excellent.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Projected Operations and Financial Performance. 1975-1979
Industrial Investment Prospects
1.     The prospects for continued industrial growth in Korea remain, on
the whole, favorable. Over the projected period 1975-79, total exports
are forecast to increase at an annual rate of 24I%, with the main growth
expected to be concentrated in manufactured exports. The growth of the
manufacturing and mining sector will be sustained by a high rate of
industrial investment; it is expected to increase at an average annual
rate of about 35%, rising from W624 billion in 1974 to an estimated W2,200
billion in 1979, at current prices. The share of manufacturing and mining
in total investment is estimated to be about 34% at the end of the Third-
Plan period in 1976, compared to 30% at end-1973. The structural change
in manufacturing investment, which has already begun to take place, would
continue, with an increasing amount of funds being directed to heavy
industries such as basic metals, engineering and chemicals. This shift
in emphasis implies a rapid growth in demand for term finance. (For a
more detailed discussion, see Annex 1, para. 16).
KDFC's Business Forecast
2.     The forecast of KDFC s approvals, commitments and disbursements
from 1975 through 1979 is shown in Table 1 of this Annex. Projected
commitments are summarized below:

KDFC's foreign exchange commitments in 1973 had risen to a record $34.1
million. Partly because of unfavorable economic conditions but mainly as
a result of the delay experienced by KDFC in securing its first loan from
ADB, foreign exchange commitments for 1974 slumped to $18.9 million.
However, when the ADB loan became effective in October 1974, KDFC was able
to accelerate the rate of processing of clients' applications. This
resulted in an unusual bunching of approvals at year-end 1974 ($14.9 million)
which became commitments in early 1975. The bunching is reflected in the
table shown above by the disparity between total commitments in 1974 of $23.8
million equivalent and estimated total commitments in 1975 of $49.4 million
equivalent. In other words, KDFC had completed all the administrative work,
except the signing of the loan agreements with its clients, for commitments
amounting to $38.7 million ($23.8 million plus $14.9 million) by December 31,
1974. Forecast commitments of $49.4 million equivalent for 1975 would be
achieved by KDFC's processing additional commitments in that year of only
$34.5 million equivalent ($49.4 million minus $14.9 million). In short,
projected commitments for 1975 appear attainable.
3.     From 1976 through 1979, commitments are projected to increase at an
annnal rate of 12%. At this rate, the growth of KDFC's commitments is con-
siderably below the Government's projected 35% average annual rate of increase
in total manufacturing and mining investment over the same period, and is
therefore on the conservative side. As usual, KDFC's forecast of operations
is not based on the projections of Government planners, but rather on its
assessment of resources, especially of foreign exchange, likely to be
available to it. KDFC has never been confronted with a lack of demand for
its funds; the factors that limited its operations, at certain times, have
been a shortage of foreign funds available, and occasional staff constraints.
Given its plan for professional staff recruitment (Annex 4), KDFC should find
no difficulty in exceeding its forecast, if it succeeds in raising additional
foreign exchange resources.
4.    Another feature of KDFC's projected commitments is the increase, in
absolute terms, in its domestic currency financing from W6.7 billion over
the 1970-1974 period to W16.8 billion over 1975-79. However, won commitments
as a proportion of the total are likely to decline from 16.1% in the five-
year period ending 1974 to 12.9% in 1975-1979; this last figure is actually
close to the proportion of won financing to total financing that KDFC achieved
in 1973 and 1974.  Given KDFC's comfortable projected won resource position
(para. 5), it should be able to increase its domestic currency financing in
the next years over the projected level should additional demand materialize.
Resource Requirements
5.    Local currency resources.  KDFC's total commitments of domestic
currency from January 1, 1975 through December 31, 1979 are estimated to be
W16.8 billion. At the beginning of that period, KDFC had Wl,240 million
available for commitment (Annex 9). From the table below, it is evident that
with the inclusion of share capital increases in 1976 and 1978 alternating
with two bond issues in 1977 and 1979, KDFC will have more than sufficient
local currency resources at its disposal to achieve the level of won financing
it has forecasted in Table 1, while maintaining a satisfactory level of
liquidity.

6.     Foreign currency resources.  KDFC plans to commit approximately
US$233.5 milion from January 1, 1975 to the end of' 1979.  In the short
run, it expects to borrow an additional US$55 million from the Bank and
US$40 million from ADB, the latter loan around the fourth quarter of 1976.
Based on KDFC's assumptions for commitments of foreign currency loans, the
fifth Bank loan should be fully committed by the third quarter of 1977
(Annex 17).

As can be seen from the above table, KDFG expects to borrow US$120 million
over the 1977-1979 period to achieve its target level of commitments in
foreign exchange. Though it may be anticipated that international lending
organizations (IBRD and ADB) will finance the bulk of these requirements,
KDF will attempt, to the extent possible, to diversify its sources of
foreign exchange funds. Actually, in KDFC's projections, the US$10 million
borrowing planned for 1977 is expected to come, for the first time, from
foreign commercial sources, whereas the origin of the remaining borrowings,
in 1978 and 1979, is not identified, but it presumably is expected to come
from IBRD/ADB.

7.    Projected balance sheets through 1979 are shown in Table 2, and
the corresponding financial ratios, in Table 5. On the basis of its
forecast volume of business, KDFCIs total assets should increase from
W154.7 billion in l975 to W116.3 billion in 1979. The loan and equity
portfolio will increase, after deductions for provisions,from W40.1
billion in 197h to about W108 billion in 1979. Provisions for doubtful
debts will be maintained at 1.5 of outstanding portfolio.  In addition,
reserves will amount to 6.9% and 7.1% ol outstanding portfolio as of end
1977 and 1979 respectively. The ratio of total long-term debt to equity
is projected to range between 6.1:1 in 197h and 6.7:1 in 1979, as the
planned share capital increases of 1976 and 1978 alternate with the bonds
issues of 1977 and 1979. The debt/equity ratio, as defined in the Bank
Loan Agreement, while also fluctuating, will increase from 4.8:1 in 1974
to 6.0:1 in 1979, as the portion of the Government subordinated loan con-
sidered as equity gradually declines.
3.     Projected income statements for the 1975-1979 period are given in
Table 3. KDFC's profits after tax are expected to grow from W912 million
in 1974 to W2,118 million in 1979. Net profits as a percentage of paid-in
capital will remain fairly steady at around 27.5% while return on equity
will decline slightly from 15.0% in 1974 to 14.3% in 1979. This return
would still be adequate to enable KDFC to meet its financial objectives.
The slight decline reflects the proposed increases in share capital and
assumed diminishing spreads on local and foreign currency loans. While the
lending rates for won and foreign exchange funds are expected to remain
unchanged throughout. the forecast period at 15.5% and 11% respectively, the
projected increase in the cost of term resources will reduce profit before
provisions and tax as a percentage of average total assets from 3.7% in 1974
to 2.6% in 1979. KDFC plans to declare a cash dividend of 10% per annum out
of the 1975, 1977 and 1979 earnings along with a 10% stock dividend, as it
has done in the past. For 1976 and 1978,however, only a cash dividend at
15% of par value is planned. As a result, the cash dividend pay-out ratio
will range from 32.9% in 197h to a, high of 45.9% in 1978 and then decline
to 33% in 1979.
9.    Projected cash flow statements for the years l975-79 are given in
Table 4.  Debt ser'rice cover is expected to decline only marginally rom
1.3 in 1974 to 1.2 in 1979. This is acceptable, for although foreign
currency repayments will just about equal collections, won collections will
always substantially exceed repayments on the Government loan (which begins
in 1977) and on the proposed bond issue. As an illustration, average
annual won collections are estimated to be W1,607 million, over the 1975-79
period, against average annual repayments of W223 million, starting in 1977.
10.     On the whole, KDFC s financial performance and position is expected
to remain satisfactory over the next few years. Profitability, although
slightly declining, is likely to remain adequate. Its liquidity, debt/equity
ratio and debt service capacity would remain sound, and accumulated pro-
visions more than sufficient to cover possible losses.

KDFC's Influence in Improving Pro.ject Design: a Selection of Cases
To illustrate the role that KDFC plays in shaping the design of
projects submitted to it for financial assistance, this annex presents
a selection of cases in which KDFC's suggested modifications were imple-
mented.
1.   Sam Heung Raw Silk Company. Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The initial proposal called for the establishment of a silk reeling
plant with an annual capacity of 180 MT, in which 12 sets of automatic
reeling machines were to be installed. Total capital cost of the project
was estimated at US$ 450,000 in foreign exchange and W189,315 thousand in
domestic currency (US$ 610,693 equivalent at the mid 1970 rate); KDFGS
was requested to finance the full foreign exchange cost.
B. KDFC Is Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that only 6 sets of automatic reeling machines be installed,
compared to the 12 originally planned; in addition, KDFC recommended adding
locally produced multiple-ends reeling machines to the list of equipment to be
procured under the project. Thus, KDFC's financing was revised to US$ 291,646
in foreign exchange and W50,000 thousand (US$ 161,295 equivalent) in local
currency.
C. Reasons for Modification
The major related factors, as seen by KDFC, were that:
(1) The plant could achieve full capacity production of 180 MT per
year with only half the number of imported automatic reeling
machines originally contemplated, provided operations were
carried out on a two-shift basis.
(2) The additional installation of local multiple-ends reeling
machines was required to process low quality cocoons.
(3) There was a need for increased investment in mulberry tree
fields.
These modifications resulted in a reduction in the foreign exchange
cost of the project of US$ 158,354 and in an increase in local currency
capital costs of W63,199 thousand (US$ 203,868 equivalent). An additional
loan of W50,000 thousand was therefore approved on June 30, 1970 by KDFC's
executive committee to finance the increased local currency capital costs.



ANNEX 12

2. Korea Stretch Industrial Co. Ltd.
A.  The Origina1 Pro.ject
The financing proposal was originally submitted by the Suk San Textile
Industrial Company, an affiliate of Korea Nylon Company, and called for the
expansion of its stretch processing capacity from 250,000 lbs. per annum to
677,500 lbs. per annum. Part of the nylon and polyester stretch yarn to be
produced under the project was intended for use in the company's own pro-
duction of nylon socks; the balance of the output was to be sold to other
textile firms.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC recommended the establishment of a new affiliate company, separate
from Suk San Textile, and in charge of all nylon, and polyester stretch yarn
production activities.
C. Reasons for Modification
KDFC evaluated that the project itself had a good prospect of success
since the raw material, filament nylon yarn, was secured from Korea Nylon
Company at a discounted price, and a substantial portion of the output
was to be used to satisfy internal requirements. However, the financial
position of the applicant was not sound enough for it to sponsor the project,
especially in view of the net financial loss it experienced with past
operations.
KDFC explained that it was willing to finance the project provided that
shareholders of the Korea Nylon Company and of Suk San Textile Industrial
Company agreed to set up a new affiliate specialized in the production of
nylon and polyester stretch and to provide this new company with W100 million
in equity. KDFC's proposal was accepted.
3. Oriental Electric Industry Co.. Ltd.
A. The Original Pro.iect
The project consisted of manufacturing electric measuring instruments
and dry batteries.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
To drop electric measuring instruments from the proposed product line.
C. Reasons for Modification
(1)  KDFC did not believe that the applicant had the required
expertise and capability to manufacture sophisticated
electric measuring equipment.
(2) The market prospects for this type of product were
uncertain.

4. Shinsung Textile Company.Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The project proposal called for the installation of 144 sets of looms
for the manufacture of synthetic fabrics.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
To reduce the number of sets of looms to 94.
C. Reasons for Modification
The proposed installation of 144 sets of looms would have resulted in
an output, at full capacity, that was beyond the applicant's export capab-
ility.
5. Pacific Chemical Industrial Co.. Ltd.
A. The Original Project
Installation of imported blow molding equipment worth US$ 300,000,
with a rated capacity of 152 MT per year, to be financed by the proposed
loan.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
To reduce the blow molding capacity to 76 MT per year, with, as a
result, a reduction in the proposed loan amount to US$ 185,000.
C. Reasons for Modification
The reduction of the blow molding capacity was suggested by KDFC so
that the project's size be in line with the applicant's plastic bottle
requirements, estimated on the basis of projected sales volume of cosmetics.
6. International Industrial Co.. Ltd.
A. The Original Proiect
The purpose of the project was to allow the applicant to enter into
the fishery business.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
Establishment of a separate entity to carry out the project.
C. Reasons for Modification
Since the applicant was a construction firm primarily engaged in
construction, shipbuilding and civil works, it was believed that the
establishment of a new company to specialize in deep-sea fishing was
desirable to ensure efficient operation of the project.

Reasons for Modifications
(1) The cost of the equipment for the applicant's original
project was substantially higher than that of the revised
-   project although the production capacity was not sig-
nificantly different.
(2) The originally proposed manufacturing process required
sophisticated technology while direct production cost is
about the same in both cases and the revised project is
more labor intensive.

8. Hai-Tai Confectionery Company Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The proposal was to establish an orange juice bottling and canning
plant to produce natural orange juice from imported concentrated orange
juice supplied by Sunkist Growers, Inc., of the USA.
B. KDFCIs Suggested Modification
(1)  While the Hai-Tai Confectionery Company had in mind to even-
tually produce orange juice concentrates from Korean mandarin
oranges that would be blended with the Sunkist concentrates,
KDFC strongly recommended that the Company proceed to establish
the orange juice concentrate plant by 1976 and imposed a
special condition to that effect, that was included in the
loan agreement.
(2) KDFC also recommended that loans outstanding of W998 million
made by shareholders to the Company be converted into share
capital, and that the share capital be further increased by
W500 million.
C. Reasons for Modification
(1) The establishment of an orange juice concentrate plant would
provide an outlet for Korean mandarin oranges expected to be
in surplus from 1976 on, thereby contributing to increase
farmerst income.
(2) The Company's finaneial structure needed strengthening, as
it had deteriorated following large capital expenditures made
to acquire related companies..
9. Kimpo Ceramics Co.. Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The local currency cost of the project was to be financed by W300
million in equity, W100 million from the KDFC loan and W611 million in
loans from other banks.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the share capital be increased to W40o million
and that its proposed W100 million loan financing be replaced by a sub-
scription of convertible debentures.
C. Reasons for Modification
There was a need to strengthen the applicant's equity position and
financial structure.

10. Pacific Shinping Co.. Ltd.
A.  The Original Project
The Company wanted to divest itself from its existing 29 year old vessel
and purchAse a new one, the project vessel.
B. KDFC_s Suggested Modification
KDJC recommended that:
(1)  In addition to the purchase of the project vessel, the
applicant charter a second vessel.
(2)  The share capital of the Company be increased by W150
million.
C. Reasons for Modification
With only one ship available, KDFC did not believe that the applicant
was able to operate efficiently and profitably.

KOREA
KOREA DEVEIOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Summary Description of Korea Investment and Finance Corporation
1.        Background and Objectives. KIFC was established in June 1971,
largely under the sponsorship of KDFC, as a combined money market/
investment banking type financial intermediary, the concept of which followed
from the findings and recommendations based on studies of the Korean
financial sector undertaken by KDFC, US5ID, Bank Group staff and private
consultants. KIFO was the first institution of its kind to be established
in Korea, at a time when due to the existing financial environment the
unorganized money market or 'curb' market was flourishing. At that time
the 'curb' market was providing short-term financing to an important
segment of local industry at excessively high interest rates (up to 6.5%
per month) using unstandardized and often unreliable credit instruments.
The funds were not always channelled into economically productive uses,
and the financial position of many business enterprises was vulnerable
on account of high cost borrowing from this market. The main objective
was to assist the development of effectively organized private money and
capital markets in Korea by creating a specialized private institution
dealing in short-term credit instruments of all kinds, underwriting and
distributing corporate securities, and providing financial planning and
portfolio management services. KIFC became the first institution to
operate under the Short-Term Financing Business Law which came into force
in September 1972. One measure of KIC's success has been the subsequent
establishment of nine new short-term financing companies in 1973 and 1974.
All of these companies were patterned largely after KIFC. The ten companies
had discounted notes outstanding totalling W173,327 million as of December 31,
1974.
2.        Ownership and Management. KIFC's paid-in capital was increased
by W700 million to W2 billion in September 1974, 60% of which is owned by local
investors including 22% by KMDF, and 40% by foreign investors including 20% by IFC.
MrF. C.H. Kim, President of ILreO, has been Chairman of the Board of Directors
since KIFC's inception. The President of KlFC, Mr. B. J. Lee, was formerly
Senior Vice-President of KDFC prior to his appointment in August 1973
following the death of the previous President, Mr. M. J. Choi. Another former
senior staff member from KDFC is now KIFC's Vice-President.
3.        Operations. KIFC's money market activities have expanded very
rapidly along with the growth of the commercial paper market in Korea. KIFC's
discounted notes outstanding amounted to W25,169 million at the end of 1974,
a growth of 61% over year-end 1973 (KIFC's first full year of operations).
Outstanding notes sold totalled W22,663 million, of which 78% was KIFC paper,
representing an increase of 62% over December 31, 1973. The total size of the
commercial paper market, in terms of discounted notes outstanding at the end
of the year for the ten short-term financing companies, increased by 137%
between 1973 and 1974. KIFC's market share fell from 21.3% to 14.5%.



ANNiEX 14
Page 2
4.        While KIFC has been very successful in its money market operations,
it has to date achieved relatively less in the underwriting field. In 1973
it managed three corporate debenture issues involving a total of W950 million
or 27.5% of the corporate debentures issued in Korea in that year. It did
not carry out any share underwriting operation, despite some attempts to do
so, partly because the Government was effectively setting the price of new
issues below market value, and partly because of the lower standards observed
in underwriting by the competition. In 1974 three debenture issues were
managed by KIFC amounting to W1.5 billion or 5.4% of the debentures issued
in that year. KIFC also for the first time participated in the underwriting
of two equity issues of two previously Government-owned enterprises.
5.        Performance.  KIFC's growth and performance have in general been
very satistactory. Total assets of the company increased by 78.5% from
X1l,623 million at the end of 1973 to W20,748 million at the end of 1974.
Profitability (after tax as a percentage of net worth) exceeded 17% in 1973
and increased to 21.2% in 1974. -Summary data on KIFO are shown below.

ANNEX 15
KOR,EA
KOREA DEVELOPPIENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Outline of Development Strateg  for 1976-1977
KDFC will endeavor to enhence both its qualitative and quantitative
contribution to the Korean economy. During the five-year period 1975-1979,
KDFC projects to provide financing to industry for a total amount of W 17 billion
in domestic currency and $229 million in foreign exchange. In parallel with the
expansion of its financing, KDFC will in the two-year period 1975-1976 accelerate
its development activities particularly in the specific areas outlined below.
I.        Project Promotion and Resource Allocation
(1) KDFC will continue and intensify its past policy of establishing
specialized subsidiaries where appropriate to help develop the financial system
in Korea and supplement KDFC's own development banking functions. Following the
promotion and establishment in 1971 of Korea Investment and Finance Corporation
(KIFC), KDFC intends to complete during 1975 the creation of Korea Development
Leasing Corporation (KDLC), with a view to providing an important financial ser-
vice to smail and medium industries.
(2) KDFC intends to work closely with the Korea Institute of Science
and Technology (KIST) for the advancement and exploitation of domestic technol-
ogical inventions and discoveries. With that objective, KDFC will promote and
establish jointly with KIST the Korea Technology Advancenent Corporation (K-TAC).
KDFC expects to provide financial and other assistance to both K-TAC and projects
sponsored by K-TAC.
(3) KDFC will endeavor to assist the industrial machinery and machine
tools industry. It intends to undertake a study of these sectors with a view to
identifying suitable projects for investment.
(4) INFC intends to begin assisting agro-industry, starting with
feasibility studies on viticulture and other agricultural projects.
(5) With the objective of assisting smaller enterprises in backward
areas, KDFC is working on and will accelerate a plan of cooperation (linkage)
with selected regional commercial banks. Under this program KDFC expects to
finance jointly with these banks relatively small projects in less developed
areas, and to help these banks improve their capability for project appraisal
and supervision.-
(6) Additionally, KDFC will endeavor to further enhance its resource
allocation impact by:
a. identifying new industrial activities and investment
opportunities;
b. seeking out and assisting new entrepreneurs and new-
comers to industry;
c.  financing efficient firms with an inadequate equity
base that want to expand their business;

d.  intensifying its efforts at arranging jloint
financing of larger projects with foreign and
dornestic finarncial institutions; and
e.  trying to get involved in projects it finances
at an early stage so as to help imrove project
design.
II.       Resource IMbbilization
(1)  In view of the prevailing interest rate structure, there is a
limit to KDF^'s capacity to mobilize private domestic resources without jeopar-
dizing its financial viability. Nevertheless, KDFC intends to begin tapping
private savings through issuance of bonds in 1977 (or earlier if changes in the
interest rate system permit) with a view to establishing its name in the domestic
capital market and to prepare for future resource mobilization efforts.
(2) -L th a view to reducing its dependence on official sources of
foreign currency funds, KDFC will continue to explore the possibility of borrow-
ing from foreign commercial sources, either directly or through a syndicated
arrangement by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and will try to
achieve that objective as soon as market conditions permit.
III.      Organization
KDZC will continue to strengthen its staff and will adapt its
organization as appropriate to effectively carry out its exDanding activities
including those mentioned in Chapter I above.  Specifically, it will establish
within its organization a separate unit for project identification and promotion.
It will also consider setting up one or more regional offices wJhen warranted by
its operational requirements.
IV.       Review of Strategy
KDYC intends to keep its development strategy under continuing review,
so as to adapt it as necessary to chanzes in government develoorment nolicies and.
to the evolving recuirements of the environment.
