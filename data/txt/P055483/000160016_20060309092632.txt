Project development objective Re$ PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3

The Project development objectives are to help: (i) poverty by supportingthe workfare component
                                                       reduce
o f the Heads o f Household Program, including continued improvements inProgram management and
governance; and (ii)   promote activities aimed at getting more beneficiaries o f this Program into full-time
employment, thereby enablingthem to graduate from the Program. Activities to promote labor market
participation by beneficiarieswould include: (i)    workfare sub-projects designed especially to promote
employability, for example, by combining them with training, skill certification, and targets for job
placement; (ii)  support for productive micro-projects; and (iii) establishment and support to municipal
                                                                    the
offices o f employment services.

Project description Re$ PAD B.3, Technical Annex 5

There are four Project components. Component A (the largest) would cover continued financing of the
transfer payment to those beneficiaries o f the Heads o fHouseholdProgram complying with the
requirement to participate inworkfare or training/education activities. Support would also be provided to
assist the Ministry o f Labor to reorient these activities so that they contribute more to improving the
employment prospects o f beneficiaries. Component B would support the provision o f grants for
productive sub-projects proposed by small groups of Programparticipants. Component C would cover
the activities related to the establishment and strengthening o f employment services insome
municipalities and the testing o f instruments to facilitate the labor market insertion o f Program
beneficiaries. Component D would support governance improvements inthe Program, as well as Project
management and monitoring and evaluation.

Component A: Heads of Household Program Sub-projects (Community Services and Works, Training,
and Basic Education) (US$2,199 million inProgram costs; US320.75 million inloan financing).
An important aim of the Heads of HouseholdTransition Strategy is to increase the number o fparticipants
who improve their employability by completing basic education, participating intraining courses,
combining the work requirement with on-the-job training, and participating in sub-projects designed to
provide experience and skills for future jobs. Inareas where employment offices exist (Component C),
beneficiaries would be referred to these activities by those staff in order to promote participation by those
most likely to benefit.  After the activity finishes, beneficiaries would be required to actively search for a
job, assisted and supervised by the local employment office.

Component B: Heads of HouseholdProductive Sub-projects ( U S 2 3 million inProject costs; U S 2 2
million inloan financing).
Support would be provided to small groups of beneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household Programto finance

the cost o f tools, equipment and inputs for productive activities. The beneficiaries would continue to
receive the monthly stipend from the Programduringthe implementation o f these sub-projects.

Component C: Employment Services (US4.2 million inProject costs; US$4 millioninloan financing).
The proposedloan would support the establishment o f offices o f employment services in some
municipalities and the testing o f instruments. It i s recognized that given the resources and time available
inthisproject, the Ministrywill only beable to make a start ininstallingcapacity andensuring minimum
employment services. It i s expectedthat at least 100 municipal employment offices could be supported.

Component D: Governance Improvements and Monitoring & Evaluation (US$2.7 million in Project
costs, US$1.5 million in loan financing). Further improvements in governance o f the Heads o f Household
Program would be made through this component by supporting (i)an expanded continuous audit o f the
Program (payment system and municipal spot checks o f municipal management o f the Program); (ii)
improvements in the registry, including additional database cross-checks; (iii)          enhanced monitoring
activities; (iv) an information and communication campaign; (v) various stakeholder activities to consult,
provide information and promote participation o f local organizations (non-governmental organizations,
unions, business groups, private companies, professional training centers); and (vi) impact evaluations of
specific Project activities. The Project ExecutingUnitwould handle the day-to-day activities o f managing
procurement, hiring consultants, and financial management, including the preparation o f Financial
Management Reports, prepare the documentation needed for reimbursement requests, and ensure
compliance with audit requirements. This component would also support a series of activities planned by
the Ministry o f Labor which aim at supporting small and medium-sized businesses to meet existing
regulations concerning labor and social security contributions in order to improve both level and quality
ofcompliance o f these enterprises.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

 1.        The proposed Heads of HouseholdTransition Project supports the implementation by the
Government o f Argentina o f a transition strategy for the Heads o fHousehold Program focused
on activities to improveemployment prospects andjob placement for participants, and continued
strengtheningo f Program management and governance. The Government set the Program up
quickly in2002 inresponse to a sharp increase inpoverty and the Programwas effective in
mitigating the impact of the crisis and reaching the poor. The Bank supported the Program
through the Heads of HouseholdProject (Ln7157-AR), approved by the Board o fDirectors on
January 28,2003.' Program enrollment has shrunk by 30 percent since mid-2003. This decline
i s expected to continue during implementation o f the transition strategy as some participants
transfer to a more appropriate program and beneficiariesreceive help findingjobs.

2.         This section (i)     reviews the economic and social situation and performance o f the Heads
of Household Program, as well as the Bank loan supporting it; (ii)                 outlines the transition strategy;
and (iii)    explains the links to the strategic objectives o f the Country Assistance Strategy.

 1.        Economicand Social Context

3.         Argentina i s rapidly recovering from the deep economic crisis o f 2001-2002. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) shrunk by a cumulative 20 percent during a four year period, 11
percent in2002 alone (Figure 1). The social impact o f the crisis was enormous and poverty
increased dramatically (Figure 2). According to official statistics', the share o fpoor grew to
nearly 60 percent o f the population, rising between 2000 and 2002 from 12 to 22 million. The
number o fextreme poor nearly doubled to 10.4 million, about 30 percent o fthe population.
4.         Economic growth averaged9 percent during 2003-2005, resulting ina recovery o f GDP
to its pre-crisis peak o f 1998. The recovery was ledby strong export earnings, increasing
investmentlevels and further aided by renewedconsumer confidence. Prudentmacro-economic
policies were key inthe recovery, especially fiscal policies that produced primary surpluses in

first halfof 2005, it i s still considerably above the pre-crisis level o f 30 percent. Insum, strong
economic growth has improvedjob creation and social conditions but much remains to be done
to help those who have yet to benefit from the economic and social recovery.

2.1.      ProgramDescription

7.        Principle Response to Social Crisis. At the height o f the economic crisis inApril 2002,
the Government created an emergency safety net, the Heads o f Household Program. The
Government designed, initiated and scaled-up the Program very quickly. The Program
transferred AR$150 (currently the equivalent o fUS$50) per month to participants. The Program
set four eligibility criteria for participation. The beneficiaries were to:
     0       be unemployed;


beneficiaries who are both in a workfare activity and looking for ajob (definition A). The lowest line considers all
beneficiaries inworkfare activities as employed. The definition (A) i s preferred.

    0      be the head o f a household;
    0      live in a householdwith at least one minor below the age o f 18, or pregnant woman, or
           handicapped o f any age;
    0      work or participate intraining/educationactivities for 4-6 hours a day inexchange for
           the payment.4

8.      Organization o f Program. Responsibilities for the Programwere shared. The national
Government decided on the basic design, with an emergency presidential decree establishing the
Program and its legal framework. The Ministryo f Labor handled the implementation and
oversight of the Program, including issuingthe regulations on specific operating procedures and
supervisingits activities. Municipalities were responsible for enrolling beneficiaries, collecting
the documentation needed to prove eligibility and organizing the workfare activities. Ifnot able
to enroll at the municipality, beneficiaries could enroll inother offices authorized for that
purpose, including provincial offices o fthe Ministryo f Labor. While the majority o f
beneficiaries enrolledinthe municipality, beneficiaries were also able to enroll through civil
society organizations, including organizations o fthe unemployed as well as unions and church
groups. A national consultative council was established and the Program required the
establishment o f municipal consultative councils comprising the mayor, as well as
representatives o f several groups (public service providers, workers, businesses, churches, and
civil society organizations).

9.      The local councils were to beresponsible for approving workfare activities, providing
information and resolving conflicts regarding beneficiary registration and taking the appropriate
action ifbeneficiaries did not meet eligibility criteria. By the end o f 2002, a large number of
consultative councils had been formed and overall 70 percent o f their members representedcivil
society organizations. Most observers agree that consultative councils made a positive
contribution to the implementation o fthe Program, particularly in2002 at the height o f the social
crisis and distrust o f government. At the same time, the problems o f overlapping responsibilities
(with municipal governments, especially), lack o fresources, and limitations ontheir influence in
practice, resultedinhighly varied experience among municipalities and overall incomplete
fulfillment o fthe major role envisaged for them. Moreover, as the Program has declinedin
importance and public institutions have taken over more o f the day-to-day activities, the role of
the consultative councils has tended to decline. Annex 1contains more details on the
distribution o f responsibilities inthe Program.

10.     Enrollment Trends. As a result o f the economic recovery and the better governance
structure of the Program, enrollment has steadily declined and reached 1.42 million as o f January
2006. This decline represents about 30 percent reduction from its peak level inMay 2003 when
the Program hadclose to 2 millionparticipants, having reached 10millionpeople including
family members.

 2.2.     PovertyImpactof Program

 11.      Overall, the Heads o f HouseholdProgramwas successful inreaching the poor and
 mitigatingthe impact ofthe social and economic crisis. Since 2002, the Bank accompanied
 Government implementation o f the Program with analytical studies o f its poverty and inequality
 impact. Incidencedata shows that the Programhas good targeting performance (Figure 5)5. The
 share o f Program participants among the 40 percent better-off households inArgentina was 6
 percent in2005 while the share o fProgrambenefits going to the bottom two quintiles was 80
 percent, Given the good targeting Performance, the Heads o f HouseholdProgram was
 instrumental intilting the overall economic growth period from 2002 to 2003 ina pro-poor way
 (see Box 1).

   Figure 5 shows gross incidence data only, not taking into account the foregone income of households that receive
 the benefit (as work income from other, informal, sources o f the family might have been reduced). Net incidence
 analysis, however, shows an equally good targeting record of the program in2002 and 2003 (see Annex 1).

                        Box 1: The DistributiveImpact of the Heads of HouseholdProgram

Inadditionto the goodtargeting o fthe incometransfer, the Heads ofHousehold Programwas instrumental in
making the early economic recovery phase pro-poor - Le., due to the Program, income inequality decreased
somewhat between M a y 2002 and M a y 2003 while growth recovered. Box Figure lshows the distributive impact of
the Programby examining growth incidence curves. Growth incidence curves map real income changes between
two years over the different percentiles o fthe entire income distribution. Figure 1 shows growth incidence curves
for the 2002  -2003 period.6 The vertical axis represents the growth rate inhousehold incomes between 2002 and
2003, while the horizontal axis represents the percentiles o f the distribution o f income. Two different income
measures were employed. The lower curve i s based on total per capita household income excluding government
transfers from the Heads of Household Program, while the upper curve uses total per capita income.

Using the total per capita household income excluding government transfers, the curve shows that 2002 - 2003
period was characterized by negative growth rates across the entire distribution (-9 percent). However, whenHeads
of Household transfers are taken into account and the total per capita household income i s considered, the growth
incidence curve acquires a downward slope, with positive growth rates at the lower percentiles o f the income
distributionbut negative growth rates at the middle and upper percentiles. The downward-sloping curve and positive
growth rates at the l o w percentiles suggest that the Heads of Household Program was instrumental intilting the
overall distribution o f income changes at the beginning o f the recovery phase in a pro-poor way.

2.3.    ProgramImplementationShortcomings

13,     With the normalization o f the overall economic and social situation, the Government has
decided to reorient the Heads o f HouseholdProgram. The strategy i s to distinguish among the
current Program beneficiaries those that have higher re-employment chances from those that at
least currently require a different type o f longer-term safety net, linkedto building human capital
for children. The strategy i s transitional as it aims to support and test several approaches to raise
beneficiaries' employment prospects, and to facilitate the transfer o f other participants to another
social safety net program. Before analyzing this transition strategy, this section describes the
shortcomings o f Program implementation.

14.     While the Heads o fHouseholdProgram was successful inachieving its poverty reduction
objective, it suffered from shortcomings intwo areas:

e       conduct and transparency o f the registrationprocess; and
e       enforcement o f some o f the eligibility criteria for Program participants, especially that
        they be unemployed, be a head o f a household, and fulfill the work requirement.

15.     RegistrationProcess and its Impact on Program Governance. The Government started
the Program inthe midst o f the economic crisis and as a rapid response to a possible social
collapse in2002, when 10 million people fell suddenly into poverty. The need for rapid scale-up
implied that the Government also relied on outside support in order to reach as many people as
possible.

16.     The high speed o f enrollment and early implementation, while understandable under the
very difficult circumstances the country faced in2002, had an important impact on the
authorizing environment and accountability and control mechanisms. First, the tumultuous
overall political and social situation made it difficult inmany places to enroll people in an
orderly fashion. Second, there was much confusion on the design o f the Program, eligibility
criteria and the enforcement o f the work requirement. In part, this reflected the various previous
promises but was also a result o f ambiguities inthe language o f the decree itself. Third, many
municipalities were not adequately prepared to administer such a large Program and organization
of workfare activities proved extremely difficult.

17.     Also, in some localities, there were reports o fpolitical interests or individuals intervening
inthe process of registeringbeneficiaries for the overall Program. For example, groups o fthe
unemployed, piquetero organizations, registered beneficiaries directly with the Ministry o f Labor
instead of going through the municipality. This practice was not illegal as the original law
establishing the Heads o f Household Program allowed for civil society organizations to enroll
beneficiaries directly given the extent o f the crisis and the need to rapidly register the poor to

start the monetary transfer. Some groups, including, for example, unions and religious
organizations, madeuse o f this possibility. Also, beneficiary numbers increased significantly in
several municipalities before the presidential elections o f 2003, betweenJanuary and May, after
Government officials had declared that registration was closed as o f end-May 2002, although this
declaration had no formal legal basis. A subsequent Bank investigation examined some o f these
reports (see Box 2, after para 26).

18.       Since i t came to power inMay 2003, the Government o fPresident Kirchner has acted
with determination to deal with irregularities inthe administration ofthe Program andto
establish stricter supervision, complaint and auditing requirementso f municipal implementation
of the Program (see below paras 21-22 and Annex 1).

19.       Enforcement o f Eligibility Criteria. Another shortcoming has been that some o f the
originally specified eligibility criteria proved impossible to enforce. Restricting the Program to
only heads o f household has been very difficult, as the procedures relied on the participants' self-
reporting. It also has not beenpossible to exclude from the Program workers withjobs inthe
informal labor market (about halfo f Argentina's total employment). Cross-checks applied inthe
Heads o f Household Program only cover workers who contribute to social security. However,
the difficulties inenforcing these two eligibility criteria did not adversely affect the performance
of the Program inreaching or targeting the poor (see paras 11-12 above).

20.       Further,participation inworkfare activities neverreachedthe target o f90 percent o f
beneficiaries and the Program's originally specified workfare character has been eroding over
time. Participation inworkfare activities has declined from 70 percent in2003 to 55 percent
during the first halfo f 2005.' This reflects the increased "pull" to other part-time employment
due to economic recovery, and the difficulties o f a number o f municipalities to enforce the
requirement (see Annex 1for more detail). Through November 2005, municipalities requested
that 28,000 beneficiaries be dropped from the Program for not working.

2.4.      GovernmentResponse to Shortcomings

21.       The Bank had identifiedthe above difficulties and the proposed mitigating measures
when the original Project supporting the Heads o f Household Program (LnNo. 7157-AR) was
prepared.'' With active Bank support, Government has made significant improvements in
Program oversight since the Government o f President Kirchner took office inMay 2003,
consequently addressing supervision shortcomings and strengthening the transparency o f
Program management and strengtheningdue diligence. These actions have reduced errors in
implementation, which affect most large social assistance programs worldwide.l1



  The figure of 55 percent does not adjust for those participants that have beenformally exempted from the workfare
requirement (pregnant women, handicapped, elderly). Adjustingfor this group would bringoverall compliance to
58 percent.

`IIn the US FoodStamp Program, a quality review showed mistakes in 8 percent o f payments made during 1999-
2003. Estimated fraud in Canadian incomesecurity programs represented4 percent o fpayments, while client
error accounted for 5 percent. Inthe UK,for Income Support and Job Seeker's Allowances, the share o f losses
due to fraud or administrative error dropped from 10percent in September 1998 to 7 percent inNovember 2002.

22.      Government measures included the following:

         Closure of registration of new beneficiaries inMay 2003 and no new beneficiaries have
         been added since then.
         Expansion and systematic use of internal consistency and database cross-checks to
         confirm available beneficiary information and the continued eligibility o f participants.
         Enhanced supervision of municipalities with improved methodology o f checking files
         (random sampling with lists provided centrally to supervisors). Government also took
         action more quickly and often when irregularities were identified. In2005, staff o f the
         Ministryo fLabor visited 1387municipalities, accounting for halfo f allbeneficiaries in
         the Program. On average, the results o fthe supervision indicated incomplete
         documentation in about a quarter o f beneficiary files, meaning that the file was not
         available inthe municipality or did not contain proof o f eligibility. Through January
         2006, 60,000'2 beneficiarieshave beendropped from the Program because o f errors
         discovered during supervision.
         Improved handling of fraud accusations. Follow-up on allegations is better because o f a
         more systematic referral system to the prosecutor's office inthe Social Security
         Administration (WISES). Between June 2003 and January 2006, the Commission for
         Treatment o f Allegations o f Employment Programs (CODEM) o f the Ministry o f Labor
         received 22,000 allegations concerning the Heads o f Household Program. Duringthis
         same period about 13,000'3 beneficiaries were dropped by CODEM as a result o f its
         work, mostly either for not fulfilling the work requirement or for not having dependent
         minors.
         Action to drop ineligible beneficiaries. Inall, since mid-2003, beneficiary numbershave
         declined by about 600,000'4 o f which about half i s due to the various actions describe
         above to identify and drop ineligible beneficiaries. The rest o f the decline i s explainedby
         those beneficiaries who found employment or voluntarily left the Program.
         Improved transparency of Program implementation. Public access to micro-datawas
         improved as the management information system i s accessible on the internet to
         beneficiaries as well as local authorities, providing data on names, ID numbers, payment
         history, reasons for being dropped from the Program, assignment to workfare activity,
         etc. Inaddition, more general information i s available on the Ministryo f Labor webpage.
         Enhanced beneficiary support. In2004, the Government started to switch the payment
         system from monthly checks to bank debit cards. All beneficiaries now are paid through
         bank debit cards, except those livinginisolated areas (less than 10percent). This has
         tangible benefits for participants as it eliminated waiting time to receive payment and
         they can use the debit cards for payments invarious installments. Further,the debit card
         systemappears to have lowered complaints relatedto the payment process, including fees
         to middlemen. Other beneficiary support measures included the introduction o f a
         component o f the Project that supports micro-enterprises as well as expanding the
         opportunities for participants to take training and education courses.

23.     The improvedmanagement and application o f oversight measures as well as the use o f
monitoring instruments have paid off. Slightly over 90 percent o f all beneficiary households
include at least one minor and only 1percent o fbeneficiaries receiving the stipend hold a formal
sector job.

2.5.    Implementationof the BankSupportedHeadsof HouseholdProject

24.     The Bank loan o f US$600 million (Ln7157-AR, FY2003) supported part o f the Heads of
Household Program. The Bank did not support the entire Programbut only the part inwhich
beneficiaries did indeed comply with the workfare requirement. Hence, while the workfare
requirement has been declining slightly inthe overall Program implementation, the Bank's
financial support for the Programhas been directed fully to beneficiaries inworkfare activities.
Also, the loan supported the organization o fworkfare activities by financing the cost o fmaterials
for small infrastructure projects, mainly schools, but also water and health facilities as well as for
the financing o f small productive activities o f groups o f Heads o f Household Program
beneficiaries.

25.     Inaddition to the Program's obligatory database cross-checks, the Government andthe
Bank use two important safeguards to ensure that the utilization o f Bank funds follows adequate
fiduciary standards. The obligatory database cross-checks are designed to preventthose with
formal employment, pensions, or other social transfers from beingpaid. Additionally, since
Project inception, a continuous audit o f the payment systemhas been inplace (ensuringthat the
actual beneficiaries receiving the payments are identical with those on the lists o fbeneficiaries
for whom payments have been authorized). This continuous audit has produced good results,
leading the Auditor General o f Argentina to providethe Project with a timely and unqualified
audit for 2003 and 2004. The 2005 audit i s expected to be receivedby end-June 2006. Further,
the Bank only disbursed90 percent o f claims included inthe list o f authorized and paid workfare
participants, taking into account potential errors inthe supporting information.

                             Box 2: Examination of Enrollment in the Municipality of L a Matanza

          Under the original Project, Bank staff had identified a highrisk o f ineligible participants or activities inthe
run-upto the presidential elections inApril 2003. Inresponse to growing concerns about shortcomings inthe
Ministry of Labor inthe first months o f2003, regional Bank staffrequested additional fiduciary support from
specialized departments from inside the Bank. An investigation o f the enrollment process o f the Program inLa
Mutanza, a large municipality inGreater Buenos Aires, took place inlate 2003. The work focused on the overall
Program, not specifically on the part financed by the Bank.

          Findings included: (i)   claims from a municipal official responsible for the implementationo f the Program
that organized groups o f unemployed, not the municipality, enrolled significant numbers o f beneficiaries inthe
January-May 2003 period; (ii)      that the municipality lacked supporting documentation for those beneficiaries
enrolled by organized groups o f unemployed and, consequently, could not monitor whether these beneficiaries met
the Program's eligibility criteria and/or fulfilled the workfare requirement; (iii) allegations from the municipal
official that half o f the individuals registeredthrough these groups did not meet the eligibility criteria for the
Program, including not fulfilling the work requirement; (iv) that these groups asked some beneficiaries for payment
or to participate indemonstrations inexchange for continued enrollment; and (v) that the operation o f another
program by the Government, not financed by the Bank, caused confusion among beneficiaries and local authorities
on eligibility and other requirements and procedures related to the Heads o f HouseholdProgram. These findings
were shared with the audit committee o fthe Board inMay, 2005.

          The Bank carried out two due diligence activities inresponse to these findings. They included: (i)      a review
o f statement o f expenditures (SOEs) presented to the Bank; and (ii)   visits to other municipalitiesto assess the
accuracy o f the information on workfare inthe management information system (MIS) o f the Ministry o f Labor.
Among the group o f beneficiaries from La Mutanza inthe due diligence analysis, the percentage o f beneficiaries
that were since dropped because o f ineligibility was 8 percent, within the margin o f 10 percent incorporated inthe
initial project designbecause o f the 90% disbursement ratio. Second, the spot checks o f municipalities showed that
the information inthe M I S was accurate as 93 percent o f the beneficiaries identified inthe M I S were working,

          Inaddition, inthe 50municipalities (out o f a total o fabout 2000 municipalities inArgentina) that
experienced significant enrollment increases during the January to M a y 2003 period, the Ministry o f Labor
conducted a review o f 100percent o f files o f current participants who entered the Program inthe months preceding
the M a y 2003 election. The municipalities were identified inan independent review o f the registry data for the
Program, requestedby the Bank. The Ministryreviewed files for nearly 46,000 beneficiaries, about 3 percent of
total current Program enrollment nationwide. About half o f the individuals reviewed inthe special supervision were
registered inthe municipality o f La Mutanza. The review found that for 56 percent o f these beneficiaries inthis
special supervision (representing about 3 percent o f total Programbeneficiaries), files were either incomplete or
missing. Not all o f these individuals were ineligible as some were able subsequently to provide the necessary
documentation.

          Follow-up actions on all these beneficiaries inthis special supervision which focused on the 50
municipalities with significant enrollment increases duringthe January to M a y 2003 period, were completed in
February, 2006, as beneficiaries were either dropped from the Program (77 percent o f those with incomplete or
missing files) or they regularized their files (23 percent).

26.      The share o ftotal Program expenditures financed bythe Bank loan has declined from 24
percent in2002 (through retroactive financing), to 22 percent in2003, and 18 percent in2004
(Figure 6). The share o f financing for 2005 from the ongoing Project is 11eg1igible.l~

2.6      Bank Support

27.      The Bank actively accompanied the Government inthe governance reforms and
implementation o f the Program to date by helping to build capacity and in evaluating the impact
of the Program. The Bank had outlined the practicaldifficulties inorganizing and implementing
the Heads o f Household Program, as well as potential remedies to influence the implementation
process, when presenting the original project to the Board inJanuary 2003. Bank support and
supervision to date include:

     a   Enhanced supervision o f the Project by Bank staff (permanent field presence, frequent
         site visits, spot checks on data reliability inmunicipalities, twice the number o f formal
         supervision mission);
     a   Continuous monitoring o f a host o f Program indicators (size, changes insize - and
         reasons -by municipality, fraud allegations, etc) and feedback to Government o f the
         results (e.g., Government carried out a special supervision o fbeneficiary files, see Box
         2);
     a   Quarterlybi-annual monitoring o fthe overall poverty impact (and compliance with
         eligibility requirements) o fthe Program usingthe independent household survey (see
         results above); and
     a   Implementation o f specific studies on the governance of the Program, involving also
         specialized departments o f the Bank (Box 2).

3.       ReformAgenda: Transition Strategy for the Heads of HouseholdProgram

28.      With the normalization ofthe overall economic and social situation, the Government is
now seekingto intensifyits efforts inreorienting the Heads o f Households Program from its
original emergency nature towards programs that assumes a mediudlong-term role in
Argentina's social protection system. The need for a reorientation i s also exemplified bythe
slowly declining share o fbeneficiaries inworkfare activities as the organization o f long-term,
meaningful public works programs for large numberso fbeneficiaries i s extremely difficult for
many municipalities.

29.      Despite the substantial fall inProgramparticipants over the past years (by 30 percent
since May 2003), such a transition cannot be achieved immediately, but will require time as a
large number o f the current beneficiaries would need to find employment or obtain alternative
support through other programs, including social safety nets or insurance-type mechanisms.



l5Figure 6 also includes potential future Bank contributionto the Program through the proposed Heads o f
HouseholdTransition Project inwhich the financing level would be performance-based and vary with the
percentage o f beneficiaries fulfilling the work requirement or participatingineducatiodtraining. The upper line
assumes a disbursement share o f 60 percent (inthe case that workfare compliance exceeds 65 percent o f Program
participants). The lower line assumes a ratio o f 40 percent (inthe case that workfare compliance i s below 60
percent).

30.     InOctober 2004, the Government decided onatwo-prongedtransition strategy for the
Program to bejointly managed by the ministrieso f Social Development and Labor. The key
underlying strategy is to distinguish among the current Program benejkiaries those that have
higher re-employment chancesfrom those that at least currently require a different type of
longer-term safety net, linked to building human capitalfor children. The strategy i s
`transitional' as it aims to support and test several approaches to raise beneficiaries' employment
prospects, while at the same time facilitating the transfer o f other beneficiaries from the current
Heads o f Household Program to other programs. The main aspects o f the transition strategy are:

      (i)    The Ministry o f Labor would continue to administer the Heads o f Household
             Program, and increase its efforts to help beneficiaries find employment through
              several specific activities, including by completing their education, technical
             training, on-the-job training inspecific sectors, and other individually-oriented
              employment services. The Ministryo f Social Development would continue to play
              a complementary role by promoting small-scale productive activities for groups o f
             Programbeneficiaries, with the aim also to facilitate graduation from the Program.
      (ii)   Participants with two or more children in400 large municipalities would move to
              the Familias conditional cash transfer program managed by the Ministry o f Social
              Development, which aims to prevent the inter-generational transmission o fpoverty
             by linkingthe income transfer to education andhealth investmentsinchildren. Its
              design and objectives are similar to other programs inthe region (Mexico,
              Colombia, and Brazil) for which impact evaluations have shown favorable results.
              InFebruary2006, the Government announced increases inthe stipendso that
              families with 3 children would receive AR$200, and those with 4 or more children
              would receive up to AR$250. InOctober 2005, the Inter-American Development
              Bank (IDB) approved a US$700 million loan to finance the expansion and
              implementation o fFamilias.

31.      On February 13,2006, the Government announced further measures inthe transition
strategy though the plannedcreation o f a non-contributory Seguro de Capacitaci'on y Empleo
(SCE, Training and Employment Insurance) program. The legal framework andregulations are
yet to be issued, but some design features were disclosed. Initially, the insurance would only be
available to current Heads o f Household Programbeneficiaries who could voluntarily opt to pass
to the new program. The new insurance would include a higher stipend (AR$225),but time-
bound (2 years), and requirethe signing o f a personal agreement stipulating specific conditions
under which the stipendcould be maintained (regular contact with municipal employment
offices; mandatoryjob search; participation intraining, education courses, labor orientation;
obligation to accept qualifiedjob offers, etc.) The planned training and employment insurance is
consistent with the previously developed transition strategy for the Heads o f Household Program
towards employability and the activities supported under the proposed Project. Plans are to start
inApril 2006 inabout 10municipalities with a gradual expansionthereafter. Those remaining in
the Heads o f HouseholdProgram (Le. those not transferring to either Familias or the new
Training and Employment Insurance, or leaving the Program because they find employment or
are dropped for other reasons), would continue to be paidthe AR$150 stipend.

32.      The proposed Heads o fHouseholdTransition Project would support several key
components o f the transition strategy. Specifically, it would support:


                                                   13

     0   Continued funding o f Heads o f Householdtransfer payments o fworkfare participants
         duringthe transition phase. Workfare activities would also include new, pro-employment
         oriented fulfillment o f the work requirement. The Bank has agreed with Government on
         an overall, projected decline inbeneficiary numbersover time (para 79);
     0   The Ministry o f Social Development to promote small-scale productive activities by
         groups o f beneficiaries through the provision o f grants;
     0   The Ministryo f Labor indeveloping employment services and other activities intendedto
         help morebeneficiaries find employment; and
     0   Continued control and governance improvements inthe Program.

33.      Over the next two years, the social policy dialogue betweenGovernment and the Bank
will not only include reviews o fprogress on the transition strategy, including the recently
announced Training and Employment Insurance, but also on how this transition will feed into the
longer-term development o f Argentine social policy.

34.      The Government recognizes that formulation o f a medium-to longer-run social protection
strategy will evolve gradually. The proposedProject to support the transition strategy for the
Heads o f HouseholdProgram i s intendedto help insuch a designby testing and evaluating
several strategies to move from emergency to sustainable programs that promote social and
human development, including through higher levels o f labor market participation, especially for
the poor. The plannedanalytical work accompanyingthe proposed Project would help to inform
the policy debate. The Bank and the Government also have agreed to undertake ajoint
Development PolicyReview on social policy options and the future o f social assistance
programs. This Development Policy Reviewwould include intensive consultations with
stakeholders from provincial and municipal governments, consultative councils as well as
beneficiaries and civil society organizations.

4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement and Link to CAS

35.      The Bank has supported workfare programs inArgentina since 1995 and worked closely
with the Government inthe social sectors for two decades. As outlined above, the Bank assisted
Government's crisis response by financing the workfare part o f the Heads o fHousehold
Program, promoted governance and management reforms inthe Program, and helpedto evaluate
its impact. The Bank has collaborated for many years with the Ministry o f Labor, in capacity-
buildingand implementationo faprevious workfare program (Trabajar). Inother regions, for
example Eastern Europe, the Bank has financed assistance to the unemployed, including by
strengthening labor intermediationservices. The proposed loan would complement the activities
o f the IDB. Both Banks would continue to discuss futurepolicies and programs insocial
protection with the Government as it i s able to reduce its focus on emergency programs.

36.      The proposedProject would support the CAS overall objective o fhelpingreduce the
extent and severity o fpoverty inArgentina and, specifically, it supports the CAS pillar o f social
inclusion. The most recent CAS (Report 27340 dated January 29,2004, and Supplemental Note
dated April 5,2004 - Date o f Board Discussion April 15,2004) highlights the needto redirect
the emergency programs, such as the Heads o fHousehold Program, to serve the mediumand
longer-term development agenda, including higher employment levels. Emergency programs,


                                                  14

while critically important incalming social tensions duringthe crisis, had-by nature -a short-
term vision and what i s now needed i s a transition to a new medium-to longer-term program,
integrated into the social policy framework o fthe country. The transition i s closely linked to the
Bank's role in dealing with medium-termchallenges and promoting more equity in opportunities
for those who have yet to benefit from the economic recovery.

37.       Partnership with Government has been a very positive feature inProgram implementation
o f the current CAS. The Bank has had an active dialogue with Government on social policy in
general and on the social assistanceprograms inparticular. Further, the Bank has been able to
share best practices inimproving governance and control systems o f such large social assistance
programs from other LatinAmerican countries.

B.         PROJECT DESCFUPTION

1.         LendingInstrument

38.        The lending instrument is a specific investment loan. The Bank may support workfare
programs, or conditional transfers, through either investment loans or by including them as part
o f a program underpinning a policy-based lendingoperation, and both these instruments are
beingusedinthe LatinAmerica Region. As inthe previous Heads o f Household Project, an
investmentloan is chosen for two reasons: (i) importanceo f strengthening counterpart
                                                          the
institutions and Program implementation, inaddition to the transfer o f resources; and (ii)                 a strong
emphasis on oversight, including fiduciary safeguards.

39.        Different from the ongoing project, the proposed Project is performance-based. Itwould
disburse funds according to a built-inmechanism that wouldpace disbursementsin-linewith the
numbero fbeneficiaries that participate ineither awork or educatiodtraining orjob-search
activity. This reflects the importance the Bank attaches to the work requirement and provides an
incentive to the Government to continue efforts to improve the Program on a variety o f fionts
including enforcing controls over eligibility requirements, promoting the timely transfer o f
eligible beneficiaries to Familias, and expanding employment support activities, particularly
education and training, andpromoting the participation o f Heads o f Household beneficiaries.

40.        According to the agreed upon disbursement mechanism, Bank financing as a share o f
overall Program expenditures could vary.l6As outlined above, the share o f Bank financing
through the current project inoverall Program expenditureshas declined since its start (from 24
percent in2002 to 18 percent in2004). Under the proposed Project, Bank financing during
2006-7 would range between 13 and 22 percent o ftotal spendingdepending on the share o f
participants inworkfare and education and training activities (see Figure 6, after para. 25).




l6Upon effectiveness o f the proposed Project, the Bank would use a disbursement ratio o f 40 percent o f the amount
o f the transfer to beneficiaries that are complying with the workfare requirement. The disbursement rate would (i)
increase to 55 percent ifthe combined share o f beneficiaries inactivities inwhich they work more than 15 hours and
those in education and training activities reaches 60 percent; and (ii)increase to 60 percent if the combined
compliance exceeds 65 percent. The calculation o f compliance with the work (or educatiodtraining requirement) i s
based o n the results from the Permanent Household Survey, plus administrative data covering professional training
activities that are not captured by the survey.


                                                            15

41.      As the proposedProject is intendedto support Government inits transition strategy for
the Heads o fHousehold Program, rather than to support a medium-to-longer-tern socialpolicy,
it would only have a life o f about two years duringwhich the Government and the Bank would
evaluate experience and progress inorder to identify the lessons for future interventions.

2.       ProjectDevelopmentObjective and Key Indicators

42.      The Project development objectives are to help: (i) poverty by supporting the
                                                                         reduce
workfare component o f the Heads o fHousehold Program, including continued improvements in
Program management and governance; and (ii)               promote activities aimed at getting more
beneficiaries o f this Program into full-timeemployment, thereby enabling them to graduate from
the Program. Activities to promote labor market participation by beneficiaries would include:
(i)workfare sub-projects designedespecially to promote employability, for example, by
combining them with training, skill certification, and targets for job placement; (ii)                  support for
productive micro-projects; and (iii)         the establishment and support to municipal offices o f
employment services.

43.      Key performance indicators are listed below. They take into account the expected short
duration of the Project (less than two years) before which time it will not be possible to establish
enough capacity for either employment services or other activities to promote labor insertion for
all beneficiaries remaining inthe Heads o f HouseholdProgram. The Bank will post selected
monitoring indicators on the World Bank web site inArgentina on a monthly basis.

44.      Outcome Indicators (targets set for December 2007, the closing date):17

                   Share o fparticipants inlower halfo f income distribution rising from 88 to 92
                   percent";

                   No less than 20 percent o f those Heads o f Household beneficiariesparticipating
                   either inworkfare activities designedto facilitate employment or training courses,
                   placed injobs;

                   No less than 20 percent o fbeneficiaries o f grants for productive projects engaged
                   inactivities generating income at least equal to AR$150/mo after 18months o f
                   operation; and

                   No less than 100,000 (current or newly) ineligible participants dropped from
                   Heads o f Household Program.          19




  All outcome and intermediate results indicators are net o f expected transfer ofbeneficiaries to the Familias
Program.
  Usingdata from PermanentHousehold Survey calculated for individuals post-programpayment.
l9This figure includes remaining, albeit small, errors ineligibility, but also new ineligibility during 2006-2007 (e.g.,
beneficiaries to comply with the work requirement, their child exceeds the eligible age, results o f follow-up on new
fraud allegations, results o f cross-checks with more databases).


                                                           16

45.      IntermediateResults Indicators:

         (i)     No less than a thirdo fthe recipients of grants for productiveprojects enrolled in
                 the Registro de Efectores (and therefore registered as self-employed that would
                 have to pay taxes after receiving a tax break for two years) one year after receipt
                 o f the materials and equipment from the grant;

         (ii)    No less than 300,000 Heads o fHousehold participants interviewedin
                 employment offices;

         (iii)   No less than 150,000 Heads o f Household participants having taken a labor
                 orientation course; and

         (iv)    No less than 5,000 Heads o fHousehold participants having completed either
                 primary or secondary education cycle.

3.       ProjectComponents

46.      There are four Project components. Component A (the largest) would cover continued
financing  o f the transfer payment to those beneficiaries o fthe Heads o f HouseholdProgram
complying with the requirementto participate inworkfare or training/education/job-search
activities. Support would also beprovided to assist the Ministryo f Labor to reorient these
activities so that they contribute more to improving the employment prospects o f beneficiaries.
Component B would support the provision o f grants for productive sub-projects proposedby
small groups o f Programparticipants. Component C would cover the activities related to the
establishment and strengtheningo f employment services in some municipalities and the testing
of instrumentsto facilitate the labor market insertion o fProgrambeneficiaries. Component D
would support governance improvements inthe Program, as well as Project management and
monitoring and evaluation.

ComponentA: Headsof HouseholdProgramSub-projects(CommunityServices and
Works, Training, and BasicEducation)(US$2,199millioninProgramcosts; US$320.75
millionin loanfinancing)

47.      Support o f Workfare and Employability. Most loan resources would finance the
workfare part o f the Programwhose participants would continue to receive AR$150 per month,
Currently most o f the beneficiarieswho are complying with the work requirement fulfilltheir
obligation incommunity services (soup kitchens, child care, schools, health centers, etc.),
municipal services (maintenance o fbuildings,cleaning o fpublic spaces, etc.), or small
construction projects.

48.     An important aim o fthe Heads o fHouseholdTransition Strategy is to increase the
numbero fparticipants who improve their employability by completingbasic education,
participating intraining courses, combining the work requirement with on-the-job training, and
participating in sub-projects designed to provide experience and skills for futurejobs. Inareas
where employment offices exist (Component C), beneficiarieswould be referredto these
activities by those staff inorder to promote participation by those most likely to benefit. After



                                                  17

the activity finishes, beneficiaries would be requiredto actively search for ajob, assisted and
supervisedby the local employment office.

49.     For activities intendedto improve employability, inaddition to the monthly transfer to
beneficiaries, the project or the sponsoring locality would finance necessary inputs, such as
educational materials, training supplies, and construction materials, as well as, selectively, per
diemfor beneficiaries to cover transportation costs, additional time obligations, babysitting, etc.
Insteado fper diems, sponsoring localities or organizations could provide support via in-kind
transfers or services (babysitting, for example) andthe provision would be covered by in-kind
services provided by sponsoring localities or organizations and would be linked closely to
participation inthe employment activities. All activities would include specific targets for job
placement, as well as agreed monitoring arrangements. For these sub-projects, the Operational
Manual used under the existing Heads o f Household Project (Ln.7157-AR) is beingrevisedto
reflect the focus on employability results as well as other changes. More details on the
implementation arrangements, including those relating to the provision o fper diems i s contained
inAnnex 5. Adoption of a revised OperationalManual by theMinistry of Labor would be a
condition of disbursementfor the materials andper diem categories of expenditures.

50.     Sector Focus. An example o f a sector that the Ministryo f Labor has identified as
promising i s construction. Inorder to increase employability, Heads o f Householdparticipants
interested inconstructionjobs would get experience working on small infrastructure projects,
sponsored by municipalities, other public entities or non-governmental organizations.
Participants would get on-the-job training leading towards certification and access to a basic
social insurance package available for constructionworkers.

5 1.    Training Focus. The Ministryo f Labor intendsto incorporate the approach, techniques,
and experience gained inFormujer, a pilot program supported by the IDB. It aimed to
strengthenand innovate intraining-for-work policies, particularly for low-income women. The
activities were carried out in several different areas o f Argentina with good results. Innovative
and quality materials (especially on employability, labor competence, occupational projects and
orientation guides) are available. Techniques, many similar to strategies used inthe welfare-to-
work reforms inthe OECD, were developed to construct a "bridge" to the labor market, by:

                 Better linking the worlds o ftraining and work, including by helping training
                 institutions to respond better to the needs o f the population, the demand for jobs
                 and the local environment;
                 Integratingtraining for employability and citizenship inthe curriculum;
                 Integrating career guidance oriented towards labor market demands, into the
                 training process and into the systemo f information on the local supply and
                 demand for jobs;
                 Working with clients on their "occupational project" inorder to encourage
                 permanent learning and enhance employability;
                 Developing compensatory strategies and scholarships to address the inequalities
                 arising from poverty and gender, diversify female vocational options, and
                 strengthen management competencies;




                                                    18

       (vi)     Linkingtraining with subsequent follow-up and counseling inorder to assist the
                beneficiaries to follow-through on their "employment projects", including
                internships with businesses; and
       (vii)    Usingnon-governmental organizations (NGOs)experienced inworking with
                these populations inorder to link themup more effectively with training
                institutions and employers-a    tool likely to be more effective in labor markets
                characterized by highinformality as i s the case in some areas o f Argentina.

52.    The proposed Project would finance: (i)    monthly transfers for workfare (or
educatiodtraining) participants paid through bank debit cards; (ii)  per diempayments paid
through bank debit cards to selected participants; (iii) construction, training, and education
materials; and (iv) consultancy services to design, implement and supervise sub-projects.
Possible locations include Tucumhn, EntreRios, Cordoba, Mendoza, L a Pampa, and the City o f
Buenos Aires.

ComponentB: Heads of HouseholdProductiveSub-projects(US$23 millionin project
costs; US$22 millionin loanfinancing)

53.     Support would be provided to small groups o fbeneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household
Program to finance the cost o f tools, equipment and inputs for productive activities. The
beneficiaries would continue to receive the monthly stipend from the Program duringthe
implementation o f these sub-projects. Eligible activities include the following: increase in
production or value-added for agriculture; production o f construction materials and o f inputs and
equipment for manufacturing; andmanufacturing o fproducts for final consumption. The
maximum value o f the equipment, materials, and inputs for which financing could berequested
would be AR$lO,OOO ifthere were a minimum of two Heads o fHousehold beneficiaries inthe
group proposing the project. Ifthere are at least three Program participants inthe group, then the
maximum amount of financing would be AR$15,000. Only projects receiving a positive
technical evaluation by qualified staff would be approved. Technical assistance would be
provided to the participants working inthe activities and efforts made to link as many as possible
to sources o f credit financing for subsequent support. This sub-component would be
implementedjointly bythe ministries o f Social Development and Labor.

54.    A revisedOperational Manual for the component has been agreed with the Bank. These
changes reflect adjustments made inlight o f the experience o f implementingthis component
underthe current Heads o fHouseholdProject (Ln.7157-AR), as well as the findings o f an ex-
post revision o f a sample o fprojects, and the baseline survey data for the impact evaluation,
More detail i s available inAnnex 5. Adoption of the revised manual would be a condition of
disbursement of the expenditure categoy of materialsfor this component. The Project would
finance the monthly transfer payment to Heads o f Household beneficiaries (as long as paid
through a bank debit card) duringimplementation o fthe productive activity, materials for the
sub-projects, and consultancy services requiredto implement and supervise the component, as
well as to provide technical assistanceto beneficiaries.




                                                  19

ComponentC: EmploymentServices (US$4.2 millioninProjectcosts; US$4 millioninloan
financing)

55.     The Ministry of Labor usedsome resources inthe on-going Heads o f Household Project
(Ln.7157-AR) to strengthenits capacity inthe areaofemployment services beginning in2004.
The proposed loanwould support the establishment o f offices of employment services insome
municipalities and the testing o f instruments. It i s acknowledged that given the resources and
time available inthis proposed Project, the Ministry will only be able to make a start ininstalling
capacity and ensuringminimumemployment services. It i s expected that at least 100 municipal
employment offices could be supported. The offices would be responsible for interviewing job
seekers, with priority for Heads o f Householdbeneficiaries, but all services would be available
for other unemployed persons or those individuals interested inimproving their employment
status. After recording the labor history, individuals would be referred to activities, both those
under the management o f the Ministry o f Labor and others offered by other service providers,
depending on the profile o fthe person and the availability o f services inthe area. These could
include: job placement, supervised job search, short workshops onjob search or labor
orientation, support for self-employment, training, completion o f basic education, or placement
intemporary work. Interviewsinthe employment office (or through an alternativearrangement
ifnoneisavailable)wouldbecompulsoryforanybeneficiaryaccessingcertainactivities, for
example, training, completion o f basic education, and participation in sub-projects to promote
labor insertion. Support to the offices would consist o f technical assistance, preparation of
Operational Manuals for the offices, training, equipment and software. The offices would be
supervised by Ministryo f Labor staff.

56.     The Project would finance local consultancy services to design, implementand supervise
this component, and to provide technical assistance to the municipalities; computing and other
basic equipment and services for the employment offices. Inaddition, it would finance the
design of the technology platform necessary to support the provision o f employment services
adequately inthe future and external consultancy services to review the initial experience with
municipal employment offices no less than four months before the completion date o f the Project
inorder to take stock ofprogress made andto provide recommendations for future support bythe
Ministry o fLabor.

ComponentD: GovernanceImprovementsand Monitoring& Evaluation(US$2.7 million
inProject costs, USN.5 millionin loanfinancing)

57.    Further improvements in governance o f the Heads o f Household Program would be
supported by the proposed Project. Specific activities which would be supported under this
component would include:

    0  Expanded Continuous Audit. The continuous audit, which was carried out duringthe
       Project now coming to a close, would be continued with new and an expanded terms o f
       reference. Since mid-2005, the audit includes an examination o f the payment system o f
        debit cards usedto transfer monies to beneficiaries. Such audit includes random checks
        on (i)delivery o f debit cards to beneficiaries; (ii)
                                                            deposits o fpayments inbeneficiaries'
        accounts; (iii)
                      debit card transactions. The audit would now be expanded to include spot
        checks o fmunicipal management o f the Program, particularly workfare activities.


                                                  20

    0  Registry Improvements. The proposed Project would also support improvements inthe
       Heads o f Householdbeneficiary registryby (i)     incorporating the information collected
       duringthe process o ftransferringbeneficiaries to theFamilias Program; (ii)       requiringan
       update for all participants inactivities directly supported by the Ministryo f Labor or
        Social Development; and (iii)   expanding cross-checks on eligibility requirements by
        incorporating additional databases. This would also include additional database cross-
       checks betweenworkfare participant lists (which would be passed to the Bank for
       reimbursement) and the entries inthe relevant Ministry o f Labor database to be carried
        out by the Sistema de Identiciatidn Nacional Tributarioy Social (National System o f Tax
        and Social Identification).
    0  Enhanced Monitoring. The component would support enhanced monitoring o f the
       overall implementation o f the Heads o f Household Program inthe transition phase
       towards new activities and programs. Government and Bank have agreed on a host o f
       current and also new indicators which would track overall Program performance and
       governance (see Annex 3).
    0  Information and communication. Facilitating good communication with those
        implementingthe Program i s important, particularly inthe context o f the new activities
        associated with the transition strategy and to ensure transparency. Thus, the Secretariat
        of Employment o f the Ministry o f Labor would strengthen channels o f communication
        and information among those involved inthe Program, both organizations and
       representatives o f civil society and provincial and municipal authorities. The Secretariat
       would develop through a specific plan o f activities and themes, expanded opportunities to
       receive information, suggestions, and opinions about Project components.
    0  Stakeholder activities. Incoordination with the National Consultative Council staff, the
       Ministryo fLabor would carry out workshops, to consult andprovide information,
       promoting the participation o f local organizations (non-governmental organizations,
       unions, business groups, private companies, professionaltraining centers, among others).
        The progress and results o f these activities would be supported by the proposedProject
        and followed carefully by Bank staff, as part o f the planned enhanced supervision.

58.     Inaddition to the newmonitoring arrangements, the proposedProject wouldbe
accompanied by a number o f impact evaluations (see Annex 3), most importantly o f the new pro-
employment strategy o f Government (which would be part o f the planned and recently
announced Training and Employment Insurance). The municipal employment offices are going
to be central infacilitating a number o fpro-employment activities and would be the focus o fthe
plannedevaluation. Inaddition, impact evaluations would be carried out for the construction and
micro-productive projects.

59.    The Director of the Project Executing Unitwould be the nexusbetween the Project and
the Ministry, coordinating with the relevant staff inorder to facilitate the use o f the loan
resources to support the eligible activities as described above. The Project ExecutingUnitwould
handle the day-to-day activities o fmanagingprocurement, hiring consultants, and financial
management, including the preparation o f Financial Management Reports, preparation o fthe
documentation neededfor reimbursement requests, and ensuring compliance with audit
requirements. A small group would be responsible for preparing the information and monitoring
reports on the Program, as well as the specific activities supported by the Bank loan. The Project



                                                  21

would finance consultancy services, supplies, minor equipment, and the carrying out o f
household surveys.

60.     This component would also support a series o f activities plannedby the Ministryo f
Labor which aim at supporting small and medium-sized businesses to meet existing regulations
concerning labor and social security contributions inorder to improve both level and quality of
compliance of these enterprises. This would include promotional activities, learning from the
experience of Chile, and training o f staff inthe provincial offices to support small and medium-
sized businesses. The Ministrywould also work with the tax authorities to simplify the process
of formally registering workers and to update regulations governing inparticular home-based
work. Inaddition, the Project would support analytical and designwork related to possible
reforms o f the unemployment insurance systeminArgentina.

61.     The Project would finance: (i)    consultancy services to undertake Programmanagement,
monitoring and evaluation activities and to improve registries and governance o f the Program;
and (ii) publications.

4.      Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

62.     The lessons learned and reflected inthe Project design relate to (i)  the design of effective
workfare programs, (ii)    experience with the on-going Heads o fHousehold Project, (iii)
evaluations of job search assistance services inthe OECD, as well as intransitioddeveloping
countries, and (iv) grant financing for productive projects.

63.     Workfare Design. Inclassic workfare programs, the level o f the wage rate i s critical in
determining the distribution o f benefits from workfare, particularly its targeting performance.
First,maintaining the wage at a level not higherthan the rulingmarketwage for unskilledlabor
(not necessarily the minimumwage) i s the best way to reach the poor effectively. Second, the
combination of the appropriate wage rate and enforcement o f the work requirement should also
ensure that workers are encouraged to take up regular employment when it becomes available
and exit from the Program. Third, it i s important that the Program be designed to strengthen the
secondary benefits from the assets or services provided. Effective monitoring and supervision o f
projects i s important to ensure satisfactory quality.

64.      While the Heads o fHouseholdTransition Project takes the above lessons into account, it
is, at this stage, not a classic workfare program. First, the Program has been effectively closed
since May 2003 and i s envisaged to continuing declining in size. A classical workfare program
would be open so as to be able to respond to an eventual increase inunemployment, with the
wage rate and work requirement acting as self-targeting devices. Second, the transition i s
focused on raising employability of the current beneficiaries through training, education, and
redesigned workfare activities rather than purelyproviding public works. Nevertheless the
amount o f the stipendi s o f crucial importance inthe transition phase as it should not deter
participants from securing stable forms o f employment. Further,the Government has decided
that, as part o f the transition phase, any increase (such as through per diem payments) be linked
to the new workfare activities that promote the re-insertion o fbeneficiaries into the labor market.
This could, potentially and importantly, lead to an increased compliance with the work
requirement.



                                                   22

65.     Experience from the Heads o f Household Program. The Heads o f Household Program
was effective incompensating many losers from the crisis and fulfilled its development objective
of reducing poverty, but several weaknesses (outlined insection 1and Annex 1o f this Project
Appraisal Document) provide lessons for the designo f the proposed Project:

     (9      Develop a separate safety netfor the structuralpoor. Manyparticipants are not
              suited for a temporary work program that i s supposed to be a safety net for
             beneficiaries until they find paid employment. O f the 1.4 million participants, nearly
              a third are mothers with two or more children, some o fwhom have no prior work
              experience. Therefore, the proposed Heads o fHousehold Transition Project would
              support Government inits efforts to provide a longer-term safety net for some groups
             who would become eligible for alternative programs, most importantly Familias.
     (ii) Refocus theProgramtowardsemployability. Forthosebeneficiarieswithawork
             history as well as possibilities to reenter the labor market, the implementation o fthe
             Heads o f Household Programto date showed that to improve their employability,
             tailor-made support programs are necessary which would increase their prospects to
              get ajob. Hence, the proposedProject would provide more opportunities for
              education and training and strengthenemployment services.
     (iii) Weakeningenforcement of work$arecompliance. Overallworkfarecompliancehas
              decreased since the onset o f the Program. Hence, the proposedProject would support
             the transition o fbeneficiaries for whom workfare i s not appropriate to other
             programs, help the Ministryo f Labor promote more participation ineducation and
             training activities, and would provide incentives for that expansion by linking Bank
              disbursementsto performanceo fthe overall Programinregistering beneficiaries in
             workfare or training and education activities.

66.      A recent Bank review of evaluations o f employment services20,including counseling,
placement assistance,job matching, labor exchanges, and other related services, inOECD, as
well as transition and developing economies, concludedthat they generally have positive impacts
on the post-program employment and earnings o f participants. Costs are relatively low so the
cost-benefit ratio i s often favorable. Comprehensive packages o f services, programs that are
oriented to labor demand and linked to real workplaces, and careful targeting are good design
features. The evaluations show that program impacts are usually more positive when the
economy i s growing. Some studies indicate that positive effects are more frequent for women.
An important caveat is that large informal sectors as well as the relative weakness o fpublic
institutions indeveloping countries,may affect the performance o fjob assistance programs in
these countries. More research i s neededinthis area.

67.      Grant Financing o f Productive Activities. The proposed Project would finance
productive activities proposedby small groups o f beneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household
Program. The discussions with the Government were guidedby the lessons from social funds.
As grants would beprovided, these include the importance o f : (i)          targeting the assistance to very
poor communities or groups that are beyond the current reach o f micro (or other) finance

institutions; (ii) financing cost-effective ways o f reducingpoverty, which can be demonstrated
by impact and cost-effectiveness indicators; (iii)   encouraging beneficiaries to contribute at least
partly incash; and (iv) combining grants with technical assistance and supporting links with
established savings and credit associations.

5.       AlternativesConsideredand Reasons for Rejection

68.      An alternative considered was to prepare and finance jointly with the Inter-American
Development Bank the comprehensive transitional strategy, including both the Heads o f
HouseholdProgram and expansion o f the Familias Program. DuringProject preparation the
Government decided to continue with a division o f funding: for the IDBto taking responsibility
for the Familias Program, and the Bank to focus where it hadprior experience (workfare and
employment). World Bank and IDB staff closely coordinated preparation of the two projects,
and would continue to work together duringthe implementationphase.

C.       IMPLEMENTATION

1.       InstitutionalResponsibilities

69.      The transition strategy for the Heads o f Household Program i s the joint responsibility o f
the ministrieso f Labor and Social Development. The latter would concentrate on transferring
eligible beneficiaries to the Familias Program and expanding and strengtheningthat program,
supported by the IDB. The proposedWorld Bank-financed Project would support the activities
assigned to the Ministryo f Labor, and, inaddition, the component o f productive sub-projects to
support self-employment (Component B) inwhich the Ministry o f Social Development has the
leadrole.

70.      The activities to be supported under the Project would be managed within the existing
structure o f the Ministry of Labor. These include the National Directorate o f Employment (sub-
projects for permanentemployment and labor insertion, beneficiary registry, and governance
issues), the National Directorate for Professional Training (sub-projects o fbasic education
completion and professional training), and the National Directorate for the Federal Employment
System(offices o f employment services). Technical groups within these directorates would
carry out all o f the activities relatedto each subcomponent. They report to the directors, who in
turn are responsible for overall management ofthe implementation o fthe activities.

71,      The Director o f the Project Executing Unit would be the nexusbetweenthe Project and
the Ministry, coordinating with the relevant staff inthe Ministry o f Labor to facilitate the use o f
the loanresources to support the eligible activities as described above. The Project Executing
Unitwouldberesponsible for the appropriate utilization ofloanresources, handle the day-to-day
activities o fmanagingprocurement, hiringconsultants, and financial management, including the
preparationof Financial Management Reports, prepare the documentationneeded for
reimbursementrequests, and ensure compliancewith audit requirements. It would analyze and
control the administrative documentation related to Project implementation and would maintain
all the documentation neededto support Project activities. As was the case inthe previous
Project, the Ministryintends to use the services o f UNDP to assist inProject implementation,
primarily for contracting consultancy services.



                                                   24

72.       The Ministry o fLabor is responsible for paying beneficiaries monthly. Since the
beginning o f the Heads o f Household Program, the National Social Security Administration
(ANSES) has cross-checked monthly the registry o fbeneficiarieswith several databases (social
security contributions, pensions, unemployment insurance) before payment is authorized.
Additional cross-checks by the Systemo fNational and Social Identificationbegan in2003. The
additional data bases include: personal property tax rolls, capital gains taxes, non-contributory
pensions, municipal and provincial databases, and death registries. Inaddition, special exercises
have been undertaken to identify other anomalies usingother checks on employment status and
health insurance rolls. For the majority o fbeneficiaries who have been switched to debit cards,
the Ministry authorizes the crediting o f the account o f that beneficiary information again checked
bythe payment agency, theBanco de la Nacidn. Ifthere is no activity inan account for three
months, that beneficiary i s dropped from the Program and the money returned to the Ministry o f
Labor. The proposed loan would finance only payments made through debit cards.

73.       For the component o f Productive Sub-projects for Self-Employment, an executing unit
reporting to the Secretary for Social Policy o f the Ministry o f Social Development, would be
responsible for managing the promotion, evaluation, approval, supervision, technical assistance,
and monitoring for the component, according to an Operational Manual agreed with the Bank.
Both the Secretary for Social Policy and the Secretary for Employment approve the projects for
financing.     Administrative aspects (contracting o f services, preparation o f agreements with
municipalities and payments to municipalities for the purchases o fmaterials for approved sub-
projects) would be the responsibility o f the Project Executing Unit inthe Ministry o f Labor. The
monthly payments o f the Heads o f Household Program stipend for beneficiaries participating in
this componentwould also continue to behandledbythe Ministryo fLabor usingthe same
procedures described above.

74.       Details on the implementation arrangements for each component, including as applicable,
the description o f the project cycle, are inAnnex 5.

2.        Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes/results

75.       Information on the Heads o f Household Program comes from the Permanent Household
Survey (EPH) carried out by the National Statistical Institute, which includes questions on the
Program, as well as the beneficiary registry and administrative data. The EPH survey i s an
independent data source and the primary source for tracking overall Program implementation and
impact. It i s now available on a quarterly basis. Data from the survey can bebroken down (and
i s still statistically valid) by region or by large municipalities or groups o fmunicipalities, This
data i s used to monitor the income levels o f the participants o f the Program, whether participants
meet certain eligibility requirements(have a minor or handicappedperson inthe household),
have ajob with social benefits, and how many hours they are working inan eligible activity (or
attending school). The survey i s also used for a continuous incidence analysis o f the Program
(see Annex 3 for more detail). Under the now closing Project, an impact evaluation was carried
out using survey data for October 2002 and updated inM a y 2003.21

76.     A group responsible for monitoring withinthe MinistryofLabor produces monthly
reports on Program trends such as coverage rates, reductions inrolls, demographic characteristics
(sex, number o f children, etc.) o f the beneficiaries, and entries into the formal labor market. For
the municipalities which contain the largest numberso fbeneficiaries, this infomation is linked
with data on results ofsupervisiono fmunicipalities and call center statistics on complaints.

77.     The Bank has agreed with the Ministryo f Labor on quarterly monitoring indicators for
the proposed Project. Inaddition, the Ministry o f Labor and the Bank have agreed on a
preliminary evaluation design to explore the impact o f the initial operation o f employment
services, Further, the impact evaluation for self-employment, begununder the first project,
would be continued. Ifpossible, impact evaluations would also be carried out for the reoriented
workfare activities. More information on monitoring indicators and the design for the impact
evaluation can be found inAnnex 3.

78.     The Bank would support the monitoring and evaluation activities with continued
enhanced supervision from the field office as well as continued frequent site visits and spot
checks inmunicipalities. Further, the Bank team would also add a media monitoring component
to its regular supervision activities, capturing reporting inboth the national and regional press.
Regular monitoring reports would be supplied to Bank management.

3.       Sustainability

79.      The Program has declined insize by a third since mid-2003 and new employment
opportunities as well as good Program administration should support a continuation o f such
trend. Inaddition, an estimated 300,000 participants would move to the Familias Program by
the end o f 2006. Activities supported by the proposedProject are designed to facilitate the entry
o f more participants into the labor market. Nevertheless, it needs to be recognized that given the
depth o f the economic crisis and the challenges facing the economy, the decline inthe number o f
beneficiaries inthe Program i s likely to be gradual. Assuming that beneficiaries would continue
to exit the Program each month as a result o f finding employment, coupled with transfers to the
Familias program, improved controls and other factors would result inestimated enrollment in
the order o f 940,000 by December 2007.

80.      The aim o f the transition strategy for the Heads o f Household Program is to move as
many participants as possible into full-timework. However, that does not exclude the possibility
that a workfare program, designeddifferently and o f a more manageable size, could still be
important inArgentina. Given the demonstrated success o f workfare programs (including
Trabajar inArgentina), it could reasonably be expected to maintain a workfare program as part
o f the social safety net, to be used flexibly for some groups dependingon economic and social
conditions.

81.      An important considerationis the role o fthe Program at the municipal level. First, in
some localities, participants o f the Heads o f Household Program essentially work as municipal
employees. Particularly inthe short run, it would not be possible for these municipalities to
guarantee otherwise essential services, since around halfo f the staff are beneficiaries o f the
Program. Second, inmany municipalities, the financial resources transferred via the payments to
Programbeneficiaries are substantial relative to other transfers received from the national



                                                    26

Government. The importance o f the Heads o f HouseholdProgram for municipal finances and
service delivery should decline as the economy continues to recover and fiscal performance
improves. However, it might be necessary to develop an adaptation strategy for some poorer
municipalities.

4.       CriticalRisks and Possible ControversialAspects

82.      Experiencewith Risk MitigationMeasures. The now closing Heads o f Household
Project (Ln.71157-AR) was classified as highrisk. Some underlyingreasons for that rating,
provided in2002, no longer apply, such as the pressures by the social emergency or the
transitional nature o f the Government. Thus, several o f the original highrisks are now reduced.
This also applies to the risk ofpoor targeting. Impact evaluations have shown the sustained good
targeting record o f the Program. Further,the risk o f expansion o f the Program beyond
manageable size i s lower giventhat the Program has been effectively closed since May 2003 and
the Government does not planto open registration.

83.      Experiencewith two originally specified risk mitigationmeasures fell short o f
expectations. First,municipal councils were expected to control and supervise the Program and
ensure transparency. As already discussed, many municipal councils could not fulfilltheir
originally specified functions to (i) and supervise the Program, including the entry o f
                                     control
beneficiaries and the compliance with the work requirement; (ii)    ensure transparency; and (iii)
assist inthe organization of workfare activities. Second, while the extent o fnational supervision
efforts and audits (by the legislative branch www.sigen.aov.ar ) o fmunicipalities exceeded
expectations innumber, they didnot always have the desiredimpact, as follow-up was
inconsistent until after May 2003. Other instrumentsworked well, for example, the continuous
audit, the impact evaluation, and the availability o f objective information on the Program
through the results o f the Permanent Household Survey. Inaddition, alternative risk mitigation
measures were developedwhich reduced some risks, especially since M a y 2003. These included
use o f database crosschecks and greater access to public information on the Program. Such
measures would be continued and extended inthe proposedProject through component D.

 84.     Riskso fHeads o fHouseholdTransition Proiect. Nevertheless, an overall highrisk
rating remains for Program implementation and, therefore, also for the proposed follow-on
Project. These highrisks include insufficient employment creation, especially o f formal sector
jobs; problems incoordination between the ministries o f Labor and Social Development inthe
 transition strategy; delays intransfers to the Familias program; and difficulties inchanging the
 focus o f the Heads o f Household Program to one o f improving employability o fparticipants.
 Governance risks o f Project implementation remain but a number o f mitigating measures for
 these have beenbuilt into the proposedProject.

D.       APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.       Economicand FinancialAnalyses

86.      Economic Analysis. There are two ways inwhich the Heads o f Household Program
mightreduce poverty: the first is byproviding paidwork for the unemployed from poor
households, and the second i s byproducing services or facilities o f value to poor families. The
cost effectiveness o f the workfare component o f the Heads o f Household Program-in                    other
words, the proportion o f total public expenditures o f the Program that i s accountable to the net
income gain to poor workers-can          be decomposed into the following four variables: (i)            labor
intensity:the share o fproject costs represented bywage costs; (ii)             targeting performance: the
proportion o f the wages paid out that goes to poor workers; (iii) net wage gain: share o f the
                                                                              the
gross wage received by the poor after taking into account any foregone income; and (iv) indirect
benefits: benefits that accrue to the poor for the assets created or services provided.



                                                        29

87.      The workfare component o fthe Heads o fHousehold Transition Project meets, overall,
these criteria, First, the average labor intensity o fthe construction projects financed i s around 40
percent, but most participants work incommunity services, where labor intensity i s high(80-90
percent). Second, the targeting performance o fthe Program overall shows that about 40 percent
of beneficiaries are found inhouseholds inthe bottom 20 percent o fthe income distribution, and
80 percent are found among the bottom 40 percent. Third, given the still widespread open
unemployment, it i s likely that there remains a net wage gain for beneficiaries o f the Program
albeit such net wage gain could not be assessed since May 2003 (after which the panel dataset
was not large enoughto undertake the analysis) when it was one third o f the transfer amount. In
a recovering economic environment the opportunity cost o fparticipation inthe Program
(measured by the foregone income) i s higher and makes the Programmore costly to be sustained
when compared to the net benefits accruingto its beneficiaries.

88.      Somewhat less clear i s the indirect benefit derivedfrom the classical workfare activities
accruing to the poor inthe Heads o f Household Program and therefore the transition phase puts
specific emphasis on raising the human capital o f beneficiaries and linking them closer to the
labor market. While some o fthe classical activities are likely to be o f considerable importance
for the poor (construction o f schools, for example, or work in soup kitchens), others are probably
rather "make work" activities, with small benefits (second-hand clothing recycling or
handicrafts). The new activities introduced inthe workfare part (education, training, job
interviews) are all geared to increasingthe likelihood o f current beneficiaries to obtain stable
employment.

89.      Inevaluating the economic features ofthe Program, however, it is important to notethat
the Program is not a classic workfare program at this stage and that the Transition Project would
aim to support downsizing the Program through a number o f activities. As mentioned above, the
Programhas been effectively closed since May 2003 and i s envisaged to further decline in size,
Also, the transition i s focused on raising employability o f the current beneficiaries through
training, education, and redesigned workfare activities rather than purely providingpublic work
occupations. The likely reduced benefit o f the Program for beneficiaries points to the needfor
such transition to take place. Albeit the Program i s in a transition phase, it i s nevertheless
important that the transfer amount does not deter those that are following the work requirement
from taking up other employment.

90.      Despite the decline inthe real transfer amount over the past two years, there i s currently
little room to increase the income transfer under the Heads o fHousehold Program. Annex 8
shows that for those Program beneficiaries complying with the minimum20 hour a week work
requirement, the transfer amount inthe first halfo f2005 is close to the average comparable
salary inthe second (poorest) decile. Adjustingthe comparison for actual overall compliance
with the work requirement, however, the transfer amount falls betweenthe expected hourly wage
of workers inthe fourth and fifth income decile.

91.      Given the above, it was agreed with Government to (i)    maintain the remuneration for
Heads o f Household participants at AR$150 per month, or another rate based on an updated
analysis usingthe methodology described above and data o f the Permanent Household Survey, if
acceptable to the Bank; (ii) the financial participation o fthe Bank inthe overall Program to
                              link
performance on the compliance with the workfare requirement; and (iii)      include inthe proposed



                                                  30

Project supervision, monitoring, and evaluation activities to ensure that sub-projects achieve
their intendedpurpose and are of adequatequality.

92.     Fiscal Analvsis. Government spending on the Heads o fHousehold Program declined
from 1percent o f GDP in2003 to 0.6 percent o f GDP in2005, and i s likely to continue to fall in
2006 to 0.5 percent, assuming that the economy grows and that beneficiaries continue to leave
the rolls for private employment and because o fbetter controls. Duringthe crisis, transfers
associated with the Programrelievedpressure on the budgetso fbothprovincial and municipal
Governments and modified the structure and distribution o f financial transfers from the national
Government. For 2003, the transfers associated with payments to the Programparticipants
accounted for about a fifth o f the total transfers from the national Government to the provinces
(nearly 30 percent for the province o f Buenos Aires).

2.      Technical

93.     The technicaljustification for the proposed Transition Project is that (i)would seek to
                                                                                             it
promote employment and shiftingthose beneficiaries without employment possibilities to other,
more permanent, safety nets; (ii)      it would reduce Program size further, thus also reducing the
municipal task o f managingthe workfare component. The workfare concept i s built on the
strong linkbetween unemployment and poverty inArgentina and the limitedcoverage o f
unemployment insurance. Household survey data show that the rate o funemployment i s higher
inthe lower deciles ofhousehold income distribution. For now, the Heads ofHousehold
Program remains an alternative instrumentto unemployment insurance for poor, informal sector
workers.22

94.     Argentina has considerable experience with the implementation o f income transfer and
workfare programs, which albeit on a smaller scale than the Heads o f Household Program, were
successful as a social safety net for poor workers.

3.      Fiduciary

95.     Assessment o fthe agency's capacity to implementprocurement. The Bank Senior
Procurement Specialist assigned to the Project has completed a capacity assessment for Project
implementation for the Ministryo f Labor. The assessment encompassed the review o f the
organizational structure for Project implementation, and o f the interactionbetween the Project
staff responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central unit for administration and
finance,  With regardto sub-projects, the Ministryo fLabor, through the Project Executing Unit,
will beresponsible for: (i)    upstream, procurement-related activities, including assessingthe
implementing capacity o f the municipalities; (ii)         coordinating procurement reviews; and (iii)
preparing management reports on compliance and prior review activities. DuringProject
execution, the procurement team will assess the implementing capacity o f the selected
municipalities and determine the level o f risk involved using a methodology acceptable to the
Bank. The team will update the procurement section based on the conditions o f the new Project
and on the revisedguidelines of the current project's Operational Manual. The teams and their

support staff will participate ina workshop focused on ensuringthat the participating
municipalities will follow the procurement arrangements set forth inthe loan agreement. The
overall Project risk for procurement i s Average (see Annex 7).

96.      The issues/risks concerning procurement have beenidentified and consist of: (1)
inconsistent practices for the selection o f individual consultants which are not always inline with
the guidelines; and (2)the absence o f a procurement information systemfor monitoring
procurement activities as the existing system applies only to financial data information. The
limited Bank procurement experience on the part o f the municipalities i s considered a risk. The
procurement team will play an important role inmitigating this risk through steady technical
assistance and careful supervision. An action plan was agreed uponwith the Borrower,
delineating the activities to be carried out to improve Project implementation.

97.      Summarv o f the Financial Management Assessment. The Bank Financial Management
Specialist assessedthe financial management system for the Project inApril 2005 to determine
whether the systems (accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, auditing and staffing)
could be relied on to provide to the Bank accurate and timely information regarding Project
resources and expenditures. The team updated this analysis inFebruary 2006. The proposed
Financial Management (FM) arrangements are considered adequate and the Borrower has
sufficient capacity and resources to implement the agreed action plan. Additional fiduciary
measures are designedto mitigate the identified risks. The initial overall risk at entry was
assessedas High, after adoption of the designed mitigation measures the overall FMresidual risk
i s considered Substantial. The detailed Risk Assessment i s provided in Annex 6.

98.      The Ministryof Labor i s the agency responsible for the FMfunctions o fthe Project,
including accounting, disbursements from the Bank, SA (Special Account) management, and
financial reporting. The Ministryalso will be responsible for the flow o f funds inthe Project and
for keeping supporting documentation and proper payments registration inits own Financial
Information System (SIDIF). The knowledge and qualification o f financial management staff
was reviewedand i s considered adequate. The Ministry has experience inimplementingthrough
their dedicated unit Bank-financed socialprotectionprograms: Social Protection I11Project
(US$284million, closed in2002) and the Heads o fHouseholdProject. On financial
management aspects, the financial arrangements for the Project draw upon experience with, and
lessons o f these prior social protection projects inArgentina implemented by the Ministry of
Labor.

4.       Social and Environment

99.      Socio-cultural and Political Context. In2002, a wide spectrum o f political and social
actors inArgentina felt the needfor a program to protect the unemployed from the effects o fthe
severe downturn and thereby to restore social order. The Mesa de Didogo, a group comprised o f
the national Government, the Episcopal Conference o fArgentina, UNDP, and several working
groups coordinated by individual national ministries, influencedthe decisions related to the
Heads o f Household Program. Based on the information available from the social assessment
commissioned for the Project, as well as public opinion polls, there i s widespread agreement
among nearly all actors that the Program played a critical andpositive role inhelping to mitigate
the crisis and to maintain social order. The transition strategy has been announced via a


                                                   32

Presidential Decree and assignsjoint responsibility for carrying it out to the Ministries o f Labor
and Social Development, who are working closely together.

100.    Participation o f Key Stakeholders inProiect Preparation. Giventhe complicated social
andpolitical context for the Heads o f Household Program andrecognizing the major influence
that it would have on the implementation o fthe transitional strategy, Project preparation included
three activities to incorporate key stakeholders. First, a social assessment was carried out in four
socially diverse provinces o f the country. Beneficiaries inthe Program, as well as municipal
authorities, national Government representatives, and businesswomedmen participated in focus
groups and interviews where they provided their opinions and suggestions on the current
operation o f the Program, as well as its proposed re-orientation. Second, since municipalities are
key stakeholders, inorder to better understand the relative incentives seenby municipalities, as
well as their strengths and constraints, in-depthcase studieswere carried out in6 municipalities,
selected inorder to represent different types o f conditions. The case studies combined a review
of quantitative information on the functioning o f the Program and economic conditions inthose
areas and on economic conditions with political analysis and interviews with key actors.

101.     Third, consultations were carriedoutjointly with the ministries o fLabor and Social
Development inthe municipalities o f Cordoba, L a Matanza, San Juan, and Corrientes, to discuss
the transition strategy for the Heads o fHousehold Program. The consultationswere organized as
workshops, which incorporated officials o fprovincial and municipal Governments, civil society
organizations and business representatives. After a brief explanation o f the strategy by
representatives o f the national Government, there were small group discussions, the comments
and conclusions o f which were later shared among all participants. Ingeneral those participating
agreed with the orientation proposed by the national Government, although they argued that
currently neither the public nor private sectors had demonstrated sufficient commitment to
promote labor market participation o f the beneficiaries. Inaddition, although they agreed with
the needfor decentralized implementationof social programs, they raised concerns about
weaknesses at the municipal level that affected the outcomes. One o f the mainpriorities
identifiedwas the necessity to improve significantly the channels o f diffusion and circulation o f
information, towards the beneficiaries as well as institutions. A summary o f the findings and
recommendations i s contained inAnnex 9 and the full reports are available inthe Project files.

102.     Social Factors important for Proiect Implementation. As discussed above inthe first part
of this document, many social factors are critical for the Project (see also Annexes 1and 9). The
critical public opinion o f how the Program started increases the need for continued, visible
improvements incontrols and governance. Consequently, the governance arrangements for the
Program will be further strengthened(hotline, cross-checks with data-bases, quality control
reviewso fbeneficiary registers, more systematic review o f local press). Perhaps most
importantly, more attention needs to be focused duringthe transitional strategy on ensuringthat
the new activities (e.g., interviews, training, education) are viewed as bindingobligations by
participations and that existing misinformation and confusion about the obligations and rights of
participationbe corrected. Giventhe highshare o f female participants, gender considerations
have beentaken into account inthe designo fthe Transition Project and will need to be
monitored during implementation.

103.     Environment. The sub-projects to be financed under the proposed loanwould be small
(underUS$135,000). Most environmental impacts should bepredictable and subsequently
avoided or mitigated with common practices. Checklists and other environmental tools have
beenincorporated into the evaluation methodology. The descriptionof the methodology,
together with forms, etc., i s included inthe Operational Manuals. Environmental considerations
are incorporated into staff training and the supervision of sub-projects.

5.        Safeguard Policies

104.     The Project does not trigger any safeguard policies.

6.       Policy Exceptions and Readiness

105.     There are no exceptions to Bank policy. The Project meets the regional criteria for
readiness. Fiduciary arrangements are inplace. The Project staff and consultants have been
mobilized. Counterpart funds have beenbudgeted and are available. The monitoring and
evaluation arrangements have beenagreed and are being put into place. Indicators are agreed
and baseline data has been collected.

Introduction

1.      Since the proposed Project supports a transition strategy, a necessary starting point i s an
examination o f the rationale and developments inthe Programunder the previous Bank loan,
now coming to an end. The Annex provides this background information.

The Economicand Social Crisisof 2001/2002

2.      The deep economic and social crisis inArgentina brought the country to the brink o f
economic and social collapse in2002. Key indicators o fwell-being, such as the infant mortality
rate, deteriorated for the first time in 30 years. The crisis also had a strong negative effect on the
deliveryo fbasic services and infrastructureto the poor. About 12percent o f the Argentine
population lost their healthinsurance coverage and 70 percent o f families had to reduce their
expenditures ineducation supplies. The poor reduced their consumption o f public services
significantly and many fell behindinpaying their bills. A governance crisis ensued when public
confidence collapsed and left the body politic indisarray. Inlate 2001 and early 2002, several
governments fell inrapid succession. Many Government decisions were challenged incourt and
some o f them were overturned. Popular protests were widespread.

Governmentresponse:Heads of HouseholdProgram

3.      Desim. Recognizingthe seriousness o f the situation, inApril 2002, the Government
created an emergency safety net, the Heads o f HouseholdProgram. Responsibilities were split
as follows:


    rn  National Government: Designed Program, including enrollment forms and eligibility
        criteria.
    rn  Ministry of Labor: Was responsible for overseeing implementation o f the Program; for
        consolidatinginformation on beneficiary enrollments and workfare activities received


                                                                           35

         from municipalities and other organizations; for ensuringthe quality o f the beneficiary
        registry; providing payment instructions for direct payment to beneficiaries through the
        National Social Security Administration and the banking system.
     0  Municipalities: M~nicipalities~~ responsible for enrolling beneficiaries, reviewing
                                                were
        the documentation requiredto prove that eligibility requirementswere met,maintaining
         files on beneficiaries, and organizing and supervisingworkfare activities.
     0   Consultative Councils: The Program requiredthe establishment o f municipal
         consultative councils, comprising the mayor as well as representatives o f other groups
         (public service providers, workers, businesses, churches, and civil society organizations).
         The role o f the councils was to approve the proposals for workfare activities and to be a
         channel for providing information and resolving complaints on beneficiary registration.
         Local councils were also to be responsible for taking appropriate actions where there was
         evidence that a beneficiary did not meet the eligibility criteria. A national consultative
         council was established.
     0  National Social Security Administration: After undertaking cross-checks against rolls of
         formal employment (those making social contributions), pensions, unemployment
         insurance and other social programs to identify any individual not eligible to bepaid, the
        National Social Security Administration is responsible for effecting the monthly
        payments by transferring resources to commercial banks, who paidbeneficiaries directly,

4.       Administration of Eligibility and Enrollment. 24 Inorder to prove eligibility, individuals
were required to show documentation (birthcertificates, document showing that individual had
legal guardianship of a minor, etc.) and copies o f these were to be maintained inthe files kept in
the municipality. The condition for maintenance inthe Programwas working inan eligible
activity or engaging intraining/education activities no less than 20 hours a week.25The initial
decree set up the Program only through the end o f 2002. Since then, the Program has been
renewed annually, under emergency powers which continue to be exercised by the Government
due to the economic crisis, as approved by the legislative branch. N o cut-off date for registration
was specified inthe initial decree. Partly as a response to the rapid growth inenrollments and
clear evidence that it was proving impossible for municipalities or the Ministry o f Labor to
strictly enforce the eligibility conditions, Government announced that registration would be
closed inMay 2002 but enrolment continued, albeit at a slower pace, untilM a y 2003. Enrolment
rose by 7% between January and May 2003, and was concentrated insome localities. The Bank
was in agreement with the announced cut-off inregistration inMay 2002, inpart to allow
beneficiary data to be processed and checked, and also in light o f the expansion o fthe Program
beyond the initial estimates o f the eligible population under the assumption that eligibility
criteria would be applied more strictly (initial estimate was 1.4 million).

5.       Size o f Program. The number of Program participants rose from 574,000 inMay 2002 to
1,857,000 by the end of 2002, reached its peak inMay 2003 and has declined steadily ever since.
The growth inthe Program exceeded by 40 percent what had been expected byboththe Bank


23There are slightly over 2000 municipalities inArgentina.
24Presidential Decree No. 565102, extended through Presidential Decree No. 1506104.
25Inadditionto workfare, the design of the Heads of Household, as reflected inthe Presidential Decree which set up
the Program, included requirements relatedto health and education o fminors. However, inpractical terms, most of
the focus was onthe workfare condition.


                                                       36

and the Government based on estimates o f the target population as definedby the Presidential
decree.

6.       The decline inbeneficiary numbers since May 2003 (whenthe current administration
took over) o f about 600,000 beneficiaries was due to improved governance o f the Program (50
percent) and the recovery which enabled beneficiaries to leave for employment (50 percent).
The decline varies from about 15 percent insome provinces (Chaco and Corrientes) to over 30
percent inother provinces (Mendoza, the City o f BuenosAires, andRio Negro). As of
December 2005, the Program covered 14 percent of all households inArgentina, down from 20
percent in2003. Current coverage rates vary from around 9 percent inCordoba andMendoza to
40 percent inCatamarca, Jujuy, Formosa, and Chaco. Those four provinces had coverage rates
of nearly half o f households in2003.

7.       Poverty Impact of Promam. Overall, the Heads o f Household Program was successful in
reaching the poor and mitigating the impact o f the social and economic crisis. Large household
surveys offer the most direct and accurate way to empirically measure the outcomes o fpublic
transfers. Two impact evaluations usinghousehold survey data (October 2002 and May 2003)
collected by the National Statistical Institute show that targetingperformance was good; about
40 percent o fthe participants came from the bottom 20 percent o f the household income
distribution, while about 80 percent came from the bottom 40 percent (Figure A 1-2). According
to the results o f the impact evaluation, an estimated 10percent more o f the participants would
have fallen below the food poverty line without the Program. Gross incidence data (see Figure 5
inmaintext) for 2004 and 2005 produces similar results. Also, the targetingresults for the
lowest two quintiles of the income distribution o f the Heads of HouseholdProgram are
comparable to other Latin American income transfer programs (Figure A1-3).26

26The methodologyused for calculating the incidence inFigure A1-3, including the treatment o f households with
zero incomes, i s somewhat different than inthe gross incidence analysis (Figure 5 inmain text) and net incidence
analysis (Figure AI-2). This explains the difference inprogram incidence o f the Heads of HouseholdProgram,
especially inthe first (poorest) income quintile. However, inthis methodology, there is a significant clustering of
beneficiaries from the program near the threshold for the bottom quintile.

8.       Evaluationof eligibility and workfare criteria. The table below summarizes selected data
on eligibility requirements,both usingthe periodic household survey (which includes questions
on Heads o f Household agreed with the Bank) as well as administrative data. Some o f the stated
eligibility criteria proved impossible to enforce and verify, most importantly that the beneficiary
i s the head o f a household (only around 45 percent o fbeneficiaries have such status today) and
being unemployed. According to the results o f the impact evaluation (which useda panel
survey), about halfo fbeneficiaries had not been active inthe labor market beforejoining the
Program. Nearly all beneficiary households include at least one minor (90-95 percent).

9.       The share o fparticipants who report the Heads o f Household Program as their primary
activity has declined from above 70 percent in2002-3 to about 57 percent inmid-2005. The
share of participants not participating inthe work requirement at all has risen from an estimated
20 percent inmid-2003 to about 30 percent inmid-2005. Geographically, workfare compliance
varies significantly.   The major problem o f enforcing the workfare condition i s inthe province o f
Buenos Aires where compliance i s only slightly more than halfo f the rate inall other regions o f
the country.

     TableA1-2: Headsof HouseholdProgram: Compliancewith Workfare Requirement




     Source: Basedon Permanent Household Survey and Ministry of Labor data on participation intraining courses.

10.     One o f the targets agreed upon inthe Heads o f HouseholdProject was that 80 percent of
the beneficiaries of the Program would be complying with the work requirement by the end of
2002, increasing to 90 percent by the end o f 2003 and maintaining that level thereafter, Data
show that with a compliance of about 75 percent, the program fell slightly short o f the end-2002
target, but instead of improving, the gap betweenthe target and actual performance continued to
grow throughout Project implementation. Factors related bothto unanticipated developments in
the Program and to its implementationhelp to explain the growing gap:


    0   First, the size of the Program at its peak was significantly larger than initially expected.
        Its scale made it difficult for some municipalities (especially large ones surrounding
        Buenos Aires) to link all participants to workfare activities. Equally important, the fact
        that inthe midst of the crisis, priority was given to register and pay people, instead o f
        only registering a person ifassigned to workfare (as had been the case inthe smaller
        Trabajar Program), made the enforcement o fthe workfare requirement more difficult,
    0   Second, as already mentioned, not all o f the beneficiaries o fthe Program had been active
        or were able to work, but were registered because the Heads o f Household Program was
        the Government's mainresponse to the crisis. Other programs which would havebeen
        expected to respond to the crisis had either very small coverage (unemployment
        insurance and minimumpension) or were in-kind(medicine, food, soup kitchens). This
        increased the demands on the Program, including those for whom the Heads o f
        Household Program (or any workfare program) was not intended or designed. For
        example, mothers with 3 or more children account for nearly a third o f the beneficiaries
        of the Program. About 60 percent o f these women are meeting the work requirement, but
        some municipalities have exempted them from the work requirement. About 5 percent of
        the participants of the Program come from similar groups (women above 60 years o f age,
        handicapped persons, parents with handicapped children, or men above 65 years o f age).
        This i s why the outlined transition strategy will place particular emphasis on
        distinguishingbetween different groups o f current beneficiaries.


    0   Third,and closely related to the second point above, although lack o f compliance with
        the work requirement isjustification for suspension by the Program municipalities have



                                                      39

         found it difficult to drop poor and needybeneficiaries from the Program at a time when
         no alternative social program could provide the needed support.
     0   Fouvth, the use o f training and education to comply with the work requirement has only
         recently pickedup inimportance and are key features o f the proposedProject.

11.      The focus inthe transition strategy i s to (i)
                                                     provide a longer-run safety net for those in
structural poverty through the Fumilius Program, not linked to workfare compliance, particularly
for those for whom a workfare program does not seem appropriate (for example, single mothers
with many young children) and (ii) support activities which could contribute more to the
                                      to
employability andjob prospects o fbeneficiaries. The latter would include not only training and
education completion, but also some specific workfare activities and employment services.

12.      Beneficiary Demographic Characteristics, Demographic information on beneficiaries,
taken from the household survey for the first semester o f 2005, i s summarized inTable A1-3.
About 70 percent of beneficiaries are women. Average household size i s slightly over 5 and the
average number o f children i s slightly over 2, both figures higher than for the economically
active population. Total household income was AR$652/month (roughly US$200/month) inthe
first semester o f 2005, including the transfer from the Program. For 17 percent o f households
there i s a formal sector worker inthe same household as the beneficiary. The average years o f
education i s slightly under 8 years, 3 years less than the average for the economically active
population inArgentina.

13.      Comparisons of data on the demographic and employment conditions o f the beneficiaries
of the Heads o f HouseholdProgram since the Program started in2002 up to the end o f 2004,
suggest a slight rise inthe share o fwomen participants, an increase inlabor force participation
(outside o f the Program) by the beneficiaries as well as other members o f their household, and a
steady increase inhousehold income for the beneficiaries, although the average remains below

the poverty line, for the typical family o f 4 members. Nearly 100 percent o f the male
beneficiaries and 80 percent o f the female beneficiaries have worked before, but 70 percent are
unskilled. Younger ex-beneficiaries ofthe Heads o fHouseholdProgramwithprevious formal
sector experience have been more successful at finding a formal sector job, particularly those in
the range between 25 and 34 years o f age. The major sectors where they foundjobs were
manufacturing and construction.

14.     Level o f Income Transfer. The level o f the income transfer o f the Program relative to
comparable wages inthe labor markethas changed since October 2002. FigureA1-4 shows the
developments o f the income transfer and unskilledwages o f the self-employed as well as wages
for salaried employees in small firms, all inreal October 2002 terms. As can be seen, while real
comparable wages have increased over time, the real Heads o fHousehold transfer has declined
giventhat the nominal transfer stayed constant and inflation picked up inArgentina over the last
two years. Relative to the poverty line, the transfer had a similar decline from covering 22.7
percent o fnecessary household expenditures (for a family o f four) inApril 2002 to 17.7 percent
inMay 2005.

15.     Whenthe Program started in2002, the transfer level was set below the expected wage
rate for households inthe bottom (poorest) quintile o f the income distribution, considering the
average wage rate for full-timework and the unemployment rate among this group. This was
important inorder to ensure that the Program was not attractive to the non-poor, would not
attract people out o f full time employment, nor discourage them from taking up regularjobs
when available.

                       ARGENTINA: Headsof HouseholdTransitionProject

1.       This Annex describes monitoring indicators and how they relateto the individual
components o f the proposedProject, including the governance sub-component D (they are
detailed inTable A3-1). The results framework (outcomes and intermediate indicators) i s
summarized inTable A3-2 followed by a description o f the impact evaluations planned o f
various Project activities.

Monitoring

2.       Proaam Administrative Data. The Project would be monitoredwith the help o f an
extensive set o f monitoring indicators which would track overall development inthe Heads o f
Household Program and be linkedto individual component (Table A3-1). Except for data from
the permanent household survey (EPH) and spot checks (which are part o fthe enhanced World
Bank supervision o f the proposedProject), the Ministryo f Labor would consolidate the data on a
monthly basis and transmit it to the Bank. This information enables the Ministry and the Bank to
monitor closely trends inparticipation, overall compliance with eligibilities, exists from the
program by reason, etc. Included inthis data i s information on the number o f people dropped
from the Program, and for which reason, permitting the Bank to monitor the functioning o f the
Ministry's mandatory monthly cross-checking o fdata bases, compliance with the rules ofthe
Program (dropping people who no longer meet the requirements, for example, when a participant
or spouse gets ajob with benefits or when the minor inthe family turns 1S), and supervision o f
municipalities. Again, based on the experience under the ongoing Project, ifmonthly monitoring
usingthese indicators shows anomalies inProgramimplementation, discussions would be held
betweenthe Bank and the Ministryon additional work or actions which would need to betaken.

3.       Permanent Household Survev. Independent o f the above monitoring instruments, and to
check the effectiveness o f the control and monitoring functions, Program beneficiaries have been
surveyed(withina larger household survey) periodically by the National Statistical Institute
(INDEC) since 2002. This data provides independentand statistically representative (for urban
areas) Program statistics. This i s the Bank's and the public at large, primary instrument to
closely track the overall Program. The survey instrumentwas developed and included inthe
regular labor force survey upon the suggestion o f the Bank. Until2004, it was available twice
annually and now it i s available on a quarterly basis. Data from the survey can be broken down
(and i s still statistically valid) by region or by large municipalities or groups o f municipalities.
This data is usedto monitor the income levels o fthe participants o fthe Program, whether
participants meet certain eligibility requirements (have a minor or handicapped person inthe
household), have ajob with social benefits, and how many hours they are working inan eligible
activity or attending school. The Bank also uses the data to estimate the share o fparticipants
with relatively highincomes, but who are still receiving transfers from the Program.

Designfor ImpactEvaluationfor Components

5.      Employment offices. The employment offices (EO) component i s at an early stage o f
conception and operations. Beginningin2005, the Ministry o f Labor started receiving initial
proposals from municipalities requesting support to set-uphtrengthen employment offices. The
Employment Services Unit (ESU) revises and discusses the proposals with the municipal teams
untilthey reachan agreement for implementation. Bythe endof2005, agreements hadbeen
concluded with 50 municipalities and some level o f service was being provided inabout 10.

6.     Municipalities are responsible for setting-up and managing the employment office with
technical assistance from ESU(including furniture, computers, training, Operational Manuals
and training materials). Service provision will greatly depend on each office's degree o f
organization, commitment, and staff quality. The service package includes: labor history
interviews, 8-hour workshops for labor orientation and active job search, placements in
professional training courses, subsidized employment or basic education completion. Since the
process i sjust starting, only the overall effect o fthe employment services will be considered. An
index o f attention to the beneficiary couldbe constructed dependingon the activities s/he i s
undertakingwith the employment office.

7.      The Bank has agreed with the Government on an evaluation strategy. The proposed
evaluation would estimate employment service participants' probability o f leaving
unemployment compared to several reference groups:
        -   transition from unemployment to employment comparedwith the similar average rate
            inthe EPH(including analysis per income decile);
        -   transition from unemployment to employment comparedwith eligible individuals in
            EPHwho do not participate inthe Heads o f Households Program (according to
            estimates made from EPH data, up to 50 percent o f individuals presently eligible are
            not covered by the Program);
        -   exit from unemployment o fHeads o f Household Program participants inneighboring
            localities with similar job markets and no employment office;
        -   exit from unemployment o f EPHrespondents, matched by gender, age and labor
            history (usingthe methodology inBlundellet a1.28,matching participants usingthe
            EPHquestionnaire andpossibility usingthe panel data available inthe EPH).

8.      Component of Construction Sub-Proiects. To increase their employability, participants in
the municipal works activity under Component A would take professional training courses
administered by a qualified institutions, including unions o f construction workers.. At the end of
the 4-month session, beneficiaries who successfully complete the course requisites receive an
unemployment insurance booklet with a certification as "traditional buildingworker".
Completion o f the course and certification with the booklet are supposed to improve their
insertion into the labor market. The Ministry o f Labor has already piloted these activities under
the on-going Project. The evaluationwould identify a control group for those participating in
this activity. Onepossible approach would be to identify a control group, for example,
unemployed construction workers as identified inthe EPH, or beneficiaries working on similar

activities, but without training and certification. The fact that the Ministry o f Labor will have the
lists of participants, including: CUIL (ID number), Name, Project's ID and name, month o f
selection for the course, month o fregistration and course starting date ifapplicable, may also
make it possible to follow-up these individuals inother registries to monitor their employment
status.

9.       The steps inthe proposed impact evaluation include: (i) administrative data to
                                                                    review
identify possible locations to carry out the evaluation; (ii) a questionnaire similar to the

labor markets for constructionworkers; and (iv) evaluation o f the feasibility o f fieldwork in
different localities.

                              Annex 5: ImplementationArrangements
                      ARGENTINA: Headsof HouseholdTransitionProject


Legal Framework

1.      Presidential Decree No. 565102 established the Heads o f HouseholdProgram, defined the
eligibility criteria, and defined the roles o fthe MinistryofLabor, the municipalities, and local
consultative councils in its implementation The Government has extended the Program three
times, most recently through 2006.

2.      The main objectives o fthe new strategy to reorient the Heads o fHousehold Program
included inDecree 1506/04 are:

        To promote a culture o fwork among those beneficiaries capable o f working, promoting
        their insertion into the labor market, and orienting the Program towards that goal.
        To decrease the vulnerability of families who are structurally so disadvantaged that an
        income supplement alone does not improve their potential to better their human
        development. Insuch cases the program should be centered on promoting improvements
        inthe quality oflife for children, particularly ineducation andhealth, including
        improving the education o fthe mothers inorder to improve their employment prospects.
        To extend untilDecember 2005 the National Employment Emergency and the Heads o f
        Household Program (the time period has been extended to the end o f 2006).

        The ministries o f Labor and Social Development shouldjointly carry out a classification
o f the beneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household Program definingthe prerequisites andprofiles
that beneficiaries moving to other programs should meet. Those beneficiaries classified as being
more employable would continue to receive assistance from the Ministry o f Labor, including all
activities that have to do with insertion into the labor market (temporary employment, training,
and promotion o f private employment). Those beneficiaries who are not classified as having
possibilities o f employment would be incorporatedinto programs directed at vulnerable groups,
income support and human development created or to be created inthe Ministryof Social
Development.

Heads of HouseholdProgram

ComponentA: Heads of HouseholdSub-projectsI(Community Services andWork,
Training, andBasicEducation)

4.      The organization and control of sub-projects i s largely a municipal responsibility, with
the exception o f activities which are supported by the Ministry of Labor or sponsored by national
agencies, like for example the Ministry of Health. They consist primarily o f community services
(working insoup kitchens, schools, health centers, etc.) or performing municipal services
(maintenance o fbuildings, cleaning o fpublic spaces, etc.). Proposals can be made by
municipalities or organizations o f civil society and are to be presented to the municipal
consultative council for review. The council has the responsibility to authorize acceptable



                                                   50

proposals, with the objective o f increasingsocial control, as well as ensuring the relevance o f the
sub-projects to local needs. The mayor gives final approval. Beneficiaries are called by either
municipalities or civil society organizations and assigned to these activities. There i s no outside
technical evaluation. The agencies sponsoring proposals are responsible for ensuring the
availability of materials needed for the activities and monitoring the attendance o f the workers.

5.      An important aim of the Transition Strategy is to increase the number o fparticipants who
improve their employability by undertaking activities designed to try to help them get jobs.
Examples would include:

        a) Training:completing basic education and participating intraining, combining the
            work requirement with on-the-job training,
       b) Community works:participatinginsub-projects designed to provide experience and
            skills for future employment.
        c) Community services: participating insub-projects designed to provide experience and
            skills for future employment

6.      Before Heads of Householdparticipants are assigned to these sub-projects (a, b, c), they
are interviewed to ensure that they can be directed to an activity that would be most beneficial to
them and that i s as much as possible inaccordance with their experience and interests. In
addition to the standard monthly payment to beneficiaries, the project would finance necessary
inputs and additional per diempayments inorder to facilitate participation inthe activities, that
would generally involve more than the minimum20 houdweek work requirement stipulated in
the Program, as well as some out o fpocket expenses (transportation, baby-sitting, for example).
The extrapayments would not exceed AR$SO/month andwould be limitedto 6 months (8
months for basic education classes). After the activity finishes, beneficiaries would be required
to actively search for ajob, assisted and supervised by the local employment office. Inorder to
ensure transparent and efficient use o f the limitedresources assigned inthe loan to cover per
diems, the OperationalManual for this component includes the following requirements:

        a) Ensure that the sponsoring agency has an open process o f ensuringthe participation
            o f interested beneficiaries.
        b) Calculate the amount o fper diem to bepaidbased on local conditions andthe
            characteristics o f the activity.
        c) Distinguishthe payment o fper diem from the monthly transfer.
        d) Consider the municipal performance inmanagingthe Heads of Household Program
            (numberassignedto workfare, numberleavingthe program for employment, record
            on other components, etc.), before organizing an activity.
        e) Have a goal o f labor market insertion o f at least 20 percent o f the participants o f each
            activity. A labor market insertion goal o f approximately 20 percent will be requested
            for projects whose beneficiaries receive per diempayments. The goal can be adjusted
            considering local labor market conditions. Those projects which have the highest
            insertion goals will be given priority.
        9 Not exceedAR$50 inthetotalper diemamount provided to the participantsbythe
            Ministry, inthe case that the municipality is able to offer cash per diem.




                                                  51

            Ensurea close monitoring and follow-up system,including amethodo fcertifying
            attendance o f the participants.
            Have inplace an efficient way o f recovering any per diem already provided, ifno
            beneficiary participates.
            Include no objectionby the Bank o f any activity with cash payment o f per diem.

No beneficiary would be allowed to participate inactivities including cash per diempayments
more than once duringthe Project implementation period.

7.       TrainindBasic Education. Eligible training activities under the Heads o f Household
Transition Program include two lines: professional training and completion ofbasic education
(adult education classes certified bythe Ministry o f Education as well as through existing
capacity inprimary education). On training, the Ministry o f Labor, within the framework o f
integrated agreements with provinces or sectors, identifies relevant areas, taking into account
local economic activities, prospects for employment growth, and the quality o fthe training
institutions. Inorder to promote the completion o f education levels for beneficiaries, the
available supply i s taken into consideration, as well as the interest o f the province inpromoting
the activity.

8.       Once projects are approved, agreements are signed with the provinces and/or sectors in
which the goals, conditions for the incorporationo fbeneficiaries into training activities or for
completion o fbasic education, and the responsibilities o f the different parties involved are set
forth. All agreements would include the following mandatory items: dissemination andpublic
notification, professional guidance, training, andjob search support. The provinces or
municipalities will select administrative units which will be responsible for gathering and
consolidating information on both the training activities and the participants. Each
administrative unit will send the information to the provincial Ministry o f Labor office, which
will enter the data inthe ministry's Management Information System(MIS, via intranet). This
will facilitate the availability o finformation onthe quantity, type and execution period o f the
courses and education completion activities. The information on the supply o f services would be
transferred to the municipal employment offices or similar authorities, who will collaborate in
the selection o fbeneficiaries to participate inthe activities. The informationwould enable
monitoring the progress o f each beneficiary enrolled ineither training courses or basic education,
and for the latter to determine not only attendance, but also learning results at each level. For
those beneficiaries receiving per diem (scholarships), information, particularly on attendance,
would beupdated monthly, as it would be linkedto payment. The Ministry o f Labor will transfer
resources to finance materials and teaching hours. The Ministryo f Labor will supervise actions
inthe field andwould release the funds inaccordance with the progress made.

9.       Community Work. These are small, labor-intensive projects (less than AR$lOO,OOO per
project, with a few exceptions up to AR$135,000) for construction or rehabilitation o f small
social infrastructureworks. The costs (workers' wages andpart o f the cost o f materials up to a
maximum o f 70 percent) would be financed by the proposedloan. Municipalities, either
individually or incooperationwith other groups, or national institutions could propose sub-
projects. Institutions that want to participate inany area will previously register inthe Registry
for Training and Employment Institutions (REGICE). All sub-projects inthis subcomponent



                                                  52

will be evaluated byprofessionals (mainly engineers or architects hiredby the provincial offices
o f the Ministryo f Labor) according to a methodology which i s specified inan Operational
Manual and incorporates economic, technical, financial, institutional, environmental, and social
aspects. The sub-projects duration would be 6 months, plus an optional extra 2 months for job
search. For about 30 percent o f sub-projects, evaluationwould include a site visit. Ifa sub-
project receives a positive technical evaluation, it can be financed under the Program. Localities
will be selected primarily based onwhether working on these sub-projects would bring clear full-
timejobs opportunities which would be influencedby local labor market conditions, future plans
for public investment projects, etc.

10.     An agreement signed betweenthe Ministryo fLabor and the municipality would specify
the procurementprocedures to be followed for purchases and documentationwould bekept at
the municipality for review duringsub-project supervision and audits. Since the goods to be
purchased would be standard, common construction materials, during evaluation they would also
be compared against the unit cost database. All o fthe sub-projects would be supervised at least
two times duringimplementation. Reimbursementswould be made intwo stages: 80 percent to
bepaid 10days after constructionhas begun, and 20 percent once the work is finished, and on
condition that they have met the prior agreement on the number o fworkers placed injobs.

11.     Communitv Services. Sub-project proposals would be submitted by municipalities,
national agencies, civil society organizations, or other eligible organizations, according to
standard formats contained inan OperationalManual agreed with the Bank. There i s a technical
evaluation, considering the experience o f the sponsoring agency and the pertinence o f the
activity to the needs o f the community and the beneficiaries. The Ministry o f Labor has the
responsibility to authorize acceptable proposals, with the objective o f improving the
employability o fbeneficiaries, as well as helpingcontrol to ensure the relevance o f the sub-
projects to local needs. These sub-projects would be supervised a minimumo f three times during
implementation (duration ofprojects likely to be no more than 6 months) by staff inthe
provincial offices o f the Ministry o f Labor.

12.     Management o f Beneficiary Registry. The Ministry o f Labor maintains the beneficiary
registry. Information was consolidated from data collected by municipalities and other
organizations during 2002 and the first halfo f 2003, before the Programwas closed to new
entrants. It i s the responsibility o f the municipality to review and to keep on file the
documentationproving eligibility. With the aim o f improvingthe quality o f the beneficiary
registry and enforcing eligibility criteria, before payment is authorized, routine monthly cross-
checks o f the registry are carried out centrally with key databases (formal private and public
employees, pensioners, other social programs, tax lists, and health insurance beneficiaries). In
late 2003 and early 2004, the Ministrychecked internal consistency within the registry, and as a
result, droppedbeneficiarieswithout minor dependents from the program, and corrected
situations such as the same child being claimed by more than one beneficiary and the benefit
beingclaimed by bothhusbandand wife. Underthe proposedProject, these efforts would be
strengthenedby incorporating additional databases.

13.     The Programhas procedures for updating information onbeneficiaries. The process is
initiated by the municipality, with each type o f change governed by an established procedure and



                                                   53

backedup by the appropriate documentation. Each municipality presents the updated
information to t h e provincial office o f the Ministry o f Labor, which centralizes all of the
information within its jurisdiction. Within the provincial office there i s one person authorized to
send the information via e-mail to the central databasekeptby the ministry.The different
operations include updating family information and recovering previous suspensions from
payment by providing additional or missinginformation. The project will support further
improvements inthe beneficiary registryin order to identify and drop from the Program
ineligible participants. These efforts will mainly involve the updating and completion o f the data
inthe beneficiary registryfor the Heads ofHouseholdProgram, usingthe information collected
for identification of beneficiaries who are eligible to be transferred to the conditional transfer
program.

14.      Since mid-2003, and as the beneficiary registry was improved, the ministryhas also made
more information available to municipalities and also to individuals. The following information
i s available in t h e registry via the internet at the level of municipality, province, and the country:

      -      Beneficiary Data: age, sex, address, workfare project, history of the payment,
            reasons for beingdropped or suspended from the Program or suspension. Work i s in
            process to incorporate the results o f the employment interview.

      -      Project Data: Location, number ofbeneficiaries, start date, participants assigned,
             supervision visits. Information is aggregated on projects.

15.      Beneficiary Payments. An important reform inthe implementation o fthe Programhas
been implementation of payment ina bank by use o f a debit card. The proposed loan would only
finance beneficiaries beingpaid by a bank debit card. InM a y 2004, the Government started to
switch the payment system from monthly checks to bank debit cards. The transition to debit card
payments i s now complete; less than 10 percent o f all beneficiarieswould continue receiving
their payment through abankbecausethey live inisolatedareas. Implementation of the reform
has gone smoothly. ASa result of the change, there has been a noticeable drop incomplaints
relatedto payments coming into the Call Center and a drop inrequests for an individual other
than the beneficiary to claim the payment Ina survey o f 3,657 beneficiaries in 7 provinces
which account for about 60 percent o fbeneficiaries o f the program, about two thirds o f those
surveyed saw the use of the debit card as a positive change because it avoid having to wait in
long lines at the bank, cash machines were generally nearby, and it was safer. Monitoringthe
use of cards has shown that gradually more beneficiaries are usingthe card as a mechanism to
make purchases periodically, instead of cashing the monthly benefit all at once.

 16.     The Ministry of Labor makes arrangements for the monthly payments to beneficiaries
directlythrough the creditingo fthe accounts of the beneficiaries associated with their debit
cards. The supportingdocumentation(showing that the beneficiaries' accounts have been
credited) i s kept at the bank and subject to audit by the national audit agency (AGN). A
summary of that information i s sent to the Ministry o f Labor and usedto prepare the
disbursementrequest to the Bank




                                                      54

17.     Svstem for ComplaintslAccusations o f Fraud (CODEM: Commission for Fraud for
Emplovment Prom-ams) and Call Center (0800). There have been improvements inmanagement
of the system for handling complaints and accusations o f fraud inthe Program. It now operates
more through the internet, procedures have been simplified and shortened, and localities can
access information to check on the stage o fprocessing o f complaints intheir own area. The
work i s also better coordinated with the Call Center which i s the main source o f channeling fraud
accusations inthe Program. Inthe past the 0800 system receivedboth requests for information
and fraud accusations. There have beenpersistent problems for individuals to access the system.
At peak times (payment times) the system was only able to respond to 15 percent o fthe calls,
andmany individuals were neverable to get through.

18.     Now a system o f standard messages has beendeveloped to answer frequently asked
questions usingtaped responses (for example, dates o fpayment according to IDnumbers). A
system working with CODEM, a standard format for taking accusations o f fraud has been
prepared to ensure that enough information i s collectedto follow up a claim o f fraud. Access to
make an accusation of fraud i s through the Call Center, directly to the CODEM (via e-mail or
personally), and inthe provincial offices o f employment. Local consultative councils also can
receive accusations o f fraud, and then pass them to either CODEM or the provincial offices of
employment.

ComponentB: Headsof HouseholdProductiveSub-projectsI1

19.     The Program would finance materials and payments for productive activities for groups
of beneficiaries. The projects are proposedby groups o fbeneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household
Program (no fewer than three members) and are revisedby the municipal councils. Beneficiaries
submit proposals through municipalities (and on an exceptional basis, through non-governmental
organizations) to the provincial offices o f the Ministryo f Labor. For no less than 30 percent o f
the projects a site visit canbe carried out as part o fthe ex-ante evaluation. The total amount that
can be financed through the project for materials (inputsand equipment) cannot exceed
ARS$15,000. Exceptionally, projects could be approved as long as a minimumo f two Heads of
Householdbeneficiaries are participating inthe project, inwhich case the maximum amount o f
financing through the project would be ARS$lO,OOO.

20.     Approval o f the proposal would be subject to a technical evaluation, following a
methodology acceptable to the Bank, and including a cost-benefit analysis, determination o f
probable sustainability o f the activity, environmental impact, prior experience o f the
beneficiaries, commercializationplans, if applicable, and the amount and form (incash or in
kind)of the contribution o fbeneficiariesto the activity. Once approved, an agreement is
prepared which would be signedbetween the municipality and the Ministry o f Social
Development. The funds would then be transferred to the municipality. The agreement includes
the procurement regulations that the municipality needs to follow when purchasing the goods for
the projects and it is responsiblefor delivery to the beneficiaries.

21.     Municipalities procure the materials on behalf o fthe beneficiaries, following Bank
procurement guidelines, and deliver them to the groups. Both the municipalities and the projects
are supervised duringthe project after resources are transferred to the municipalities. In



                                                  55

addition, technical assistancei s provided to the participants working inthe activities for at least 6
months and efforts are made to link as many as possible to sources o f subsequentcredit
financing. All beneficiaries receiving financing for carrying out aproductive project underthis
component would be encouraged to enroll inthe Registero f Participants inLocal Development
and the Social Economy (Decree 189/2004). The number o fproductive projects whose
participants are registeredwould be monitored.

22.     As part o fthe national strategy to promote participation inthe formal economy by
disadvantaged groups, the Government created the National Register o f Participants inLocal
Development and the Social Economy (Decree 189/2004). All beneficiaries receiving financing
for carrying out a productive project under this component would be encouraged to register and
the number o fregistrationswould betracked. Thenumbero fparticipantsregistering will be an
important indicator, as it will be very difficult, ifnot impossible, for enterprises to sell their
goods or services on any reasonable scale unless they can provide receipts. Enterprises will also
not be able to pass on the value added tax charged on their inputs (cloth, for example, for
clothing businesses) unless they are registered, which would seriously jeopardize their ability to
record any profits on sales.

23.     Inorder to register (and to continueto maintainthe benefits outlinedbelow) an
individual's gross annual sales cannot exceed AR$12,000. Once registered, the individual i s
incorporated into the regimenfor the "social" self-employed individual, contributing half o f the
minimumpayment (currently AR$12.25/month), andas longas theyremain inthe register (up to
a maximum o f 24 months), they are able to:

        a) Provide receipts;
        b) Obtainhealth insurance with services equivalent to any other self-employed through
           the union-sponsored healthplans (and with an additional payment for other family
           members); and
        c) Receive recognition o f this period o f time as employment for purposes o f retirement.

24.     The component beganto be implementedunder the previous Heads ofHousehold Project
inJanuary 2004. Attached is atable providinginformation onthe distribution ofactivities as of
December 2005. About 86 percent o f the projects are concentrated inthe categories o f agro-
industrialproducts, agriculture/fishing, goods production (not relatedto food), and
services/commerce. About 60 percent o f the participants are women.

                   Types of Projects




25.    An ex-post review o f a sample o f similar activities financed under the previous Project
was undertaken. The findings must be considered preliminary as the projects were commencing
their activities. The report showed that:

       a) It was difficult for beneficiaries to associate among themselves. Groups require
             strengtheningprior to the initiation o fthe program, because their organization was
            weak.
       b) There was confusion about what would happen after the duration o fthe project
             (financing) ended, including uncertainty about the ownership o f the tools and inputs
             received and concern about the possible loss o f the monthly transfer from the
             program.
        c) Some municipalities had created an area to support productive activities and they
             provided technical assistance to the project, but more often municipalities had little
             capacity to assist inproject formulation. Insome cases, the omission o f a key
             element could prejudice the project's implementation (tools, space, security, safety
             norms, seasonality). These same factors reflect the need to adjust some of the
             evaluation criteria and to make visits to projects and beneficiaries part o fthe
             evaluation process.
        d) Obtaining the necessary 3 price quotes for materials was sometimes difficult, but at
             the same time important for the beneficiariesto carry out.
        e) All projects visited were weak on commercialization. The ex-post revision
             emphasized that inorder for these activities to compete inthe market, they had to be
             able to provide receipts. The project should help the inscription o fthese beneficiaries
             intheregister for social self-employed.
        f, Prior experience ofthebeneficiariesinthe activities ofthe company is keyto the
             viability and sustainability o f employment. This factor should be givenmore weight
             inthe evaluation.
        g) Changes inthe project cycle o fthe component should be considered inorder to reflect
             more realistically how implementation i s occurring (transfer o f resources to the



                                                   57

            municipality, time lapsed for purchases by the municipality, delivery to the
            beneficiaries, organization o f the work space, provision o f technical assistance to the
            projects, etc.).
            Insome cases, beneficiaries were not satisfied withthepurchases madebythe
            municipality. It i s recommended that beneficiaries should be more involved inthe
            purchases.
            Currently most beneficiaries are working part-time inother activities that are
            generatingincome.
            Inpart ofthe sample ofprojects visited, the number ofbeneficiariesparticipating had
            dropped; some had only two left, and insome others beneficiaries were absent.
            There i s a need to strengthentechnical assistance to the projects and to extend its
            provision for a longer period o ftime.

26.     Inaddition, animpact evaluation usingamethodology agreedwiththe Bank is being
undertaken. The first round o f the field work was done inDecember 2004/January 2005, and the
second phase was carried out inNovembedDecember 2005. The survey included over 100
projects covering around 300 beneficiaries (treatment group), selected from among those projects
for which transfers hadbeen made to the municipality no later than September 2004. Results
from the second phase should be available by March 2006. The analysis carried out inJanuary
2005 showed:

         a) Seventy five percent o fthe projects had not received the materials. Among those
           who had received them, 55 percent had problems, mainly (67 percent) the poor
            quality o fpurchases.
        b) Although 95 percent stated they hadno problems associating as a group, 64 percent
            o f the projects had fewer than 3 beneficiaries.
         c) Ofthose beneficiaries who reported the number o f hours worked, halfworked more
            than 20 hours inthe project.
         d) Key factors for the project are the definition o fthe project activity and the
           beneficiary's previous experience.
         e) About three quarters o fthe beneficiariesthought the project would continue and that
            they would be able to support their households with what they earned from itbesides
            acquiring work experience.

ComponentC: EmploymentServices

27.     The Ministryo f Labor has identified, usinga variety o f criteria, 100localitiesto set up
and/or strengthenmunicipal offices o f employment. The offices o f employment, through direct
contact with the municipalities, will carry out dissemination and promotion activities inorder to
strengthen the offices o f employment. The potential offices identified will be given an
institutional diagnosis to identify their needs. The municipalities will prepare a project based on
this diagnosis. Proposals for strengthening will be submitted bythe municipalities to the
provincial offices o f the Ministry o f Labor, accompanied by a diagnosis o f the situation of each
office. The proposals will be registered ina management system and will bepublishedinthe
Ministryo fLabor's website. The coordinatingunit for the component will evaluate the
proposals inaccordance with the conditions established inthe Operational Manual for the unit.



                                                  58

There will be an agreementbetween each municipality and the Ministryo f Labor that will set up
the framework for project execution, including the results expected indifferent categories
(interviews, labor orientation courses, etc.), as well as the standards o f service to be provided.

28.     The maximum duration of eachproject would be 12months. Those proposals approved
would receive, from the coordinating unit inthe Ministry o f Labor, technical assistance and
training inareas identified as needingstrengthening inthe municipal proposal, equipment,
software for management and service provision, and short-term consultancy services contracted
according to the needs of each project. Inturn, the municipality would promise to guarantee a
certain number o f basic services for the beneficiaries o fthe program: to get information on their
labor history, supervised job search, short workshops onjob search or labor orientation and/or
referrals to other available activities (job placement, support for self-employment, training,
completion o f basic education, placement intemporary work). The offices would be supervised
by the staff o fthe Ministryo fLabor, including staffinthe provincial Ministry o fLabor offices,
no less than three times.

ComponentD: GovernanceImprovementandMonitoring& Evaluation

29.     The enhanced governance structure o fthe Heads o fHouseholdProgram (supported by
the proposed Project through various activities described inthe main text) coincides with a
strengthening o f Ministry of Labor's system o f supervision. This i s especially important given
the expected transfer of at least 20 percent o f beneficiaries over the next 12 months to the
Familias program, the promotion by the Ministryo f the update o f the information inthe
beneficiary registry, as well as the increasing focus on provision o f employment services and
projects to improve employability. First,the supervisors will be placed inthe provincial offices
of employment, and second, instead o f focusing on monitoring beneficiary registries and
workfare activities, they would supervise the total range o f activities in support o f employment
being implementedwithin the municipality. These changes would imply a revision o f norms,
operatingprocedures, as well as the profile o f the supervisors. Some activities would be
maintained. On a selective basis, beneficiary registries could still be monitored, but on a case-
by-case basis, because of accusations of fraud, requests byjudges, and other needs identified
through Program management and monitoring. Periodic supervision ofprojects with financing
of materials (both productive and others) would continue under the proposed loan, as described
underthese components.

Summary of FinancialManagementAssessment

1.      The assessment of the financial management system for the Project was carried out in
April 2005 to determine whether the systems (accounting, financial reporting, internal controls,
auditing and staffing) could berelied on to provide to the Bank accurate and timely information
regarding Project resources and expenditures.

2,      The proposed Financial Management (FM) arrangements are considered adequate and the
Borrower has sufficient capacity and resources to implementthe proposedProject. Additional
fiduciary measures are designedto mitigate the identifiedrisks.

3.      The Ministry o f Labor (ML)is the agency responsible for the FMfunctions o fthe
Project. MLwill be incharge o f accounting, disbursementsfrom the Bank, Special Account
(SA)management, and financial reporting. The MLwill also beresponsible for the Project's
flow o f funds. MLi s responsible for keepingsupporting documentation and proper payments
registration in its financial information system(Sistemade Informacion Financiera - SIDIF).
FMstaffing was reviewedand considered adequate.

4.      The MLhas a dedicated group o fpeople that are carrying out financial management
functions on the on-going Loan 7157-Social Protection VI-the Heads o f Household Project.
They also have experience implementing the previous Loan 4366-Social Protection I11Project
(284 million dollars - Approved 1998 -Closed 2002). On financial management aspects, the
Project's arrangements draw upon experience with, and lessons from these Projects.

CountryIssues

5.      The Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) preparedbythe Bank in
2003-2004, states that at the central level, the Government o f Argentina has a fully integrated
budget, accounting, treasury, and public debt financial management system. These systems
control the funds received by the central Government from any source and provide sufficient
information to determine ifthe funds were utilized as planned. A CFAA update i s ongoing.

6.      A FMissue raised inthe Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), issued inJanuary 2004, was
the chronic problem o f late submissiono faudit reports to the Bank. This issue is being
addressedby the Bank at a portfolio level and through an IDF grant to strengthen the institutional
capacity o f the Auditovia General de la NaciBn (AGN), the Borrower's Auditor General Office.
However, inthe ML case, audit performance under the ongoing Project i s satisfactory with
timely submission and clean opinions.

7.      The International Monetary Fundissued an experimental Report on the Observance o f
Standards and Codes (ROSC) for Argentina inApril 1999. The section on fiscal transparency
commented that, based upon the description o fpractices provided by the authorities and
summarized inthe report, Argentina has achieved a highdegree o f fiscal transparency, This i s a

   Strengths and Weaknesses

   10.      Strengths: The MLhas implemented and i s implementing several workfare-type
   employment programs; there are experienced staff and adequate systems to administer and
   operate this kind of Program. Specific budget lines to execute the Program within the Integrated
   FMsystem (SIDE)will be used for Project execution, establishing a clear separation between
   the Heads o fHousehold Transition Project funds and the rest o fthe ministry'sprograms.

   11.      Weaknesses: The large number and wide geographical distribution o f beneficiaries could
   make fiduciary control activities, Project supervision and external audit work difficult. Inorder
   to deal with this increased difficulty, the ongoing Project, through the additional audit work on a
   continuous engagement basis (concurrent external audit), provides a permanent assessment o f the
   Program's performance inFMmatters, facilitating also the auditor's work on the annual
   financial statements. This practice will be continued under the proposed Project.

   Audit Arrangements

    12.     The Project i s expected to use the audit services o f the Argentine Supreme Audit
   Institution,Auditovia Geneval de la NaciBn (AGN) as was the case inthe ongoing executing


                                                      62

Heads of Household Project. For the Heads o fHousehold Project the financial management
arrangements included a concurrent audit on the remuneration o f temporary workers and
transfers to municipalities under Terms o f Reference acceptable to the Bank. This concurrent
audit has been carried out by the Argentine SupremeAudit Institution (SAI), Auditoria General
de la Nacidn (AGN) and contributed through its work to facilitate the issuingo f an audit opinion
on the Heads o f HouseholdProject financial statements. The concurrent audit looks at a
significant sample to reach a representative proportion o f operations. From time to time issues
are identified and reflected inthe audit report, but do not materially affect the financial
statements and auditors opinion. The last opinion issued by the AGN i s clean and was submitted
on time (on 2004 project financial statements, SOEs and Special Account). Audit findings have
not beenconsidered significant and therefore do not affect the audit opinion. The opinion to be
requiredon the annual audit will comprise the Financial Statement, SOEs, and Special Account
opinion, and a section on compliance with legal and financial clauses and internal controls.

13.     Issues on the Elinibilitv o f Beneficiaries. Questions on the capacity o f the municipalities,
to deliver workfare activities, have been raised by different sources. To supplementthe
supervision carried out under the current project by the Ministry o f Labor, this Project will
incorporate random Bank spot supervision of municipal administration o f the Heads o f
HouseholdPrograms, including confirmation o fparticipation inworkfare or other eligible
activities.

14.     As part of the ongoing Project, as an effort to increase transparency inpayments to
individual beneficiaries, the payment system for beneficiaries has moved from cash payments to
the use of individual debit cards. This change limitsthe possibility o f intermediation and abuse
of the payment system. Terms-of-References o fthe concurrent audit were adjusted to adequately
cover external independent oversight o f the card distribution process, and the transfer o f funds to
beneficiaries' accounts in the Banco de la Nacibn Argentina. The move to the use o f debit cards
lowered the cost o fbeneficiary payments from 1.4 to 1.3 Argentine pesos per transfer. The
TORSwill also include follow up on the claims o fcardholder reposition comparing them with
local bank standards. AGN had a proactive role inoverseeing the process bywhich the credit
cards have been delivered to the beneficiaries and there have not been indications o f abuse or
fraud.

Financial Reporting

15.     The financial statements inthe ongoing Project are comprehensive and reflect the
financial position o f the entire Program, an improvement from previous Bank-financed Projects
(Social Protection 111)which only reflectedpartially the program, disclosing only the portion
underBank financing. The Heads o fHouseholdProject has satisfactorily submitted the required
FMRsfor reportingpurposes (for disbursement the ongoing Project uses insteadofFMRs,the
traditional disbursementmethodbased on SOEs). The SOEs for the category o f remuneration
for temporary workers reflect the amount paid to beneficiaries complying with the workfare
requirement,based on the informationreportedby municipalities and consolidated inthe MIS of
theMinistryof Labor. This is a subset o fthe monthly paymentsmade to all beneficiaries. This
information i s imperfect. It i s only a partial listing o f those complying with the work
requirement, i s subject to administrative errors and may not be fully up-to-date. Nevertheless,



                                                    63

based on experience under the ongoing Project and periodic visits carried out during supervision
by Bank staff (see maintext, Box l), level of error is well within the highest disbursement
                                         the
rate envisaged against this category (60 percent). For this operation a new format o f SOE will be
used summarizing the payments to eligiblebeneficiaries. The Ministryo f Labor will keep all
supporting documentation to justify the figures presentedinthe SOE. This documentation will be
reviewedinthe annual external audit and its appropriateness will be the subject o f a separate
audit opinion inthe annual audit report. Inaddition, the lists o fbeneficiaries presented inthe
SOEs will be cross-checked with the entries inthe relevant Ministry o f Labor databases to ensure
the matching o f names by the Government. Any anomalies which are identified would be
promptly followed up. Inaddition, the Bank would continue to carry out periodic spot checks in
the field to confirm the reliability o fthe information inthe MIS system o fthe Ministryof Labor
and follow-up on any irregularity during supervision visits.

16.     MLwill preparethe following FinancialMonitoringReports: (i)summary ofuses and
                                                                           a

and (iii)progress monitoring reports, all in accordance with formats which have been agreed.
Additionally, MLwill be responsible for Project accounting, timely submission o f the Financial
Management Reports-FMRs, and for preparing annual Project financial statements in line with
Bank requirements.

17.     MLwillberesponsible for the financial management oftheProject, includingflow of
funds, keeping supportingdocumentation andproper payments registrationinits own SIDIF
system. Annual audits will cover all these aspects o f Project implementation. The FMRs will be
submittedquarterly to the Bank.

Accounting Policies

18.     MLwill maintainthe accounts for theProject inits ownaccounting systemwiththe chart
o f accounts reflecting the categories and components o fthe Project. Also, MLwill maintain an
adequate asset register for the Project. The accrual basis will be used for internal reporting and
the FMRsthat will be prepared. The accountingsystem will bethe same usedfor the SP VI-
Heads o f Household Project.

19.      The public sector accounting standards inArgentina will be followed. The public sector
accounting rules are comprehensive and consistent with public international standards. Said
standards are set by the Contaduria General de la Nacidn (CGN).

FundsFlow Disbursement Arrangements
               -

20.     PacingDisbursements with the Extent o f Compliance with the Work Requirement. The
proposedProject would build ina mechanismto pace disbursements inline with trends in
compliance inthe overall Heads o f HouseholdProgram with the work (or training and education
activities) as required for the various components. This reflects the importance the Bank
attaches to the work requirement and provides an incentive to the Government to continue efforts
to improve the Program on a variety o f fronts, including enforcing controls over eligibility
requirements, promoting the timely transfer o f eligible beneficiaries to Familias, and expanding



                                                  64

employment support activities and insisting on participation. Disbursements would start at the
rate o f 40 percent, with a baseline compliance with the workfare requirement o f 55 percent. The
disbursementrate would increase to 55 percent ifcompliance reaches 60 percent (second
condition), and ifthe compliance rate exceeds 65 percent, would rise to 60 percent (first
condition). The calculation of compliance with the work requirement i s based on the results
from the Permanent Household Survey, adjusted by administrative data for activities, such as
training courses not covered by the survey (See Annex 1, Table A1-2). The disbursement
mechanism to be usedi s based onjustification o f expenditures (SOEs), the details o fwhich are
described above.

21.      Disbursementswill bemadeon the basis of SOEs against eligible expenditures, which
would cover payments o f remuneration and per diems o f temporary workers inthe Heads o f
Household Program, the materials financed for selected sub-projects, goods for project
management and the employment offices, and consulting services. The documentation on the
payments to beneficiarieswill be submittedto the Bank with the information on the payments
made to the beneficiaries submittedbythe payment agency to the Project. The subsidies to
finance materials inthe sub-projects will be paid directly by the Project Implementation Unit and
submittedfor reimbursement against the deposit to the account opened by the sub-project.
Supporting documentation for these expenditures would be maintained inthe municipalities and
would be subject to supervisionby staff o fthe MinistryofLabor or the Ministry o f Social
Development inthe case o fproductive sub-projects. They would also be subject to enhanced
audit by AGN, according to terms o freference agreed with the Bank. The preparationo f the
withdrawal applications, SOEs and the organization o f the supporting documentation i s the
responsibility o f a team inthe Ministry o f Labor, ledby an administrative officer.

22.      The project will operate a Special Account (SA) inU S dollars. As inthe ongoing
Project, the Special Account (SA) will be opened by the Borrower inBanco de la Nacidn
Argentina, and will be under control of the ML.The proposed maximum authorized allocation
for this operation i s US$35 million and i s considered adequate to cover up to three months o f
local currency operations. The Ministryof Labor would submit replenishment applications for
the Special Account on amonthly basis, or whenever 20 percent o fthe authorized allocationhas
been used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment application will be supportedby the
necessary documentation: a bank statement o f the Special Account and a reconciliation bank
statement o f the Special Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment o f the Special
Account would follow Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submittedto the Bank
for review and approval within six months o f the end o f the fiscal year.

23.      The proceeds o f the Project are expected to be disbursedover a period o f about 2 years.
The Project completion date would be June 30,2007, and the loan closing date i s December 31,
2007. Retroactive financing ofup to 20 percent o f the loan or US$70 million, would be
available to cover eligible expenditures incurred after April 1,2005, but no more than 12 months
prior to loan signing.

24.      As this Project i s a continuationo fthe previous Social ProtectionProject, the Project
Executing Unit inthe Ministryo f Labor will use the existing administrative section o f the

General

1.      A largeproportion o fthe loanwould not involveprocurement as the Bank would
reimburse the Governmentfor remuneration paid to qualified beneficiaries o f the workfare
components o f the Heads o f Household Program. Procurementfor the proposed Project would
be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated inthe
Legal Agreement. The various items under differentexpenditure categories are described and
summarized below. Regardingeach contract to be financed by the loan, the applicable
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the needfor pre-qualification when
necessary, estimated costs, prior review requirements and time frame are agreed betweenthe
Borrower and the Bank inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Planwill beupdatedat least
annually or as required to reflect the actual Project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity. The procurement procedures and Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) to
beusedfor each procurement method, as well as model contracts for goods andconsultants
procured, will be includedinthe Operational Manual (OM).

2.      Procurement of Goods: Goods to be procured would include office equipment, supplies
and materials for sub-projects. All goods estimated to cost over US$500,000 shall be procured
usingInternational Competitive Bidding(ICB). All goods estimated to cost less than
US$500,000 may beprocured inaccordance with the NCB procedures, usingNational SBD
acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for goods which cannot be grouped into larger bidding
packages and estimated to cost less thanUS$50,000 per contract, maybeprocuredusing
shopping (National/International) based on a modelrequest for quotations satisfactory to the
Bank.

3.      Advertisement: All procurement notices shall be advertised in"OJicina Nacional de
Contrataciones" (ONC) web page or inat least one local newspaper o fnational circulation. ICB
procurement notices and contract award information shall be advertised in UNDevelopment
Business online (UNDB online) and inthe Development Gateway's dg Market. ONC shall also
be used to publishinformation on awarded contracts inaccordance with provisions o fparagraphs
2.60 of the Procurement Guidelines and as mandatedby local legislation.

4.      Procurementof Consultants' Services:

        (i) itisexpectedthattheProjectwouldfinancesurveys,thedesignofa
           Firms:
technological platform for employment services, as well as a review o fprogress inestablishing
the municipal offices of employment services, to be undertakentowards the end o f the Project.
All contracts for firms wouldbeprocured using Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection(QCBS),
except for small contracts for assignments o f standard or outing nature and estimated to cost less
than US$lOO,OOO equivalent that would be procuredusingother methods such as Least-Cost
Selection (LCS) or Consultants' Qualifications (CQ). Single-source selection (SSS) procedure
maybeusedonly inexceptional cases, with prior agreement o fthe Bank, inaccordance with


                                                  67

provisions o fparagraphs 3.10 of the Consultant Guidelines, for assignments when only one firm
i s qualified or has experience o f exceptional worth, and it has been confirmed by a request o f
expressions of interest. Consultants' services to organize workshops would be selected using
LCS. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$300,000 equivalent
per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants inaccordance with the provisions
of paragraph2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines. As has beenthe case inprevious Projects, the
Ministry o f Labor intends to use the services of UNDP to assist inProject implementation,
particularly inthe area o f the contracting o f consultancy services.

         (ii)Individual Consultants: Most o fthe consulting services to be contracted would be
related to Project management, supervision o fthe sub-projects with materials co-financing,
technical assistance to beneficiary groups inproductiveprojects and support to municipaloffices
o f employment services. The consulting services mentionedabove would be providedby
individual consultants selected by comparison o f qualifications o f at least three candidates and
hired inaccordance with the provisions of Section V of the Consultant Guidelines. Individual
consultants for services with an expected duration o f six months or more would be selected as a
result o f a request of expressions of interest advertised ina national newspaper and/or ONC, and
contracts would be signed for the expected duration o f the assignment, subject to annual reviews
for performance. Contracts with individuals may only be terminated for poor performance or for
non-completion o f the work with Bank's prior agreement. The Bank would not agree to the
replacement of individual consultants terminated for other than the aforementioned reasons.

         (iii)Advertisement: ONC and/or a national newspaper shall also be used to advertise a
request of expression of interest for consulting firms or individuals, and to publishinformation
on awarded contracts inaccordance with provisions o fparagraphs 2.28 o f the Consultants
Guidelines and as mandated by local legislation. Contracts expected to cost more than
US$200,000 shall be advertised in UNDB online and indgMarket.

5.       Grants for sub-Droiects comprise financing for materials to be used for : (i) Workfare
Sub-projects , estimated to cost US$18 million, and (ii)    Sub-projects topromote Sev-
Employment estimated to amount US$18 million to cover the cost o f tools, equipment and inputs
for productive activities. Inboth cases municipalities would procure the materials, inthe case of
the latter, municipalities would procure the materials on behalf of the beneficiaries under the
review o f the PCU. Any procurement would be conducted according to the procedures specified
above following Bank guidelines. The Bank and the PCUwould conduct ex-post procurement
reviews o f funded sub-projects.

Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement

6,       The Project will be implementedby the Ministryof Labor (ML)and, inthe case of
Component B, together with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). The Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) i s inthe Ministryo f Labor. The Ministry o f Labor i s currently
implementing another Bank-financed project. The procurement unit within the PCUof the
Ministry o fLabor is staffed with a Coordinator, a LegalAdvisor, andthree Technical Experts, all
o fthem with more than nine years o f working experience. The Coordinator o f the PCUinthe
MinistryofLabor has experience inBank procurement procedures. All Technical Expertsinthe
PCU o fthe Ministryof Labor have Bank procurement experience acquired duringthe
implementationo f the current loan 7157-AR.


                                                  68

7.      The Bank Senior Procurement Specialist assigned to the Project has completed a capacity
assessment o f the existing PCUo f the Ministry o f Labor. The assessment encompassed the
review of the organizational structure for Project implementation, and o fthe interactionbetween
the Project staff responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central unit for
administration and finance. Below i s an actionplan to strengthen this department. With regard
to sub-projects, the Ministryo f Labor, through the PCU, will be responsible for: (i)  upstream,
procurement-related activities, including assessingthe implementing capacity o f the
municipalities; (ii)coordinating procurement reviews; and (iii)   preparingmanagement reports on
compliance andprior review activities. The procurement team will assess the implementing
capacity o f the selected municipalities and determine the level o f risk involved using a
methodology acceptable to the Bank. The team will update the procurement section based on the
conditions o f the new Project and on the revisedguidelines o f the current project's Operational
Manual (OM). The team and its support staff will participate in a workshop focused on ensuring
that the participating municipalities will follow the procurement arrangements set forth inthe
Loan Agreement (LA).

The overall project risk for procurement i s Average.

8.      The issues / risks concerning procurement havebeenidentified and consist of: (i)
inconsistent practices for the selection o f individual consultants which are not always inline with
the guidelines; and (ii) the PCUabsence o f aprocurement information system for monitoring
                         in
procurement activities, the existing system applies to financial data information. The limited
Bank procurement experience on the part o f the municipalities i s considered a risk. The
procurement teams will play an important role inmitigating this risk through steady technical
assistance and careful supervision. An actionplanwas agreed uponwith the Borrower,
delineating the activities to be carried out to strengthenProject implementation:

       Preparation by the PCU o f draft standard biddingdocuments for all processes (NCB and
        Shopping) for goods and request o fproposals for consultants' services would be agreed
        and included inthe Operational Manual.
       A project OMwith a specific chapter onprocurement detailing all the procedures and
        channels of responsibilities and flow o f documentation. The manual should include de
        description o f functions for the PCU's procurement staff, acceptable to the Bank and
        adopted.
       Implementation o f a procurement information system acceptable to the Bank.
       Presentation o f a proper training plan for all PCU staff,
       Improvements inthe procurement filing system.
        Submission o f procurement plan.

The Special Procurement Conditions listed in Section E would be included in the Loan
Agreement.

ProcurementPlan and GeneralProcurementNotice

9.       The PCUs prepared an overall procurement plan for the tasks to be carried out duringthe
project's implementation. This plan will be discussed during the appraisal phase andwill be used
as a model for the Project's implementation. This model procurement plan will be included inthe
OM. Procedures for institutional procurement planningwill be specified inthe OM. The Bank
will annually review the Project procurement plan and the PCUs will reviewthe plan o f
municipalities according to the number o f Sub-projects awarded to prepare an action plan and to
assess the risk level.

10.      This planhas been agreedbetween the Borrower and the project team on June 6,2005,
and i s available at the Ministry o f Labor, Avenida L.N.Alem 638, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It
will also be available inthe Project's database and inthe Bank's externalwebsite. The
Procurement Plan will be updated inagreement with the project team annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

11.      Inthe case ofconsultant contracts expected to cost more thanUS$300,000 aGeneral
Procurement Notice (GNP) i s required. The Bank will arrange for its publication in UNDB
online and indgMarket.

Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

12.      Inadditionto the prior review supervisionto becarriedout from Bank offices, one full
annual procurement supervision mission will be carried out inorder to conduct ex-post-reviews
of procurement actions. Based on the overall risk assessment, the ex-post-review field analysis
should cover a sample o f no less than 1in 10 contracts signed. Identical supervision conditions
will be followed by the PCU and based on the capacity o f the municipalities. An annual planof
visits should be submitted to the Bank for its review and approval.

13.      Procurement reviews. Inorder to ensure compliance with the procurement rules, the
participating municipalities will be subject to independent procurement reviews as often as i s


                                                                 70

determined by their risk classification. The reviews will focus on the smaller procurement
activities. The PCUwill provide the Bank with procurement records reviewed by independent
procurement experts who are acceptable to the bank no later than six months after the end of
each year. The terms of reference for the independent procurement reviews will be in
accordance with accepted standards, and specified inthe OM.

Special ProcurementConditions

14.     The following Special Procurement Conditions would be included inthe Loan
Agreement (LA): (i)     Project procurement should follow an approved procurement plan. The
Bank does not finance expenditures for goods and consultants that have not beenprocured in
accordance with the agreed provisions inthe LA and as further elaborated inthe Procurement
Plan; (ii)shopping requires comparing a minimumo f three price quotations, and (iii)    Project
procurement shall follow local regulations concerning advertising of procurement opportunities
and publications of results inthe web page o f "Oficina Nacional de Contrataciones" (ONC).

15,     Procurement records. The PCUwill maintaindetailed procurement records, reflecting
the Project's supply of goods, and consultant services, including records o f time taken to
complete key steps inthe process and procurement activities relatedto supervision, review, and
audits. These records will be maintained for at least two years after the Project's closing date.
The records for goods will include public notices, biddingdocuments and addenda, bid opening
information, bid evaluation reports, formal appeals bybidders and outcomes, signedcontracts
with related addenda and amendments, records on claims and dispute resolutions, and any other
usefulinformation. Theparticipatingmunicipalities will retain all invoices, price comparisons,
bidsreceived, bid evaluationreports, and all o fthe documentation required underthe law and
ensure that it i s readily available. The audit and procurement post-review supervision by the
Bank and by Government institutions i s particularly important because of the Sub-projects,
which would follow the normal flow of funds from the federal Government to the municipalities,
The filing, record keeping, auditing, reporting, post-review, and monitoring o fthe smaller
procurement activities are crucial for the successful application o f the funds for ensuring
economy, efficiency, and transparency.

               Annex 8: EconomicAnalysis of the Headsof HouseholdWage Rate
                       ARGENTINA: Heads of HouseholdTransitionProject

1.       The wage rate offered by workfare programs i s the key variable that determines whether
such programs achieve their main objective-to               provide temporary employment, and hence a
safety net, for those unemployedpoor that do not find alternative employment. The key
requirement i s that the wage rate offered should bebelow the wage rate which workers could
earn insimilar alternative employment, Le., informal as well as informal sector jobs for
unskilledworkers outside the workfare program.

2.       If wagerateoftheworkfareprogramweretooclose-or
            the                                                                   even above-such
alternative earnings, this would have three negative consequences. First, even employed workers
would have an incentive to join the workfare program so that the program would, for such
workers, not reduce unemployment but only shift employment between sectors. Second, public
resources which were meant to go to the unemployed poor would be diverted ifthe workers
supported could actually have another job outside the workfare program. Hence, public
resources would be usedfor those that are actually not intendedto be reached and muchmore
likely not to bepoor-hence          the program overall would be less successful intargeting the poor
than it could be. Third, a too highwage would discourage workfare participants from taking up
regularjobs when available.

3.       Inevaluatingthis design feature ofworkfare, however, it is important to notethat the
Heads of HouseholdProgram i s now no longer a classic workfare program. Infact, the proposed
project would support a downsizing o f the program. Also, the Program has been effectively
closed since M a y 2003 and the transition strategy focuses on raising employability o fthe current
beneficiaries through training, education, and redesignedworkfare activities rather than purely
providing temporary work. It i s nevertheless important that the transfer amount does not deter
those that are following the work requirement from taking up other employment.

4.       We use the following methodology and definitions for the analysis. Inorder to place the
Heads o f Household stipendinto a nationalwage context, Table A8-1below calculates (i)                       the
average hourly wage o f employed workers (covering informal and formal sector jobs) per
income decile (with `1' representing the poorest 10percent o f the population and 10representing
the wealthiest 10percent o fthe population). To arrive at hourlywages we dividedthe `full time
work' salary3' for an assumed 40 hours o f effective work per week; (ii)              the unemployment rate
perpopulation decile; and (iii) the third column, the expected hourlywage which results from
                                       in
the multiplication of the calculated hourly wage and the employment rate (1-unemployment


30 To calculate the full time salary, from data collected by the Permanent Household Survey (EPH), we use the
following definitions: (i)an individual i s employed full-time when working 35 to 50 hours per week inthe main
occupation (the one with the greater number o f hours worked). Workers with zero labor income are excluded; (ii)
the EPHdata includes take-home income information: salary minus contributions for social security plus family
supplements. Income includes salary, extra hours, daily wage, usual bonuses, tickets or vouchers, sales or
production commissions, tips. The salary does not include the extra monthly salary paid at Christmas, extraordinary
or retroactive bonuses. The data includes domestic employees; and (iii) the weights for the expansion o f the sample
correct for non-response on income from the mainoccupation.



                                                           72

rate). The latter adjustmenti s necessary to take into account that the possibility o fbeing
employed outside the workfare program i s dependent on the prevailing unemployment rate.

5       The hourlywage rate inthe Heads o f Household Programwas calculatedinthe following
way (Table A8-2). First, the actual distribution ofworkinghours ofparticipants inthe Heads o f
Household Program was calculated from the latest Permanent Household Survey(EPH, inthis
case the first semester 2005). Second, a weighted average o f the working hours was calculated
dependingon that distributionwhich resultedinan estimate o f 11.7hours ofworkfare
compliance. Third, the actual stipendo fAR$150 was adjusted for the average working hours in
the Programwhich producedan averagehourlywage o fAR$3.21. For reference, we also
include the average hourly wage for those complying with the 20-hour requirement,which then
results in an hourly wage o f AR$1.87 (assuming 80 hours per month).

6.      Lastly, the calculated average hourly wage inthe Program was placedwithin the income
distribution, comparing it to the expected hourly wage from employment. Inthe first semester of
2005, the Heads of Householdhourly wage fell betweenthe expected hourly wage o f the fourth
and fifth population decile. Assuming compliance with at least 20 hours o f work activity, the
wage rate would be slightlybelow the expected hourlywage inthe second decile.

1.       This annex summarizes the main findingsof: (i) social assessment; (ii)study o f
                                                           the                        a
several municipalities; and (iii) consultations, all o fwhich explored the views o f the main groups
involvedinthe Heads o f HouseholdProgram (public authorities, beneficiaries, civil society
organizations, private companies, and unions) on the transition strategy and, inparticular on the
implementation o f actions to improve employment possibilities for participants.

A. SOCIAL ASSESSMENT

2.       The fieldwork took place innine municipalities infour provinces (Jujuy, Salta, Mendoza,
and Buenos Aires) using semi-structured interviews with Government authorities and
businessmen,and focus groups o fbeneficiaries and civil society organizations. Ineach of the
first three provinces, two municipalities were covered -the capital and another city with a
significant number o fbeneficiaries. Inthe province o fBuenos Aires, the work took place inL a
Matanza, the municipality with the largest number o fbeneficiaries inthe country. The
objectives were to find out the opinions on the current operation o fthe Program and the
definition and implementation o f new actions, particularly those aimed at getting participants
jobs, and to use that information inthe re-design o f the Program.

3.       Members o f civil society organizations, Government authorities and beneficiaries agreed
on two important points. The first was that the Program hadplayed an important, positive role
duringthe crisis. The secondwas that there were irregularities inits implementation.

4.       Among beneficiaries,nearly all expressed the view that the Program had been and
continued to be indispensable to prevent households from falling into extreme poverty, to
provide some stability inhousehold income, and to guarantee a minimumincome, even though
the transfer amount was not sufficient. Itneeded to be supplementedby other sources o f income
(oddjobs, etc.). Many beneficiaries also described various irregularities and informalrules, For
example, although ingeneral the requirements for eligibility and continuation inthe Program
were widely known, some participants did not meet them. There were also irregularities related
to the work requirement, such as non-compliance, misinformation on which activities were
eligible, and usingit to apply clientelistic pressure. Inaddition, some beneficiaries thought that
the mechanisms o fcontrol, including procedures for registering complaints, and communication
channels were inadequate. A related comment from beneficiaries was that the local consultative
councils had limitedinfluence.

5.       Ingeneral, mostparticipants indicatedthat theywere aware o fthe formal andinformal
rules of the Program, and believed that such rules neededto be changed. However, participants
expressed the view that they were not ina position to say what changes should be made, nor
were they confident that the informal rules could be changed. When asked, most beneficiaries
responded that they had been assigned to community sewices workfare projects, ranging from
cleaning public facilities to childcare. They expressed the view that the social value o f this work
varied depending on the particular activity. Female beneficiaries expressed a higher value for



                                                  74

the work requirement than male participants, seeing it as an opportunity to establish personal
relations and to "get out o f the house".

6.      Participants said that the Programhad not promoted training activities. When
mentioned, most said they were interested intraining, but many also mentioned that they were
confronted with difficulties, including bamers, such as a lack o f resources or time, or were
ashamed to go back to school. Except for the young, most beneficiaries said that they did not
believe that training would help them find ajob. Women were more likely to express an interest
ineducation and commentedthat itwould helpthemraise their children, relatebetter with other
people, andprevent pregnancy and sickness. Those who hadparticipated intraining activities
expressed a favorable opinion of them, but the results o fthe focus groups suggested that the
opportunities for beneficiaries, either through professional training or finishing basic education,
varied greatly between provinces, and evenamong municipalities.

7.      Participants inthe focus groups expressed unfamiliarity with the option o f working on
constructionprojects. However, the mensaid that they thought it would be unfair to have to
work inthese projects because they could earn more for similar work outside the Program.
Participants said that small-scaleproductive activities could be a way out o f unemployment, but
they were aware of the challenges (having the capacity to develop into a firm, to ensuringthe
functioning o f the group, findingsales opportunities, sustaining the activity, etc.)

8.      Programparticipants expressed pessimismon the labor market: "there i s no
employment." Although most expressed a desire to stay inthe Program, they said what they
really wanted was ajob with social security and health insurance. Men and women expressed
different expectations regarding salary. Men said that they expected around AR$600/mo, while
women mentioned halfthat amount. Beneficiaries said that they felt tom between the possibility
of leaving the Program for ajob and fear that ifthey left they would be dropped from the rolls
permanently. Moreover, both men and women thought that obtaining ajob required a certain
presence and capacity that they did not have. Some participants manifested a desire to leave the
Program, but had little hope that this would be possible. Some beneficiaries said they were
ashamed o fbeinginthe Program. There was a general perception o f a lack o f alternative to the
Program because there was no employment.

9.      Most participants stressed the need for more information so that any changes would be
understood and respected by all and to reduce any anxiety about losing what they had. Many
commented that the dissemination of information would help stop irregularities. They expressed
the view that administrative procedures shouldbe streamlined and that to whom and where they
neededto report should be clarified inorder not to have to depend on anyone.

10.     Inthe interviews with businessmenmost said they had sufficient staff and would only
incorporateunskilledworkers temporarily for seasonal activities, especially agriculture. Insome
regions businessmensaid that it would be helpfulto provide more flexibility inthe regulations in
order to hireProgram participants. Their view was that the existingProgram component for
labor reinsertion was not attractive because it was too complicated. They also expressed
skepticism that unemployment could be solvedby providing employment subsidies. They
thought that employment offices would be useful if employment was growing. Inthat case, there
would be a place where profiles o f the beneficiaries would be filed and available whenever
needed. They thought that labor unions or business groups should operate these offices because


                                                 75

they were closer to the private sector. Ingeneral, businessmen expressed unfamiliarity with the
idea of circulating information on employment opportunities.

11.     Among the new actions proposed, they thought that professional training would yield the
most benefits inthe longrun, as it would help to recover a qualified labor force. They also said
that projects to promote local development and employment generation were the priority inorder
to lower unemployment. They also suggested that the name o f the Program be changed inorder
to extricate it from its previous history and the prejudice that surrounded it.

12.     There are two types o f civil society organizationswith roles within the Program: (i)
movements o f unemployed biqueteros) and (ii) groups. The focus group discussions
                                                     other
showed that there are two kinds o f unemployed groups. The first type has control over its
members, organizes its own workfare activities, and has more capacity to develop group actions.
They put emphasis on reconstructingthe culture o fwork and trying to prevent unemployment
from causing their membersto lose their identity as workers. They use the components o f the
Program, including training and construction, and are open to offers o f financing for micro-
enterprises or cooperatives for housing projects. Ingeneral they do not participate inthe
consultative councils, but appear to be willing to improve the Program. They are concerned
about the possibilities o f losing the benefit ifthe conditions o f the Program change. They
pressure for space to participate inthe control and evaluation o f the Program, acknowledging the
Government's role to propose actions. The second type o f group fights to maintain their
beneficiaries within the Program, mistruststhe intentions o f the Government and i s sure that
endingthe Programwould lead to social chaos.

13.      Other civil society organizations identify with groups such as neighbors, women, children
or senior adults, rather than with the unemployed or workers. Insome cases they specialize in
certain fields, such as training, nutrition, health, etc. These organizations bringtogether
beneficiaries which carry out the work requirement intheir institutions. Beneficiaries are
recognized as are other workers inthe agency. They complain about the same irregularities
beneficiaries do. They think that inthe past the Programwas necessary, but now it needs to
promote employment, to recognize the needs o f local employment inits training activities,
depoliticize the use o fbeneficiaries, and promote local development projects by controlling the
purchase o f influence. They are willing to help monitor the Program. While they recognize the
consultative councils as a good space for coordination, many no longer participate because they
think the councils were manipulatedbymunicipal employees.

14.     The opinions o f municipal authorities on the functioning o fthe Program did not differ
from those described above, but they expressed more awareness o fproposals for new activities,
Except for Mendoza, municipal authorities had managed the Program within the consultative
councils. The councils had focused on controls over the work requirement and had included
groups o f unemployed who otherwise would have pressured from the outside. All participants
voiced their agreement that the consultative councils should be strengthened by improving
institutional capacity and infrastructure.

15.      Municipal authorities said that community sewice activities were important because they
allowed municipalities to carry out tasks for which they did not have sufficient budget. The
authorities ratedthe activities coordinated by them better than those coordinated by civil society
organizations. Concerning the training component, they responded that these activities should be


                                                   76

strengthened and that access for the beneficiaries and bureaucratic procedures should be
simplified.They explained that these activities depend onprovincial decisions about resources.
The enthusiasm expressed varied dependingon these relationships. According to municipal
authorities, this activity was resistedby the coordinators o fneighborhood associations who
prefer beneficiaries to do community services, and threatened participants with loss o f the
benefit. Reactions towards the materials component differed. Authorities agreed that the
principal difficulties consist inrecruiting beneficiaries and keeping the work group inplace.
Those with some experience inconstruction do not want to participate for AR$150 since they
felt that it downgraded their work and qualifications. Insome cases they said they had tried to
place women inthese activities. As regards small-scaleproductive activities they agreed on the
need to obtain better assistance to helpbeneficiaries formulate projects. They insistedthat most
beneficiaries did not possess the experience or the capacity needed for these projects.

16.     With respect to focusing the program on "employability", they insistedthere was no
demand for labor. Concerningproactive measures to generate employment, they favored the
creation o f employment offices and local plans o f development formulated by municipalities.

17.     Provincialauthoritiesshared the views expressed above. Their understandingwas that
irregularities were caused by informal rules, the rapid growth o f the Program, and the lack o f an
adequate structure to carry out the controls and to organize the work requirement. They
recognized that the provincial Offices o f the Ministry o f Labor and the more recent cross-checks
of data bases had improved controls recently. They agreed that it was important to promote
employment and training inorder to improve the Program and they were familiar with the recent
activities o f the Ministry o f Labor through the Integrated Plan for the Promotion o f Employment.
They agreed that local development plans need to be ledby municipalities.

18.     The authorities thought that inconcept at least, consultative councils fulfilled an essential
function o f developing a broad consensus for the Program. Most authorities valued their
existence, but expressed the need for infrastructure and capacity, as well as clear rules. Council
members criticized the lack of communication with the authorities. Inmany cases they had been
accused of following the instructions o fmayors, causing some organizations to withdraw.


B. ASSESSMENT OF MUNICIPAL ACTIONS AND POLICIES TO PROMOTE THE
EMPLOYABILITY OF HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD BENEFICIARIES

19.     This report analyzed the context for policies and activities oriented to promoting the
"employability" o fbeneficiaries o fthe Heads o f HouseholdProgram insix municipalities in
three provinces (Buenos Aires, Cordoba, and Tucuman). The purpose o f the study was to
explore the capacity and willingness o fmunicipalities to carry out the activities intended to
promote employability, as well as to link the social and productive sectors inorder to be able to
intermediate the demand and supply for employment. The findings are based on semi-structured
interviews with municipal authorities involved inthe implementation o f the Program, and with
other staff indepartments related to economic development and employment. Municipalities
played an important role inthe Program, including managing activities, implementing some
components and inoverall coordination. Performance varied but even incases where the
authorities criticized the Program, they valued its contribution to the local economy and to social
contention.


                                                   77

20.     Inthe municipalities includedinthe study, the interviews showed alack ofsustained
policies oriented to increasingthe employability o f the participants. Inaddition, there were
several perceived obstacles to doing more inthis area, including:


            0   the socioeconomic and educational characteristics o f the beneficiaries (low
                qualifications, little work experience, highshare o f women);
            0   the politicalibureaucratic management o f the initiatives;
            0   budgetary restrictions limitingmunicipal capacity to finance qualified
                administrative staff to manage the program and work with participants; and
            0   the intense political conflict within some municipalities which restricts their
                capacity for policy management.

21.     Although there were some initiatives addressing the issue o f employability, nothing was
beingimplemented. Moreover, some municipal authorities considered that provincial authorities
were the ones responsible for implementing employment policies. Their own role was providing
public services. Likewise, for various municipal authorities, Heads o f Household was a
temporary Program o f social assistance, not a program to promote employment. The review also
found little analytical work adequate to support initiatives to increase employment. It was often
the case that even when national resources were available, implementation was lower than
expected and allocations inefficient due to weak municipal administrative capacity.

22.     The political andbureaucratic obstacles faced bymunicipalities inimplementing
employment policies were considerable. First, there were highlevels o f conflict andpolitical
competition among the different levels o f Government. Second, there was little coordination
among the different official agencies responsible for managing employment policy. Third, poor
administrative and management capacity meant that there was little information available on the
profile of the beneficiaries. This lack o f information also hinderedthe design o f policies o f
employment and training that responded to local needs. Finally, there was a significant conflict
of interest between municipal agencies and the implementation o fpolicies oriented to improving
the employability of the beneficiaries because o fthe highshare o fProgram beneficiaries
working inthe municipality. This was true as well for many non-governmental organizations
giventhat the beneficiaries were an important source o fpersonnel and their permanent
reinsertion into the formal labor market would mean a loss in administrative capacity.

23.     There were also substantial difficulties related to the implementation o fthe existing
component to finance small-scale productive activities for small groups o f beneficiaries:


        0   The technical and administrative requirements (type o f forms to fill out, the budget,
            calculations o f rates o f return)were too difficult for the beneficiaries.
        0   The requirements for association were difficult for the beneficiary population to
            fulfill.
        0   Municipalities lacked technical teams with the capacity to advise beneficiaries,
            especially on commercialization.

24.      The study identified serious difficulties for the municipalities to link businessmenwith
Program beneficiaries. The lack o f articulationwith the private sector was explainedby several
factors. One, since the share o f unregistered employment was highin some municipalities, many
businessmenmightnot want to risk involvement with the employment service because they

                                                   78

would fear that they would need to regularize their labor force. There were prejudices against
the beneficiaries, particularly for beingpotentially conflictive. The limited skills o f the
beneficiaries did not satisfy the demand for technical skills. Currently, municipalities lacked
capacity to promote the labor reinsertioncomponent o f the Program.

25.      The promotionofeducation activities confrontedother difficulties. Few initiatives
existed to respond to the increasing needfor improving the qualifications o f the existing labor
force. There was a lack o f coordination and consistency between existingprograms and
bureaucratic structures and the training neededto satisfy the local demand for labor, Another
problem was the perception among the beneficiaries that the value of education for employment
and social mobility i s a diffuse and distant promise. Finishingtheir educationwas not viewedby
them as an efficient option to resolve anurgent problem. The majority o fbeneficiaries were
women with young children who without child care facilities can not attend classes for long
periods.

26.      Inthe caseswhere municipalitieshadbegunto implementpolicies relatedto improving
employability, the results interms o fjob placement and education achievements were meager -
few beneficiaries had gottenjobs and few were attending training or educationprograms. Even
inmunicipalities which were interested inpromoting the employability ofbeneficiaries, they
were handicapped by lack o f specialized staff, resources, and adequate instruments. The study
also demonstrated that in some cases the demands for labor were not limitedto the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Alliances neededto be encouraged betweenmunicipalities. Otherwise
employment policies focused just within single municipalities could be inefficient.
On the positive side, the staff o f the provincial offices o f the Ministry o f Labor was willing to
work to overcome the material and administrative difficulties mentioned above. However,
willingness alone was not enough to overcome those issues.

C. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROMBOTH STUDIES

27.      Findings indicate the need to bring about certain changes and identify the difficulties. It
is critical to:


         0   Improve the communication among the different actors of the program and to
             increase the access and the availability of information among the beneficiaries.
         0   Create rules that would be followed by all. N o w "clientelism" and informalrules
             make i t possible to go outside the established mechanisms and generate special
             benefits.

28.      Higherconfidence inthe public institutions that were implementing the changes was
evident. Inpractical terms it would benecessary to create mechanisms that would help bring
about the collaboration and coordination o f actions o fpublic agencies with different areas o f
focus (i.e. education and production), and with different jurisdictions (nation, province, and
municipalities). Inaddition, coordination with the productive sector on these policies was weak.

29.      The lack of administrative, institutional, andhuman capital capacities was one of the
principal difficulties for the implementation o f employment policies. Furthermore, the fact that
the municipalities useda highportion o f the beneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household Program as
a free labor -- generated a conflict o f interest between employment for the beneficiaries and the

                                                   79

reduction inmunicipal staff. Some municipalities have implementeda series o f previously
inexistent services, sustained by the labor provided by the Heads o f Household Program. The
intermediation o f the non-governmentalorganizations also seemed to generate significant
conflict o f interest. For many NGOs the reinsertion o f the participants would have obvious
disadvantages: loss of staff, loss o f income and/or loss o f their ability for political and other
manipulation.

Recommendationsby Component

30.     Materials Component. The component i s underutilized becausebeneficiaries resist
participating. Those with skills and experience inconstruction rehse to work for AR$150 since
the pay i s below what they can obtain inthe market. Furthermore, it i s inefficient to organize
work for only 4 hourdday and to rotate personnel. Possible improvements include expanding
eligibility to other organizations besides municipalities, providing beneficiaries with training and
technical assistance, and topping up the payment, a practice in some municipalities.

31.     Labor Reinsertion Component. This component i s not widely knownor utilized.
Businesses thought that the benefits were not sufficient to justify having to go through
complicatedbureaucratic procedures. Ingeneral, possibilities for hiringstaff would also depend
on the existence o f offices with information on the work experience o fbeneficiaries. The offices
should be located inmunicipalities and ways should be found to link the service to employers.
For example, the Government could get unions andbusiness groups to publicize the offices so
that they become a natural place o f reference for businessmen. The benefit o f registering their
CV at the employment office needs to be promoted among beneficiaries. They needto
understand that they do not risk losing the Program.

32.     Training Component. This component i s complex and good implementationrequires
coordination among different ministries and actors. It takes time and effort to organize good
training courses, and the infrastructure was often inadequate. Many courses were not suitedto
the target group, did not focus on the skills required, and didnot meet local needs. The skill-
level of many beneficiarieswas considered insufficient for the more specialized demands for
manpower at the local level. Some courses are too short to be useful and often beneficiaries are
not taking the right series o f courses relatedto the same skill or competency. Sometimes
beneficiaries are attending any course inorder to fulfill their workfare obligation. Other
problems included the following:
        0    Some organizers o fworkfare activities (municipal authorities, neighborhood leaders)
             opposed training because this would reduce their labor force
        0    Participation had a highopportunity cost for beneficiariesbecause it required
             disciplined attendance, transport and materials, and time
        0    Some participants had negativepreconceptions or thought they were too old
        0    Because o fpoor communication many participants didnot know that they could
             fulfill the work requirement through training.

33.     Education Activities. Inthe case o f education, it would be necessary to overcome the
rigidity of the bureaucratic educationstructure o fthe provinces and deficiencies ininfrastructure
to expand the service. Expansion o f these activities would require prior efforts to restore the
value attached to adult education, breaking the prejudice that schooling is only for children.
Psychological and emotional factors are preventing the incorporation o f beneficiaries to the

                                                   80

programs for completing basic education becausethey have to overcome previous unrewarding
experiences with school, return to disciplined study practices forgotten for some time and
overcome low levels of self-confidence. Formal education needs to be integratedwith practical
skills demanded by the market. Finally, alternative mechanisms needto be considered like part-
time classes more appropriate for the target population, although classroom-based courses are
more valued by the beneficiaries.

34.      Small-scale productive activities. The low participation o fbeneficiaries o f the Heads of
Household Program inthese activities i s explainedby the demands o f self-employment and the
difficulties to associate with others. In addition, municipalities lack technical teams to advise on
the preparation and implementation o fprojects, especially on commercialization.


D. CONSULTATIONS ONTHE TRANSITION STRATEGY

35.      Inorder to shareviews andperspectives onthe transition strategy for theHeads of
HouseholdProgram, staff o f the Ministry o f Labor and the Ministry o f Social Development
organized consultations inthe provinces o f San Juan, Corrientes, Cordoba, and the municipality
o f L a Matanza (Buenos Aires Province). They invitedprovincial and municipal authorities, civil
society organizations andbusiness representatives. Representatives o f the World Bank
participated as observers. The workshops consisted o fpresentations by the staff o f the two
Ministries followed by small group discussions centered around five assigned questions. At the
closing, a representative of each group readtheir conclusions and suggestions to all participants.

36.      Government representatives presented a briefreview o f the program and the information
contained inDecree 1506/04 (setting out the transition strategy). They said that it was necessary
to identify among the current participants inthe Heads o fHousehold Program: (i)     the group that
would remain in the program, but in a new context that would focus on insertion inthe labor
market; and (ii)  those who because o f their vulnerable situation would be able to opt to transfer
to the Plan Familias. The first group would remain under the management o f the Ministryof
Labor, and the second o f the Ministry o f Social Development.

37.      The proposed actions for the populationremaining inthe Heads o fHousehold Program
included the organization o f municipal offices o f employment inorder to get better information
on the work profile of beneficiaries and to facilitate contact with employers. Inaddition,
participants would be givenmore opportunities t complete their basic education and to receive
skills training, as demanded by the market. Efforts would be made to re-orient workfare
activities so that could be more instrumental ingettingajob. The objective was through these
activities to get as many beneficiaries as possible employed inthe private or public sectors.

Conclusions/Suggestionsof the Groups

38.      Some participants asked ifthe Government would increase the coverage o f the Program
(specifically, what would happen to those who remained outside). Other participants stressedthe
needto improve the channels o f communication and information with the beneficiaries and other
participants. Government representatives responded that there would be no new enrollments.
They accepted the suggestion to strengthenthe mechanisms o f communication. Inthe



                                                  81

discussions, some participants commented on the contradiction between the requests for
municipal autonomy and for greater agility and decision making at the central level.

39.     On the topic of actions to improve the employability and job prospects for the
beneficiaries,the working groups made the following suggestions:

    e   Promote agreementswith the private sector. Although a mechanismto promote private
        employment exists, it should be promoted more among beneficiaries and businessmen.
    e   Improve the attitude and commitment o f the public and the private sector to providejobs.
    e   Strengthen and consolidate channels o f citizen participation within the framework of a
        national strategy, with specific instruments and tools decided locally.
    e   Improve the mechanisms and channels to disseminate information to reduce ambiguities
        that still exist inmany areas.
    e   Create mechanisms to help municipalities enforce the work requirement. Government
        representatives responded that mechanisms exist. Beneficiaries who do not fulfill the
        work requirementcould be dropped from the program.
    e   Improve procedures for temporary exits from the Program.
    e   Facilitate access to certified training, including on-the-job training during workfare
        activities. Participants did not think that technical schools responded to the needs of the
        "world of work".
    e   Increase flexibility on the work requirement (working full time for fewer days, etc.).
    e   Improve the self esteem o f the beneficiaries.
    e   Train community leaders.
    e   Create productive projects for highly vulnerable population.
40.     The working groups identified several obstacles that the beneficiarieso fthe Program
faced to employment. This included the fact that not all beneficiaries were the chronic
unemployed. It was also felt that there was still a lack o f demand for labor inthe provinces and
much of the demand that existed was only for seasonal work. Incorrect information on the
program also hurt employment prospects for participants. Registered jobs faced competition
with unregisteredwork. Nongovernmental organizations withmore technical capacity inthe
fields o f employment and training claim had not been invited to participate inthe consultative
councils. Finally, many beneficiaries were not very qualified.

41.     Onthe role of employmentoffices,the working groups thought that they should
maintain CVs showing the capacity, abilities and interests o f the individual. They suggested that
options more useful for future employment should be developed for work requirement activities.
Some concern was expressed that municipal employment offices could be subject to political
influences, including clientelism and arbitrary manipulationbymayors. Some suggested
forming territorial working groups o f employment offices. The difficult social context was
recognized. The groups said that the employment office should monitor the job search of
beneficiaries and should formally certify competencies demonstrating employability. The
current lack o f infrastructure andhuman resources were an obstacle to highquality services. The
technical quality o f this instrumentwould be critical. Political decisions need to be implemented
by strong technical teams.

42.     The working groups made several concludingremarks. Control and supervision
mechanisms needed to be improved. Government agencies should form a network and


                                                   82

coordinate resources. Thejoint participationof the Ministries o f Social Development and Labor
was a positive sign. Inview of the existence o f two major social programs, collaboration to
create and maintain a unifiedbeneficiary registry was important. Information neededto be made
available to organizations that the municipality did not usually work with. An alternative needed
to be found to exclusive responsibility o f the consultative councils to coordinate the Program.
Government representatives closed the workshops emphasizing the importance o f the
commitment o f all agencies and the role o f the Heads o f Household Program to help those
beneficiaries that wantedjobs to become employed.
