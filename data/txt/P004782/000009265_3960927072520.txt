SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Kingdom of Thailand
Beneficiary:       Department of Highways (N0H)
Department of Land Transport (LTD)
Amount:            US$87.0 million equivalent
Terms:             20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the Baizk's
standard variable interest rate
Project
Description        The basic objective of the proposed project is to assist
the Government in sustaining an efficient road transport
system and to continue to support the goals of its Sixth
Development Plan including: (a) protection of past
investmenti in the highway sector by concentrating on
rehabilitat5on and strengthening of paved highways and on
improving the maintenance systems; (b) reduction of road
transport c,fsts and improvements in the transport services
over the highway system which would facilitate disposal of
industrial and other economic activity away from Bangkok to
smaller cities and rural areas; (c) improvements in road
traffic safety; and (d) improvement in environmental
control of vehicular air and noise pollution. The bulk of
the loan would finance components of DOH's 1987-91 road
development plan and periodic maintenance program.
Specific subprojects to be financed under the loan would be
selected on the basis of agTeed-upon criteria and proced-
ures. Major components of DON's program, for which most of
the loan proceeds would be used are widening of congested
roads; other components include air and noise pollution
control, training, equipment and consultant services.
Risks:             The project poses no unusual risks.

THAILAND
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       Since the mid-1960's the Thai economy has grown rapidly.  To accom-
modate the growing demand, the Government has undertaken large transport
investments (particularly in road infrastructure) and has created a policy
environment in which a competitive transport industry has developed. Today
all provinces are interlinked with a good interregional and interprovincial
communications network, and transport services have penetrated the majority of
previously remote rural areas.
1.2       The country's transport system is multimodal, consisting of road,
rail, inland waterways, maritime, air and pipeline transportation. The sector
agencies, except for pipelines, are under the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MOTC). Road transport has become predominant, supported by
large infrastnrcture investments. In 1986 the public road network consisted
of approxie'ately 152,200 km of road.  Of these, 16,500 km were national,
30,000 km provincial (Table 1.1) and 105,700 km rural.
1.3       The Department of Highways (DOH), under MOTC, is by far the most
important road agency ard is responsible for all national and provincial
roads, accounting for over 76% of all roan expenditures in 1986 (Table 1.2).
The 73 provinces and municipalities, under the Ministry of Interior (MOI),
assisted by a number of central government agencies, chiefly the Accelerated
Rural Development (ARD) and the Public Works Department (PWD), are generally
responsible for rural roads.
1.4       Under the Government's Sixth Development Plan (1987-91), about Baht
79 billion (12% of total development expenditure) is devoted to transport
sector investments, 42% of which is allocated for roads (Table 1.3). Govern-
ment goals outlined for the transport sector focus on increased utilization of
assets, improved efficiency, increased self-reliance of state enterprises, and
privatization. Specific highway subsectoral goals include a proper balance
between investment and maintenance expenditures, including rehabilitation of
highways, reduction of traffic congestion and provision of a higher level of
traffic safety and improved environmental controls.
1.5       The Bank's Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH) approved on
December 15, 1987, finances various componients of DOH's 1987-91 Road Develop-
ment Plan. Detailed engineering for about 754 km of road to be bid in late
1988 are now complete, with detailed engineering for about 848 km of road to
be bid during 1989, presently underway. Other components of that loan include
road safety, training, testing equipment and consultant services and are
progressing satisfactorily. Past projects have also been successfully
implemented by DOH. Originally, the Government expected to borrow about
US$238.4 million from foreign sources for its US$998.6 million road



-2-
development plan 1987-91. However, this plan has since been increased to
US$1,316.8 million to accommodate additional works, including urgent upgrading
of congested roads, some of which had earlier been planned as concession
roads. As a result, the protected external borrowing has been raised to
US$471.6 million. The Bank has been asked to cofinance part of this increased
amount, together with the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan
and Asian Development Bank (ADB). Financing arrangements of the participants
will not, however, be interdependent as the Government intends to allocate
specific free-standing subprojects to each for financing.
1.6       The proposed Second Highway Sector Project is a continuation of Bank
support for the Government's expanded five-year program for national and
provincial roads as discussed under the first Highway Sector loan (SAR Report
No. 6877-TH). Because of this recent loan the present report is an
abbreviated update of last year's P-praisal Report and focuses on the addi-
tions to the Development Plan.
II. DOH PROGRAM (1987-1991)
2.1       DOH's five-year expendicure program 1987-1991 (Table 2.1), which is
the basis for the proposed Second Highway Sector Project, strikes a proper
balance between maintenance and rehabilitation on the one hand and paving and
new construction on the other, while taking into consideration available
financial resources. The program also provides flexibility for adjusting
annual targets in line with changes in fiscal and economic conditions. During
negotiations the level and composition of this program was reviewed and agreed
upon.
2.2       The proposed loan is based on:
(a)  DOH's expenditure program covering the period 1987-1991, subject to
annual updating;
(b) criteria, procedures and related organizational arrangements for
selection, engineering and implementation of individual subprojects
included in DOH's program; and
(c)  appropriate measures ..o address selected sectoral issues concerning
sectoral plannirg, road transport services and highway administra-
tion.
A. Program Components and Description
2.3       DOH's estimated feasible expenditure levels (1987 through 1991) are
central to defining the framework of the Bank's involvement in the sector
during DOH's program period.  Thus, evaluation of DOH's estimated highway
expenditure program for 1987-1991, presented below and detailed in Table 2.1,
has been the focal point of the Bank's appraisal.

Total               99739.8   10,599.4 14,115.1 15,743.9  15,449.2   65,647.4
The significance of these estimates lie in the fact that they are recognized
as realistic, given DOH's previous work programs implementation, the Bureau of
the Budget's current outlook on public revenues, the National Economic and
Social Development Board's (NESDB) assessment of priorities among and within
the sectors, the Ministry of Finance's (MOF) current prospects for external
borrowing, and MOTC's views on previous and projected funding allocations. It
is considered that the 1987-91 budget estimates therefore provide an adequate
framework to assess the physical targets of the sector and to project the
financing requirements.
2.4       Given the age structure, pavement condition and increasing traffic
volumes on the network, the bulk of future DOH expenditures will be determined
by maintenance, rehabilitation and capacity expansion along existing routes
rather than by construction of new routes. The expected 1987-91 highway
program reflects these realities and continues the shift towards maintenance
and rehabilitation begun in the fifth plan.
B. Road Development Plan
2.5       DOH's Road Development Plan accounts for some 51% of DOH's expendi-
ture program for the period 1987-91. Under the Plan, presented below and
detailed in Table 2.2, DOH envisages the following: rehabilitation,
strengthening of some 6,800 km of paved roads; improvement through construc-
tion of additional lanes along about 870 km of congested roads, some of which
may be operated as toll roads; a safety program through improving conditions
in about 400 hazardous road sections; construction of interchanges and major
bridges in about 11 locations; construction of some 350 km of new road links;
and upgrading 3,200 km of gravel roads to bitumen standard. The physical
targets to be achieved are considered to be consistent with resource
projection and im,lementation capacity.

C. Financing
2.6       Government budgetary allocations make up about 65% of DOH's planned
investments and recurrent budget requirements. The remaining funds r: nuired
would be obtained from foreign sources, including IBRD, the Asian DeveLopment
Bank and OECF, and would be applied mainly to capital expenditures under the
development plan. The table below summarizes the expected financing sources
for the development plan during 1987-91.

The proposed project is the second of three fina, ing operations for which the
Government is seeking Bank financing. The Bank's dighway Sector Loan was
approved on December 15, 1987 for US$50 million and a third highway sector
loan for about US$50 million will be proposed in FY90.
2.7       Should DOH, in the future, have to meet the national highway
requirements with less budgetary resources than those presently envisaged,
reduction in the overall size of the prog-am would first be effected by
reducing the new construction and paving components through postponement or
scaling down of subprojects. To ensure the program's continued relevance and
adequacy, agreements were reached during negotiations regarding (i) the
financing plan of the program; (ii) an annual review of program implementa-
tion; and (iii) the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation over new
construction of roads during periods of resource constraints.
D. Institutional Improvements
2.8       To ensure smooth execution of the DOH program and efficient manage-
ment of the sector, specific action programs were developed by the agencies
concerned during the prepar-tion of the Bank's Highway Sector Project. These
programs refer to specific measures required to: (i) implement the pavement
management system nationwide; (ii) complete implementation nationwide of DOH's
equipment revolving fund system; (iii) strengthen DOH's training system; and
(iv) control truck overloading and improve road safety. These programs will
continue and will be supplemented by an environmental action program aimed at
improving existing vehicular air and noise pollution control measures
(paras. 3.6-3.9 and Annex 1). During negotiations, agreemsnts on the former
action programs were confirmed and the air and noise pollution action program
agreed upon.
III. SELECTED SECTOR ISSUES
A. Congestion and Toll Roads
3.1       The majority of national roads was constructed before 1965 and,
while most of them are well maintained, their width and other geometric
standards are now largely inadequate for the increased traffic volumes,
resulting in traffic congestion and uneconomic speeds. With increased
congestion and a growing need to widen certain national and provincial roads,
the Government is considering the introduction of more toll roads, which would
allow for earlier road construction without significant increases in budgetary
allocations. Recent attempts at introducing private concession roads to
eliminate pressure on the budget have not materialized, largely because of
disagreement between private investors and the Government regarding profit
margins, repatriation of funds and duration of the concession period.
Although this attempt at privatization has not materialized the Government
remains committed to its privatizacion policy. The Bank was approached, for
financing of the three toll roads, only after the collapse of the negotiations
and will continue to work with the Government in future efforts at
privatization.



6-
3.2       In hay 1988, a Highway Toll Office was established within DOH to
facilitate the Government's policy of increasing the number of toll roads in
the country. At present this responsibility extends to two existing toll
roads, highway 32 and 34. Introduction of toll roads would, in addition to
ensuring cost recovery, also facilitate road maintenance, since the funds
collected would be placed in a special account in the Ministry of Finance for
exclusive use by DOH. It is generally agreed, however, that the present toll
rates of 1 Baht per motorcycle, 3 Baht per car, and 5-10 Baht for trucks and
buses are low. Although the revenue does cover the cost of toll operation as
well as maintenance expenditures, it is insufficient to cover capital
investment and investment interest costs. The Government has therefore
requested technical assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) to address these issues with a view to advising the Government on an
appropriate long-term concept for toll road operations. During negotiations,
the Government confirmed that it will consult with the Bank on the scope,
recommendations and envisaged actions which may ensue from the JICA Study.
B. Road User Charges
3.3       In 1986 Government expenditure on road works amounted to 11.7
billion Baht, 76% of which (8.9 billion baht) was spent by DOH. The remainder
was divided among 8 other Government agencies, with the largest share (11%)
going to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) (Table 1.2).
3.4       According to a DOH Study on Road Revenue and Expenditure 1977-1986,
Covernment expenditures on road works have been covered since 1979 by rev nues
collected from road user charges levied.  A breakdown of revenue collected
trom road user charges (Table 3.3) indicates that the greatest proportion is
collected by the Excise Duties Department, which is responsible for oil and
fuel tax collection. In 1985 this amounted to 49% of total revenue collected.
Of this, gasoline tax accounted for 59%, diesel tax 33%, and other taxes 8%.
3.5       In terms of user costs, as opposed to user charges, those levied on
motorcycles and automobiles are more than sufficient to cover road use.
However, the charges levied on trucks, particularly heavy trucks, are
insufficient, allowing these vehicles to pay less than the actual cost of road
use, in effect creating a Government subsidy for truck use. Mechanisms are
being put in place to increase license fees for heavy trucks to cover their
road usage costs, but because of political sensitivity related to the raising
of truck charges, the increase will be phased in over a five year period.
C. Air and Noise Pollution
3.6       According to the National Environment Board (NEB) of Thailand, the
major sources of both air and noise pollutior are motor vehicles and
industry. The pollutants from motor vehicles include carbon monoxide, hydro-
carbons, suspended particulate matters (SPM), and lead. The Office of the
National Environment Board (ONEB) has monitored ambient air quality since
1981, with 8 permanent stations in Bangkok and 2 mobile units which cover the
remainder of the country.



-7-
3.7       Although laws and standards for air quality and noise control
have been in effect since 1981 and 1984, respectively, enforcement has been
difficult. The primary method of motor vehicle emission control in Thailand
is through the system of inspection at the time of licensing and registration.
Annual renewal is mandatory. However, given that automobiles and motorcycles
are allowed to register by mail, emission inspections are seldom done on an
annual basis and often occuv only when vehicle ownership changes.
3.8       Although buses and trucks are required by law to be inspected
annually, enforcement of the regulation is difficult due to a critical lack of
properly trained personnel and equipment. As of July, 1988, the Department of
Land Transport will have the sole responsibility for the registration and
emission and safety inspection of all motor vehicles (previously shared with
the Police Department). The Harbor Department is responsible for enforcement
of pollution standards for all waterborne vessels.
3.9       In an effort to more adequately deal with the growing number of
motor vehicles and control air and noise pollution resulting from them, in
1987, NEB drafted and received approval of an Action Plan to solve air and
noise pollution problems from land and water transport. This action plan
covers a three year period and aims in particular at providing sufficient
manpower and resources for concerned agencies to enforce emission standards
for vehicles in the Bangkok area. Emphasis is on control of black smoke and
carbon monoxide, as well as noise. The 'Bangkok' Plan also includes
supportive measures, such as allowing certified private garages to inspect
vehicles and, the introduction of a reduced import tax for pollutant
monitoring equipment. In total 34 pieces of equipment and 124 more staff are
being requested for enforcement of air and noise controls in the capital.
While the focus of the NEB Action Plan is Bangkok the objective under the
proposed project is to address the issue of vehicular air and noise pollution
countrywide. The key theme is to improve the enforcement of law compliance,
through the provision of equipment and technical assistance.
D. Maintenance
3.10      Maintenance expenditures grew steadily in absolute terms dnd as a
share of DOH's expenditures during the fifth plan and, since 1985, have
covered the estimated requirements. The projected level of maintenance
expenditures increases from B 2.5 billion in 1987 to B 3.4 billion in 1991
(Table 2.1). The proposed level of maintenance should be adequate considering
that the sixth plan also allocates B 10.7 billion to rehabilitation and
reconstruction. Together these amounts account for 40% of DOH's expenditure
program. The rehabilitation work-load should start to decrease from about
1,300 km per year during the sixth plan to about 800 km/year in the seventh
plan. Furthermore pavement management and equipment revolving fund systems
are being implemented to further improve the situation.

IV. BANK PARTICIPATION
4.1       The proposed project is a continuation of the Bank's involvement in
the sector. Out of a total lending program of 21 transportation projects
supported by loans amounting to US$657.7 million, US$462.6 million (71%) has
gone to the highways subsector, US$120.3 million (18%) to ports and waterways,
and US$74.8 million (11%) to the railways (Table 4.1).
4.2       The proposed project will support the Government's policy of
emphasis on improving maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network and
thus help the Government in sustaining a relatively efficient road transport
system. Together with Loan 2894-TH, the project will assist the Government
in: (a) protecting past investments in the highway sector by concentrating on
rehabilitation and strengthening of paved highways and by improving the main-
tenance system; (b) reducing road transport costs and improving the reli-
ability of services in the national and provincial roads system to facilitate
dispersal of industrial and other economic activity away from Bangkok to
smaller cities and rural areas; (c) improving road traffic safety; (d)
rc.I-ving congestion; and (e) improving environmental control of vehicular air
and noise pollution.
A. Proposed Second Highway Sector Loan
4.3       The proposed second highway sector loan would continue support for
the Government's expanded five-year program for national and provincial roads,
including the improvement of three congested roads which will be operated as
toll roads. In accordance with provisions under the Highway Sector Project
(Loan 2894-TH), this year's annual review of the Sixth Development Plan
confirms that the improvement of these roads meet the criteria for subprojects
and would be suitable for Bank financing. The propesed loan would continue to
finance tnie Bank's participation in the co-financing of Thailand's Highway
Development Plan with ADB and OECF. The major components are: (a) civil
works for the improvement of specific road sections; (b) provision for equip-
ment for the environmental program to reduce air and noise pollution; and
(c) consulting services related to the subprojects. The Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MOTC) will be responsible for implementation of the
project, through the Department of Highways (DOH), an arrangement already
provided for under Loan 2894-TH. However, MOTC's Department of Land Transport
(LTD) will execute the environmental component of the project.
4.4       The proposed US$87 million loan would be utilized as follows:
Civil works                                           83.5
Equipment for environmental program                    1.0
Consultants services and training                      2.5
Total    87.0
Details of the tentative allocation of the proposed loan are provided in
Table 4.2.



-9-
Civil Works
4.5       The proposed project supports the implementation of subprojects in
DOH's program. DOH is using adequate economic analysis for selection of
subprojects. During negotiations, the framework and criteria previously
agreed upon and presently in use for subproject selection, was confirmed
(para. 4.23) and agreement reached that all subprojects be approved prior to
September 30, 1991.
Environmental Program
4.6       To ensure availability of funds for the National Environmental
Board's (NEB) Action Plan, and to complete NEB's effort by extending this Plan
to include the remainder of the country, the project would introduce a
component to help finance the creation of a program for enhanced air and noise
pollution control nmeasures for land motor vehicles (para. 3.9) A countrywide
environmental program would, in effect, be created with this project
component, to be executed by the Department of Land Transport (LTD). The main
features of the component would include:
(a) technical assistance, including analysis of options, to improve
inspection procedures and current control measures;
(b) a training program for inspection personnel, and
(c) equipment to inspect and monitor motor vehicle air and noise pollu-
tion.
Consultant Services and Training
4.7       About 270 man-months of consultants' service are provided for in the
project to assist DOH and LTD in carrying out the project. These services
will include assistance to DOH's highway supervision team, to DOH for imple-
mentation of toll operations and management, to LTD in the formulation and
implementation of an environmental air and noise pollution control program,
and to training of DOH and LTD staff. As in past projects, consultants would
provide the required services with a mix of local (about 150 man-months) and
expatriate personnel (about 120 man-months). Consultants will be appointed on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Implementation
4.8       Project implementation and procurement will follow the same proce-
dures as used under the Highway Sector project (Loan 2894-TH), which are
satisfactory to Lhe Bank.
Conditions and Procedures for Procurement of Bank-Financed Subprojects
4.9       All civil works andl equipment financed by the Bank loan would be
carried out through contracts awarded on the basis of ICB to prequalified
firms in accordance with the Bank guidelines for procurement (Table 4.3).



- 10 -
4.10      Bidders would be allowed to bid for separate contracts or for groups
of them, depending on the value of works for which they are prequalified.
Invitations to prequalify will be sent annuaily to embassies and published in
Development Business. The Bank will receive for its review the list of
prequalified contractors and of those refused prequalification, if any, and
the reasons therefor.
4.11      Consultant services for coordinating the supervision of highway
works and for technical assistance, estimated at about US$2.5 million, would
be contracted in accordance with Bank's guidelines.
4.12      Contracts for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$2.5 million or less would be subject to random post review by the Bank
after contract award. This is considered sufficient since the bidding docu-
ments are similar for all road works.
4.13      In the case of goods and equipment for the environmental program,
and for training, the Bank would also do a prior review of the list, including
the type and estimated value of the equipment and the schedule of execution.
The Bask would also do a prior review of bidding documents for equipment or
goods estimated to cost US$300,000 equivalent or more.
4.14      After contracts eligible for Bank financing have been signed, DOH
will send to the Bank:
(a) the updated evaluation sheet for the subprojects;
(b) the tender evaluation report showing award to the lowest evall'ated
bidder; and
(c) the signed contract.
The Bank would have the right to reject the financing of any contract for
which agreed-upon bidding procedures have not been followed.
Monitoring and Auditing
4.15      MOTC will be responsible for implementing the project, through DOH
and LTD. The bulk of the administration of the contracts under the proposed
loan would be the responsibility of DOH, which would keep records of all bids,
documents and official decisions on each eligible subproject showing total
expenditures to date, monthly payments and administrative data and prepare
quarterly reports with this information. The Bank would reserve the right to
inspect and review the documentation maintained by DOH and to be sent detailed
information. The same procedure would be followed for the LTD component.
4.16      The annual consultations on DOH's highway program and the budget
would provide the major opportunity for reviewing progress of DOH's 1987-91
program and implementation of the project. Monitoring and supervision of the
proposed sector loan would focus on:
(a)  the evolution of DOH's 1987-91 program;



- 11 -
(b)  the progress made in pursuing the sectoral objectives of the loan
including the environmental component; and
(c) the progress in commitments and disbursements of loan funds.
4.17      During negotiations it should be agreed that (a) DOd will keep
separate accounts for the proposed project; (b) the project accounts, includ-
ing documentation for the statements of expenditures (SOEs), will be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (c) DOH will report on the
level of investment and recurrent expenditures and any variances between the
expected program level and the amount actually budgeted; and (d) the detailed
audit report will be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of
each fiscal year.
Disbursements
4.18      Three national roads, proposed in DOH's program for widening
(Table 4.4) and operation as toll roads, will be co-financed by the Bank, ADB,
OECF and the Government. Each of these roads will be treated as a
subproject. It has been agreed that parallel co-financing would be adopted as
the most suitable mode for co-financing. The Government's contribution toward
the financing of each of these three subprojects would be 202, and the 80%
contribution of the co-financers would be as shown in Table 4.4. The
Government's comparatively low contribution of 20% is the result of the
inclusion of the three roads in the Government's financing program for DOH at
a relatively late stage, when most of the domestic funds had been apportioned
to other subprojects of DOH's Development Plan, a reversal of which would
cause severe difficulties in the budgeting process. This is acceptable since
the total external financing of about US$472 million is below the foreign
exchange cost of DOH's Development Plan, and represents only about 35% of its
total cost.
4.19      Disbursement from the loan will be made against applications based
on contracts for subprojects eligible for Bank financing as follows:
(a) Civil Works. 80% of the expenditures for construction/improvement
of specific road sections along three toll roads; 50% of expendi-
tures for civil works on other roads;
(b) Goods. 100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost); and 80% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally; and
(c) Consultant Services and Training. 100% of the total cost.
4.20      To facilitate disbursements the project would use the Government's
established internal revolving funds system which enables the Co,troller
General's Department to advance funds from its own resources to line agencies
for expenditures in both local and foreign currencies. When project expendi-
tures under the internal revolving fund reach $20,000, the Controller
General's Department will batch the withdrawal applications and submit these



- 12 -
to the Bank for reimbursement. Disbursements for training would be made
against Statement of Expenditures.
4.21      A schedule of estimated disbursements (Table 4.5) has been prepared
on the basis of a tentative implementation schedule prepared by DOH consider-
ing additional Bank financing in 1990. The projected disbursement profile,
for the proposed Bank participation in the program is broadly in line with
DOH's current performance. It is expected that loan disbursements will be
completed in about four years because bidding documents are standard and the
review and approval of contracts has been streamlined to reduce delays.
B. Economic Justification
4.22      DOH's policy is to use economic feasibility as the main criterion
for selecting subprojects for its development plan. The cost estimates will
be based on detailed engineering, and the benefits, depending on the specific
subproject being analyzed, will consist of savings in vehicle operating costs,
maintenance cost savings, and diverted or generated traffic benefits, whenever
applicable. Time savings are not included in the base case but would be
provided as additional information. The vehicle operating cost savings are
based on the terrain in which a particular subproject is located and on the
traffic composition and growth. The latter is established by a countrywide
system of traffic counting stations supplemented by specific traffic counts,
if required. DOH maintains periodically updated vehicle operating cost
tables. The minimum economic return for subprojects to be included in the
plan is established at 12%, equal to the opportunity cost of capital in
Thailand.
4.23      The new subprojects included in DOH's 1989 program have an economic
return in the 19-45X range (Annex 2). DOH plans to select and evaluate all
future roads for construction. rehabilitation and paving in accordance with
the methodology used in developing the 1988 and 1989 programs. During the
negotiations, the Government confirmed that the evaluation methodology would
not be changed without consultation with the Bank and that no road work is
implemented for which the economic return is less than 12%.
4.24      The economic assessment of the environmental component, which
accounts for about 1% of the proposed loan, is more complex and, by necessity,
of a qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. As its principal benefit
this component is expected to achieve a reduction in air and noise pollution
with the training component expected to lead to higher efficiency. These
benefits cannot be quantified.
C. Assessment of Risk
4.25      DOH's budget estimates for its 1987-91 program have been carefully
reviewed and are reasonable considering, on the one hand, the financial
resources available for the subsector and, on the other hand, the capacity of
DOH and the construction industry. The amount of the loan has been set
prudently below the potential disbursement basis. There is no serious risk of
DOH's program being insufficient to commit and disburse the loan as scheduled.
Road works to be implemented during the program and specifically for the



- 13 -
proposed project follow the alignments of existing roads, thereby minimizing
property disturbances and land acquisition for right-of-way.
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1       During negotiations, the following matters were reviewed and agreed
upon:
(a)  level and composition of DOH's updated 1987-91 program (para. 2.1);
(b) financing plan of the program (para. 2.7);
(c) an annual review of DOl's program implementation (para. 2.7);
(d) the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation over new road
construction (para. 2.7); and
(e) the noise and air pollution control action program (para. 2.8).
(f) action programs (para. 2.8);
(g) consultation with the Bank on the scope, recommendations and
envisaged actions which may ensue from the JICA Study on Toll Roads
(.para. 3.2);
(h) subprojects to be approved prior to September 30, 1991 (para. 4.5);
and
(i) reconfirmation of the selection criteria for the road works to be
included in the investment program (para. 4.23).
5.2       Subject to the above, the project provides a suitable basis for a
Bank loan of US$87 million equivalent, for a period of 20 years including a
grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's standard variable rate. The borrower
will be the Kingdom of Thailand.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Proposed Toll Road
A. Route Description
Route 2: Saraburi-Nakhon Ratchasima Highway
1.        The Saraburi-Nakhon Ratchasima Highway (Route 2) runs in the east-
west direction. It is 144 km in length from the junction with Route 1 at
Saraburi, approximately 110 km north of Bangkok, to the city of Nakhon
Rat.:hasima. The first 10 kms of road are in flat terrain, after which the
road traverses rolling and mountainous areas entering the vicinity of Korat
Plateau throughout the remaining distance. Along the first half of the road
there are the outcrops of limestone, while the Nakhon Ratchsima side has river
fill of alluvium type. The subsoil is a composition of silty clay and sandy
soil with a reasonably high CBR value averaging 6Z. This could form a rather
firm stratum for road bed. This route provides a major access for the
northeastern region to connect with Bangkok and the Central region. The areas
along the roadside have been fully developed for industrial factories.
Therefore, there has been a high percentage of generated traffic for years.
The Khao Yai National Park, situated about halfway along the road, also
provides a recreation spot for tourists.
2.        The existing 2-lane road was opened to traffic about 28 years ago.
The road formation consists of a 7 m wide asphaltic concrete surface and 2.5 m
wide treated shoulders on both sides. On average, the road embankment height
is about 1-2 m. A climbing lane has been provided for heavy vehicles at the
locations of higher vertical gradient.                                          i
3.        The proposal is to improve the road to a 4-lane divided highway with
grade separated intersections provided where necessary. The existing right of
way is wide enough to accommodate the proposed improvement, however,
realignment in some sections may be required. Four toll gates will be built
along the road.
Route 32: Bang Pa In-Nakhon Sawan
4.        The Bang Pa In-Nakhon Sawan Highway (Route 32) traverses south-north
and is 1985 km in length from the junction of route 1 in Bang Pa-In district
to the terminal city of Nakhon Sawan. The alignment runs along the deltaic
plain of the Chao Phraya River and passes through fertile agricultural land
with rice fields. The road also crosses many streams and rivers which from
branches of the Chao Phraya. Flooding occurs extensively during the rainy
season. The road is located in the flat, deltaic plain of alluvial deposits,
thus most of subgrade soil is cohesive clay. The recent clays are comprised
of a firm, weathered crust followed by a soft, compressive layer. Beneath are
sediments, the upper region of which consist ot a stiff clay layer overlying a
belt of sands.



- 27 -                               ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        The area is a very gently sloping plain with southward-flowing
drainage through the Chao Phraya River. The top soils are fertile and
principally used for rice. The highway provides the direct access to Bangkok
from the Northern region.
6.        The existing 2-lane roadway was constructed in 1967 on a clay
embankment with an average height of about 3 m. The surface is asphaltic
concrete 7 m wide with 2.5 m of shoulders on both sides. Most of the
alignment is in the flat terrain except the area close to Nakhon Sawan which
is slightly rolling. Settlement of the subgrade soil is not expected to be a
major problem for construction.
7.        The proposal is to improve the road to a 4-lane divided highway with
grade separated intersections provided where necessary. The existing right of
way is wide enough to accommodate the expana.on. Two toll gate have presently
been established at Bang Pa-In and Singburi. With the proposed improvement,
three more toll plazas will be build.
Route 35: Thonburi-Pak Tho Highway
8.        The Thonburi-Pak Tho Highway (Route 35) extends 85 km from Suk Sawat
Road in the Bangkok area to the intersection with the Phet Kasem Highway
(Route 4) in the vicinity of Pak Tho District. It runs approximately parallel
with the northern shoreline of the Gulf of Thailand. The alignment traverses
the lower deltaic plain of he Chao Phraya, Tha Chin and Mae Khlong Rivers and
passes through rice fields, brush wood areas, coconut plantations, salt
fields, shrimp farms and mangrove swamps. the ground level averages only one
meter above sea level and is flooded to depths of 20 cm to 80 cm during high
tides and in the wet season. Most of this area was previously only accessible
by boat.
9.        The soils in the project consists primarily of soft deltaic marine
clays and silts, although riverine alluvium occurs adjacent to the Mae Klong
River silts and clays. At the eastern end of the project area, in the
vicinity of Thon Buri, very soft surface deposits of silt and clay occur at a
depth of approximately 20 meters. Below this depth are alternating layers of
sand, clayey sand and stiff clay. At the extreme western end of the project
area, in the vicinity of Pak Tho, the alluvial deposits thin out. Rock of the
Ratburi series outcrops west of the Phet Kasem Highway. The alluvial
deposition is still going on. It has been estimated that the land is growing
seaward at a rate of four to five meters per year. Some desiccation is
evident in most of the project area, resulting in a crust-like surface of a
few meters thickness.
10.       The highway provides direct access to Bangkok for the Southern and
Western regions as well as for two major regional towns, Samut Sakhon and
Samut Songkhram, and open up a considerable area of land between Thon FJri and
Samut Sakhon for industrial development. The road crosses the Tha Chin River,
near Samut Sakhon. The existing 2-land roadway with asphaltic concrete
pavement on sand embankment was built and opened to traffic in 1973. Due to a
considerable rate of subsoil settlement, some road sections are flooded during
the rainy season. Moreover, traffic on the road has increased at a higher

Page 3
growth rate.than anticipated as the route provides a short cut from the south
into Bangkok as well as to a number of industrial developments along the
road.
11.       The proposal is to improve the road to a 4-lane divided highway with
some frontage roads in certain locations.
B. Economic Justification
12.       Econoiic feasibility of the three toll roads under consideration
have been analyzed by WDH. No assumptions concerning potential impacts
resulting from the tolls has been included as there has been no decision
respecting toll charges. However, JICA is to undertake a study to determine
appropriate toll levels for these roads.
13.       Present traffic volumes (1986/87) range from 9,000 to 18,000
vehicles per day for Route 2, 6,000 to 13,000 for Route 32, and over 10,000
for route 35.
14.       For the purpose of economic evaluation each road has been subdivided
into sections in accordance with the traffic patterns, and economic analyses
have been carried out on each of the sections. The preliminary results are as
follows:
