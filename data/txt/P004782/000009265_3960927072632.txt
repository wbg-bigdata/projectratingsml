MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Kingdom of Thailand for US$87 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The loan would help finance a second highway sector project and
would be for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  Since the mid-1960's the Thai economy has grown
rapidly. This growth has generated a steadily rising demand for-transport
services. To accommodate the demand, the Government has undertaken large
transport investments (in particular for road infrastructure) and has created
a policy environment in which a competitive transport industry has developed,.
Through the period of its first four five-year development plans (1965-1981),
Thailand successfully developed a substantial network of major highways, now
comprising some 46,500 km. Increasingly, the focus has shifted from building
new roads to providing for their maintenance and gradual upgrading. Expendi-
tures for these purposes under the Fifth Plan (1982-1986) were about 302 of
the highway development expenditures. Under the Sixth Plan (1987-1991), the
proportion is programmed to rise to about 401. Originally, the Government
expected to borrow about US$238.4 million fr?m foreign sources for its
US$998.6 million road development plan 1987-91. However, this plan has since
been increased to US$1,316.8 million to accommodate additional works,
including urgent upgrading of congested roads, some of which had earlier been
planned as concession roads. The projected external borrowing has as a result
been raised to US$471.6 million. The Bank, together with the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) and Asian Development Bank (ADB),
has been asked to finance part of this increased amount.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would be the
Bank's second operation in support of the Government's 1987-91 Road
Development Plan and reinforces the efforts under the Highway Sector Project
(Loan 2894-TH), which was approved by the Board on December 15, 1987. The
proposed project reflects Bank views on appropriate sector development
strategy. Together with its existing role in railways, inland water transport
and ports, and proposed involvement in the transport-related and infrastruc-
ture needs of the Government's Eastern Seaboard program, the Bank's continuing
sector financing represents a major effort to help improve intermodal invest-
ment planning in transportation, increase existing capacity utilization and
improve efficiency and cost effectiveness of freight and passenger
transport. The proposed level of lending is considered appropriate to
continue the Bank's role in securing important sector policy improvements
related to road investment planning, efficiency of resource allocation, road
maintenance, safety and environment.



2-
4.        Project Objectives.  The basic objective of the proposed project is
to assist the Government in sustaining an efficient road transport system and
to continue to support the goals of its Sixth Development Plan including:
(a) protection of past investments in the highway sector by concentrating on
rehabilitation and strengthening of paved highways and on improving the main-
tenance systems; (b) reduction of road transport costs and improvements in the
transport services over the highway system which would facilitate dispersal of
industrial and other economic activity away from Bangkok to smaller cities and
rural areas; (c) improvements in road traffic safety; and (d) improvements in
environmental control of vehicula-r air and noise pollution.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project is a three year time
slice of sector investments (1989-91). The loan would continue support for
the Government's expanded five-year program which includes construction,
rehabilitation, improvement and maintenance activities on the country's
national and provincial roads, including the improvement of three congested
roads to be operated as toll roads. In accordance with provisions under the
Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH), this year's annual review of the Sixth
Development Plan confirms that the improvement of these roads meet the
criteria for subprojects and would be suitable for Bank financing. The pro-
posed loan would continue the Bank's participation in the financing of
Thailand's Hightay Development Plan together with ADB and OECF. The major
components of this loan are: (a) civil works for the improvemert of specific
road sections; (b) provision for equipment for an environmentai program to
reduce air and noise pollution; and (c) consulting services related to the
subprojects. The Ministry of Transport anmI Communications (NOTC) will be
responsible for the implementation of the project, through the Department of
Highways (DOH), an arrangement already provided for under Loac 2894-TB. How-
ever, MOTC's Department of Land Transport (LTD) will execute the environmental
component of the project. Both departments have adequate capabilities to
carry out their respective reponsibilities. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Thailand
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7414-TH dated November 7, 1988, is being
distributed separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed with the
Bank on: (a) the level and composition of updated DOH's updated 1987-91
program, including estimated budget support to ensure adequate road main-
tenance; (b) the financing plan for DOH's 1987-91 program; (c) an annual
review of DOH's program and its financing to ensure balanced program implemen-
tation; (d) the priority of rehabilitation and maintenance works over new road
construction; (e) the action program for improvement of air and noise pollu-
tion; (f) reconfirmation of the selection criteria for the road works to be
included in the investment program; and (g) the procedures related to the
evaluation of subprojects in order to be eligible for Bank financing.
7.        Benefits  The major benefit of the program would be to secure a
continued focus on road maintenance by ensuring that the Government's
resources are directed towards maintenance activities as a priority. Although



-3-
the condition of the highway network in Thailand is generally fair, many of
the roads need asphaltic overlays &n4 resealing without which they will
deteriorate over the next few years leading to subsequent rehabilitation that
would eventually cost a multiple of the present repair cost. Already about
5,000 km of paved roads are in need of rehabilitation. The proposed project
would continue the Bank's support of WOl's progrms to improve efficiency and
safety of the highway network as well as introduce an environmental component
to aid air and noise pollution control efforts. The minimum economic return
for subprojects to be included in DOH's Development Plan is 12M, equal to the
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand. The three toll roads included for
co-financing under the proposed project have an economic rate of return in the
192452 range.
8.        Risks. The project poses no undue risks from an investment or
environmental point of view. The investments are already overdue and the
enviroment should be positively affected by the project. DON and LTD have
adequate organizations and experience to implement the project.
9.        Recommendation.  I a  satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank aAd recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
