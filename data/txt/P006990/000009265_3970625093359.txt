PROJECr COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
EMERGENCY ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT (LOAN 1783-DO)
Highlights
In September 1979 two major hurricanes hit the Dominican Republic
causing extensive damage to two of the island's main roads. The objective of
the Emergency Road Reconstruction Project, to limit further economic losses
pertaining to agricultural production and the transport of goods to
commercial centers, was largely achieved by reconstructing approximately 150
km of hurricane damaged roads. The Project included funds for the
reconstruction of two main roads; and the equipment, technical assistance,
and supervision necessary to execute the Project (paras. 1.01 mid 2.03).
Project preparation and initiation emphasized expediting
mobilization of resources and project implementation in order to rectify the
emergency situation that existed after the hurricanes. A detailed appraisal
mission was by-passed and less than four months elapsed between
identification and Board presentation. Although measures were taken to
reduce project risks and avoid potential problems, the project was completed
almost two years behind schedule and suffered a cost overrun of 39Z (paras. 2.01,
3.01-3.10 and 4.01).
Project execution was hampered by an initial delay in loan
effectiveness, inadequate engineering designs that required complete
revision, and uncertainties regarding the availability of financial resources
required to cover large cost increases. Threatened with a complete work
stoppage in August 1982 due to lack of local funds to pay contractors and
exhaustion of available Bank funds, SEOPC requested supplemental financing
through an amendment to Loan 1784-1,0, the Second Road Reconstruction and
Maintenance Project. A Bank staff paper was prepared which showed that the
investment required to complete the project was justified and, on April 4,
1983, when loan proceeds for 1783-DO were close to depletion, the Board
approved an amendment to Loan 1784-DO to provide financing required to
complete the project (paras. 4.01-4.04).
In view of the emergency nature of the project, no detailed
economic analysis was carried out before Board presentation. An economic
analysis of the project, based on actual construction cost and current
estimates of project benefits, yields an economic rate of return of about 32Z
for the project. The investments are, therefore, economically justified
(para. 5.02).



- vi -
The project brings to light the suitability of Bank participation
in an emergency situation. In retrospect, the decision to forego a detailed
appraisal and proceed without completed designs is questionable. This
emphasis on expediting mobilizaton and implementation caused a less than
accurate analysis of other details as well, specifically the engineering
designs. The result was delays being encountered in al1 stages of the
project's execution and major cost overruns (para. 8.02).

EMERGENCY ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT (LOAN 1783-DO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      On August 31st, 1979 a devastating hurricane, David, with winds of
150 miles per hour, crossed the western section of the country from the south
coast just west of Santa Domingo, to Monte Cristo on the north coast, just
east of the border with Haiti. The hurricane was accompanied by torrential
rains, floods, and earthslides. On September 2, hurricane Frederick followed
a similar path bringing lesser winds but four more days of torrential rains.
The resultant damage was extensive with more than 2,000 deaths, 21,000
families left homeless, and 100,000 people living in refugee centers.
Physical damage included the destruction of a hydroelectric station,
de-roofings of industrial factories in the Haina area, destruction of or
damage to some 2,400 km of roadway, 58 bridges, and over 20,000 housing
units; plus extensive damage to current agricultural crops. The full
economic impact of the disaster went beyond current losses of agricultural
production, in that future production would also be impaired because of the
time it would take to repair and restore assets and productive capacity. The
damage the hurricane caused to the road network, although extensive in
itself, served to emphasize the need for rehabilitation and reconstruction of
the system. The objective of the Emergency Road Reconstruction Project was
the reconstruction of two important roads which were partially washed away by
extensive flooding (Cruce de Guayacanes-Santiago de la Cruz, 85 kms and
Azua-Barahona, 65 kms).
1.02      To date, Bank involvement in the road subsector has consisted of
three projects and the provision of technical assistance as executing agency
for the UNDP-financed Highway Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project
(1973). The First Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan
1316T-DO, US$5.0 million, August 1976) was for highway reconstruction and the
initiation of a highway maintenance program. The Emergency Road
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1783-DO, US$25 million, January 1980) is the
subject of this report. The third project is the on-going Second Road
Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan 1784-DO, US$35.0 million,
January 1980).
1.03      This project completion report is based on information obtained
from the LAC Information Center, President's Report No. 2641-DO, Staff
Appraisal Report No. 2698b-DO on the Second Road Maintfxance and
Reconstruction Project, staff supervision reports and working papers, and
data provided by the Secretariat of Public Works and Communication (SEOPC).
In addition, Bank staff visited all the roads that had been included in the
project and held discussions with SEOPC staff, the consultants and
contractors concerning project implementation.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, A-PPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      A Bank appraisal mission was not carried out.  Instead, the Bank
responded to the Government' s urgent requests for aid by extending the terms
of reference of a post-appraisal mission already In the Dominican Republic
for the Second Road Reconstruction and Maintenance Project (Loan 1784-DO).
The mission's uain focus was to review the reconstruction plan SEOPC had
prepared and determine if Bank participation would be appropriate, as well as
the extent and make-up of that participation. The mission was able to arrive
at tentative agreements with respect to project content, engineering design
standards, methods of construction, equipment requirements, technical
assistance, cost estimates, financing, and a project implementation schedule.
2.02      The project was defined with the objective of limiting economic
losses that would result from the inabii-ty to transport agricultural
production to commercial centers by restoring road facilities to areas where
agricultural areas became isolated as a result of hurricane damage.
Approximately 150 km of two main roads severely damaged by flooding were
scheduled for reconstruction: t:he 64 km Azua-Barahona Road (in the South)
and the 86 km Cruce-de-Guayacanes Santiago de la Cruz Road (in the North).
These roads (Map IBRD 144'92R) were already slated for reconstruction under
the second segment (l982-E4` of SEOPC's five-year reconstruction program.
These two roads fulfill an important role in connecting economically
depressed agriculture-producing areas with the commercial centers of Santiago
and Santo Domingo. At the time of negotiations, the immediate reconstruction
of the roads to two-lane paved standards to replace the temporary repairs
that had been undertaken by the Government was considered extremely urgent.
2.03      In addition to providing for the reconstruction of the above roads,
the project also included: (a) purchase of road construction equipment
required by SEOPC to carry out project civil works by force account;
(b) technical assistance to the Special Construction Management Unit (CMU)
created within SECPC to be responsible for overall project implementation;
and (c) consultant services for civil works supervision.
2.04      A combined Issues/Decision Memorandum, distributed September 17,
1979, and a subsequent Back-to-Office Report dated October 11, 1979,
identified and discussed major issues of the proposed loan. Amongst these
were project execution, retroactive financing, extent and timing of equipment
purchases for SEOPC, establishment of a specialized unit (CMU) entrusted with
overall responsibility for project implementation, and establishment by SEOPC
of a revolving fund to ensure available resources to execute civil works.
2.05      Negotiations between the Dominican Republic and the Bank took place
in Washington on November 19!20, 1979 and a loan amounting to US$25 million
was approved by the Executive Direccors on December 18, 1979.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
A. General
3.01      The loan was signed on January 8, 1980 and was expected to become
effective by March 1980. Congress' delay in giving final approval to the
loan resulted in the effectiveness date being extended three times before
final approval was received on September 19, 1980. This delay caused an
initial setback in project implementation because equipment already purchased
under the project which was expected to be financed using loan proceeds could
not be paid for due to the Government's lack of foreign exchange. Table 1
provides a list of project components together with the actual implementation
schedule.
B. Procurement of Equipment
3.02      In the interest of expediting equipment purchases and standardizing
these purchases with other SEOPC equipment, it was agreed that the initial
procurement would be carried out by requesting quotations from established
suppliers. All such equipment was to be delivered within three months of the
purchase date. Equipmen. purchased after March 1, 1980 was to be procured
through ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines. The program for equipment
purchases was approved by the Bank in February 1980 and orders for $1.5
million worth were placed with suppliers. Procurement of the various items
of equipment was basically in accordance with Schedule 4 (Procurement) of the
Loan Agreement. Procurement was completed by June 1982.
C. Civil Works
3.03      The civil works component of the Project consisted of the
reconstruction of the 64-km Azua-Barahona Road and the 86-km Cruce de
Cuayacanes-Santiago de la Cruz Road to two-lane paved standards.   These were
permanent improvements as opposed to temporary repairs. The tight
implementation schedule of the project did not allow for engineering designs
to be completed prior to Board approval in December 1979. Subsequent to
their completion, construction contracts were awarded and work began.
However, the standards used in completing the designs exceeded those agreed
t o between SEOPC and the Bank during negotiations. The process of making
design changes during construction created appreciable delays in
implementation and higher costs. Bank missions reviewed the designs, made
recommendations to reduce standards and instructed the consultants to carry
out careful trade-off analyses whenever departures from the existing
alignment were deemed necessary. Most of the revisions suggested by the Bank
were eventually incorporated in the final engineering designs. In addition,
some of the designs turned out to be faulty, with deficiencies only being
discovered during construction, causing further delays in the reconstruction
work and still higher ccsts.
Azua-Barahona Road
3.04      The original civil works program divided the Azua-Barahona Road
into five construction sections but subsequent delays in initiating the works
caused CMU to revise the reconstruction program using four sections. Under
the new program civil works by force account increased to 28.7 km compared to



14.6 km in the original program. The Bank approved this change and force
account work began in February 1980 on the newly created Section I
(Azua-Canada del Burro). SEOPC utilized rented equipment since equipment
purchased with loan proceeds could not be released until the loan became
effective in September 1980. The works included under Section I were
completed in December 1983, about two years later than originally
anticipated, at an approximate average cost of US$328,000 per km.
3.05      A second reprogramming of civil works was done in June 1980 whereby
Section II (Canada del Burro-Vicente Noble - 20.5 km) and Section III
(Vicente Noble-Palo Alto - 11.7 km) would be joined in order to offer a
larger, more attractive bidding opportunity and was awarded to a joint
venture of a local and a foreign firm. Shortly after work began, in May
1981, when engineering designs were reviewed on the basis of actual field
conditions, large cost overruns were estimated for the project and, in an
effort to reduce these cost increases, standards for Sections II and III were
reduced. The road was finally completed in December 1983, about 24 months
later than had been expected.   The cost of construction averaged
approximately US$321,000 per km.
3.06      The contract for Section IV (Palo Alto-Barahona - 11.7 km) was
awarded to a joint venture of two local firms, and work progressed smoothly
until a design problem arose on the last two kilometers of the section. The
location of the center line along a narrow strip between a sugarcane railway
line and a deep irrigation canal required that one of the facilities be moved
in order to accommodate the agreed platform width of 9.5 m. A second problem
that delayed reconstruction works was the National Institute of Hydraulic
Resources (INDRBI)'s plans for irrigation works along certain road
stretches. This affected the bridge spans and drainage systems. The work
was finished in December 1983, about two years later than had been
anticipated, at an average cost of about USS273,000 per km.
3.07      The project also provided for construction of five bridges along
the Azua-Barahona Road. Because procurement procedures utilized by SEOPC
were not in accordance with Bank guidelines, financing the bridges became the
complete responsibility of SEOPC. A local firm was contracted for the
construction of four bridges while work related to the fifth bridge was
executed by force account. Construction works began in April 1982 and were
completed by May 1983.
Cruce de Guayacanes-Santiago de la Cruz Road
3.08      The Cruce de Guayacanes - Santiago de la Cruz Road was also divided
into four construction sections and was completed in November 1983, about 24
months later than originally expected. Faulty engineering designs were the
major factor explaining the delays in the completion of the works. Sections
I and IV were carried out through force account methods at an average
constru.ction cost of about US$235,000 per km, while Sections II and III were
bid and awarded as a combined contract to a local contracting firm and were
completed at an average construction cost of about US$217,000 per km.
Originally, reconstruction by force account was limited to 10 km, but due to:
(i) delays in loan effectiveness; (ii) delays in letting bids; and (iii) the
changes and revisions required in the engineering designs, the length of the
road to be reconstructed by force account was increased from 10 km to 31 km



- 6 -
in order to expedite progress. Work began on Section I in March 1980 and was
completed in September 1983, about 18 months behind the original schedule.
For Sections II, III and IV, work began in October/November 1980 and was
completed in December 1983, about two years behind the original schedule.
3.09      Originally the project design contemplated retaining four narrow
bridges on this road in order to reduce costs. Subsequently, duri.g
construction of the road, it became obvious that these single-lane bridges
were acting as a serious constraint to free traffic flow.  After an
unsuccessful attempt to locate other funding sources, the Government
requested that the construction of four new, adequately designed bridges be
included in the project. The Bank agreed, and construction is being carried
out by a local contractor who began work in January 1984. The four bridges
are expected to be completed by March 1985.
D. Consulting Services and Technical Assistance
3.10      The project also included consulting services for construction
supervision and technical assistance to the CMU. Those assignments were
carried out by consulting engineering firms who completed their work
satisfactorily; the technical assistance advisors to CHU (a foreign firm) in
December 1982 and the consultants for construction supervision (a joint
venture between a foreign and a local firm) in June 1984. 1/
1/ These services are continuing, with financing provided under
Loan 1784-DO.

IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison beween original and final cost estimates is given in
Table 2. Final project cost is estimated at US$54.1 million, constituting a
39Z cost overrun from the original estimate of US$38.8 million during
appraisal. The principal reason for the large cost overrun was lack of
detailed engineering by the time of Board presentation and the subsequent
changes required because of faulty designs. Other reasons for the cost
overrun include increased rental rates for construction equipment; cost
increases in materials such as cement, steel, and petrol; and general price
escalations related to the two year delay in project implementation.
4.02      As engineering designs were reviewed and finalized during
construction, large cost increases and corresponding deficits in requirements
of funds and available sources became apparent. Despite the Government
assurance to the Bank that it would finance all cost increases resulting from
higher design standards, the country's tight fiscal situation in 1982 forced
the Government to seek alternative sources of financing to cover an initial
deficit estimated at US$4.1 million. A bilateral agreement between the
Dominican Republic and Mexico was attempted in hope of financing the deficit
but failed to materialize. An arrangement with the Venezuelan Investment
Fund for the financing of four bridges on the Cruce de Guayacanes - Santiago
de la Cruz Road also failed to materialize (para 3.09).
4.03      In April 1982, a newly revised cost estimate taking price increases
into account increased the financial gap to US$6.5 million. An agreement was
negotiated and signed between the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic and
the Venezuelan Investment Fund, by which US$3.0 million was allocated to the
project. Despite this allocation, a deficit of US$3.5 million remained and a
shortage of funds to pay civil work contractors became imminent. The lack of
funds led to a suspension of contracted works in July 1982 and only after the
Government allocated US$1.2 million in funds to pay contractors did civil
works resume.
4.04      In December 1982 project costs had escalated to an estimated final
cost of US$58.1 million, and the Bank loan account (for civil works) was
close to depletion. The situation prompted the Secretary of Public Works to
propose to the Bank that additional financing be obtained from Loan 1784-DO,
the Second Road Reconstruction and Maintenance Project. After review by the
Bank, an agreement was reached to allocate some of the loan proceeds of Loan
1784-DO to cover the unfinanced portion 2/ of the Emergency Project. In
April 1983 the Loan Agreement for Loan 1784-DO was amended and a Special
Account with an initial deposit of US$4.6 million was established in the
Central Bank to help speed disbursements.
2/   Including the four additional bridges (para 3.09) on the Cruce de
Guayacanes to Santiago de la Cruz Road.

4.05      Despite the additional financing provided by amending Loan 1784-DO,
a lack of counterpart local funds has been an issue of concern to both the
Bank and SEOPC. The 1982 and 1983 National budgets did not allocate
sufficient funds to ensure the availability of counterpart funds needed to
complete the Emergency Project and alternative sources had to be found. 3/
4.06      Disbursements of loan proceeds were initially hampered by the
delayed effectiveness date and later by delays experienced in project
implementation. To accomodate the extended project completion dates, the
closing date of the loan was extended three times- Actual disbursements
compared to appraisal estimates are included in Table 3.
3/   In 1983, US$1.8 million was disbursed from USAID, Special Fund.

V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01      In view of the emergency nature of the project no detailed economic
analysis was carried out during the rather short period between Government's
loan request and Bank approval (3 months)- The Bank's judgement on the
long-run economic viability of the project was based on the results of a
SEOPC identification survey in 1977 which indicated benefit/cost ratios above
3.0 (at 12Z discount rate) for both roads.
5.02      Using (a) actual road reconstruction costs; (b) updated traffic
counts and current forecasts of traffic development; and (c) current vehicle
operating costs (VOC) (Tables 4-6), economic rates of return (ERR) for
individual sections of the two roads, for the roads separately and for the
total project have been reestimated (Table 7). The combined rate of return
for the two roads is now estimated at about 32%, with the Cruce de
Guayacanes-Santiago de la Cruz road yielding an ERR of about 20X and the
Azua-Barahona road resulting in about 48Z. Individual stretches of these two
roads are estimated to have ERRs ranging between about 16% to 50Z. The
corresponding B/C ratio (at a 12% discount rate) for the combined roads is
about 2.7, slightly less than the SEOPC's estimate of 3.0.

VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
A. Construction Management Unit
6.01      The CHU was created to ensure effective management of the
construction works, update engineering designs, and supervise overall project
execution. Officially established by SEOPC on October 25, 1979 by appointing
a Dominican Director and an expatriate Co-director, the unit was given
authority over SEOPC staff assigned to the Project and any additional staff
that was hired on a fixed term basis until project completion. By March
1980, a financial manager and two resident engineers had also been appointed
thereby fullfilling the conditions for civil works disbursement that the Unit
be fully staffed by April 1, 1980. Additional operational and supporting
staff were recruited in accordance with the workload and scheduling of the
civil works.
6.02      The Unit proved instrumental in directing and managing overall
project implementation and in so doing helped expedite project works and
avoid potential problems. The Unit's responsibility in organizing and
implementing the civil works program; assembling and assigning equipment to
various construction units; preparing terms of reference for supervisory
consultants; and monitoring costs and record-keeping procedures was met
satisfactorily. There were, however, some problems in the financial
management of the CMU. An independent audit carried out in March 1981
detected numerous irregularities in the financial records maintained by CMU
employees. The irregularities were confined to the Moa field office working
on Section I of the Cruce de Guayacanes-Santiago de la Cruz Road and showed
that overpayments and overdisbursements for civil works had been made that
were not justified by work accomplished and were not in accordance with the
provisions of the Loan Agreement. This led to the dismissal of various CMU
employees, including the financial manager and the resident engineer for the
road.
6.03      Following an analysis of the road reconstruction carried out and
estimating a reasonable value for works in place, SEOPC agreed that
US$240,000 would be withheld from subsequent withdrawal applications. A
review of accounting procedures conducted showed that the incident was the
result of poor management and supervision and not because of an inadequate
accounting system.
B. Performance of the Borrower and Compliance with Loan Covenants
6.04      Overall performance of the Borrower, except for reluctance to
incorporate Bank-recommended changes in road designs, was satisfactory with
respect to Project implementation and Loan Agreement covenants.  The
Government's firm commitment to the project and the enthusiasm of CMU's staff
were key factors throughout project implementation which contributed to the
successful, if belated, completion of the project. The Government's
inability to provide adequate local funds on a timely basis was an
unfortunate result of the serious economic situation in the country, not due
to any lack of interest in the project.



- 11 -
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank's decision to participate in the Emergency Road
Reconstruction Project was justified since the Project's goal of
reconstructing two main roads, so as to limit economic loss related to
agricultural production, was consistent with both the country's five year
(1980-1984) road reconstruction program and the country's strategy for
economic development.
7.02      Adequate measures were taken to assure that Project content was in
line with SEOPC's capacity and to reduce project risks that were present
given SEOPC's inexperience in undertaking a project of similar magnitude.
These measures included the establishment of the Construction Management Unit
to ensure adequate project management; Special Accounts to ensure
availability of funds; Supervisory Consultants to oversee Project execution,
and the purchase of equipment for works to be carried out by force account.
Yet the emergency situation that existed in the country after the hurricanes
hit caused the Bank to expedite project preparation and by-pass an appraisal
mission. The decision to proceed with the project and seek Board approval
before completed engineering designs were available, had negative effects on
subsequent implementation and project costs.
7.03      Bank performance with respect to operational tasks and supervision
of the Project was good. The nature of the Project required heavier than
normal supervision yet a good working relationship and open co munication
between Bank staff and SEOPC was maintained.
7.04      The Project's problems bring to light the suitability of Bank
participation in an emergency situation. In retrospect, it seems that if more
time had been devoted to project preparation and less emphasis on immediate
implementation, the Project could have avoided the substantial cost overruns
and related problems that arose during project execution. Emergency action
to re-open the roads after the hurricane had already been taken by the
Government, and a low grade form of access had been provided before the
Bank-financed project began. The project, therefore, represented a road
improvement rather than only a rehabilitation. Project preparation could
perhaps have been more thorough since the emergency nature of the project
was, at best, doubtful. The Bank's action in continuing with the Project,
despite the substantial overdesigns and realignments of road sections that
were not in accordance with the initial agreement during negotiations between
the Bank and SEOPC and the consequent delays and cost overruns, was
nevertheless justified in the light of the successful completion of the
project and the benefits that can be seen to be accruing.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Project goal of reconstructing two main roads was achieved
although cost and time overruns were substantial. Reconstruction of the
roads to two-lane paved standards can be seen as a sound decision given the
economic rate of return of 32%.
8.02      However, in retrospect, the decision to forego a detailed appraisal
of the project in order to expedite implementation on the basis of the
questionable -emergency' nature of the project was not justified given the
fact that the work involved was road improvement rather than rehabilitation
and that there was almost a two-year delay in completing the project.
Although the Project's risks were identified and concrete measures were taken
to reduce them, not all matters were fully analyzed, particularly the issue
of not having completed engineering designs which would be satisfactory.
8.03      Execution of the project was substantially improved by the CMU and
the supervisory consultants, but this positive factor could not fully
compensate for the lack of a full appraisal and the consequences of a hastily
approved loan.
