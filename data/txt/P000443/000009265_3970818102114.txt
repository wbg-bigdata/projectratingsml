CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT - CR. B74 & 1074-CA
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The project provided a total of US$ 20 million to help finance
construction of the 145 km Bangui - Bossembele road and related
consulting services. The Bangui - Bossembele road is the first part of
the principal overland route via Garoua - Boulai on tne frontier with
Cameroon and thence to the port of Douala. The Kuwait Fund provided
US$3.6 million equivalent and the African Development Fund US$5.6 million
equivalent to co-finance the road. The project was fully successful and
the economic rate of return of 13% was about the same as the originally
estimated 12%. The higher than expected truck traffic on the completed
road offset the 21% increase in the project cost which resulted from
additional work, higher than estimated inflation and currency
realignments. A Supplementary Credit of SDR 3.5 million provided by the
Association and a Kuwait Fund loan of US$1.8 million defrayed the project
cost increase.
2.       In association with the project, a program to rehabilitate the
remaining part of the overland route from Bossembele to Garoua - Boulai
on the frontier with Cameroon and thence to Douala was financed by the
European Development Fund (EDF), French (FAC) and German (GTZ) bilateral
agencies. The co-donors program was successful.
3.       The following points may be of particular interest:
(i)   the understanding between the Association, EDF, FAC and
GTZ, concerning the need and extent of road improvement
(paras. 2.06 - 2.09);
(ii)  increase.in cost estimate and inclusion of co-donors in
the project (para. 3.05);
(iii) difficulties encountered in procurement, design and
construction of the I'Bali bridge (paras. 4.05 - 4.06);
(iv) success of the Road Fund (para. 4.10); and
(v)   institutional aspects (paras. 6.01-6.02).



CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT - CR. 847/1074 CA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The project was the third financed by the Bank Group in the road
sector of the landlocked Central African Republic (CAR). The first
(Credit 146-CA, US$4.2 million, 1969), financed the paving and
reconstruction of the Bangui-M'Baiki road (98 km) in 1972.  The second
(Credit 199-CA, US$4.3 million, 1970), financed equipment, material and
technical assistance for a four-year highway maintenance program, which
mainly because the Government was unable to provide local funds for
recurrent maintenance was completed in a substantially reduced form early
in 1975.
1.02     CAR with an area of about 620,000 km2 lies mostly on a high
rolling plateau, which presents no geographical obstacles to transport.
The country is landlocked and transport costs to distant ocean ports are
high. The population of 2.3 million is concentrated mainly in the south
and west of the country, the areas of greatest economic activity.
Politico/Economic Situation
1.03     During the 1960s the economy, predominantly in the private
sector developed satisfactorily. However in the 1970s growth slowed down
and by the mid-1970s, when the Third Highway Project was being prepared,
CAR's economy had deteriorated badly. It was affected by the drought in
West Africa, and there was a significant decline in the quality of
Government Administration.  Cotton production was down 50%; output of the
nationalized coffee plantations was reduced drastically; and the infant
manufacturing sector was stagnating because inefficient public
enterprises were squeezing out private ventures.  In September 1979, a
year after the Credit was approved, a new regime came to power.  At that
juncture the commercial agriculture sector had all but disappeared. The
civil service was in disarray. Taxes were hardly collected and the
Government was virtually bankrupt.  Roads had become dilapidated through
neglect and were urgently in need of rehabilitation.



-2-
II. THE SECTOR
2.01     Most domestic transport is by road.  The classified network
consists of about 9,000 km of which about 450 km are paved. The larger
unclassified network (about 11,000 km) consists mainly of seasonal
secondary roads and unengineered tracks. Most trunk roads radiate from
Bangui, the capital. The road network is generally adequate in extent
and serves the populated areas. However at project preparation roads had
deteriorated due to inadequate maintenance.
2.02     The country's primary access to the sea is the historic
road/river/rail route south to the port of Pointe Noire (Congo). To
reach Pointe Noire from Bangui (1,810 km) goods must travel 1,300 km by
the Oubangui and Congo rivers to Brazzaville and then 510 km by rail.
This route carries 90% of CAR's 200,000 tons annual freight but is only
navigable eight months of the year. The alternative route via Cameroon
is shorter and consists of the road from Bangui to Garoua-Boulai on the
frontier from where it goes to N'Gaoundal (850 km). This is part of the
Trans-African Highway. From N'Gaoundal most of the traffic goes by rail
to Douala (830 km). The less expensive river route is attractive for the
transport of bulk commodities, whereas the Cameroon route is attractive
for higher value commodities and small shipments.
2.03     The draft 5-year plan for transport (1976-80) gave highest
priority to improving the CAR section of the Cameroon route. The project
provided for the rehabilitation of the fV-st section, the 145 km
Bossembele-Bangui stretch.
2.04     The Directorate General of Public Works (DGPW) is responsible
for the highway sector, and its Planning and Construction Directorate
handles design of minor road works and small bridges. Traditionally,
major projects are designed by foreign consultants. Road maintenance is
the responsibility of DGPW through its two divisions and eight
subdivisions.
2.05     Societe Centrafricaine des Transports Fluviaux (SOCATRAF), a
mixed enterprise, is now responsible for freight and passenger transport
on CAR's waterways. It has suceeded the state enterprise, Agence
Centrafricaine des Transports Fluviales (ACCF) which was formed in
1970. ACCF by 1975 was deeply in debt due to a combination of poor
management and organization, lack of qualified local staff, and declining
traffic. ACCF has now become the holding company (para. 4.12).
2.06     In view of the inadequate road maintenance, the Association
advised the Government in May 1976 that the financing of the proposed
project would be contingent on the Government's establishment of a road
maintenance program supported by foreign financial and technical
assistance. The Government acquiesed, and after discussions and
negotiations over a long period signed agreements on specific programs



-3-
with FED and FAC in April/May 1978, and GTZ (Federal Republic of Germany)
somewhat later. 1/
2.07     FED assistance also included continuation of the existing
training school, re-oriented to highway maintenance. FED assistance to
the program was to total CFAF 1.2 billion (US$5.0 million) and included
the provision of expertise to direct the donors maintenance program.  The
overall amount of the co-donors programs was about US$6.9 million.
2.08     In conjunction with the program, assistance was to be provided,
beginning 1978, to enable the Government to mobilize its idle maintenance
organization to do routine maintenance operations on the priority road
network, using its field staff of "cantonniers" and existing equipment.
For this purpose, the Government itself was to allocate CFAF 500 million
(US$2.0 million) in 1978 and at least the same amount annually for the
following three years to a special Road Fund account managed by DGPV.
Independently of this, the Government was to have consultants make a
highway maintenance study in 1977-78.
2.09     The arrangements whereby the Association-financed road was to be
done by contractor and the maintenance program of the other donors done
under their direct supervision was evidence of the concern over the
capability of the Government, and Government institutions, to execute the
program in the prevailing state of affairs of the country.  In addition
to this direct intervention of the donors the maintenance program was
made as simple as possible.
2.10     When the political climate became more favorable in 1979,
further assistance was quickly provided to the road sector. The cotton
crop, the country's most important source of foreign exchange, had been
declining for some years. FAC and CCCE (Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique), France's development bank, which had been involved in the
financing of the cotton sector, mobilized a program to improve trunk and
access roads in the country's main cotton growing area in the
southeast.  Under the program some 1,700 km of roads were rehabilitated
by contractors at a cost of US$4.5 million. The rehabilitation was
light, involving some grading, ditching, removal of vegetation, light
lateritic coverage and the provision of essential turnouts. The
rehabilitation of the cotton roads enabled the cotton crop to be salvaged
that year.  The Association has included in the preparation of the Fourth
Highway Project, Cr. 1150-CA, provision to continue and consolidate the
road rehabilitation effort in the cotton growing area.
1/ Subsequently Japan provided some equipment, but not funds for
operating costs.



-4-
III. PROJECT FORNULATION
3.01     The project comprised:
(a)   reconstruction of the Bangui-Bossembele road (145 km) to
two-lane bituminous sealed standard, including the
construction of a two-lane bridge on a modified alignment
(to that of the existing one-lane bridge) at the M'Bali
river crossing; and
(b)   consultant services for laboratory work related to
construction and for prequalification of contractors and
evaluation of bids.
Chronology of Effectiveness
3.02     General      The project was identified under the Second Highway
Project, which financed the feasibility study and detailed engineering
for reconstruction of the Bangui-Bossembele road (145 km). The study was
prepared in June 1972; detailed engineering completed in October 1975 and
an updated economic analysis in February 1976. Negotiations took place
in November 1977. There were no major issues. It was agreed, however,
that Board presentation would be contingent on signing of maintenance
agreements with European donors and receipt and evaluation of bids for
the road works; the latter because there were no major civil works
executed in recent years and it was difficult to make reliable cost
estimates.
3.03     Bidding Procedures    Following ICB, bids were received before
Board presentation in order to have realistic cost estimates. The
original plan was to let all road works as one lot. Contractors were
prequalified in April 1976 on this basis. The Government, however, in
May 1976, requested that the new bridge for the M'Bali crossing should be
separated from the other works to enable local contractors to bid.
Eventually, the Association agreed, subject to prequalification of local
contractors. DGPW employed consultants to complete detailed engineering
and bidding documents and to prequalify contractors and evaluate bids.
Ten firms were prequalifed to bid on both the road works and the
bridge.  Two local firms were prequalified for the bridgeworks.  Bids,
invited in Novenber 1977 were received and opened in April 1978. (Four
firms submitted bids for the roadworks and three, including one local
firm, for zhe bridgeworks.)
3.04     Effectiveness      Satisfactory road maintenance agreements
having been reached with the FED and FAC and the bids received in April
1978, the Board approved the project on September 5, 1978. It became
effective on April 4, 1979.



-5-
Cost Estimate and Financing
3.05     The estimated project cost was US$25.7 million equivalent net of
taxes including contingencies ($22.4 million or 87% foreign and $3.3
million local). The Government exempted the construction contract of
taxes and duties, estimated at $3.6 million. The Association financed
100% of foreign and 55% of local costs for the supervrision of civil works
(laboratory services), and 100% of consulting services which were
completed before the Credit was approved and financed retroactively in an
amount of US$140,000. In retrospect, the Association's insistence on
presenting the project to the Board only after receipt of bids was
appropriate considering the substantial revision of initial appraisal
cost estimates (based on the consultants' estimates made in 1975) from
US$18.5 million to US$25.7 million. With the increase to US$25.7
million, other donors were needed. The Kuwait Fund agreed to provide
US$3.6 million equivalent to finance a share of the foreign exchange cost
of the road. The African Development Fund (ADF) agreed to provide US$5.6
million to finance foreign and local costs of the road jointly with the
Association.
3.06     The table below summarizes the final financing arrangement:
Foreign     Local      Total
…---(US$ million)---
IDA                                 13.7        1.8       15.5
Kuwait Fund                          3.6         --        3.6
African Development Fund             5.1        0.5        5.6
Government                           --         1.0        1.0
Total                           22.4       3.3        25.7
The Government's contribution of US$1 million, excluding taxes, covered a
share of local project costs. Association financing represented 60% of
the total project cost, and 70% of its foreign costs. Altogether, IDA,
the Kuwait Fund and ADF provided 96% of total project cost.
Commitments by CAR
3.07     General    The Government, was asked to undertake maintenance of
*            priority roads other than those being repaired by FAC, FED and GTZ during
the course of the project and also to focus on problems in river
transport. The major commitments made by CAR were formalized as
*            covenants in the Credit Agreement, as follows:
3.08     Execution of the Project    The Government agreed to arrange
with FAC that four experts (two engineers and two technicians) then
assigned to DPGW would be available throughout the project to supervise
all construction works.
3.09     Maintenance    The maintenance program, to be carried out
parallel to the project involved mobilizing the Governments's existing
field staff of "cantonniers" and equipment and financing the works
through a Special Road Fund. In addition, the Government agreed to



-6-
finance a highway maintenance study in 1977-75, although there was no
covenant to that effect. Specific maintenance covenants were:
(a)   to ensure adequate day-to-day maintenance on priority
sections of public roads, as determined by the Government
in consultation with the Association;
(b)   to provide through a Special Road Fund not less than 500
million CFAF (US$2 million) annually from 1978 through
1982 in constant 1977 prices for day-to-day maintenance of
the priority roads, maintenance and renewal of road
equipment and the establishment of road maintenance
workshops;
(c)   to inform the Association each October of its budget
allocation for maintenance for the following year;
(d)   by not later than December 31, 1979 to carry out heavy
maintenance work on an 8 km section of road from Bangui to
Demara, the start of the road to be constructed under the
project.
3.10     River Transport      The Government agreed to propose as soon as
possible a program satisfactory to the Association to improve the
operation of ACCF and rehabilitate the Borrower's river transport system
and, thereafter, execute the program.
IV. IXPLEENTATION
General
4.01     The project was fully successful.  The road reconstruction was
completed a year ahead of schedule, but progress of work on the x'Bali
bridge experienced delays. In parallel activities, the maintenance
operations of the other donor agencies were carried out essentially as
planned. The Government, however, experienced initial difficulties in
carrying out its maintenance program which consisted of mobilizing road
maintenance gangs for routine tasks as well as mechanized maintenance
with financing for both coming from a special Road Fund.
Bangui-Bossembele Road
4.02     The contract with the lowest bidder--a joint venture of
two french contractors was signed in November 1978. Work
was completed satisfactorily in June 1981, a year ahead of schedule, due
in part to the tight construction management and task scheduling by the
joint venture working on separate sections of the road. The joint
venture successfully resolved technical difficulties as construction
progressed. For example, on about 7 km of the road, laterite gravel was
used as a base instead of the originally specified cement-stabilized



-7-
laterite since good quality gravel was found nearby. This substitution
reduced costs slightly.
4.03     Despite strict adherence to the construction schedule, by
March 1981, the additional but minor cost of redesigning a part of the
rDad's realignment coupled with the more serious local price escalation
in CFAF terms (the currency in which nearly all contracts were
denominated) and the decline in the parity of the dollar nearly exhausted
the construction budget. Anticipating a shortage of funds to complete
the works, the Government requested US$6.5 million in supplementary
financing. In October 1980 IDA approved a Supplementary Credit of 3.5
million SDR (equivalent to US$4.5 million). The Kuwait Fund financed
most of the balance (US$1.8 million) and the Government contributed
US$200,000. Although effectiveness of IDA's Supplementary Credit was
delayed until October 1981 because it was contingent upon effectivness of
the Kuwait Fund financing, the delay did not affect the progress of the
works. The joint venture pre-financed the remaining work for which it
was reimbursed when the supplementary credit became effective.
M'Bali Bridge
4.04     Work on the M'Bali bridge began in January 1980 and was
completed in July 1981 a month later than the completion of works on the
road. The work was late in starting, due to design problems experienced
by the contractor.
4.05     The Government decided in November 1978 to let the contract to
the only prequalified and responsive CAR firm. The other
prequalified local firm, did not bid. Before confirming its choice, the
Government asked for information based on which it satisfied itself
that the firm had adequate management, technical means, skills and
financial resources for the job and advised the Association
accordingly. The contract was officially awarded in 1979. The
Association apparently did not review the firm's qualifications because
although the firm had considerable e-perience in building construction, it
lacked experience in bridgeworks. This made it necessary from early on
to bring in a consultant to assist the firm to complete the bridge design
and to manage the actual construction. A French consulting firm provided
the bridge expert who helped complete the design early in 1980. The
foundation design called for sheet piling.
4.06     The contractor, shortly after starting work ran into difficulties
driving sheet pilings for the left bank pier, making the pilings
unusuable in the process. Untrained staff unacquainted with piling
techniques were the source of the problem. To forestall further
difficulties, the consultant was compelled to redesign the foundation.
To ensure quality control, the Association and the Government agreed that
the consultant should also supervise the remaining foundation works.
Except for the finishing touches,  the firm completed the bridge in mid-
1981. Load bearing capacity tests have now been completed. The bridge
is structurally sound.

Compliance with Covenants
4.07     Road Maintenance Provided By Foreign Donors The rehabilitation
of 640 km of priority road sections financed by FED, FAC and C-TZ was
carried out as planned. These roads were planned to be maintained by
foreign donors until 1983 when DGPI was to take over responsibility for
the brigades and finance the recurrent costs from the Road Fund.
Arrangements have now been made to continue maintenance by foreign donors
until 1984-85.
4.08     Government Maintenance Program  The maintenance work done under
the project by the Government itself was not carried out well. In 1979
the funds were used to poor advantage. Lack of effective organization,
know-how, and inadequate spare parts were the main causes.  The grading
of 453 km of certain roads included in the program was not done. Routine
maintenance continued to be limited until 19B1 when the Road Fund was
restructured and made effective.
4.09     The highway maintenance study although not included as a
covenant was to be made during 1977-78. It was not completed because the
Government failed to pay the consultant after a preliminary report was
prepared. In 1979, the Association proposed that the study should be
financed by the Road Fund but the Government did not respond.
4.10     Road Fund  The Road Fund was established in 1971, in part to
provide funds for maintenance. The main source of revenue was fuel taxes
but in practice only a comparatively small share was actually made
available for maintenance. The average expenditure on annual maintenance
during 1972-1975 was about US$600,000, an almost negligible amount. The
Government agreed under the project to allocate not less US$2 million
each year to annuall road maintenance and to put this amount in a Road
Fund account administered by the Ministry of Public Yorks for this
purpose. In 1979, although some 500 million CFAF (US$2 million) was made
available from general budgetary funds only 400 million CFAF was actually
spent on maintenance, 100 million short of the amount anticipated in the
covenant. In 1980, a special tax of CEAF 15 per litre (about 7 cents US)
levied on fuel was earmarked for the Road Fund account to increase
revenues to about CFAF 700 million, corresponding to about CFAF 500
million in 1977 prices. However, the Road Fund only really became
effective in early 1981, when it was restructured and the national
distributor of motor fuel began to deposit the levy directly in the Road
Fund. This system provided the Fund with financial and administrative
autonomy.  The s ecial tax was increased by degrees, reaching CFAF 24 in
December 1981. 1
4.11     The 8-km Section    In 1980, the Government carried out the
heavy maintenance on the 8 km section which was agreed to in the Credit
Agreement, although the work was some months behind schedule. However,
1/ In January 1984, the special tax was COAP 30/lt.



this section is again badly deteriorated and will be reconstructed under
the Fourth Highway Project.
4.12     River Transport   The Government approved a sizeable program,
in 1980, to renovate ACCF s infrastructure, rehabilitate the fleet and
upgrade its maintenance. The first phase of the program, estimated at
about CFAF 2.6 billion, is being implemented with assistance from FAC,
FED, CIDA and KfM. To bring order in the chaotic management and river
transport operations, the Government transferred also in 1980,
responsibility for management, and operations of ACCF to a semi-public
r         corporation, SOCATRAF. SOCATRAF leases ACCF's fleet; the revenues from
this partly finance fleet renewal. Under SOCATRAF management, river
transport operations have improved and barge turn around time between
Bangui and Pointe Noire has improved considerably.
Project Costs
4.13     Total project cost was US$31.0 million compared with US$25.7 at
appraisal, an overrun of $5.3 million or 21% in nominal terms. The
overrun was financed by IDA and Kuwait Fund. Slightly over half of the
overrun was caused by currency fluctuations as the dollar declined. The
actual cost increase attributable to price escalation and increased
quantities was only about 10%. The increased quantities included
adjustments to the alignment, a series of unforeseen but justifiable
remedial works on the road amd bridge and a weighing bridge and its road
approaches. The latter was originally to have been financed by ADF, at
an estimated cost of US$350,000.
4.14     Disbursements were made much as scheduled. Cooperation between
the Bank, the Kuwait Fund and ADF was satisfactory.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
Background
5.01     The project was justified on the basis of quantified benefits
arising from:
(a)   savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) for normal and
generated traffic resulting from upgrading the seasonal
Bangui-Bossembele road to a two lane paved standard; and
(b) savings from road maintenance costs plus distance savings
(about 2.5 km) with the latter resulting from alignment
rectifications.
Other benefits resulting from improved road conditions such as journey
time savings and reductions in the numbers of accidents were not included
in the economic evaluation.



- 10 -
5.02     Twelve percent was the overall economic rate of return (ERR)
estimated during appraisal based on the above quantified benefits. The
ERR for the first section of the road from Bangui to Boali was 13% while
that for tL'e second section from Boali to Bossembele was 11%. To assess
the impact of possible adverse scenarios on the estimated ERRs,
sensitivity analyses were carried out and the results were acceptable:
overall the ERR was 11% with the second section showing an ERR of 9%
under the most pessimistic scenario analyzed. Because the existing and
expected traffic volumes on the second road section were modest, separate
estimates of the incremental ERR from constructing particularly this
section in stages were made (i.e. first improving the section to an
engineered gravel standard and then paving it in the future when
justified by the growth in traffic). As the ERRs for paving the road
section right away compared with paving it in stages were both about the
same (11%), indicating that stage construction did not represent
significant economies over paving right away, the first solution was
adopted.
Reestimated ERRs
5.03     Upon project completion, based on the final costs of works and
traffic counted in the road opening year, the reestimated ERR for the
road was about 13.0% compared with the appraisal estimate of 12%.  For
individual road sections, the ERRs were: (i) 12.0% for Bangui - Boali
compared with 13% estimated during appraisal; and (ii) 16.5% for Boali-
Bossembele compared with the appraisal estimate of 11%.
5.04     The methodology for quantifying benefits for the economic
reevaluation is the same as that used during appraisal except that no
benefits for road maintenance savings have been included in the
reestimated ERRs. Had these benefits been included in the reevaluation,
the ERRs would have been higher. Compared with the appraisal estimates,
and after accounting for the incidence of the change in parity between
the dollar and other currencies, final constuction costs in CFAF
increased only modestly (about 10%) and overall the actual traffic
(Table 3) was about the same as estimated during appraisal. For the
purpose of reevaluation, all costs and benefits have been evaluated in
CEAF terms. Quantifying them in US$ terms would have distorted the
comparison with the appraisal estimates largely because of the marked
currency realignments during 1978-81.
5.05     The higher than anticipated ERR on the Boali - Bossembele
section is the result of a higher than expected volume of truck traffic
and from an unanticipated increase in VOC savings for such vehicles.
Traffic counts indicated there were about one-third more heavy vehicles
in the first year than anticipated, (80 vehicles per day assuming
historical annual growth rate of about 8% compared with the appraisal
estimate of about 60 vehicles per day). For this economic reevaluation
VOC estimates were updated to reflect increases in the net cost of
vehicles, spare parts, carburants and vehicle maintenance since the
appraisal. Because benefits from reduced VOC for heavy vehicles are
about 68% higher than for lighter vehicles, a one-third unexpected



increase in the volume of heavy trucks translates into an overall 20%
increase in benefits. The updated VOC estimates, combined with the
higher than expected traffic, offset the modest increase in construction
costs and yielded the higher than anticipated ERR on this section.
5.06     Actual counts indicate that only about 20% of the total average
daily traffic was related to the developmental impact of the project
compared with the 35% estimated during appraisal. The benefits to this
traffic are half of the unit benefit to normal traffic from reductions in
VOC (Table 4). Thus, although still too early to affirm categorically,
the appraisal team's assessment of the project's developmental impact
appears to have been optimistic.
5.07     In conclusion, the reestimated ERRs are close to the appraisal
estimates and reconfirm the appraisal team's judgment about the project's
economic justification and construction priority. The appraisal team's
traffic projections in particular were well made and, overall, correspond
to the traffic counted in the road opening year.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01     The project contained no institutional development components
per se because during project preparation the politico-economic climate
was not propitious and the assimilation and adoption of institutional
improvements unlikely. It was considered urgent, however, to arrest the
decay of the main highway network, by using contractors and force account
directly managed by the donors.
6.02     The politico-economic environment changed in 1979 when new
Government came to power. Both the project and the rehabilitation
efforts of the other donors succeeded and now a sound base exists on
which a continued rehabilitation and maintenance program can proceed.
The Fourth Highway Project contains $12.0 million for institutional
development, which includes components designed to increase CAR's
capability to plan and execute road maintenance.
VII. PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSOCIATION AND BORROWER
The Borrower
a          7.01     The Government recognized the need for road rehabilitation.  It
apparently also realized its own limitations and let the donors assume
direct responsibility for rehabilitation and maintenance of key roads in -
the network. Since 1979, the new Government was fully supportive of the
Association's and other donor's activities in the highway sector and for
the most part met the Credit covenants. It also took measures to
increase the Road Fund Account, in fact providing it with an autonomy
unique in Francophone Africa.



- 12 -
The Association
7.02     The Association initiated the donors coordinated approach to
rehabilitating priority roads. Association supervision of the project
was generally good, particularly its careful handling of the N'Bali
bridge problems. As project implementation advanced it became apparent
that the Government was ready and willing to restore order to the
sector. It was in thia spirit that the Association took the initiative
in launching the Fourth Highway Project which has a strong institutional
development orientation.
VIII. IMPACT OF PROJECT
8.01     The project, together with the concurrent efforts of the
European donors, was a key to laying the foundations for a concerted
effort toward building a road maintenance capacity. Accessibility has
been restored to formerly cut-off areas and the way cleared for the
rehabilitation of the remaining priority network. The changed
administrative environment makes it possible to attempt improvements to
the administrative machinery and the execution of highway maintenance
through efforts to develop the still infant institutions.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.O1     The reconstruction of the Bangui-Bossambele road was completed
satisfactorily ahead of time although the NMBali bridge was delayed
somewhat. Credit covenants for the most part were met. The concurrent
road rehabilitation program of other donors was also successful and the
path cleared for further rehabilitaton of the priority road network under
the Fourth Highway Project and other donors operations. The reestimated
economic rate of return, 13%, was satisfactory.
9.02     An overrun of US$5.3 million was experienced, more than half of
which was due to currency fluctuation. This was financed by an IDA
Supplementary Credit of 3.5 million SDR (US$3.8 million) and additional
Kuwait Funding of US$1.5 million equivalent.
9.03     The Government encountered difficulties in executing its limited
maintenance program but took a major step in the right direction by
restructuring the Road Fund and making it financially autonomous. This,
together with the substantial technical assistance included in the Fourth'
Highway Project, should make it possible to develop and improve the
institutions in the road sector and enable the Government to begin to
finance and execute road maintenance on its own account.

The World Bank
Washington, DC
Dear Mr. Kapur:
In reply to your letter of January 4, 1984, I enclose below my
comments on the Project Completion Report prepared by your Department.
The report coincides broadly with the evaluation prepared on our
side. The following comments therefore relate more to detail than to general
approach.
P. iii, paragraph 2: It should be mentioned that the
BOSSZMBELE-GARDOUA-BOULAT road rehabilitation project, financed by EDF, FAC
and GTZ, provides a link from the Third Project road to the Cameroonian
border, and thus to the port of Douala.
P. 2, para. 2.05:  SOCATRAF (a mixed-capital corporation) is now
responsible for river transportation, while ACCF has become a "Societe de
Patrimoine."
P. 3, para 2.06: Refers to the GTZ from the Federal Republic of
Germany.



ANNEX I
-18-  Page Z of 2
P. 3, para 2.10: BADEA is also participating in the rehabilitation
of the road rmnning to Cameroon, covering the financing of the structural
works costing some US$5 million. The (beginning of the) last sentence should
be rewritten to read "The Association has included, in the preparation of the
Fourth Project
P. 7, para 4.02: It was the Government that decided to resurvey the
section and not the Joint Venture.
-P. 8, para 4.06: The load bearing capacity tests have now been
completed.
P. 8, para 4.07: Provision has been made for maintenance to be
continued until 1984/5.
P. 9, para 4.08 and 4.10: The Road Fund was established in 1981.
P. 9, para 4.10: The Special Tax was increased to CFAF 30 in 1984.
Sincerely,
1sf Guy Darlan
