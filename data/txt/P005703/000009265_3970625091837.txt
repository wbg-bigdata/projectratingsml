MEMORANDUM AND RECOMbIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE I&TERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF TUNISIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A FOURTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed investment loan to Tunisia for
US$30 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate. It would help finance an agricultural credit project and
promote development of a financially sound rural credit system. The National
Bank of Tunisia (BNT), a major commercial bank since 1969, would be the
Borrower, and the Republic of Tunisia the Guarantor.
2.       Background.  The Sixth Development Plan in Tunisia (1982-86) called
for an increase in capital investment in agriculture, which is a priority
sector. The Seventh Plan (1987-91) will continue to treat agriculture as a
priority sector and emphasize greater involvement of private sector financing
of agriculture as part of the current adjustment program. Agricultural credit
will therefore continue to be important. Issues relevant to the project are:
(a) inadequacy of interest rates and spreads; (b) arrears; (c) proliferation
of agricultural credit programs, with different lending conditions; (d) cost
of subsidies under the Special Funds for Agricultural Development and Fishery
(FOSDA/FOSEP), and excessive State intervention in some credit operations.
Recent measures taken include: (a) raising of interest rates by 0.75% to 2%;
(b) enforcing collection of arrears; and (c) making operational the National
Guarantee Fund (FNG) to cover part of the risk of default on subloans made to
small and medium farmers.
3.       Project Objectives and Rationale for Bank involvement.  The project
has been designed in the light of experience gained under earlier credit
projects (in particular the third credit line), and the Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan (ASAL) discussions. The main objectives of the new project
are to (a) restructure the complex institutional system by which agricultural
credit is made available; (b) encourage BNT and the banking sector to increase
their role in mobilizing resources and in financing agriculture through
further interest rate reforms; (c) improve the financial viability of
2419E



- 2 -
agricultural credit operations and harmonize credit terms and conditions; (d)
assist Government in its efforts to develop private investment in the
agricultural sector to meet its objective of raising investment in the sector;
and (e) promote savings schemes tied to eligibility for credit. The Bank's
presence will be catalytic in achieving these objectives more rapidly, and in
setting the stage to bring other commercial banks into agricultural lending
over the next three to five years.
4.       Project Description.  The project would support two major components
from September 1987 to September 1990:
(a) BNT Credit Program: Ci) on-farm investments by small and medium, and
large private farmers, particularly the former; (ii) investments by
cooperatives; (iii) investments by agricultural and agro-industry
enterprises, and selected investments (repairs) by creditworthy
fishermen;
(b) Institutional Development: (i) the MIS software, equipment and
training needed to modernize and strengthen, on a decentralized
basis, BNT organizational structure, planning process, management
control, accounting systems, and loan monitoring systems; and (ii)
the strengthening of the agricultural credit policy coordination
between the Ministries of Planning and Finance, Agriculture and
Agricultural production, the Central Bank (BCT), BNT and the National
Bank for Agricultural Development CBNDA), a Government development
bank created in 1983. The Coordinating Committee would plan and
monitor reforms, and coordinate the execution of the subsequent
Government policy decisions.
Total projept cost is estimated at US$59 million equivalent, including
US$30 million equivalent or about 51% in foreign exchange. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Retroactive financing
of up to 10% of the loan amount (US$3 million) would be made available to the
Borrower to help bridge the financing gap between the Third Credit Line and
this loan and ensure that the BNT institutional component is not unreasonably
delayed. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Tunisia are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6622-TUN dated June 1, 1987, is being distributed
separately.
5.       Actions agreed.  Under the recent ASAL, the Government agreed to (a)
the principle of achieving, during the Seventh Plan period, an interest rate
and spread structure for agriculture which covers the financial and operating
costs at reasonable efficiency and a reasonable part of the risks, with the
objective of encouraging the banking sector to play its role more fully in
financing development; a first interest rate adjustment, acceptable to the
Bank, is a condition of second tranche release and (b) the reduction and
better targetting of budgetary allocations to the credit part of FOSDA, with
current, sharply reduced levels to be maintained in 1987 and a further 15%
reduction for 1988. Under the Project, specific actions have been defined and
agreed to achieve:
Z4 1 SE



- 3 -
(a) the agreed medium-term adjustment on interest rates and spreads; this
includes agreement to increase interest rates by not less than 0.5%
for medium-term and 0.25% for short-term rates by August 31, l987-'
as a first step to bring agricultural interest rates in line with
market rates, and an agreed schedule of adjustments in 1988, 1989,
1990, and 1991 so that market rates are reached by end 1991 as agreed
under the ASAL.
(b) continued action to reduce budgetary allocations to the FOSDA
subsidized credit programs: this includes agreement on a 15%
Leduction by end 1989 and another 151 by end 1990 over the reduced
level of Dll million, such level to be reached in nominal terms by
end 1988 under the ASAL.
In addition, Government has (i) agreed on improving bad debts policy, and FNG
operating procedures; (ii) defined in April 1987 the eligibility of small- and
medium-scale farmers to institutional credit in a way satisfactory to the
Bank; (iii) rescheduled in March 1987 the debts due by farmers where this was
justified; and (iv) agreed on promoting farmers bank savings schemes linked to
eligibility for credit during project implementation. Government has also:
Ci) signed a poliLy letter to be implemented by BNT and incorporating the
project proposals, in particular those on interest rates, spreads, FOSDA,
recoveries, savings, risks, guarantees, provision for bad debts, and
harmonization of subloan lending terms, conditions and procedures; and (ii)
specifically confirmed in the policy letter that measures taken and to be
taken to complete by December 31, 1989 the nationwide subloan harmonization
process would lead in particular to the merger of BNT agricultural credit
programs (including FOSDA) into a single fund managed by BNT (fungibility of
funds). BNT's improved MIS will be put in place during the project period.
Government would set up the Agricultural Credit Policy Coordinating Committee
by December 31, 1987.
6.       Justification.  The proposed project would support the Government's
medium-term adjustment effort to establish a policy and institutional
framework which would promote development of a financially sound rural credit
system. Through provision of investment credit to private farmers, the
project would also contribute to increased agricultural production and rural
employment. Bank involvement is justified because of the sectorwide
improvements being introduced under the project.
7.       Risks.  On the basis of past experience, the risks are mainly the
Government's possible lack of commitment to go ahead with the proposed
reforms. Since the project has been designed to be fully consistent with the
Government's medium-term program already mutually agreed by the Bank and the
Government under the ASAL, this risk is considered reduced.
1/ In any event not later than loan effectiveness of the proposed
agricultural credit project.

8.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
