MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO ETHIOPIA FOR A
WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Ethiopia for SDR 24.0 million (US$35.73 million equivalent) to help finance a
Water Supply Development and Rehabilitation Project. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years
Background
2.    The water supply and sanitation sector in Ethiopia is characterized by severe deficiency of
physical infrastructure, and by inadequate management capacity of the sector institutions to handle
policy and regulatory issues, and to plan, operate and maintain services.
3.    Access to sufficient and safe water supply is very limited: only about 17 percent of the total
population has safe potable water, and sanitation service coverage is even lower. Water supply
coverage in urban areas, where some 10 percent of the population lives, is better (about 70 - 90%/O),
but with significant inequalities in the larger towns, especially Addis Ababa, where over half of the
people live in areas which have serious deficiencies in basic infrastructure and little or no access to
municipal services. Even the existing schemes are suffering from low production level and high
leakage of water. Of some 200 urban water supply schemes, serving 3 million people (including the
satellite schemes), 80 percent require major rehabilitation or additional construction. Currently, only
22 schemes are newly constructed, 7 are under construction for additional capacity and 12 are under
rehabilitation. Of more than 6,000 rural water supply schemes serving 17 million people, some 30
percent are not functioning properly due to lack of maintenance. Water quality is also poor: problems
include high bacterial pollution, high fluorine and mineral content, salinity, and the existence of guinea
worm.
4.     Following the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia's (GFDRE's)
policy of regionalization which began in 1993, responsibility for water supply and sanitation services,
which had previously been assigned to the central Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, was
transferred to the water supply bureaus of the newly created regional governments. Although some
personnel have been transferred to the regions,  the regional governments still lack hands-on
experience in managing water supply operations and need technical assistance to develop their human
resources. Sector institutions are now required to take on the responsibility of providing regional
governments with policy advice, investment planning and technical support to assist them in managing
water supply operations on a sustainable basis.
5.    There are four major issues in the sector. First, financial viability and cost recovery of
urban water supply operations. Water and sewerage tariffs need to reflect adequate cost recovery
principles. Tariffs for most of the water supply schemes have not been revised for over 15 years, and
are insufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs. Second, formalization of the institutional
structure. The institutional structure in the sector has been defined, including relations between the
Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) and the regional governments, and is awaiting issuance of
proclamations.  However, although the regional governments have de facto taken over the
responsibilities and claims for revenues from the operation and maintenance of urban and rural water
supply schemes, a number of issues remain unsolved, including the roles of the sector institutions,
functions of the regional governments' water bureaus, management of cross-regional water resources,
legal arrangements regarding the ownership of schemes, and local financial management. Third, there



2
is a need for an assessment of water resources and establishment of a water resources
management master plan. GFDRE has initiated assessments of the eight major river basins in
Ethiopia, which are in progress to varying degrees. Initial preparation of a national water resources
master plan has also begun, with assistance from a bilateral donor. A satisfactory water resources
policy and strategy would be in place prior to IDA financing of any future major investments which
involve the development of water resources. Finally, inadequate donor cordination in the sector.
Assistance has generally focused on individual donors' priorities, with no consistent consideration of
overall sector policies. GFDRE must begin to actively coordinate dialogue with donors and sector
stakeholders.
Project Rationale
6.     One of the priority policies of the Government during the transitional period was to accelerate
provision of water supply and sanitation facilities to urban and rural areas. Dialogue with the
Government and its sector institutions regarding the Bank's potential support of the water supply and
sanitation sector began in April 1992. These discussions focussed on capacity building and continued
assistance for rehabilitation and augmentation of existing systems in Addis Ababa and war-affected
and neglected regions.  Based on these initial discussions, the Water Supply Development and
Rehabilitation Project was identified as the best vehicle for addressing the most pressing needs of the
sector. The proposed project focuses on building capacity in the regions to operate water supply and
sanitation schemes, while the proposed Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project (SRDFP)
would assist construction of rural water supply operations. The project also contributes to GFDRE's
major sector objectives, which are (i) rehabilitation and improvement of water supply and sanitation
infrastructure and operations; and (ii) capacity building of water supply and sanitation sector
institutions. The achievement of the sector objectives would greatly contribute to the alleviation of
poverty, the primary development objective for the country, through better health and higher
productivity of the population, improvement of women's household work conditions, capacity
development and income and employment generation.
Project Objectives
7.     The main objectives of the project are to ensure the long-term viability of water supply and
sanitation operations in line with the Government's regionalization policies and, in the long run,
improve the health and productivity of the population. These objectives would be met by providing
assistance for (i) building the capacity of the regional governments and the water supply and sanitation
agencies to manage urban water supply and sanitation schemes and rural water supply operations; (ii)
formulating policies to ensure long-term financial and managerial viability of water supply operations,
establishment of regulatory arrangements and sound investment planning by regional governments and
water supply agencies; and (iii) short- and medium-term physical rehabilitation, augmentation and
establishment of urban water supply and sanitation schemes in the war-affected and most deficient
regions.

Project Description
8.    The project would include:
(a) Institutional support to the regional governments of Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali,
Benshangul, Southern Ethiopia People's, Gambella and Harar regions, the Addis Ababa
Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA), and MOWR through (i) regulatory policy
formulation studies in the urban and rural water supply and sanitation sector; (ii) studies on
organizational, financial and technical management, and rural water supply development;
(iii) provision of short-term technical assistance for the implementation of the
recommendations of the studies, including a pilot scheme for rural water supply
development; (iv) manpower development and training; and (v) provision of equipment,
maintenance rigs, mobile workshops and vehicles (US$28.5 million, 53% of the base
project cost);
(b)  Engineering consultancv for (i) pre-investment studies and detailed engineering designs for
the rehabilitation and extension of urban water supply and sanitation schemes in the 25
towns; and (ii) design of regional water supply headquarters in Afar, Somali, Benshangul
and Gambella regions; (US$5.64 million, 10% of the base project cost); and
(c)  Physical works, including (i) immediate rehabilitation/extension of several urban water
supply schemes; and (ii) civil and building works for the above four regional water supply
headquarters and AWSA's branch offices (US$19.7 million, 37% of the base project
cost).
Project Financing
9.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$65.5 million, with a  foreign exchange
component of US$29.28 million (46 percent). The proposed IDA credit of US$35.73 million
represents approximately 55 percent of the estimated total project cost, net of taxes and duties. The
Government's contribution will be US$29.22 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown at Schedule A. The economic and financial analysis tables and key
performance indicators are given in Schedule B. The procurement and the disbursement profiles are
shown in are shown in Schedule C. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Ethiopia are given in Schedules D and E, respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 1440 1-ET is being distributed separately A map is also attached..
Project Implementation
10.   The water supply operation units of the Water Resource Departments of the regional
governments would be the beneficiaries of the project. To facilitate implementation and enhance
ownership of the regional components, a project manager will be appointed by each regional Water
Resource Development Department. Counterpart staff for the studies and technical assistance will be
explicitly appointed for the project activities. The regional managers will report to the National
Project Coordinator who has been appointed at MOWR with responsibility for day-to-day
implementation and for supervision of quality of outputs. MOWR will coordinate and supervise all



4
project activities, except for the AWSA sub-component, for which AWSA will be the executing
agency.
11.   A Steering Committee to supervise project implementation has been established under the
chairmanship of the Vice-Minister of MOWR, with membership from MOWR (Heads of the Water
Supply and Sewerage and the Planning and Projects Departments), AWSA, Regional Bureaus and
related Ministries as necessary. The National Project Coordinator will be the secretariat of the
Committee and will report on progress of the project and any issue which requires the Committee's
intervention.
12.    Special implementation arrangements would be established to manage the studies and
technical assistance in order to (i) enhance ownership of the project activities by the executing
agencies; (ii) establish accountability in the process of skill transfer from the technical assistance
experts to the personnel of the executing agencies; and (iii) ensure sustainability of the improved skills
of the executing agencies. Ownership would be enhanced by including MOWR personnel in the
experts' team and by assigning executing agencies' counterpart staff to the teams. Accountability
would be established by preparing detailed work plans with clearly defined measurable outputs and
timetables, establishing an objective evaluation system of performance, and providing appropriate
incentives. Sustainability would be ensured by providing counterpart staff with clearly defined work
plans, performance-based incentive schemes and an objective performance evaluation system; by
establishing a clearly defined exit mechanism for the consultants, with timebound actions; and by
coordinating the technical assistance with other training activities. The above arrangements are set out
in the Project Implementation Manual.
13.    Consultative meetings with donors would be organized bi-annually by MOWR, with
assistance from the IDA project team, to ensure that donors' positions on major policy issues such as
cost recovery, institutional set-up and water resource assessment are consistent, that their approaches
to capacity building and physical rehabilitation are in accordance with the Government's sector
objectives, and that they are kept informed of the financial requirements for future investments in the
sector. The first of such meetings will be held in June 1996.
Project Sustainability
14.   The project is essentially designed to ensure the sustainability of water supply and sanitation
operations by assisting capacity building of the sector institutions, sector investment planning and
establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework. The technical assistance to be provided under
the project would have a built-in mechanism to ensure accountable transfer of skills and sustainable
improvement of institutional capacity by provid;ng counterpart staff with clearly defined work plans,
incentive schemes and an objective performance evaluation system; by establishing clearly defined exit
mechanisms with timebound performance monitoring targets; and by coordinating the technical
assistance with other training activities. Appointment of counterpart staff for implementation of the
capacity building studies component would be completed by June 1996. Financial sustainability
would be ensured by implementation of appropriate water tariffs by the Regions: recovery of operation
and maintenance costs would be achieved by June 30, 1998.

Lessons from Past Bank/IDA Operations
15.   Lessons learned from Bank's operational experiences in the sector have been incorporated in
the design of the project. OED's 1992 review of the Bank's 120 water supply and sanitation projects
from 1967 to 1989 points to the need to have: (i) a comprehensive water resource management
strategy; (ii) appropriate sector regulatory framework; (iii) sufficient autonomy of water supply and
sanitation institutions; (iv) appropriate tariff level and structure: (v) clear measures to reduce
unaccounted-for water; (vi) human resource management system; (vii) better assessment of
environmental impact; (viii) better assessment of poverty alleviation; and (ix) better compliance with
covenants. All these points are being addressed under the project.
16.   A review of 24 water supply and sanitation projects in the Africa region in 1993 indicated that
improvement in performance of water utilities requires (i) earnest efforts to build local capacity; (ii)
private sector participation; and (iii) demand driven planning and management. Capacity building at
the regional level is the primary objective of the project. Increased participation of the stakeholders in
sector planning would be reviewed and proposed by the stud-es under the project, and a pilot scheme
to promote a participatory approach for rural water supply development would be established, with
possible involvement of non-governmental organizations and other donors.
17.   The Project Performance Audit Report on the Bank's loan to AWSA (Addis Ababa Water
Supply Project, Ln. 818-ET) raised issues of: (i) difficulty in land acquisition; (ii) delays in audit; (iii)
inconsistent financial covenants; (iv) poor financial management; (v) high level of unaccounted-for
water; and (vi) lack of autonomy in deciding key policy issues. The current project does not involve
any land acquisition or resettlement. Audits under the two ongoing urban projects (Market Towns
Development Project (Cr. 2103-ET) and Second Addis Ababa Urban Development Project (Cr. 2161-
ET)) are up to date. AWSA's financial management would be strengthened by the technical assistance
and training to be provided under the project. Technical assistance to improve metering and billing
operations would also be provided, and rehabilitation of the distribution network to reduce the high
rate of unaccounted-for water in Addis Ababa would be carried out under a follow-on investment
project. AWSA's new institutional charter provides AWSA's Board with autonomy in deciding key
policy issues.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
18.   The project is consistent with the Government's sector objectives and the Countrv Assistance
Strategy discussed by the Executive Directors on June 13. 1995 in that it will (i) contribute to better
access to safe water and sanitation facilities for the population in the project towns and for the
adjacent rural populations, which will improve health and raise the productivity of the population; (ii)
support human resource development and capacity building in the regional governments; and (iii)
facilitate establishment of a regulatory framework which is conducive to the introduction of full cost
recovery principles in utility operations and the greater involvement of the various stakelholders.
Agreed Actions
19.   During negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) AWSA's revenue-generating activities
and accounts receivable reduction requirements over the project period (120 days by end-FY95/96, 90
days by end-FY97/98, and 60 days by end-FY98/99 and thereafter); (b) establishment by June 30,
1998, and maintenance over the remainder of the project period, of water tariffs sufficient to cover



6
operations and maintenance costs of the water supply schemes in the 25 towns; (c) appointment of
regional counterpart staff for the capacity building studies by June 30, 1996; (d) the content of the
project implementation manual; (e) the scope and timing of the interim review; and (f) timing of
establishment of target monitoring indicators. Conditions of effectiveness are (a) signing of a Grant
Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and AWSA; (b) provision of terms of reference for
preparation of the monitoring indicators; and (c) award of the consultancy contracts for the capacity
building studies.
Environmental Aspects
20.   No major negative environmental issues are expected. There is no resettlement under the
project. The project would, in the long run, contribute to improvement of the environment in the form
of safe water and better sanitation. The integration of environmental concerns in the water sector will
be the subject of training sessions and studies under the project, which has a "C" environmental rating.
Program Objective Categories
21.    The program objective categories of the project are poverty reduction and human resource
development and economically sustainable development.
Participatory Approach
22.    Each Region has been visited by the project preparation team and their specific requests for
assistance have been discussed. In addition, the Prime Minister's Office has held several seminars for
the Regional Bureaus' management to discuss policy issues and institutional structures; Bank staff
participated in the seminars to discuss the issues and the project. The ultimate beneficiaries of water
supply and sanitation operations, the consumers, have been consulted at public water fountains and
communal sanitation facilities during field trips to the project towns. Systematic client consultation
process will be established based on the recommendations of the Organizational Management Study.
23.   To facilitate participation of stakeholders in the sector, a participatory approach would be
adopted in the implementation of the pilot rural water supply scheme with possible involvement of
non-governmental organizations and other donors.  The experiences and lessons learned from this
pilot scheme would be utilized for future investments in rural water and sanitation operations to be
financed, in part, by the SRDFP.
24.    The Project Implementation Manual includes monitoring indicators to assess the performance
of the water bureaus of the regional governments and AWSA, as well as the socioeconomic impact
on the population. A quick baseline survey will be conducted by September 30, 1996 to establish a
basis for performance targets for assessment of benefits, especially to women and the poor.
Benefits
25.    The project is expected to produce the following immediate benefits: (a) the regional
governments would develop improved technical, financial, planning and administrative capacity to
implement and manage urban water supply and sanitation schemes and rural water supply operations,
as well as physical infrastructure and small-scale service facilities to provide technical support for
rural water supply operations; (b) four regional governments would have administrative office



7
headquarters and small scale service facilities to provide technical support for rural water supply
operations; (c) AWSA would develop an appropriate financial management system, and administrative
and planning capacity, as well as the physical administrative infrastructure required to undertake
future major investments in water supply and sanitation schemes in Addis Ababa; (d) pre-investment
studies and engineering designs would be completed for the 25 towns to facilitate future sector
planning of the regional governments; (e) appropriate principles and management capacity for pricing
and cost recovery for the urban water supply operations would be established and implemented by
MOWR and the regional governments; (f) a regulatory framework for the sector would be established
by MOWR and the regional governments, which would take into account market entry and exit,
private sector participation, participation of the public, incentives and disincentives for performance,
control of monopoly and enforcement of regulations; and (g) improvement in availability, reliability
and quality of water through rehabilitation of water schemes and provision of maintenance rigs and
mobile workshops.
26.    The development of management capacity and establishment of an appropriate regulatory
framework would contribute to the improvement of performance of both urban and rural operations.
The short-term minor rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation systems in the project towns,
enhanced maintenance capacity of the Regional Bureaus, and establishment of administrative
headquarters would have a positive impact, primarily on urban and adjacent peri-urban populations.
A study and a pilot scheme for developing least cost rural water supply systems would benefit the
rural populations. In respect of the physical improvement of the sector, major rehabilitation of the
urban systems in the project towns would be canried out in a follow-on investment project, while
investments in rehabilitation and development of rural water supply systems would be made with
assistance from the SRDFP.
27.    The project would benefit the populations in all regions, especially some 550,000 people
living in and around the 25 project towns, in addition to about 8.2 million in other towns serviced by
enhanced maintenance from the service rigs and mobile workshops. In the long run, the project would
have a particularly beneficial impact on the poor and women. A general improvement in health arising
from the provision of safe water and sanitation services to be achieved in the follow-on investment
project, including a reduction in intestinal morbidity and infant mortality, would contribute to higher
labor productivity of the population. Easier access to a reliable supply of safe water would relieve
women of the burden of fetching water and reduce the time spent in caring for unhealthy infants. In
addition, the poor are likely to be the major beneficiaries of employment to be generated through
future follow-on sector investments.
28.    A full economic analysis has been conducted and is presented in the Staff Appraisal Report.
The estimated economic rate of return of the water supply rehabilitation and capacity building
components (23 percent of total project cost) is 18.4 percent'. The net present value of these
The following components are not included in the calculation of economic costs: (i) studies, technical assistance,
miscellaneous equipment and buildinig works for AWSA, whose main benefits are to be realized under the follow-
on Addis Ababa Water Supply Stage MA investment project; (ii) nmral water supply pilot scheme, whose benefits
will materialize under the rural water supply componenlt of IDA's proposed Social Rehabilitation and Development
Fwud Project; (iii) the regulatory study for MOWR, the benefits of which accrue to the country rather than the
population of the regional towns; and (iv) feasibility anid engineering studies, since their benefits will be realized by
the actual construction/expansion of new water supply schemes to be carried out under the follow-on investment
project.



8
components, at a 12 percent discount rate, is US$10.6 million. The benefit/cost ratio of this
component is 1.27.
Risks
29.   The major risk would be delays in Government implementation of key policy issues, including
establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework and implementation of tariff increases. This
risk would be minimized by confirmation of the Government's commitment in the Letter of Sector
Policy and upfront tariff increases. There is also a risk that the project management capacity of
newly created regional governments may not improve as fast as desired; this risk would be mitigated
by early initiation of capacity building studies, using PPF funds, as well as technical assistance and
training to be provided under the project.
30.   A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the effect of these risks on the expected
returns of the Project, taking into account various factors such as deviation in water tariff increases,
water consumption, operation and maintenance costs, health benefits and implementation timing. The
base case (most likely) scenario is: tariffs=2.5 Birr/cubic meter; water consumption= 15 liters/day;
operation and maintenance costs=US$2.9 million per year; and US$2 per capita lost due to
waterborne diseases. For the net present value to become negative, tariffs would have to increase by
less than 1.4 Birr; water consumption to reach no more than 8 liters per day; investment and
operation and maintenance costs would have to be 33 percent higher; health benefits only 12% of total
estimated; and project implementation delayed by two years.
Recommendation
31.    1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Main Assumptions:
Discount rate: 12%
Growth in demand: 3% per year
Growth in real prices of output: Tariffs to be increased from ETB 0.5-2.5 per cubic meter to an
average of ETB 2.5 by the year 2005
Growth in GDP per capita: 2% per year from US $ 130
Real Exchange Rate: constant at ETB 6.25 = US $ 1
Water Consumption increase from 7 lpd to 15 lpd by the year 2000
Unaccounted for water to be gradually reduced from 40% to 30% by the year 2005
Prevailing rates of water-borne disease: 45/1000 in a two-week period
Average days of restricted activity: 6.2 days per incidence
Average expenditure on treatment of disease: ETB 12.7 per capita per year
Income lost due to sickness: 80% of income per capita for economically active population and 20%
for the rest of the population
Physical Contingencies: 10% over base costs for civil works and other physical works; 5% for
consultancies and studies
Switching Values of Critical Items:
Tariffs would have to be increased only to ETB 1.65 for NPV to become negative
Water Consumption lower than 8.8 lpd by the year 2000 would make the NPV negative
Annual O&M costs and Investment would have to be 23% higher than estimated for NPV to become
negative
Health benefits would have to be 20% of estimated base case for NPV to become negative
A delay of over two years will reduce the ERR to 12.4%
2   Financial analysis of this project was not undertaken because of, in part, the lack of reliable financial data of the
water supply units of the project towns due to the civil war and, in part, the incipient status of financial
management of the water supply units in the project towns.

Nature of Benefits:
Consumers' surplus from more water available due to the project
Health benefits
Potential savings to consumers from not buying from vendors (not included)
Improved technical, financial, planning and administrative capacity of the Regional Governments and
Project Towns (not included)
Main Benefwsiaries:
550,000 people who live in the 25 small towns with relatively high poverty incidence in which the
rehabilitation works will be undertaken and about 8.2 million people who live in towns where better
maintenance would be provided under the project.

ETHIOPIA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
As of December 31, 1995, there were 12 ongoing projects in Ethiopia. Out of this, six
projects (amounting to a commitment of US$ 270 million) were prepared in the 1980s during the
Derg regime period. The other six projects have been prepared since FY92 in response to the
changed policy environment in the country. The country portfolio represents a total commitment of
US$ 977 million, with an undisbursed amount of US$ 507 million (and US$ 433 million excluding
adjustment operation) as of end-December 1995. Disbursements for investment operations have
averaged US$ 67 million a year during the period FY91-95.
Ethiopia's poor portfolio performance is explained by a number of factors. First, the civil
strife in the 1980s slowed down the pace of implementation of projects. Implementation delays
were caused by inappropriate policies and general mismanagement during the several years prior to
the Transitional Government (TGE) assuming power. Second, many of the projects which had been
designed by the previous government did not correspond to those of the new regime, thus resulting
in a loss of commitment and ownership by the new regime. Third, sector strategies (e.g., forestry
sector, environmental aspects) had changed, rendering some projects or components of projects
inappropriate in the new sector setting. The ongoing institutional changes in the country, including
the regionalization process, have raised a new set of issues and development challenges. While
generic and other problems remain, of course, there has been a real, substantive change in the
status of IDA's projects in Ethiopia.
The current portfolio better meets government priorities and is better focused on the key
development objectives of the country. The Goverunent, with the assistance of the Bank Group,
has made an effort to restructure and rationalize the portfolio. This rationalization has included in
some cases the significant modifications of projects to accord better with the priorities established
by the new regime, and in other cases, the closure of low priority or problem projects. A total
amount of about US$ 112 million was canceled from projects in FY94 and FY95. The
restructuring process has helped to reduce the number of projects in the portfolio from 19 in FY94
to 16 in FY95, and lowered the number of problem projects as measured by "implementation
progress" from 4 to 3 over this same period.
On the basis of development objectives rating, however, the percentage of problem projects
rose from 16 to 19, during this period, mainly due to the downgrading of the Transport project.
Two problem projects, Livestock Services and Transport, were subsequently closed during FY95,
thus further reducing the number of problem projects turned over to FY96 to only one under both
ratings. The projects currently rated as unsatisfactory are the Peasant Agricultural Development
Project (PADEP I), Market Towns and Second Addis Urban Development. While PADEP I has
been restructured, and it has begun to show signs of improvement, the unsatisfactory rating is
being retained until the impact of the restructuring is clear and disbursements begin to take place.
While the development objectives of Market Towns and Second Addis Urban Development remain
valid and implementation progress in some components of the projects continue to be satisfactory,
several other important components require restructuring to fit the Government's current policies.
The restructuring of these projects is expected to be completed during FY96 and performance
rating in the future will reflect the actual implementation experience of the restructured projects.
The Bank Group is continuously monitoring those projects which have been slow to
disburse. The Small Scale Irrigation project, which was launched in FY88, did not disburse in the

first four years because Ethiopia was at its height of a centrally controlled economy. Since FY92,
the remaining concerns on the security situation and the more recent phase of regionalization, had a
delaying impact on the progress of the project. Following the agreements on the revised action
plan in FY93, and improvements in beneficiary participation, the progress and, more importantly,
the physical implementation of the project on the ground in the last two years has been greater than
the progress achieved in the previous four years. The second and final extension of the project has
been agreed for end-December 1996. The Education VII and the Family Health Projects, which
were also approved in FY88, were not implemented in the first four years. Following the
restructuring of projects in FY93, implementation pace has begunb to pick up, and supervision
strengthened. The Calub Gas project (FY94), was slow to disburse as it became effective only in
October 1995, once the problem of recruitment of consultants was addressed. The pace of
implementation should pick up from here onwards. The closing date for the second tranche of
SAC1 has been extended to September 1996 to give time to Government to put in place pre-
shipment inspection services to enable the disbursement of the funds.
A number of other actions are also being taken to improve performance of the country
portfolio. The Resident Mission has been strengthened to better focus on implementation issues.
Increased attention is being given to functional supervision (e.g., procurement, accounting and
auditing, disbursements) and to early detection and action on problems. Efforts are being made to
ensure the government commitment to the imnplementation of the projects and improved quality of
projects at the entry level. CPPRs are being strengthened to address general obstacles to project
implementation and assess in depth the issues related to problem projects, and involve beneficiaries
m project implementation and supervision activities, as well as in project preparation.
