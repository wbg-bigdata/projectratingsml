SECTION I
ENVIIl)NIENTAL ACTON PLAN
1.   INTRODUCTiON
1.1   GWN General Description
1.          TIhe proposed Guigang Multi-Purpose Navigation project (GMPN), located
between the Xi3in and Guiping resrvoirs (Figure 1. 1.1) on the Yujiang river, is an integral
part of the Guangxi Autonomous Region's economic development strategy. The Yujiang
river is a tributary of the Xijiang river system, which drains an approximate area of 90,800
km2 and discharges mto the Pearl nver delta in the east. The nver system is a major route
for the trasportation of raw  materials and manufactured goods from as far inland as Sichuan,
and thus occupies a vital positon in the economy of the regon.
2.          The primary objective of the proposed GMPN project is to improve the
navigability of the Yujiang riner between the Xijin dam and Guigang city. The project will
ensure a minimum navigable water depth during dry seasons, thus guaranteeng an
uninterrupted flow of shipping and the reclassification of he river to a Class m waterway
accessible to 1000 ton barges. The upgrading will make the Yujiang river the backbone of
the Xijiapc, river system trasportation strategy and thus facilitate economic development in
Guangxi and the adjacent provinces.
3.          Additional benefits of the proposed GMPN project include hydropower
generation and increased availabilty of water which may be diverted for irrgation projects
in the future. Guigang city and to a lesser extent the upstream Hengxian county are currendy
constrained in their development due to a shortage of ectric power. The project will have
the capacity to generate 120 MW of hydro-electic power to supplement area supplies. A
minimnum capacity of approximately 36 MW is guaranteed during the dry season, which
amounts to an average 590 GW.h of annual power generation. It is also anticipated that
several thousand hectares of medium productivity land may be brought under cultivation
following project completion due to the increased availability of high quaity irrigation water-
Environmental assessments of proposed irrigation projects will be undertaken by the relevant
implementation agencies as needed and in accordance with Chinese regulations.
4.          The main physical components of the project include (i) construction of a damr,
ship lock, and hydropower station at Guigang, and (ii) small-scale removal of rock shoals
at three locations by blastng. Originally the GMPWN project was proposed as part of a
domestically fnided multi-component infrastructure construction project and had received
approval for implementation. An EIA for the entire project was prepared in 1990 and
approved by the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) in 1991. However, due
to funding constran, only the bridge component which is part of the Guigang urban
infrastrucue program and is sabstantially financed by the city was initiated and is now
nearng completion. The remaining components which are included in te inland water way

program were re-packaged and submitted to the State Planning Commission (SPC) and
approved for international financing.
5.          As detailed in the ELA Report, the overall project impacts are minimized due
to relatively good planning and implementation strategies on the part of the project
proponents. However, an overal monitoring strategy is requred to provide an on-going
evaluation of the project constrction and operation, and to implement mitigation strategies
for un-anticipated impacts.
1.2          Principal Adverse Impacts on the EIvronment
6.           As detailed in the EIA Report, the major environmental impacts of the
proposed GMPN project mclude:
i.    Construction ?eriod
7.          The impacts on the environment include disruption of areas adjacent to the
project site, soil erosion, temporary water quality decline, and potental air quality
degradation resulting from construction activities and tasporttion of construction materials.
ii.    Reservoir Embankment and Adjacent Areas
8.          Bank collapse may increase as a result of project construction. Inundation will
affect surrounding low-lying areas, including cultivated lands. The major portion of bank
failures will occur in Jingwu, ringnan and Xieyu.  The widest collapse will be
approximately 33-37 meters. Approximately 100 ha of land immediately adjacent to the
proposed reservoir will be inundated following project completion. The major impact areas
include Xiangjiang and Watang.
iii.   Cultivated Lands
9.          The total cultivated area impacted by inundation is estimated at approximately
448 ha, and land requisition for the project will affect another 132 ha (including
approximately 53 ha for temporary construction facilities). Consequently, agricultural
production will experience adverse impacts.
vi.   Aquatic Products
10.         Two spawning grounds in Erweizhou and Xueyi Tan will be inundated
foilowing construction. disruptng carp reproduction.
v.    Historical Sites
11.         Certain low-lying Segments of the neolithic archeological sites identified in
Chapter 4 of the EIA will be inundated following construction- However, plans have been
formulated to remove the archeological artifacts in these areas at a cost of approximately
1.15 RMB.
3



vi.   Water Quality
12.         During the construction phase, the main impacts on water quality will be
turbidity from foundation excavation work and coffer darm construction at the project site and
from shoal blasting at three locations within the reservoir area. In the operation phase, water
quality impacts due to biodegradable materials are anticipated to improve slightly and
deteriorate slightly in terms of metals and COD. During certain! periods of the dry season,
water will be retained in the reservcir for electicity generatng purposes, resulting in
temporary downstream water quality degradation.
vii.  Ecological Environment
13.         The flooding of mud-flats and grass beds which will result -rom the project
may impact some migrating bird species and reptiles which inhabit these areas, particulaly
tortoises and soft-shelled tures. Changes in the river ecosystem may also have some impact
on aquatic plants, fish and hydrophyte species in the reservoir and downstream areas.
Baseline ecological studies within the reservoir area have identified certain locations which
are classified as potential habitat for aquatic fauna. However no endangered species other
than the Guangxi soft shell turle have been observed within the projea area as the
environment has long been dirted by industrial and agricultural activities.
1.3         Institutional Arrangements
14.         In order to ensure the implementation of environmental measures as stipulated
in the Environmental Action Plan (EAP), the followig insttutional arrangements as
presented in Figure 1.3.1 have been agreed upon:
(a)    Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) has overall authncty within the
project. The Deputy Chief of the Foreign Capital Utilization Division (Ms.
Xiong Hui Jun) is responsible for project environmental issues within GCD.
(b)   Xijiang Project Headquarters (XJPH) located in Guigang has project
responsibility during ooth construction and operation phases. Under the
guidance of the Vice Director for environmental and resettlement issues (Mr.
Huang Fu Sheng), the Environmentl Management Group (EMG) which
includes two experienced technical staff, are responsiole for managing project
environmental issues during the constuction period and operational phase.
The two environmental staff shall be directly appointed by GCD and will be
permanent, full-time employees of X1PH.
The EMG, which will be established in early 1995, will advise the XJPH
Director and other group managers concering project environmnental issues
through participation on the XJPH management group. EMG will also
manage the project environmental monitoring sub-contract with the Guigang
Enviromnental Monitoring Center (GEMC) and direct aEl monitoring and
reporting activities. Figure 1.3.2 presents the task chart of the Environmental
Management Group.

BarLk.
2.          IMPACT MTIGATION
2.1         Mitigation Strategv
16.         The basic principles for environmcna protection of the project area iiclude;
the following:
a.    The project design mcludes elements for possible envirommental improvement
of the project area and avoiding or minimizimg environmental imp   Where
avoidance or minimization are not possible, economically and technically
feasible mitigation measures have been formulated Lor implementaion within
a reasonable time frame.
b.    Environmental protection- measures include mitigation of impacts during the
construction and operation phases of the project.
17.         The project design includes measues for minimizing social and economic
impacts on area inhabitants. Initially several thousand area inhabitants have been impacted
by the reservoir filling. As a result of foTmulating protection measures, none of the area
inhabitants need to be relocated following project construction. Those inhabitants whose land
will be inundated are to be compensated with new land, money and if necessary vocational
training which at minimum will allow them to sustain their present income levels. The
economic compensation packages are designed to ensure that no physical relocation is
required.
18.         Ir, order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics, sanitation and public health
measures such as septic tanks. and solid waste management will be required both in the
construction area and in. the workers' living quarters. These measures are designed to protect
the reservoir and surrounding areas from contamination.
19.         Major environmental impacts during construction include atmospheric
degradation due to fugitive dust, water quality degradation due to constraction activities, and
increased erosion resulting from removal of surface vegetation. To minimize fugitive dust
impacts, road surfaces, excavation areas and construction areas should be sprayed and kept
m.oist for dust control. Erosion control may be .chieved .by minimizing disruption of
vegetation and exposed sur.faces until necessary, and installing silt traps and other erosion
prevention measures. After construction is completed, the site and its surrounding areas
should be restored as closely as possible to their original state.
20.         ?ost construction mitigation alternatives are presented in as much detail as
possible in the EIA report. Details of mitigation measure implementation are presented in
the present report.
7



2.2   Scope and content of the EA
21.         As a supplemental report to the GMPN project EIA, the EAP will chiefly
discuss the implementation plan, icluding miiigaiion measure, implementation schedule,
investments and general concepts which need to be considered during the project construction
anDa operation phases. Based on the conclusion of the EIA and recommended mitigation
measures, the scope of environmental activities include:
a.    inundation protection engineering
b.    embankment reinforcement and protection of bank vegetation
c.    reservoir bottom cleaning
d.    protection of historic sites
e-    rebuilding spawning gonds
f.    environmental monitoring during project construction and operation
g.   landscape restoration
h.    sanitation and public health
i.    water pollution control of indusLrial and municipal wastewater
j.    protection of the public water supply (including relocation of the
waterworks intake)
Resettlement and compensation for land acquisAlon and other economic losses due to the
project are addressed in the Resettlement Action Plan.
22.         Plarning and implementation of environmental mitigation measures will be
undertaken by EMG in coordination with the XJPH and GEMC. Particularly, in the primary
design of the proposed project, environmental activities focused on the following items:
a.   inundation protection engineering
b.    reinforcement of the embankment
c.    reservoir bottom cleaning
d.    protection of historic sites
e.    construction of the e.nvironmental monitoring station
f.    rebuilding spawning grounds

2.3         Envionmennal Investment
23.         A total of 69-97 million RMB wil be provided for the EAP, iDcluding
protection engineering expenses of 58.01 million RM, reonustruction of specialized faciiies
totaling 7.6 million RMB, reservoir bottom cleaning expenses of 0.26 milion RMB,

3 .    ACTION 1: ENGINEERING MEASUES
3.1 Protection Prooram
3.1.1 Current Flood Control WorKs
24          According to data compiled by the Guangxi Conmmunications Design Institute,
there are currently 111 dikes and embankments from Xijin hydropower station to the GMPN
project site protecting more than 7000 ha of arable land. There are 79 embankments in
Guigang protecting an ^rea of 5267 ha, while in Hengxian there are 32 protecting an area
of 1867 ha. As these embankmnents were constructed between the 1950 and 1970, their flood
control effectiveness has been reduced by years of erosion.
25.         Most of the existing embankrnents are constructed from homogeneous soils to
different heights. They are generally higher upstream than downstream and in tnrbutaries.
The average elevation is 48 meters (MSL), with the highest being 58 meters and the lowest
10



being 42 meters. More than 76 embarzanents do not meet the minimum elevation
requirement for protection against a ten year flood stage. The embankmnents are generally
2 to 5 meters wide at the top, with slope gradients of 1: 1.5 to 1:2, ard are generally in good
structural condition. However, the embanlanents have no slope protection, they are poorly
maintained, the tops and slopes are not smooth and most of the outlets have been destroyed-
26.         Field surveys indicate that the bottom elevation of embankment outlets are
approximattely 41 meters (MSL), with the 1-ighest being 47.5 meters (y4ps1ream) and lowest
being 35.6 meters (downsteam). Seventy percent of the outlets have bottoms which are
below the dry season flow (540 m3/s) backwater level for that location.
27.         Most existing outlets are mortar and stone structurs, with square or circular
culvert cross sections. The culvert gradients range between one to three percent and the
outlet walls are approximately 0.5 to one meter thick depending on their flow capacity. The
adopted alternative for flood control embankments discussed above requires that 42 out of
46 embanklnents be rebuilt because their bottom outlet elevations are less than the new
design elevation.
28.         The existng gates are all flat and are constructed with steel, reinforced
concrete or wood. Most gates are currenty in disrepair due to many years of use and poor
water resistance. Moveover, the old gates will not be functional after the outlet elevations
have been raised, so it is recommended that they be rebuilt.
3.1.2 Engineering Measures
29           In the preminary design of the GPIN project, mitigation measures have been
considered in as much detail as possible in order to minimize losses and relocation caused
by inundation, such as reinforcement and reconstruction of the embanianents.
30.         There are 78 protection embankments that will be- affected by inundauon,
many of which will require rebuilding. Three alternatives of varying scopes have been
proposed for rebuild;ng the ernbanklments, and the third alternative was recommended.
31.         The protection engineering measures which have been adopted as part of the
project design include:
o     Stabilizing slope failure,
*     Raising and reinforcing the four existing embankments,
*     Rebuilding the forty-four drainage gates and culverts,
*     Building two new flood control embankments, and
o     Constructing forty-six flood drainage stations.
32.          According to calculations performed in the preliminary design stage of the
project, approximately 716 ha of land will be protected from inundation in 46 different areas
through the above-mentioned protective measures. Cultivated lands account for 576 ha of
the protected area and the remaming 140 ha includes residenial areas and economic
installations. The total area to be inundated after prevention measures are taken is 448 ha,
of which cultivated land accounts for 268 ha.
11



3.1.3       Design Stndards
a.    Design Standards for Flood Control and Drainage Works
33.         The "Zhujiang Basin Comprehensive Usage Planning Report" prescnrbes that
flood prevention criteria in the Yujiang river should meet 10-year rer period flood
protecton requirements. The flood control design for the Yujiang river is an on-going
project of the Guangi Water Resources Department, and will be implemented in upcoming
years.
34          The project design criteria prescribes an expansion in the discharge area and
an increase in the flow capacity of the river channel. During rainy season opeaons when
flow exceeds 7080 m3/s, all 18 reservoir sluice gates wil be fully opened to simulate namral
flood flow and water levels. The impoundment design dictates that during a 10-year return
period flood event (13400MN/s), the water level above the proposed dam wil only be 0.28
meters higher than pre-construction conditions, which is lower than the iundation critea
of 0.3 meters stipulated by the Ministry of Water Resources.
35.         The storm duranon specified for controlling flood peaks in the project area is
idenified as one day for small and three days for lre draiage basis. The desgn flood
drainage penod is equivalent to maxunum crop iundation endurance tiimes, which are two
days for dry crops and three to five days for rice. Tberefore, three days of drainage time
for the maximum 24-hour five year flood is regarded as the standard for all the protection
works, including those for mechanical and electrical equipment performance specifications.
36.         The design standard for embankment drainage outlets is that water within the
erbankments be drained and the water from the reservoir be prevented from flowing into
protected areas. The design stndard for drainage outlets will also meet five year flood
protection standards-
3.2         Prevention of Slope Failure
a.    Controlling Slope Failure
37.         The topographic and geological characteristics of reservoir banks require that
both engineering solutions and stabilization through afforestation be adopted to reduce slope
failures. As mentioned in the E1A report, the banks in the upper reaches of the proposed
reservoir from Zhanvu to Xijin require surface protection.
38.         Specific measures include:
39.         Protecting shallow  slopes by placing select rock on bank surfaces,
Implementation may be divided into two phases. During the first phase, mitigation measures
will be implemented at Jiamnan village, Jinwo, Watangyu and the threatened highway sections
during the construction. Upon project completion and reservoir operation, the second phase
will be inplemented. Areas to be protected will be identified during post construction
monitoring. Initial estimates indicate tat approximately 200,000 mn3 of 50# cement mortar
and select rock will be required.
12



40.            In areas where slope stability is required but rock placement is not necessary,
afforestation will be undertaken, requiring approximately 150,000 trees to construct forest
protection zones on the two reservoir banks.               -
b.      Investment
Initial estinates are that a total investment of 11-16 million Yuan will be
required, including the costs of indation prevention.
3.3    Embankment Reinforcement
a.     Embankment Reinforcement
41.             In the protection program, the preferred plan is embankment reinforcement,
which includes raising elevations of the four embankrnents at Zhudoutang, Mahuangdong,
Liaowo and D.nwo. Engineering requirements for reinforcing the ernbankments are shown
in Table 3.3 1.
(1)    elevation of the dike top: the design elevation for inundation pulsing
is 1.4 meters.
(2)    width of the dike top: 8 meters for dikes req!red for tansportation and
3-4 meters for others.
(3)    Slope gradients: 1:2 to 1:2.5 for earth embankments

3.4   Two Newly-Constructed Flood Contwl Embankments and Drainaet Facilities
42.         The project includes construction of new flood control embankments and
drainaage facilities at Shakoudong and Shuangchong in Xinjiang and Watang villages in .el
Watang township. Engineering costs of approximately 1 17 million RMB were estimted in
the preliminary design report of the project. Approxizately 7.8 ha of farmland will be
protected from inundation as a result of this construction.
3.5   Reconstruction of Draina-e Gates and Culverts
a.    Raising outlet bottom elevations and gate reconstruction
43.         Assuming that the normal operaing water level in the reservoir is 43.1 meters
(MSL), the backwater level under the average flow of 540 mIs during seasons is identified
as the design elevation of the bottom of the drainage gates and culverts. Outlets with bottom
elevations below this defined level should be raised.
44.         Three rebuilding options were considered, and the adopted rebuilding option
is the second as below:
45.         Blocking existing culverts and building new ones with gates above the old
ones. The new outlet should correspondingly be raised and widened. This option requires
substantial engineering work since the embankment should be excavated at die location of the
new culvert, but construction is relatively simple.
46.         Other specific options will be considered at a later time for larger culverts such
as Linqiao Gate.
47.         All the rebuilt gates should be constructed with reinforced concrete to ensure
security, durabilitv., convenience and incorporate simple structure and fabrication
requirements.
The engineering requirements of rebuilding the gates and culverts were
estimated in the preliminary design report of the GMPN project. All reconstruction activities
will be completed before the filling of the reservoir, and a detailed implementation schedule
will be considered at a later time.
b.    Investments
48.          The total investment for outlets and gates reconstruction is approximately 2.48
million Yuan, not including the cost for reconstruction of Linxiao gate.
3.6   Flood Drainatze Stations
49.          The purpose of constructing flood drainage pumping stations for all
ernbarAnents is to minimize the inundation of arable land and to increase grain yields within
the protected zones. These zones mclude the most productive gramn and sugarcane fields in
the reservoir area, and are densely populated.
14



50.         The design capacity of drainage facilities is based on three day drainage
following a 24 hour duration five year storm, with pumps working 22 hours a day.
51.         The adopted embankment reimforcement option includes construction of
drainage facilities within all 46 embankmnents to be modified. The facilities will have a total
instaled capacity of 15776 kw and will protect 3010 ha of arable land, including 403 ha of
fields and fish ponds below the bottom elevation of the drainage gates, and another 603 ha
below the land reiisition line.
a.    Pumping station scheme
52.         Both horizontal cenrifugal pump and axial flow pump house schemes were
selected. The pum  houses will be built by the Yujiang nver banks. One floor building of
mixed construion was selected for horizontal centrifugal pump houses.  Two floor
construction buildings were selected for axial flow pump houses in which the base floor of
reinforced concrete is an open suction bay, and the second floor of brick masomy is designed
for installig pumps and electncal equipment.
b.    Pumping system
53.         Both horizontal centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps were selected.
54.         Horizontal centrifugal pump: Vacuum air pumps will be selected where the
design diameter of suction tubes is over 200mm, and discharge pumps will be installed where
the desigred diameter of the suction tube is smaller than 200mm.
55.         Axial flow pump: Axial flow pumps with single-high outlets will be selected.
56          Steel pipes will be used for the suction tube and the outlet tube inside of the
pump house. Steel pipes will also be used for the outlet tube when the designed diameter
is larger than 400mm, while concrete tubes will be used for the outlet tube when the designed
diameter is small than 400mm.
c.    Electricity supply
57.         The power supply for the drainage stations will be provided by the Hengxian
and Guigang grid. A specific transformer substation which is connected with the 35KV
transformer station by a 35 KV or 10.5 KV power line will be built for each drainage station.
d.   Investment
58.         Initial estimated investments for flood drainage facilities are listed below:
(1)   The cost of construction buildings is 20.77 million Yuan.
(2)   The cost of mechanical equipment and electrical facilities is 15.05
million Yuan, which includes 4.84 million R.MB for power lines.
15



(3)   The annual cost for operation of the facilities is 1.17 million Yuan.
59-          Embankment and drainage station locations are listed in Figure 5.5. 1.
3.7         Infrastructure
60.         Infrastructure requrig reconstrucuon includes power tranission lines,
telecommunication lines and tansportation facilities such as docks, water conservation and
hydropower stations. Additional roads, ferries. docks and barges will be built to improve
the standard of living of local residents.
a.    Power Transmission Lines
i.    10 kv Transmission Lines
61.         A total of 4.32 kn of transmission lines in the reservoir area will be affected
by inundation, with 3.47 km to be protected and 0.85 km to be relocated to higher ground.
Wherever possible, transmission poles will be reinforced rather than being moved, entailing
a total investment of about 15 thousand yuan (178,000 Yuanfpole.lan). Investment figures
were compiled according to 'Cost Calculation Standards for Water Conservation and
Hydropower Projects" issued by the Ministries of Energy and Water Conservation in 1989.
62.         Power transmission lines undertaken during the course of the project are not
expected to have significant environmental impacts since they are located at a distance from
residential areas and pass through cultivated fields. Power transmission lines from the
generating station will not traverse any sensitive areas, and there are no human settlements
within 200 rneters of the power lines.
ii.    Communication Lines
63.         A total of 0.3 km of communication lines will be iniundated in the reservoir
area, of which 0.25 km lies within the protected areas and 0.05 km will require
reinforcement. This will entail an investment of 900 yuan at a unit compensation of 17,800
yianfkm.
b.    Hydro-Power Facilities
i     Mini Hydr-power Stations
64.          There are three mini-hydropower stations with total insalled capacity of I 11
kw which will be impacted by inundation. Two are in Guigang city, with 99 kw of installed
capacity, and one is in Hengxian with 12 kw. Compensation of 7446-9288 yuan per kw will
be provided for their reconstruction. Total compensation is estiated at 848.6 thousand
yuan.

ii.    Electric Pumping-Stations
65.         There are 13 elecic pumping stations affected by inundation in the reservoir
area, with 808 kw of total installed capacity. Three of these are within protected areas, with
145.5 kw of installed capacity. Another 10 stations with total installed capacity of 662.5 kw
are to be rebuilt. Total compensation amounts to 1.12 million yuan, or 1,279-1,855
yuan/kw-
iii.   Turbine Pumping Stations
66.         There are 42 turbine pumps at 22 sttions in the affected area. Four stations
lie within the protected area and another 18 will have to be rebuilt. Unit compensation is
41.4-174.6 thousand yuan with total compensation of 3.95 million yuan.
c.    Transportation Infrastructe
67.         Transportation infrastructure in the project area includes 1.5 km of Class IV
roads, 7.12 km of dirt roads, 4.59 km of dirt tracks and 16 bridges (136.2 m). An estimated
investment of 8.8 million yuan is required to preserve or upgrade these facilities.
i.    Dirt Roads and Dirt Tracks
68.         Dirt roads: upgrading 0Q3 kn of Dingang-Gelai section and 13 km of the
newly constructed Xinping-Xincheng-Waang road in Guigang city; upgrading 12 kcm of the
Behe-Yangxi-Heang-Tonglai section in Hengxian county. The compensation is estimated at
180.3 thousand yuan per kcm, equivalent to a total of 4.56 million yuan.
69.         Dirt tracks: upgrading a total of 3.76 km in Guigang city and 1.45 km in
Hengxian county. The surface elevation will be raised at a unit cost of 7,420 yuan/kmn,
equivalent to a total of 38.8 thousand yuan.
70.         Road con-truction during the course of the project is not expected to have
significant environmental impacts since roads are located at a distance from residential areas
and pass through cultivated fields. Project service roads are all temporary (unless located
within existing aligmnents), and will be restored to agricultural land after construction is
completed as in the case of the quarry area access road. Unpaved road surfaces will be
sprayed regularly for dust control.
ii.    Bridges
71.         There will be 23 bridges of various types with a total of 427.9 meters to be
newly constructed or rebuilt, including four highway bridges (30 meters) and 19 pedestrian
bridges ( meters) to be rebuilt and five bridges (100 meters) to be newly constructed in
Guigang city. Five bridges (100.9 meters) will be rebuilt and three bridges (60 meters) will
be newly constructed in Hengxian. The unit compensation is 4,252 yuan/m for rebuilding
highway bridges, 1,484 yuan/m for rebuilding pedestrian bridges and 4,252 yuanmrn for
newly-constructed bridges. The total compensation for bridge construction is estimated at
1.2 million yuan.
17



iii.   Docks and Ferryboats
72.         According to the residential layout in the reservoir area, seven freight docks
(four in Guigang city and three in Hengxian county), 78 feey and houseboat docks (47 in
Guigang city and 31 in Hengxian county) and 27 ferryboats (13 in Guigang city and 14 in
Hengxian county) will be constructed. The unit compensation is 296.8 thousand yuan for
each freight dock, 8904 yuan for ferry and houseboat docks and 8904 yuan for each
ferryboat. The total compersation amounts to 3 million yuan.
4.    ACTION 2: CLEARING OF ThIE RESERVOIR BOTTOM
a.    Bottom clearing
73.         To protect reservoir water quality after construction, the reservoir bottom
should be cleared before water storage begins. The clearance process includes removal of
vegetaion, construction debris and other wastes from below the design water line.
74.         When the reservoir water level is low, stagnant pools will form in low-lying
lands on the river banks, providing a potential breeding ground for flies and mosquitoes.
When water levels are high, polluted water from these pools will mix with the river water,
causing contamination of the reservoir. To prevent this from occurrng, drainage canals
should be constructed in the low-lying areas along the river banks to drain the pools before
stagnation occurs. All the clearance activities will be completed six months prior to filling
the reservoir.
b.    Investment
75.         Initial estimated cost of reservoir bottom clearing is 0.27 million Yuan.
S.    ACTION 3: HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES
76.         Surveys carried out during the feasibility study identified cultural and historic
sites in the reservoir area, as detailed in the EIA report, section 3.8.3. It is advisable to
carry out another survey early in the construction process so as to obtain as much
information as possible about the kinds and quantities of relics in the project vicinity. If
additional relics are unearthed at any point in the constmction process, work should
immediately be suspended until a proper inventory can be made by relevant authorities.
77.          Due to financial limitations, the Shangjiangkou and Jiaoyiechong relics are
scheduled to be unearthed in conjunction with the construction process, an operation which
will have special supervision in order to avoid damaging the relics. There are plans to
unearth 2000 in2 of Shangjiangkou relics and 3500 m2 of the Jiaolinchong relics. Site
specific surveys and excavation will be performed prior to flooding of the area.
78.         As they are likely to be inundated by rising water levels, the Neolithic age
relics located near the dam area will be unearthed. A detailed final survey will be performed
before excavation.
18



79.         The total cost for surveying and excavating histoncal relics in the reservoir
area is 1,147,320 RMB. This includes:
1) 150,00 RMB for site investig2tion,
2) 997,320 RMB for excavation of the Neolithic age
relics;
3) 362,280 RMB for excavating the Shangjiangkou relics;
4) 635,040 RMB for excavating the Jiaoyiechong relics.
80.         Costs have been calculated on the basis of regulations from document No.248
of the National Bureau for Historical Relics.
6.  ACTION 4: WATER QUALITY PROTECTION
6.1         Protection of water durin2 construction
81.         The construction of the coffer dam and blating of the chnnel shoals at three
locations along the reservoir area may temporarily increase water turbidity within the river.
The shoal blastmg will be undertaken during low flow periods when rock outcrops are
exposed thus minimal urbidity is antcipated.  The cofferdam construction began in
November 1994 and site inspection indicated that the construction method does not result in
significant turbidity. It is proposed that the water quality will be monitored on a daily basis
at key locations downstream of the dam construction site and a two-day basis during shoal
blasting. Details of the monitoring program are presented in the Environmental Moniitoring
Plan (EMP) section.
82.         Should turbidity result in significant impacts at the first Guigang city water
inlet downstream of the construction site (Nanjiang), the water company proposes to curtail
water diversion for short periods and increase uptake from inlets further downstream. This
in effect will minimize the impact of turbidity on the city water supply.
83.         Based on the analysis provided in the EIA report section 4.5.1.3, the impact
of waste water from the construction site and workers living quarters on the Guigang city
downstream water supplies is small. However, in order to avoid impacts on downsteam
fisheries and inhabitants on both river banks, the construction waste water will be treated
before being discharged into the Yujiang river. Sewage sludge from t^he construction camps
will be collected and used as organic fertilizer. An investment of 0.20 million RMB wi}l be
provided for waste water treatment (septic) facilities at the consuction camp
84.         Temporary river flow stoppage during construction will increase the silt load
in the river with the greatest impacts occuring at the Nanjiang water intake area 600 meters
downstream of the construction site. Residents and enterprises will be notified beforehand
to store water for 2 days and temporarily cease intakes of water.

85.         Since the Guigang domestic water supplies diverted from the Nanjiang inlet
downstream of the proposed project site are currently polluted by industrial discharges into
the Liyujiang river, and the simation could deteriorate following completion of the GMPN
project and from increased industral development, a feasibility study in Guigang has
recommended that the following measures be adopted:
(1)   Guigang city has decided that its waterworks inlet will be relocated upstream
of the dam in order to substantially improve current municipal water quality.
Preliminary plans have been formulated to construct a new large-scale
waterworks 100 meters upstream  of the dan.  The Communications
Department is coordinating with the city government on this issue and it is
anticipated that the new inlet structure will be completed at the same time as
the dam completion to immediately facilitate diversion. The relocation of the
inlet is primarily aimed at avoiding industrial discharges from city industries
in response to State strategies for improving municipal water quality
standards. The dam construction therefore provides an opportunity to divert
higher quality water.
b.   Indusrial Wastewater Control
86          Inh order to ensure that water quality standards are met, comprehensive control
of discharges from existing contamination sorrces will be implemented by the local Guigang
Environmental Protection Bureau (GEPB). Currently, greater attention is being paid to Ehe
control of contaminants from sugar and paper manufacmturng, as well as to waste water
collection and treatment both upstream and downstream of the reservoir area.
87.         Waste water discharges from Hlengxian Sugar Factory have created a serious
pollution zone along the river banks, especially in the dry season. Currently water quality
is good in the proposed reservoir. There will be some impact on water quality caused by
project construction, and a pollution control plan along the river banks will be carried out
by Hengxian EPB and GEPB as follows:
(1).  The GEPB is currently implementing a program  of restricting effluent
discharges from city industries in order to improve the water quality of the
Liyujiang river. Concurrently, the pollution load in the conservation area
upstream will be reduced by controlling industrial discharges and possibly
constructing a canal which would divert part of the surplis uncontrolled flow
of the proposed impoundment through the Liyujiang river to improve its water
quality.  Detailed monitoring studies have be performed to identify tne
carrying capacity of the Yujiang river to accept the Liyujiang river flows and
its potential impact on the Yujiang river. Although the river carrying capacity
data has not been made public, GEPB is formulating programs for controlling
effluent discharges in order to preserve the river water quality at Class m in
the short term and improve it to Class [ in the long term.
20



(2)   Limitations will be imposed on the operation of the power station during the
dry season in order to reduce contaminn loading downstream. Detailed
itemls will be considered following construction.
88.         The GMPN project will create a free-flowing reservoir, whose h,draulic
retention time is very short. Therefore, no temperatre gradations will occar at different
water depths, eutrophication is not anticipated and sedimentation will not vary sigmficantly
from present conditions.
c.    Control of Water Pollution from Navigation Activities
89.         In order to control the discharge of waste oil from barges, the Departments
of Navigation Administration, Navigation Monitoring, and Shing Management of the
Guangxi Communications Department as well as the EPB have undertaken a comprehensive
coordination program with regard to oil discharge control and enforement and air pollution
control in all provincial waterways. The program stipulates annual inspection and licensing
of vessels with regard to oil collection and noise protection facilities. At the same time,
measures have been taken to increase environmental awareness among navigation department
and barge tansportation personnel. Guidelines for the control of waste oil discharges from
ships are stipulated in the "National Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law", the
national -Shipping Contminant Discharge Srandard' (GB3552-83), and the 5th Decree of
the Ministry of Transportation on 'Shipping Sluice Management. -
90.         To control barge waste oil discharges, al motorized ships should be equipped
with oil-water separators to ensure that oil content in the discharged bilge water does not
exceed 15 mgI. Where installation of such devices is not feasible, then a waste oil container
should be kept on hand.  The navigation administration and navigation monitoring
departnents have equipped special ships to collect waste oil at regular intervals.
91.         In the inland river area, an oil transport registration system has been
implemented for 150 ton oil tankers and for common ships exceeding 400 tons. At present,
however, waterway facilities in the project region do not have the capacity to dispose of
waste oil and other shipping wastes. In order to remedy these deficiencies, investments are
proposed for waste disposal equipment within the project area.
92.         The potential for accidental spills will rise as a result of the significant increase
in river traffic.  Spill prevention strategy centers on enforcing shipping and lock
management. To prevent accidental spills of materials, a safety check will be enforced on
all river vessels by navigation administration agencies at downstream and upstream handling
terminals and shipping sluice gates. A special check will be performed for vessels which are
carrying ecologically sensitive materials such as oil and coal. An accident mitigation plan
has been formulated and put into effect by provincial agencies for the protection of water
ways.

7.    ACTION 5: NOISE, AIR QUALITY AND OTHERS
7.1         Noise and Air Oualitv
93.         Noise and air quaity degradation impacts during the construction phase may
be significant along the quarry haul road, the dam construction area and the shoat blasting
areas.  However other than haul trucks, large equpmen shall not be used duing
construction. A comprehenive noise and air quality monitoring program has been propose -
in the EMP section to evaluate impacts in sensitive areas. It is proposed that all haul roads
will be paved to reduce dust.  Cosruction ric will be resticted to 6 am - 8 pm and
taffic control measures will be instituted to reduce congestion and noise. Should noise levels
reach regulatory limits, tmck traffic volumes will be reduced to acceptable limits.
94.         Blastng at the shoals and dam site will be in strict accordance with national
safety regulations. Blastng will only occur at noon and at 6 pm as stipated in the naeonal
regulations. Wind diection, noise and dust monitormg will be instituted pnor to blasting.
7.2           ntion Prtection
95.         The areas affected by inundation are concentrated in the mddle and
downstream sections of the reservoir area such as Xiangjiang, Watang and between LAi3cun
village and the project site. The affected area includes approximately 100 ha, as well as
Xiangjiang and Watang, most of which lies within Ilood protection dikes.
96.         Measures to address inundation proposed by the project proponents include
pumping water out of submerged areas to decrease waterlogging, digging drainage canals,
and convertig dry lands to paddy fields. To combat increased moisture ievels inside
residences adjacen to the reservoir, drainage ditches will be constructed around the
foundations of buildings, and floor levels will be raised.
7.3         Prevention of Soil Loss During Construction
97.         The GPN project includes construction of a low head concrete gravity dam.
It will consume 1,110 acres of land, including 714 acres for temporary facilities.
Approximately 3.7 million m3 of eartn and 0.94 m of rock will be excavated for the project,
while 1.28 million ni3 of earth and rock will be used as select fill and 0.5 million mn3 of
concrete will be used for construction  - :he dam, lock an other facilities. Constuction will
last apjroximately 5 years, during m: - v    time protective measures will be taken in order to
prevent soil erosion from the project ave. Tne following steps will be taken:
a.    Priority will be given to using construction matrials which are
available at the project site.
b.    During the construction, measures will be adopted to miniiz soil
loss such as not removing suiface vegetation until the site is needed,
minimizing traffic, and treating surfaces to prevent erosion. In non-
construction areas, vegetation cover will be protected and additional
cover such as wees will be planted.
22



-/7.4       Construction of Spawning Grounds
98.         To mitigate losses of economically valuable fish stock, hatchery efforts will
be focused on commercial species- An altemative is to thoroughly utilize all available
remaining water bodies including river bends. Employment opportunities from the above
mentioned mitigation measures will contribute to the economic development of migrants.
99.         In the initial environmental impact assessment for the project, the Guangxi
Electric Industry Design Institte (GEIDI) together with the Aquaculture Depatment of
Guangxi Agricultural University, selected the middle reaches of the reservcir near the ur outh
of the Yunbiao tributary (near Yunbiao village in Hengxian county) as the sie of thi planned
fish spawning ground. The reasons for selecting this site are as follows: (1) it is located
directly upstream of Fubo Shoal, die largest and most important fis-t spaurg grond in the
rtservoir, and is therefore convenient for introducing fish fry; (2) water quality is good and
plentiful water supplies are ensred year-rouDd by the Yunbiao reservoir upstream; (3) the
site has a lirge amount of low-lying wasteland which can be reclaimed to build fish ponds
at minimal cost; (4) there is a spawning ground downstream of the Guigang reservoir area
at Maiu Shoal, but no spawning groands presently exist upstream of the C-uigang reservoir
in the Xilu reservoir area. Situating the spawnig ground in the middle reaches of the
Guigang reservoir will be beneficial for the economic developmnent of the area.
100.        According to the Fisheries Department of the regional Aquatic Products
Bureau, this Hengxian locaton is suitable from the standvoint of fish habitat, water supply
amd water quality. Another pi>ssible location is Jiangkou village in the Genzhn township area
of Guigang municipality. Since the site already has approximately 40 mu of fish ponds, little
additional investnent would be required. The Fisheries Deparment felt that siting the
spawning ground in Guigang might be preferab.e to Hengxian because of its beLter technical
and management capaoilities.
101.        As both spawning sround locatioms are feasible, a final decision between them
will be made at a later time. An "ivestment of 1.0 million RiME w.vill be provided for the
spawning facilities.
7.5          Public Health
102.        In order to avoid the incicence ef epidemics during the construction proc:ess.
a disease prevention unit will be set t.2 to oversee sanitay conditions and to detect the sprad
of epidemic diseases at the constIuctior) site, as well as to educate the workers in hygiene.
Strict hygiepac fequirements will be placed on the living quarters of workers in tbe
constnuctior. area, paxcuiarly the controlled disposal of solid waste (i.e. landfihing) and
domesdic sewage. Sewa,.e will be disposed of in septic tanks with drainage areas away from
the reservoir.
103.        A iaves=rr1ant of 0.2 million RMB will be provided for sanitation and domestic
sewage treatnent.
23



7b6             life
104.        A major impact to wildlife resulting fiom this project will be the disruption
of tortoise and soft-shelled urtle habitat The current existence of reservoirs in the lower and
upper sections of the river combined with the proposed new impoundment wil create a
closed river system which may be unfavorable to the tortoise and soft-shelled trle. Due
to their m rtae in the region, the following meares will be considered to assure their
survival.
105.        A mptaion alternative for potental wipacts to tortoise and soft-shell tute
habitat is to allow surrounding fields which will be imndated to revert to wetlands. Captured
tortoise and soft-shell urle species cold then be relocated to these shallow wetland areas
as well as to tnbutaries which will be eniarged aftr submergence. Furthermore, these
wetland areas wOuld provide valuabie habitat for wading and aquatic birds displaced by
submergence in the immediate project viity. Secondly, a system of spawning platsM may
be set up to provide tortoise and soft-shelled artle to the local populanon in order to
decrease pressure on the wild populations once they are relocated. The scheule for project
coDStcton will be caref.lly planned in order to accmmodate the tortoise and turtle
breeding season and thus assure a population size that will be amenable to relocation_
106.        Prior to construction initiation, furter surveys to locate endangered animal
species in the project area will undertaken as part of project ecological monitoring. In
particular, care will be taken to ensure that no Chna-autumn ducks, pangolin, masked civet,
silrer-ring snake, or white crane are nesting at or near the site. If any of these species
should be located, special mitigation and relocation plans have been formulated. However,
none of these species has been observed in the project area. Creation of new wetland areas
surrounding the site will reduce the impact to the wading and aquatic bird species and
possibly making relocation unnecmary. In the case of the silver-ring snake, relocation will
be the only option if the species is observed.
7.7         Wetlands and Swamps
107.        The project ZOI is a major agriculturai zone of Guangxi province. Substantial
wetland reclamation and cultivation has occurred in this area and currently no undisturbed
wetlands have been identified within the proposed project area.
108.        Constrction of the proposed project will result in iundation of the
surrounding agricultural fieids. Some areas may become so highly saturated that crops can
no longer be grown on them. Due to the fact that water levels will rise in the mrservoir and
disrupt much of the shallow water habitat it may be desirable to let the newly saturated areas
revert to wetlands. Thzs reversion would provide habitat for displaced wading birds, ducks,
and reptiles that rely on shallow water bodies for cover and food.

SECTION II
ENVIRONMENTAL MONIrORING PLAN
1     INTRODUCTION,
1.1   Background
109.        This project Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) has been formulated in
consultation with the Guangxi Communications Department (GCD), and the Guigang and
Hengxian Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs)- The Environmental Action Plan (EAP)
and EMP were also reviewed by the Guangxi Enviromnental Protection Bureau (GEPB) and
approved in December 1994.
110.        As detailed in the EHA report, the overall project impacts are minimized due
to relatively good planning and implementation strategies on the part of the project
proponents. An overall monitorng strategy, however, is required (i) to ensure early
detection of conditions that necessitate particular protection measures, and (ii) to provide
information on the progress and results of protection measures.
111.        A detailed monitoring pla was formulated in consultation with provincial and
local environmental regulatory agencies in Guangxi and the World Bank. The plan was
approved by the GCD in December 1994 and commitments were obtained for its
implementation. The monitoring plan is presented in table form at the end of Section H.
1.2   Pre-Construction Monitoring in the Proiect Area
1.2.1 Regulatory Monitoring Requirements
a.    Hydrology and Meteorology
112.        There are hydrological and meteorological stations operating at Xijin reservoir
and the Guigang section of the Yujiang niver.
b.    Water Quality
113.        Figure 1.2-1 presents the distribution of pollution sources and monitoring
stations in the project area and Figure 1.2.2 presents location of monitoring tansects, water
inlets and discharge points within Guigang city. Where possible existing river tansecs have
been selected for project water quality monitoring, however additional transects were also
selected to ensure comprehensive data collection as presented in Figure 1.2.1. In order to
assure data consistency, all transects selected for construction phase monitoring shall also be
used for operation phase monitoring.

114         Three existing monitoring locations were selected at Lucun, Tieqiao bridge and
on the Liyujiang river, additionally a transect was selected approximately 500 meters
downstream of the construction zone. River water has been sampled thrice annually at the
permanent trnsects since 1981 at Lucun, Tieqiao bridge and the Liyujiang river, the latest
monitoring event occurred in October 1994. The monitored parameters are: pH value, color
degree, total hardness, SS,DO, COD, BOD5, total P. N113-N,N02-N, N03-N, phenol, Hg,
CN-, , Cd, Pb, Cu, Cl-, coliform bacteria, total bacteria and water teruperature. List I
attached to the monitoring plan at the end of Section II includes all parameters monitored
three times per year by GEMC and Hengxian EMC (HEMC).
1.2.2       Mqcn ;oring Undertakern for the Proposed Project EIA
d.    Projt. Monitoring Network and Parameters
115.        One mn-itoring location was selected at the Hengxian transect and two others
at the Lucbur. a,d Tieqiao transects of the Yujiang river to monitor water quality upstream
of tue project site. Both transects are regularly monitored by HEMC and GEMC. The
monitored parameters are FEnilar to those presented in List 1.
116.        One monitoring location was seLcted downsuream of the Hengxian Sugar
Factory waste water discharge area to monitor the cross-sectional distnrbution of pollutants.
117.        Additional monitoring locations were selected downstream of the proposed
project site as presented in the monitoring plan and Figure 1.2.1 to monitor the lock area and
downstream water quality during both construction and operation phases. Justifications for
location and parameter selection are presented in the monitoring plan.
b.    Ecological Surveys
118.        Fish: Surveys have been completed in the Yujiang river from Xijin dam to the
proposed dam site and tributaries such as the Wusijiang, Wajiang, Dabujiang, Yunbiaohe.
It is proposed that fish toxic substance accumulation analyses will be undertaken semi-
annually downstream of the project site to evaluate accumulation of metals.
119.        Zooplankton and phytoplankton: Three monitoring locations were selected at
Hengzhou, the proposed dam site and at the Wusijiang, 3 km from its confluence with the
Yujiang. Data included zooplankton, phytoplankton, benthon and aquatic'plants.
120.        Surveys of ecological habitats will be performed on an annual basis to ensure
that there will be no impacts on wild or endangered aninmals in the project area. As
mentioned above, the project area is relatively developed and as such endangered animals
have not been observed in the reservoir area.
121.        The rnonitoring contract with GEMC mentioned in the EAP will include all
water quality, noise, air quality and ecological mnonitoring required by the project.
36



c.    Bank Collapse and Inundation
122.        Bank collapse: Six geologic survey sections were established for the bank-
collapse survey. These surveys will be undertaken by the waterway management unit
(XjP,).
123.        Imindation: Three geologic survey sections were established for the study of
inundation. Pumping tests have been done to estimate aquiclude thickness, infiltration
coefficients and soil properties.
2.    PURPOSE OF THE MONITORING
124-        Following evaluation of environmental impacts during and after reservoir
construction, together with normal environmental monitoring requirements; monitoring
parameters, network distribution and frequency were determined. Short-term and long-temi
environmental monitoring shall be performed to determine changes in the ecological
environment, water quality, bank failure and inundation, so that appropriate protection
measures can be applied to alleviate potential environmental impacts.
3.    SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND MONITORIiG
3.1   Enviromnental Monitoring During Construction
a.    Water quality monitoring:
125.        Details of monitoring locations, frequency and parameters are presented in the
monitoring plan at nie end of Section II and in Figure 1.2.1 - Monitoring will be undertaken
at downstream. locations for all blasting and construction sites 30 days prior to initiation of
activities to evaluate background water quality. Upstream data will also be collected at the
dam site prior to constiuction initiation to evaluate the quality of water flowing into the
construction site.
126.         During construction, sampling will be performed in accordance with the
monitoring plan at all activity locations. Daily SS and DO monitoring will be performed
downstream  of all activity locations to evaluate immediate water quality impacts.
Comprehensive monthly and seasonal sampling will be undertaken and samples will be
analyzed for the parameters in Lists I and 2 accordingly.
b.    Atmospheric monitoring:
127.        Air quality monitoring will be undertaken in the construction, quarry and
blasting areas as well as consmtction roads. Monitoring will be undertaken by GEMC
personmel at various sensitive locations which will be determined by the project
Environmental Management Group (EMG) during the construction activities. Dust sampling
will be performed at both the dam site and the quarry site by placing dust receptacles around
construction sites and analyzing dust colected. Air sampling will also be performed in the
workers living area.
37



c.    Ecological monitoring:
128.        Three ecological sample collection sites have been selected as presented in
Figure 1.2.1 to monitor changes in the local hydro-ecology during construction.
Accumulation of toxic substances in fish will be monitored semi-annually downstream of the
construction site and surveys of wild animals will also be undertaken at the same time.
d.    Noise monitoring:
129.        Noise monitoring will be undertak-en at the construction site, blasting locations,
construction roadways and quarry area. Environmental management personnel and GEMC
staff will be supplied with noise monitoring equipment to monitor sensitive areas during
project activities on a daily basis.
e.    Meteorological observation:
130. A meteorological observation station will be established near the dam site to record
climatic conditions.
3.2   Envirornental Monitoring Duinn Operation Phase
a.    Water quality monitoring:
131.        The permanent construction phase monitoring tansects presented in Figure
1.2.1 will continue to be used during the project operation phase. The locations, frequency
and parameters monitored are presented in Figure 1.2.1 and the monitoring plan at the end
of Section n.  The operation phase monitoring shall be undertaken by GEMC which
currently performs water quality monitoring at several transects within Guigang city three
times per year.
c.    Ecological monitoring:
132.        The three ecological sample collection points will be retained to monitor
changes in rie local hydro-ecology after construction. Monitoring of toxic substances in fish
r'illl also continue semi-annuaHly at the same location downstream of the darn site. Semi-
a.nual surveys of wild animal habitats will continue as part of the routine environmental
survey of the reservoir site by GEMC.
d.    Benthic deposition monitoring:
133.        Benthic material sample collection will continue on an annual basis to monitor
post-constructionr impacts.
e.    Bank collapse observation:
134.        Observation points will be established in sections previously affected by bank
collapse in order to adopt corresponding protection measures. The' monitoring sites are
38



chiefly located in areas where bank failure may occur and have not been reinforced during
construction.
f.    Inundation observation:
135.        Several observation points will be established in areas susceptible. to inundation
(including agricultural iand and residential areas) in order to adopt corresponding protection
measures. The observation sites are chiefly located in potentially inundated areas as
anticipated in the EIA report. Other observation sites wiU be set up where -mcessary in order
to evaluate the un-anticipated impacts of inundation.
