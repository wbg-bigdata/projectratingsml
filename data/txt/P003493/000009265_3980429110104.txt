SECTION I
SU 3MARY E.NVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
L.  INTRODUCTION
1           The original Chinese EIA for the Guigang Multi-Puo  iNavigation Project
(GMPN) was prepared by the Guangxi Electric Industry Design Institute (GEID) between
1990 and 1991 as part of the Feasibility and Preliminary Design Report. The EIA was
reviewed and conditionally approved by the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA) in December 1991  A supplemental report was produced in early 1992 to satisfy
addiional NEPA requirements and satisfy all Chinese EIA criteria
2.          The Guangxi Comx.urnications Department (GCD) engaged the services of
Environomics in mid-1993 to assist in the preparation of the project English language EIA
report for submission to the World Bank. The Environomics scope of work included review
of the Chinese ELA documnents, compilation and re-asssment of available background data
and information, and drafting of the English EIA report. Due to time and resource
constraints, te English EIA is based only on data collected during the original EIA and
Feasibility Study and is supplemented with additional data provided by GPC. Environomics
has attempted to validate available information with the original field data when feasible, and
has sought clarification and amplification of material from GEIDI to meet as closely as
possible Bank EIA requirements.
3.         In addition to the main ELA report, Environomics has prepared a combined
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) under the
direction of GCD. The latter two documents provide a rational program and schedule for
mitigating and monitoring potential project environmental impacts within the technical and
resource constraints of the project proponents.
4.          A socio-econtomic impact study was completed by the Guangxi Electric
Industry Design Institute and included in the original feasibility study for the project. It
contains detailed information and statistics on socio-econiomic impacts of the projects. Based
on this report a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was developed, modified and fimalized in
December 1994.
5.          This Summuary Environmental and Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SESIA)
repor. is divided into two sections and provides a synopsis of the findings and proposed
monitoring and mitigation actions related to Section I: Environmental and Section 11: Socio-
Economic impacts of the GMPN project implementation.
1.1   Regulatory Framework
6.         In August 1987, Guangixi Autonomous Region Construction Committee
submitted Document No. 85 to the Ministry of Communications proposing the GMPN
project. The Ministry approved the location for the project and authorized the expedited
completion of the preliminary project design. In January 1990, Guangxi Communications



Department Document No. 008 assigned the responsibility for performing the EIA to GEIDI
which completed the report in 1991.
7.          Originally the GMPN project was proposed as part of a domestically funded
multi-component infrastructure coistruction project and had received approval for
implementation. The ELA for the entire project was prepared in 1990 and approved by
NEPA in 1991. However, due to funding constraints, only the bridge component which is
p?rt of the Guigang urban ifrastructure program and is substntially financed by the city was
tiated and is now nearig completion. 1 he remaning components which are included in
the inkind water way program were re-packaged and submitted to the State Plnning
Commission (SPC) and approved for intemational fmancirg.
1.2   EIA Report Preparaton
8.          The Chinese EIA was prepared with reference to the following regulations and
stands:
a.    Environmental Protection of Law of P.R.C.
b.    Water Pollution Prevention Law of P.R.C.
c.    Fishing Law of P.R.C.
d.    Water Law of P.R.C.
e.    Surface Water Environmental Quality Stndard.
f.    Air-Environmental Quality Standard.
g     Urban Envirommental Noise Standard.
h.    EIA Standard of Hydropower from Ministry of Electncity and Hydrology.
9-          The English language EIA report was prepared based on the onginal Chinese
EIA data to meet as closely as possible the reporting format of the World Bank. In the
period between 1991 and 1994 substantial changes occurred in environmental requirements
witiun China and the World Bank, the English language EIA and supporting documents have
auempted where possible to upgrade the assessment to address the new requirements.
2.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1   Objectives
10.         The prmiary objective of the proposed GMPN project is to improve the
navigability of the Yujiang river between the Xijin dam and Guigang city. The project wili
ensure a minimum navigable water depth during dry seasons, thus guaranteeing an
uninterrupted flow of shipping and the reclassification of the niver to a 3rd Class waterway
accessible to 100 ton barges. Tie upgrading will make the Yujiaag river the backbone of
the Xijiang river system tansportation strategy and thus facilitate economic development in
Guangxi and the adjacent provinces.
1 i .       The main physical components of the project mclude (i) construction of a dam,
ship lock, and hydropower station at Guigang, and (ii) small-scale removal of rock shoals
at three locations by blasting. Originally the GMPN project was proposed as part of a
domesuically funded multi-component infrastucture constcion project and had received
2



approval for implementationi. An EIA for the entire project was prepared in 1990 and
approved by the Natioral Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) in 1991. However, due
to funding constaints, only the bridge component which is part of the Guigang urban
inasrure program and is substantially financed by the city was iaitiated and is now
nearng completion. The remaining components which are included in the inland water way
program were re-packaged and submitted to the State Planning Commission (SPC) and
approved for international financing.
12          Additional benefits of the proposed GMPN  project include hvdropower
generation and increased availability of irrigauon water. Guiang city and to a lesser extent
the upstream Hengxina county are currently constrained in their development due to a
shortage of electric power. The project will have the capacity to generate 120 MW of hyd:o-
electric power to supplement area supplies. A mininmm capaciy of approximately 36 MW
is guaranteed during the dry season which amounts to an average 590 GW.h r.nnual power
generation. It is also anticipated that several hundred hectares of medium productivity land
will be brought under cultivation following project completion due to the increased
availability of high quality irrigation water.  The irrigaiion scheme has not yet been
determined, but a preliminary estimate indicated that the amount of irrigation water would
be very small compared with river water flow even in the dry season. Nevertheless,
individual irrigation projects will be subject to EIAs in the future in accordance with Chinese
regulations.
2.2   Description
13.         The proposed GMPN project is an integral part of the Guangxi Autonomous
Region's economic development strattegy which includes inprovement of its railway, highway
and waterway tranWortation infrastructure. Guangxi is located in central south western
China and is bordered by Vietnam to the south; and Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou and
Yunnan provinces to the south east, east, north and west respectively, By virtue of its
location, Guangxi is a transit route for goods and conumerce within south westem China, and
an important link for the region's international trade.
14.         The Guangxi road and rail network is currentiy poorly developed and lacks
the capacity to efficiently transport goods to potential markets. Traditionally, waterways
have been a rnajor mod& of transportation in Guangxi and are currently used for shipment
of bulk commodities and raw materials between the interior and coastal areas. The proposed
GMPN project is designed to increase the transportation capacity of the Yujiang river which
flows approximately west to east in souLherm Guangxi and is a major transportation route for
the entire region.
15.         The Yujiang river is part of the Xijiang river system which drains an
approximate area of 90,800 hTi and discharges into the Pearl river delta in the east. The
river system is a major route for the transportation of raw materials and manufactured goods
from as far inland as Sichuan, and thus occupies a vitai position in the economy of the
region. The improvement of th-is waterway, comr,ined with other proposed infrastructure
projects shall provide the transportation neetwork required to meet the anticipated demands
of increasing trade between Guangxi, adjacent provinces, Vietnam and tLe ports of Hong
Kong and Macau.
3



i6.         The proposed GMPN project consists of a low head concrete impoundment and
lock system planned for the mid to lower reaches of the Yujiang river, approximately six
kilometers upstream of Guigang City (Figure 2-2.1). 'he area is in the historic flood plain
of the menering Yujiang river, characterized by flat topography with occasional limestone
outcrops, and deep. fertile fluvial soils. The project site is located in a smight length of the
river which follows a wide turn and continues along the same course through Guigang city.
(Figure 2.2.2) The Yujiang river is approximately 400 meters wide at this location and is
confined within an eroded channel by unstable earth banks which are marked with drainage
gullies and show evidence of erosion and slumping.
17.         The Yujiang river is presently regulated by the low head coDcrete Xijin dam.
approximately 104 kilometers upstream of the project site, and at 110 kilometers downstream
by the Guipimg dam. The dams were constructed in the 1960's and the 1980's respectively
to enhane the navigability of the river, provide hydro-power and to imp  ve inigation and
fisheries. The river is currently designated a 6th Class waterway (Table 1), navigable for
100 ton barges. While there is capacity for larger barge traffic durng the wet season, the
river flow between Xijin dam and the proposed project site is reduced significantly during
the dry season, exposing some 22 shaaflow and rocky areas which hinder navigation and
increase the hazard to shipping. The increased water depth resulting from the project
construction will render all but three shoals harmless by submersion. The remaining three-
shoals located at Jier, Difu and Fubo (Figure 2.2.1) consist of rock outcrops which shall be
removed by blasting as part of the project implementation.
(i)   Infrastrucmre
18.         The land transportation system in the proje^t area consists of a network of dirt
and gravel roads interlacing the ccntryside and connecting with paved two lane Class I1 or
Class III highways. National Road 209 located on the northern plane of the Yujiang river
is the major trunk road in the project vicinity. This road which is poorly maintained and
very congested carries the bulk of the highway passenger and goods traffic in the region.
The railway system in the Yujiang river area is relatively undeveloped; its main function is
for hauling bulk materials to small loading facilities along the river which tansfer the
materials to barges for tasportation to dowtream locations.
19.         The Xijin dam is the major source of electric power for Hengxian County.
Several low-head dams along thX tributaries of the Yujiang river also provide power to
isolated communities or commercial operations. Guigang City receives its power from the
regionai electricity grid which is networked to both thermal and hydro-power plants.
Currently, the Yujiang river area is constrained in its development due to a lack of
electricity. This is particularly true of Guigang City, which suffers from acute power
shortages, requiring major industries to generate electricity on site.

(ii)        Population aid Output
20.         The zone of influence (ZOI) for the project is approximately 76,300 Km2
which amounts to 32 percent of the area of Guangxi province. The area includes 12.33
million mu (790,000 ha) of cultivated land ad has a population of 11.4 million, which is
equivalent to 26.3 percent of the Guangzi population. The gross output value of agriculture
and industry in 1992 was 20.6 billion yuan (RMB) with a 10-8 percent average annual
inxrease (calculated over the period 1981-90). Before 1988, agrcultral and industria output
were approximately equal. in 1990 the value of industrial output incicased to double that
of agriculture and in 1992 it reached 16 times agriculral output.
3.   DESCRIEMION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
3.1   Natural Environment
(i)   Meteorology
21.         The GMPN project area lies in Southwest China and has a subtoical
monsoon climate with distinct rainy and dry seasons. The rainy season, which is marked by
heavy monsoon precipitation, lasts from April to the end of August, while the dry season
extends from September to March. Rainfall ranges from 2020.7mm to 975.0mm, with an
average annual precipitation of 1450mm. Temperatures range from 39.50C in summer to
-3.4C in winter, with an average temperature of 21.50C.
(ii)   Terrain and Geology
22.         Terrain in the project area is generally mountainous in the north, with low
lying plains in the south. The Yujiang river flows through the Xijin step area and into the
reservoir from southwest to northeast, forming a U-shaped river valley.
23.         Some sections of the Yujiaog r- er cont.in navigational hazards ircluding
shallows and rock outcrops, but most of the river is wide~ and has a natural flow. The step
tableland crdering the river is heavily developed.
24.         Exposed strata at the dam site consists of Cambrian, Triassic, Cretaceous,
Devorian and Carboniferous formations, of which the latter two are the most widely
distributed. Igneous rocks appear in the Xijin dam and impoundment area. Most of the bed
rock is covered by Quatemary period strata. Fault activity in the region is considered low
and earthquakes above magnitude 5.0 on the Richter scale do not commonly occur.
(iii)  Surface and Groundwater
25.         The proposed GMPN project site is located on tLe Yujiang river approximately
104 kilometers downstream. of the Xijin hydroelectric station. The catchment area between
the two locations is 4400 km2, 5.4 percent of the total river basin. There are seven major
tributaries and some small reservoirs within this secdion of the Yujiang river.
8
I



26.         7he Yujing nver is the main source of mdustrial water supples in mh project
area, as well as a supplementary source of domestic nd irrigation water. Groundwater is
pleatifal. and many residents obtain their drikn water from domestic wells.
(iv)   Flora and Fauna
27.         The region surrounding Guigang city, including the proposed project area, has
been heavily developed, and high population dawit has put dtemendous straim on the
terrsrial environment.  Deforestation and insive agricultural land practices have
decimated regional riprian biota. Diversity of plant species ms low a"4 forest cover which
originally dominated the area has been destoyed and replaced by cash crops, shib- -xid
grsslan for cattle grazig. Seasonal flood iundation has also greatly reduced the diversity
of flora and fauna.
28.         Bird and reptile species are thie predominant wildlife species found withn the
extremely poor habitat of the project site. Birds likely to be foxnd m the surounding
ighland forests, and lowland shrub and grassland areas iclude owls, swallow, magpies,
Lfow, thrush, monkey-face, hawk and wild pheasants none of which are likely to be iapacted
by the project due to their distance from the river. Within the project site riparin zone and
river course, the habitat for eight species of aquatic birds and 27 species of wadi_e bird have
been identified. The habitat for one rare bird (China-Aunumn Duck) has been identified in
the tributaries of the Yujiang river but none have been observed.
29.         Tortoise and soft-shelled nurtles are usually found living in the larger
tributaries and main branches of the Yujiang nver.  hes have been impacted by harvesting
as a delicacy and their habitat will be affected by the proposed project. Seven snake species
have been identified in the region and are predominatly fiound in surrounding agricuilral
lands and mountais at a distance from the riier. The rare animal species in the zegion such
as pangolin, masked civet, silver-ring snke, and white crane inhabit mountainous and
densely forested areas at a distance from the site, and hence are unlikely to be affected by
the project.
30.         Tne Yujiang river has an abundance of aquatic organisms including
hydrophytes and a variety of fish species plmarily introduced to tbe river from spawn farms.
Some of these species may experience impacts due to the project.
3.2   Soclo-Economic Setting
(i)    Local E-onomy
31.         The project area is withn a maJor agricultural region producing approximately
27 percent of Guangxi's agricultural output. Cultivated crops include cereals such as rice,
wheat and corn, and also peanuts, sesame, mushroorms, sugarcane. fruits, tea and tobacco.
32.         F<axming  activities have historically  been  consained  due - to poor
transportation, inadequate power availability, and cycles of drought and flooding. A
secondary benefit of the projet therefore wdl be the greater avaiiability of quality irrigation
water and the bringing into production of dry uncultivated lands.
9



33.         Currently, the fiull potential for industrial output and commerce in the project
area has not been realied. The major light idustres process or produce sugar, paper.
fertilizer, food products, textiles and leather. Heavy industries include manufactur of steel,
concrete, and machinery as well as miing of coal and other minerals.
(ii)   Population and Indigenous Peoples
34.         The prcject area has a population of 11.4 million, approxirmately 90 percent
of which is rural and depends on farmig or fishng for subsistene. Some 40 percent of the
population is made up of non-Han nationalities, with a large majority being Zhuang. Ihe
various nationalmes in the reservoir area are relatively well integrated with the exception of
some isolated inland and highland villages which are predominantly Zhuang. The latter
communities are not witbin the direct area of reservoir impact.
(iii) Cultural and Historical Proerties
35.         Various surveys were performed dunng the feasibility study to mventory
cultural and historic sites in the reservoir area and identify potential impacts of the proposed
project on these sites. The District Traffic Planning, Prospecting and Design Academy
(DTPPDA) in collaboration with provicial historical relics authorities prepared a report m
accordance with "The Cultural Relics Protection Law of the People's Republic of China,"
which identified approximately 17 sites within the reservoir area. The DTPPDA performed
a comprehensive survey of the reservoir area over one year and compiled sufficient
information to characterize the historic sites and provide suggestions for mitigation
alternatives where required. The DTPPDA survey was perfonned on both banks of the
Yujiang river from Watang town in Guigang city to Hengzhou in Hengxian county.
36          Historical and cultur3a sites in the project area include: twelve Neo-lithic
period relic sites containing arifacts such as pottery and stone implements; one ancient city
site; one ancient kiln site; a group of ancient tombs and burial mounds from the Nan
Dynasty; and Lree historic structures: the Mother Dragon Temple, Fubo Temple, and
Haitang Bridge.
(iv)   Public Health
37.         Diseaces which have previously affected the reservoir area include viral
hepatitis, dysentery, typhoid fever, encephalitis B and malaria- Viral hepatitis and dysentery
currently rose the most widespread problems in the region. Incidence of encephalitis B has
greatly decreased in recent years. Blood fluke and schistosomiasis were eradicated in 1983,
and fiariasis was eliminated in 1990. In the last five years,. the incidence of malria has
dropped to below 1/10,000. While the erdarged area of stagnant water resulting from the
project is a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes, based on the experience of the nearby
Xijin dam, this is unlikely to increase the incidence of malaria in the reservoir area.
10



4.   ENVIRONAIENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MSEASURES
4.1   Location Issues
(i)   Inmdation Management and Prevention
38.         Following completion of the GMPN project, the water levels in the reservoir
will rise approximately six meters above pre-consuction levels- The total inudated area
is estimated at approximately 6,735 mu (450 ha), including 2,537 mu (169 ha) of paddy
fields and 1,498 mu (100 ha) of dry cutivated land. The area affected by inundation covers
12 counties of Guigang city and Hengxian county.
39-         During dte primary stages of the GMPN project, enginering measre will
be taken to minimize loss of land and odher economic assets due to inndation. These
miclude reinforcement of existing dikes and consotction of additional ones in key areas. As
a reslt of these measures, it appears that the GMPN project will not icea  flood water
levels during the rainy season and that any inndation will be in low-lying areas, below the
design reservoir operaMg water level and primarily in the tributaries of the main channel.
40.         Approximately 716 ha of land will be protected from inundation in 46 different
areas. Cultivated lands account for 576 ha of the protected area and the remainig 140 ha
includes residential areas and economic mstallations. Thev total area to be inundated after
prevention measures are taken is 448 ha, of which cult;vated land accounts for 269 ha.
41.         There are currently 111 dikes and embankments with an area of 7,000 ha in
the reservoir vicinity.  Of these, 78 embankments will be affected by inundation,
approximately 46 of which will be rebuilt as part of the inundation prevention program.
Embankment locations are shown in Figure 4.1 1.
(ii) Socio-economic impacts
42.         The provincial government has taken considerable care to design the project
in a manner which will minimize disruption to area communities, economy, environment and
historical sites. Where possible the project design has optimized use of protection measures
and suggested alternatives to minimize economic dislocation of farming communities. As a
result, relocation and re-allocation of labor has been minimized. Details of socio-economic
impacts and mitigation action plans are presented in Section II of this report.
43.         In addition to the area of inundation, the dam consauction area will occupy
1,510 mu of land, including 158 mu of paddy fields and 1352 mu of sugar cane fields. A
total of seven houses will be relocated, and 914 people will require new employment. The
seven houses will be rebuilt within 200 meters of their original location with an investment
of 212,579 yuan.
44.         The compensation progran which has been formulated to assist farmers who
wil lose their land is dicussed in detail in Section 11 of this report. The local governments
which are responsible for this aspect of the project have already mobilizd teams which will
assist m the project implementation at the grass roots level.

a)    Aquacultire and Forestry
45.         Aquaculmure investment will be concenrated in Guigang city. It will involve
improvn exising fish ponds, mvesting in fish species and fry input Some 252.8 ha of fish
ponds with yields of less than 50 kg per mu will be upgraded. With a planned investment
of 2.51 milion yuan, 200 more fish fry are to be bred on every mu of fish pond. Lingmeng
reservoir in Xingtang township will also be developedt for fishing. Measures to develop
forestry resources include plantig trees on 67 ha of reclaimed land in Baihe town, Henghe
county.
(iii)  Flora and Fauna
46.         The project ZOI is a major agricultral zone of (Guangxi province. Substantial
wetland reclamation and cultivation has occurred in this area and currently no undistrbed
wedands have been idendfied within the proposed project area.
47.         Due to the generally poor quality of natural vegetative cover in the project area
and dominance of cultivated land, it is anticipated that construction of the Guigang anchorage
will not have a significa  impact on natural vegetative cover. The flooding of mud-flats and
grass beds, however, may have some impact on bird species and repties which inabit these
areas.
48.         A major impact to widlife resulting from this project will be the disruption
of tortoise and soft-shelled turtle habitat. The current existence of reservoirs in the lower
and upper sections of the river combined with the proposed new impoundment will ereate a
closed river system which may be unfavorable to the tortoise and soft-shelled turtle. Due
to their importance in the region, the following measures will be taken to assure their
survival.
49.         A mitigation alternative for potential impacts to tortoise and soft-shell turtle
habitat is to allow surrounding fields which will be inundated to revert to wetlands. Captured
tortoise and soft-shell turtle species could then be relocated to these shallow wetland areas
as well as to tributaries whicb will be enlarged after submergence. Furthermore, these
wetland areas would provide valuable habitat for wading and aquatic birds displaced by
submergence in the immediate project vicinity. Secondly, a system of spawning plants may
be set up to provide tortoise and soft-shelled turtle to the local population and to replenish
river stocks in order to decrease pressure on the wild populations once they are relocated.
The schedule for project construction will be carefully planned in order to accommodate the
tortoise and turtle b -eding season and thus assure a population size that will be amenable
to relocation.
50.         Prior to construction initiation, further surveys to locate endangered animal
species in the project area will be carried out. In particular, care will be taken to ensure that
no China Autumn ducks, pangolin, masked civet, silver-ring snake, or white crane are
nesting at or near the site. To date none have been observed in the potential habitats in the
area. If survey results indicate the presence of any of these species, special mitigation plans
will be detailed. However, creation of new wetland areas surrounding  e site will reduce
the impacts on wading and aquatic bird species and possibly make relocation unnecessary.
13



In the case of the silver-ring snake, relocation will be the only option if the species is
observed.
51.         Changes in the river ecosystem will affect aquAtic plants in the rservoir and
downstream areas. Fish and hydrophyte species will have to adapt to direct and indirect
man-made changes in environmental conditions. Some species will adapt while others will
not, experiencing reductions in population.
52.         To mitigate losses of commercially valuable fish stlck, four spawning facilities
will be constructed to augment fish populations incrase activities already underaken by
Guigang and Hengxian and hatchery efforts will be focused on commercial species. An
alternative is to thoroughly utilime all remaining water bodies including nver bends for
aquaculture. Employment oppomunities from these mitigation measu  will contnbute to
the economic development of migrants.
53.         Wherever aquaculture would be developed in the project area, comprehensive
water quality monitoring will be conducted- Semi-annual fish toxic metals bio-accumulation
analyses will also be undertaken. If water quality assessments indicate the presence of
contaminants, including heavy metals, mitigation measures will be adopted to include
pollution source control and relocation of proposed aquaculture sites.
54.         Measures will be taken both during and after con1uction in order to minimize
impacts to hydrophyte populations. During construction, special measures such as the use
of sand bags ai1d hay bails to control erosion and reduce sediment flow into the river course
will be employed. Oil slick booms and cleanup equipment will be employed to assure that
oil and petroleum products from equipment used during construction will not contaminate the
river.
55.         Barik surveys will be undertaken during the operation phase to reduce erosion
and collapse. In order to control the discharge of waste oil from barges, the Departnents
of Navigation Administration, Navigation Monitoring, and Shipping Management of the
Guangxi Communications Department as well as the EPB have undertaken a comprehensive
coordination program with regard to oil discharge corntrol and enforcement and air pollution
control in all provincial waterways. The program stipulates annual inspection and licensing
of vessels with regard to oil collection and noise protection facilities. At the same time,
measures have been taken to increase environmental awareness among navigation department
and barge transportation personnel. Guidelines for the control of waste oil discharges from
ships are stipulated in the "National Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law", the
national "Shipping Contaminant Discharge Standard" (GB3552-83), and the 5th Decree of
tfie Ministry of Transportation on 'Shipping Sluice Management."
56.         To control barge waste oil discharges, all motorized ships should be equipped
with oil-water separators to ensure that oil content in the discharged bilge water does not
exceed 15 mg/i. WMhere installation of such devices is not feasible, then a waste oil container
should be kept on hand.  The navigation administration and navigation monitoring
departments have equipped special ships to collect waste oil at regular intervals.
14



57.          In the nand river amea, an oil transport registration system has been
irplemented for 150 ton oil tankers and for common ships exceeding 400 tons. At present,
however, waterway facilities in the project region do not have the capacity to dispose of
waste oil and other shipping wastes. In order to remedy these deficiencis, investments are
proposed for waste disposal equipment within the projet area.
58.          The potental for accidenal spiLls will rise as a resuk of the significant increase
in river traffic.  Spill prevention stategy centers on enforcing shipping and lock
management. To prevent accidental spils of materials, a safety check will be enforced on
all river vessels by navigation administration agencies at downsuram and upstream handling
terminals and shipping sluice gates. A special check will be performed for vessels which are
canyig ecologically sensitive materials such as oil and coal. An accident 'mitigation plan
has been formulated and put into effect by provincial agencies for the protection of water
ways.
59-         A major impact of the project on the aquatic environment is that of altering
river flow velocity. Although the retention time in the rservoir is short, in:order to sustamin
hydrophyte populations, it is important to limit stagnation in the water body by maintining
proper flow rates in the dry season. Contnual monitoring of hydrophyte populations will
be carried out upstream and downstrem of all the impoundments within the Yujiang river
and its major tributaries.
(iv)  Impact on Cultural and Historical Properties
60-           Cultual and historical sites identified in the EIA, including the ancient kiln
site, the Nan dynasty burial mounds, the Mother Dragon Temple, Fubo Temple and the
Haitang bridge, have undergone evahltion, and have been determined to either be well
removed from ffie reservoir or elevated above the maximum design storage water level and
as such will not be impacted by the project. In some cases such as Fubo Temple, the river
banks below the site may be de-stabilized due to the elevated water level. Therefore slope
protection and reinforcement measures will be implemented as necessary.
61.          Thirteen cultural and historic sites will be affected by inundation. One of them
is the ruins of an ancient city from between the Nan and Qing dynasties, while the other
twelve are Neolithic age relics. Since the water level will rise and the passing of large
vessels will cause bank erosion, bank collapse will be aggravated and may encroach on some
of the more importnt sites. Therefore protection measures, including further field survey,
excavation and removal of relics will be implemented.
(v)   Coal Handling Terminals
62.         Since the Nanning coal handling terminal is still in the planning stages, the
pre-feasibility report and the terminal siting will not be completed until the beginning of the
second-stage engineering. Therefore, the terminal has been included in the proposed project
The ELA of the terminal will be carried out in accordance with Chinese regulations. The
coal handling terminal in Guigang has already been built and includes conveyer and terminal
protection devices including- water sprinklers for dust control, and waste water collection and
sedimentation facilities.
I-



63.         The general environmental impacts identified, and miuigauon measures adopted
by the Guangxi Communications Department are as follows:
a)    Principal Environmental Impacts
64.         Loading and unloading operations at the coal dock will contribute to
atmospheric pollution n the area, particularly during the fall and winter due to dry, windy
conditions. Heavy summer precipitation will mix with the exposed coal in the yard, forming
contaminated runoff. Mitigation measures to control dust and prevent pollution of the harbor
and river course are needed.
b)    Dust Prevention
65.         Sprinklers will be used to control dust generated by loading and unloading of
coal at the dock, and in the conveyer belt area. In each of the four coal storage areas, two
water pumps will be installed with 15 automatic sprinkers. Spraying will be conducted as
often as necessay in the coal yard, and along the harbor roadway-
c)    Wastewater Treatment
66.         A special drainage system will be constucted to handle runoff from the coal
yard. Runoff will be drained into a sedimentation pond at a rate of 0.37 m&Vs, where it will
undergo a 20 minute sedinentation process. Discharged water will meet national discharge
stamdards. Sludge from the pond will be collected and recycled.
4.2   Construction Issues
(i)    Noise
67.         Much of the construction equipment and activities including blasting and pile
driving at the proposed project site will emit noise above 90 dB. This is above regulated
standards in China (65 dB) and may cause hearing damage to construction workers in the
event of prolonged exposure. Therefore hearing protection is recommended for construction
workers. The noise sources are approximately 900 meters away from the closest residential
units and as such will not cause significant impacts. The major noise in the residential units
is anticinated to be from fte existing highway. Noise levels are anticipated to reach
approximately 57 dB during the peak construction times when 60 trucks will pass through
the site each hour. The post construction activities are not anticipated to result in noise
levels above regulated standards.
(ii) Soil Erosion and Dust
68.         One major environmental impact of construction is atmospheric degradation
due to fugitive dust and increased erosion resulting from remnoval of surface vegetation. To
mininize fugitive dust impacts, excavation and construction areas will be sprayed regularly.
69.         The existing road connecting the construction area to the newly proposed
quarry is mostly paved with the exception of a two kilometer section adjacent to the quarry.
16



The two Lilometer section of road shall be upgraded to asphalt and the entire road shall be
widened by two meters prior to quarrying activities. In general, dust resulting from traffic
during project construction are not expected to seriously affect the local population.
70.         The road to the new quarry site primarily passes through. fields, a small rural
commercial area and is far from the neares village. There are no other environmentally
sensitive sites along the road. This road will be managed and monitored by the Guigang city
and monitoring will be performed by Guigang Environmental Monitorng Center under the
supervision of the Environmental Management Group of the Xijiang Project Headquarters
(XiPH). Dirt roads affected by construction traffic including those inside the quarry area
shall be sprayed regularly to minimnize dust, and traffic control measures will be instituted
for safety.
71.         Erosion control may be achieved by minimizing vegetation removal and
exposed surfaces until necessary, and by inlng silt traps and other erosion prevention
measures. After construction is completed, the site and its surrounding areas will be restored
as closely as possible to their original state.
(iii) Atmospheric Pollution
72.         During construction, air quality in the project area will be impacted by to a
limited extent by construction machinery due to the labor intensive nature of the work.
emissions from blasting, excavation and earth moving operaftions. Pollutants from vehicle
emissions include NO., S02, CO and hydrocarbons, while CO and NO, are the primary
emissions released by blasting activities.
73.         The extent of air quality degradation during construction is dependent or. the
intensity of site activities. It is anticipated that air quality degradation may occur on cahm
days (wind speed below 3 mis) when site activities are at a peak and an atmospheric
inversion occurs. Inversion however only occurs up to 15 days a year and the number of
construction machinery used at the site is quite limited. Therefore no significa-nt air quality
impacts are anticipated .
(iv)   Surface Water Pollution
74.         The principal impacts on water quality during construction will be turbidity
from foundation excavation work at the dam site and wastewater from the construction site
and workers living quarters. Turbidity will be very limited in duration. The impact of
wastewater from the construction site and workers living quarters on the Guigang
downstream water supplies is negligible. However, in order to avoid impacts on downstream
fisheries and inhabitants on both river banks, the constuction wastewater will be treated
before being discharged into the Yujiang river. Sewage will be disposed of in septic tanks
and sludge will be collected for use as organic fertilizer.
(v)   Economic Impacts of Construction
75.         Construction of the dam is anticipated to last approximately five years. During
the peak period of construction in the second year, an estimated 3300 workers will be
17



employed on site. It lis anticipated that infrastucture for the work-ers may encroach on
adjacent economic activities such as agricultural production and cause some degree of
interruption. River traffic will be at least temporarily disrupted, and local roads will become
congested as large amounts of materials are transported back and forth in the construction
process. However, local residents will benefit economically from the opporuity to sell
construction materials, food and other goods to the workers.
(vi)  Public Health
76.          Project construction will potentially exacerbate existing public health problems
in the region, particularly the incidence of water-borne diseases such as dysentery and viral
hepatitis as well as vector borne diseases such as malaria. The high concentration of people
in the reservoir area and resulting increase in the volume of sewage will potentially promote
disease transmission. Based on the experience of other hydro-electric power stations, it can
be anticipated that the incidence of epidemic diseases will increase, necessitating effective
countermeasures In particular, the threat of epidemic diseases brought in by the floating
population in the area will need to be dealt with. Diseases trnmitted by rats are likely to
increase as they are driven from their original habitats by rising water levels.
77.         In order to protect public health during construction, strict hygienic
requirements will be placed on the living quarters of workers in the construction area,
particularly the controlled disposal of solid waste (i.e. landfiiling) and domestic sewage.
Efforts will be made to avoid potential breeding grounds for rats, mosquitoes and flies, and
a disease prevention unit will be put in place to detect the spread of epidemic diseases.
Drinking water supplies will be placed a sufficient distance away from solid waste disposal
areas and septic tanks. In order to safeguard water quality in the reservoir after construction,
the bottom of the reservoir will be cleaned six months prior to water storage.
(vii) Shoal Removal by Blasting
The project includes shoal removal by blasting at three locations including:
Jier, Difu and Fubo shoals (Figure2.2 1). Detailed blasting locations at each shoal is shown
in Figures 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 respectively. The purpose of blasting is to eliminate rock
outcrops at each shoal location in order to increase navigation capacity and safety. The
blasted rock shall be removed for use in construction projects, excess rock shall be used to
fill deep spots at each shoal locations as shown in the shoal maps.
78.          Tne navigation department may conduct annual dredging work on the channel.
While preliminary sample tests of bottom mud did not indicate the accumulation of toxic
substances, in order to prevent any pollution problems from dredging, dredged sludge will
be tested for hazardous substances such as Hg and Cr. Where tests indicate the presence of
hazardous substances, the sludge will be disposed of in an approved, secure landfill site.
Because the river course is generally 300-500 meters wide, dredging will not affect bank
stability.
79.          Blasting will be only undertaken during low flow periods. Thus rock outcrops
will be above the water surface and as such significant noise and vibration impacts on fish
is not anticipated. Prior to blasting however, investigations will be conducted to determine

the presence of aquatic orgausms in blasting areas. In order to minmize ecological impacts,
small explosives will first ce used to disperse aquatic organisms. Impacts on the local
populace will be minimal, since the nearest villages ar= located at a disance from potential
blasting sites. Site noise and water quality monitoring will be undertaken according to the
Monitoring Plan 30 days prior to blasting and during the blasting operations.
(viii) Coffer Dam Placement and Removal
80.         The coffer dam at the construction site was initiated in November 1994. It is
currently being placed on the northrn bank of the construction site with light machinery
under labor intensive conditions. Obsevatons at the site  dicate very slight elevations in
the river silt conent as a result of the constuction. This is due to the construction technique
which icludes placent of alternate layers of soil and straw as a stabilizing agent Water
quality data taklen approximately 30 days prior to construction initiation will be compared to
data being currenty collected and analyzed according to the Monitoring Plan schedule in
order to determine the impact of the coffer dam construction.
81.         The Phase I coffer daam will be removed from the north bank in late 1996 after
the completion of the south bank coffer dam. Portions of the coffer, dam located above the
water line will be removed with light bulldozers and submerged portions will be removed by
clam-shell cranes. Water quality monitoring will be undertaken on a daily basis according
to the Monitoring Plan durig tis period and no signficant mcrease m water turbidity is
anticipated. Coffer dam materials shall be disposed of in designated landfill sites to the south
bank of the river.
(ix)   Quarry Site
82.         Due to recent local opposition and increased rates by original site owners, an
alternative quarry site has been proposed located approximately 15 kilometers to the west of
the construction site on the north bank (Figure 4.2.4). The newly proposed site which was
ispected by the World Bank mission consiStS of a rock outcrop with a capacity to yield
700,000 m3 of material. The access road to the quarry is currently a sugarcane field which.
shail be temporarily used by the project. The compensation to the impacted farmers is
included in the RAP.
83.         The road from the quarry to the construction sit.> is a Class IV ral highway
with a width of eight meters. The first two kilometers from the quarry site is currently
unpaved but shall be upgraded to an asphalt surface. The entire road shall also oe widened
by two meters to facilitate access to two way truck traffic. It is proposed that to meet
construction demands, on average 20 trucks shall pass along the road in each direction per
hour. Construction traffic will be restricted to 6 am - 8 pm and traffic control measures will
be instituted to reduce congestion and noise. Blasting at the quarry site will only occur at
noon and at 6 pm as stipulated in the national regulations. Wind direction, noise and dust
monitoring will be instituted prior to blasting.

84.         The quarry access road passes for the most part tugh agicultural areas
cultivated with sugarcane. Approxiately three kilometers froin the quarry a railway
overpass crosses the road which due to it's narrow opening may cause traffic congestion.
Following the overpass for approximately 100 meters small nWal shops are located on either  w
side of the street. No residenndal areas were observed along the alignment. Daily noise and  --
dust tonitoring shall be undertaken at ths location according to the Monitorng Plan
schedle and traffi control measu  will be undertaken to avoid congestion and ensure
safety.
4.3   Operation lssues
r7 
(i)   Surface Water Pollution
85.         Water quality impacts due to biodegradable materials are anticipated to
improve slightly and detenorate slighdy in terms of metals and COD. Downstream water
flow will remain relatively stable with the exception of certain periods of the dry season,
when water wil be reained in the reservoir for electricity generating purposes, possibly
resultg in downstream water quality degadation.
86.         Water quality will deteriorate downsteam of the project due to the increased
concentratLon of indusral effluent from the Liyujiang nver, which is located downstream
of the proposed dam site and is presently polluted. Moreover, the significant increase in
river traffic will increase the scale of oil contamirtion in the project area, necessitating
prevention and remediation meares.
87.         It is necessary to carry out comprehensive water pollution control for the
project area, for which much effort has been made by provincial and local EPBs. Specific
pollution control measures have been examied and some have been implemented. In order
to bring about further improvement in water quality, the Guigang EPB will take a leading
role. Greater attention will also be paid to the control of contaminants from sugar and paper
manufacturng, as well as to waste water collection and treatment both upstream and
downstream of the reserroir area.
88.         Extensive monitoring has been undertaken within the entire Xijiang nver
system in order to control effluent into the Pearl river delta. As a result of this monitoring
specific discharges must be controlled according to regulatory orders and comprehensive
water quality control programs are being formulated at the local and provincial levels.
Guigang city and Hengxian county EPBs are also participating in this program which is
aimed at preserving water quality at current levels until the year 2000 and improving water
quality after ftat time. Specific details are not currently available for review.
89.         To control barge waste oil discharges, all motorized ships will be by law
equipped with oil-water separators to ensure that oil content in the discharged bilge water
does not exceed 15 mg/I. Where installation of such devices is not feasible, then a waste oil
container will be kept on hand. The navigation administration and navigation monitoring
departments will equip special ships to collect waste oil at regular intervals or by patrolling
the river.

90.         In the iland river area, an oil transport registration system  has been
implemented for 150 ton oil tankers and for common ships exceeding 400 tons. At present,
however, waterway facilities in the project region do not have the capacity to dispose of
waste oil and other shipping wastes. In order to remedy these deficiencies, investments will  - - -  -
be made in waste disposal equipment.                                                         - -
91.         The potential for accidental spiUs will rise as a result of the significant increase
in river traffic.  Spill prevention strategy ceanters on enforcing shipping and lock
management. To prevent accidental spills of materials, a safety check will be enforced on
all river vessels by navigation administration agencies at downstram and upstueam handling
terminals and shipping sluice gates. A special check will be performed for vessels whuch are
carrying ecologically sensitive materials such as oil and coal. An accident mitigation plan  ,
will be formulated at a later time.
92.         -The GMPN project will create a free-flowing reservoir, whose hydraulic
retention time is very short. Therefore, no temperaue gradations will occur at different
water depths, eutrophication is not anticipated and sedimentation will not vary significantly
from present conditions.
5.    PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
93.         The Guangxi Communications Department has investigated various methods
for ensuring unimpeded river traffic in this segment of the Yujiang river. Dredging and
blasting of shallow rocky areas have been undertken, yet neither will provide unrestricted
access during the dry season. As such, the project feasibility report identified the GMPN
project as the only means to insure access to 1000 ton barges by raising the water level
permanently to high flow season levels. The additional benefits accrued from electrical
power generation and improved irrigation also adds to the economic feasibility of the project
with relatively small impacts to the reservoir area.

6-2   Environmental Monitoring
96.         In order to evaluate environmental impacts during and after the reservoir
construction, an Environmental Monitoring Plan has been formulated w4ich meets regulatory
requirements, and includes parameters, locations and frequency of monitoring. Short and
long term environmental monitorng shall be performed to evaluate project impacts and trends
so that both retroactive and pro-active measures may be taken. The scope for monitoring
includes air, noise and water quality, ecology, bank failure and inundation. The monitored
data will be used to upgrade the project Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and formulate
effective mitigation measures.

S.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
103.        The likely negative impacts of the GMPN project are considered acceptable.
By improving the navigability of the Xijiang river system, which is a vital route for the
transportation of raw materials and manufactued goods, the project will spur economic
development in Guangxi and adjacent provinces. Additional benefits include hydropower
generation and increased availability of irrigation water.
104.        Tle principle impacts on the environment include disruption of areas adjacent
to the project site, soil erosion, temporary water quality decline, and air quality degradation
resulting from te construction process. Impacts to terrestrial and aquatic resources appears
to be samall since the proposed project will be located on a highly regulated waterway and
will not create significantly new conditions.
105.        Potential impacts may occur due to the large labor population which the project
will attract. Health and sanitation impacts will have to be managed by placing strict hygieiic
requirements on workers' living quarters, controlling solid waste disposal and disposing of
sewage in septic tan-s- Thirteen cultural and historic sites will be affected by inundation,
necessitating protection measures and excavation in some cases.
106.        The overall project impacts are minimized due to relatively good planning and
implementation strategies on the part of the project proponents. Despite inundation caused
by increased water levels in the reservoir, engineering measures preclude the need for
physical resettlement of the affected population. For those whose lands are inandated,
compensation will be provided and a comprehensive program to upgrade marginal fields,
reclaim wastelands, and expand aquacul3ure will be implemented.

SECTION 11
SUMMARY SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1.    CURRENT SlTUATION
107.        The proposed reservoir site is located in the Yujiang river. The Yujiang
tributary divides the reservoir area into many small drainage systems and six main
tributaries. Over the years, local governments and villages have built III flood control
structures for protection of over 100,000 mu (6,452 ha) of farmland and houses, however
most of ihese smuctures are in disrepair and the area suffers under the effects of periodic
flooding.
108.        The region in vwnich the reservoir will be constructed is a developed area in
which economic activity consists primarily of agriculture and jobs in the unskilled labor
sector. Waterways provide the main transportation routes but the use of the section from
Xiiin to Guigang is severely liited in the dry season. Sinc e  main alternative transport
routes are badly maintained and highly congested branch roads, this puts great pressure on
the three larger roads on the left bank of the reservoir.
109.        There are some small hydropower stations in the reservoir area alongside the
Xijin Power Plant which was built in the late 1950's. The plants supply eiectricity to
industrial and mining enterprises, to residents of both urban and rural areas and for
agricultural processing, waterlogged-land drainage and for flood protection.
2.  DETERMATION OF TIHE RESERVOIR AREA
110.        The Construction Committee of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has
stipulated the following design in two official documents: 'Reply to the Design Flood
Criteria for Reservoir Flooding and Resettlement of Guigang Multipurpose Navigation
Project" and 'The Design Standard for tie Treatment of Reservoir Flooding in Water
Conservancy and Hydro-power Project'.
a.    For cultivated land - fields and garden plots - the acquisition line is the
envelope curve based on the 5-year flood plain (43.10m) and the restricted
level (41 .1m during flood periods)
b.    For buildings and population, water conservation insallations, highways,
bridges, installations for electric power and communications, military
installations, historic relics and sites, mineral resources etc., the
acquisition/resettlernent line is detennined according to the 20-year backwater
flood plain in dry season after construction of the reservoir. The minimal
backwater iMuence in the upper section 36 kcm from the dam (sections 1-18
at the dam site) will be calculated in. According to the "Design Standard", the
demarkation line for affected population is calculated at the elevation of
44 10m, which exceeds the normal pool level by 1 m.
45



c.    According to both the 'Design Stadard' and the Guangxi Construction
Comnmission, the actual flooded areas are detenmined by extension of the peak
of the reservoir's backwater curve.
2.1   Determination of the Area for Resettlement and Land Acquisition
Ill.        The area affected by the flooding resulting from the GMPN project covers 68
villages, from 6 townships belonging to Guigang Municipality and from 6 townships
belonging to Hengxian Municipality. The total flooded land area including fish ponxds and
pools is 17,790.31 mu (1,148 ha), of which 12,961.44 mu (836 ha) are farm land- The dam
site requires acquisition of 1507.80 mu (97 ha) of arable land and resettlement of 7 family
homes totalling 2153.5 m2 of living and storage space.
112.        The Guangxi Conmunications Department has determined that the Guangxi
Power Industry Survey and Design Institute will be enusted with the supervision and
assessment work associated with land acquisition, resettlement and compenration. The design
for their supervision and reporting is outlined in Figure Ha (for details see Section m below.)
113.        Due to inadequate flood control measures, most settled areas are currently
beyond the 10-year flood plain with cultivated fields in the flooded plain and rice paddy in
the low-lying water logged areas adjacent to the river or connected by irrigation canals.
2.2   Flood Control
114.        The reservoir and flood control have been designed so that flooding of the
reservoir subsequent to dam construction is similar to current natural flood patterns
Therefore, flooding will affect the low lying areas adjacent to the river, including scoured
depressions of tributaries, and land which is inadecquately protected by flood control measures
even when measures for draining water-logged land are implemented.
115.        The area has 238 dykes with a total length of 37.223 kin with 237 floodgates.
These protect the low-lying areas on bot'h banks and up the trbutaries. While these measures
are sufficient for 5-year flood levels, they are not adequate to protect all the cultivated land,
housing and population. Further flood control measures will be taken, including increasing
and up-i fiiug tUe existiag measures and deploying electric facilities for draining waterlogged
land and for pumnping.
116.  It bas been determined that building new protection embarknents and improving the
condition of existing ones is an economical approach to reducing to the amount of land
acquisition necessary. The Guangxi Communications Depamnent suggests the following
principles for deciding where to build or improve flood protection:
a.   to protect cultivated land whenever eccnomically rational
b.   to protect areas where there are particular difficulties in connection with
resettlement, even if it is not economically rational
C.    Given the ratio between the cost of flood protection and the flooding
46



compensation, embanlkents whose ratio is > 3.0 will not be maintained.
117.        After examining three alternative plans for maintaining 58, 51 and 46
protection embankments respectively, and taking into account investments in pqwer
transmission as well, it is recommended that 46 embankment be maintained. These will
protect a total of 45,140 mu (2,912 ha) of cultivated land, 9,052 mu (584 ha) of which fall
under land acquisition. Additional protection measures will include construction of drainage
facilities and construction of dikes and retaining walls to minimize bankc slumping.
3.    OVERSEEING BODY
3.1   Organization for Coordination and Supervision
118.        In order to facilitate the plans for land acquisition, resettlement and
compensation, the Guangxi Power Industry Survey and Design Institute has been entrusted
with canying out the necessary supervision and assessment work.
119.        In May 1993, in agreement with the Guangxi Construction Comniittee, the
Guangxi Major Project Office and the goverments of Guigang City and Hengxian County,
a group co-headed by the assistant mayor of Guigang City and the deputy magistrate of
Hengxian County was designated to oversee and coordinate the compensation program. The
group includes 12 technical staff experienced in resettlement projects, including:
a.    One committee member from the Reservoir Economic Professional Committee
(researching the reservoir area resettlement issues) of the National
Hydroelectrical Engineering Institute;
b.    2 committee members from the Reservoir Economic Professional Committee
of Guangxi Hydroelectric Engineering Institute;
c.    6 senior engineers; and
d.    4 engineers.
120.        In the course of implementation, sociologists and agronomists will consult on
the monitoring system of the resettled families' standard of living and working conditions.
The implementation work in the field will be carried out by the Guangxi Power Industrial
Survey an.d Design Lnstitute with te assisEance of two local experts. The information
processing will be done by technical personnel from the Reservoir Area Resettlement
Division of Guangxi Power Industrial Survey and Design Institute.
121.        The supervisory group reports to the Guangxi Communications Department
and to local governments. Its responsibilities include reporting on the state of the land
acquisition, resettlement and compensation plan, evaluating the implementation thereof,
proposing any necessary changes in design, and assessing impacts. Its precise tasks are:
a.    To supervise contract execution by the client and the Reservoir Reallocation
Office

3.3   Survey of Familes and Individuals
126.        The survey of family and individual sandard of living will be carried out using
not less thn 15% of the directly affected populatiqn. A welfare index for each will be
colleced both before and after resettlement. Ths will include:
*     Number of persons in fimily,
*     Number of male and female laborers in each famiiy and number of
non-agricultual workers
*     Number of school age children
*     Total nmnnber of houses (in damsite area)
*     Total amount of cultivated labnd
*     Amnal grain output
v     Total anual mcome of family
3.4   Schedule
127.        The infoTmation for each key index will be collected the year before and the
year following the resettlementlreallocation to compare for change.
3.5   Reporting
128.        As soon as the contract of supervision and assessment has been signed, the
data collection will begin. Draft reports on supervision and assessment in the dam site area
will be submitted to the client and the World Bank in the first and second half year -1995.
Reports will be submtted in the fist and second half year 1996. Thereafter reports will be
provided yearly until the project is completed. The reports will include:
1) General description
2) Aim and scope of work
3) Content and methods of work
a) Choice of base index
b) Data collection
c) Progress of project implementation and compensation funds
d) Standard of living and of production of the resettled population
e) Risk analysis for the resettled population
4) Remaining problems
5) Proposals for improvement
6) Assessment and conclusion
129.        The data will be tansferred to computer. The local government should provide
necessary infrastructure such as communications, residence and offices.
3.6   Local Relocation Ofrices
130.        Local relocation offices of 3-5 persons led by the village head have also been
designated in the villages and towns most affected by the resettlement and land acquisition
programs. These offices are responsible for relations with the resettled population and for
ensuring that their living an working conditions are acceptable. Based on the detailed
relocation and production development plans designed for each locality, and under the
guidance of specialized design departments, the local offices will implement the agricultural
and non-agricultural projects, handle and distribute funds and commodities \to affected
farmers, carry out trainig programs for the farmers, managge funds relevant to
50



resettlement,and generally take on the care for the resettled population. They are also the
intermediary between the resettled population and government organs, being both the
government's contact with the locality and the contact address for problems or complaints
from the local population.                          !
131.        The local relocation offices thus both manage the implementation of programs
and distribution of compensation funds from the state goverment to the resetted population,
and serve as the technical department for guiding and t for economic development.
4.    THE RESERVOIR COMPENSATION PROGRAM
132.        In the early stages of planning, a comprehensive socio-economic survey was
carried out in Guigang City and Hengxian County. This included data on agricultural and
industrial production and the local government's plans for economic development of their
areas. The information was collected for 1990 and projected for 1995 and 2000. Similar
investigations and projections were formed for the directly affected population, with
particular focus on their current and projected production levels and standard of living.
133.        The resettlement and compensation program will be carried out in accordance
with the National State Council's Decree No. 74:"Resettlement Regulations and compensation
for Land Acquisition in Water Conservancy and Electricity Project Constuctions of Varying
Sizes" of Feb. 15, 1991.: A furher reference is the 'Standards of Design of Reservoir
Flooding Treatment in Water Conservancy and Electricity Works", Document No. 118 issued
for trial implementation by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power (84).
134.        The basic principles for resettlement and compensation are as follows:
(i)   Emphasize flood protection over resettlement.
(ii) Tap available natumral resources to continue supporting directly affected
famnilies in their orginal locality.
(iii)  Emphasize meeting infrastructure and natral resource needs.
(iv)   Prioritize enNironmental protection.
(v)   Ensure the socioeconomic condition of the resettled population.
4.1   Flood Protection
135.        Preference will be given to flood protection works where it is possible and
rational to protect existing fields and structures rather tian relocating them. Where such flood
protection is not feasible or rational, farmers must be given compensation for their flooded
land.
136.        The agreed on measures to improve and expand existing flood protection
means have resulted in only ten families having to be relocated because their homes will be
inundated. The flood protection measures have also reduced the number of people who will
have to be resettled for economic reasons because their arable land will be flooded. The
original- estimate of population needing resettlement was 12,696 for 1990; following the
decision to emphasize flood protection that number has fallen to 4743 for 1990, which would
be 4994 in 1995 and 5256 in 2000.

4.2   Full Utilization of Avaiable Resources
137.        The direcdy affected population will be resettled within the same district, thus
avoiding disruption of communities. This has been agreed on together wtth the governments
of Guigang City and Hengxian County as wel] as all the local town, township and village
govermnents affected. In the allocation of new lands, first priority will be given to
agriculture, followed by township and village enterprises. Special attention will also be given
to relocating existing or developing new production centers so as to take full advantage of
available natraal resources to provide alternative employment for relocated population.
138.        The plan for fully utilizing the available natural resources also focuses on
agriculture. Farmland that now only provides low or medium yields is to be upgraded.
Wastelands and barren hills are to be reclaimed for growing grain crops, planting trees and
fruit orchards. Aquaculture production will be expanded in the reservoir. Agro-technical
training will be offered to improve the agricultral skills of the resettled population. Finally,
an investigation of the natural and technological resources of existing township and village
enterprises will be undertak-en with the aim of identifying an developing potential new areas
for growth. These measures are all part of the move for economic development in the
reservoir area.
139.        For details of the plan for full utilization of the available natural resources see
Section V Plan for Agricultural and Economic Development below.
4.3   Emphasize Meeting Infrastructure and Resource Needs
140.        During resettlement, particular attentiol will be paid to providing the
infrastructure and basic installations necessary, to ensure that the related population can
maintain growing production levels and increase their living standards. With the goal of
maximizing the productive potential of the relocated population, priorities will be placed on:
lowered land use, finding land of a quality that allows higher production yields, convenience
of living situation, and ease of mnanagement
141.        An analysis of the directly affected farmers' needs, taking into account such
indicators as land use, population level, available natural resources including water, evel and
potential for economic development, land area per capita, and mode of production have
provided a baseline for 1990. These figures have been used to project developments in 1995
and 2000. According to this analysis, the resettled populationi will have regained its standard
of living in 1995 and by 2000 will have reached or surpassed the that of the non-resettled
local population.
142.        Readjusting the balance of land use between plantation farming, forestry, fruit
orchards. animal husbandry, aquaculture and township and village enterprise is a top priority.
The output of grain and industrial crops and the annual output value and net irnome has been
calculated on an annual basis. Irnvestment and production have been predicted so as to project
the per capita net-income and grain OUtput targets for the years 1995 and 2000. These were
then analyzed in relation to population density, level of demwand and availability of water and
fuel, and the health care and communications systems to determine whether the available
resources can meet the increased demand including the needs of the resettled populations.
This was carried out to determine whether each locality has the necessary available resources
to sustain resettled population and continue development.
143.        According to analyses of the eight townships in the reservoir areas, all of them
have high enough projected per capita net income and prr capita grain output levels for 1995
52



and 2000 to sustain resettled population. Water capacity, fuel resources, and comxnunications,
health care and educational systems are all sufficient to support the increase in population
density.
4.4   Environmental Protection
144.        In utilization of natal resources, special attention will be paid to the
environmental impact in order to ensure long-term use and coordinated development.
Particularly soil erosion and pollution will be prevented and controlled to minimize ecological
damage.
4.5   Socioeconomic Level of the Resettled Families
145.        The short range goal of this plan is to ensure the resettled families a stable life
and that they regain their level of production and standard of living. The longer term goal
is to raise their socioeconomic level to that of the region and eventally to raise their
production levels and standard of living above the mean.
5.  PLAN FOR AGRICLTLTURAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
5.1   Development of Arable Land
146.        The eight directly affected townships are located along both banks of the
Yujiang river.The average area of per capita cultivated land is less than one mu. Following
flooding, the total area of cultivated land available will be 187,541 mu. Of this, 47.7%
(about 89,465 mu) provides only low or medium yields. Implementing new fanning methods
or technologies to raise yield is therefore high priority. The available area of wasteland and
bar-ren hills will be 43,981 mu. 68.8% (about 30,262 mu) of which can be reclaimed to grow
grain or oil-producing crops or to support fruit orchards or tea trees.
147.        The plantation development plan calls for upgrading farmland by introducing
new farming methods, improving irrigation and drainage conditions, utilizing more fertilizer
and popularizing high yield seeds. It is estimated that of 425 RMN will be invested per mu,
of that 250 RMB are for irrigation expenses and 175 RMB the cost of fertilizer. As a result,
the annual per-mu grain yield will increase by 100 kg, thus increasing annual net income by
50 RMB.
148.        Reclaiming wasteland to grow grain crops will necessitate an investment of
1475 RMB per mu, of which 200 RMB is for levelling and excavation, 250 RMB for
irrigation, 225 RMB for fertilizer and 800 RMB for land acquisition. The projected ainiual
per mu grain yield will be 500 kg thus raising annual net income by 160 RMB.
149.        These changes are aimed at achieving a rational structure for land use because
that is seen as the primary factor in increasing grain yield and income levels. Systems
engineering is being used to design a coordinated plantation'structure to be established in
steps by i995 and 2000.
150.        According to the plan as described above, 5.69 million RMB will be invested
in upgrading 13,389 mu (864 ha) of farmland to attain a grain yield increase of 1339 tons
and an increase in net income of 0.67 million RMB. A further 22.73 minlion RMB will be
invested in turning 1849 mu (I19 ha) of wasteland into new famland, thus obtaining 925
additional tons of grain and 0.3 million RM.B in additional income. Following the
implementation of the measures descibed, 915 people will be resettled.
53



5.2   Development of Fruit Production
151.        The reservoir area enjoys a temperate climate and favorable soil conditions for
fruit growing. The hills slope gently at less than 25 degrees; the soil pH value is between 5
and 6. In two counties there are fruit production offices staffed with horticulturalists. In the
reservoir area there are 4662.5 mu (301 ha) of firit orchards at a total investment of 13.871
million RMB. On these lands there are currently banana, lichi, longan, tangerine and mango
trees as well lesser amounts of other fSuit trees. Certin areas are designated for grafting.
This can support 3779 resettled farmers.
5.3 Development of Township and Village Enterprises
152.        The development of township and village enterprises is the quickest way of
providing new employment oppormuities and raising income. Based on analysis of the current
situation, it is proposed that 5 million RMB be invested in setting up a cannery and a starch
mill in Guigang City's Qiaoxu County, whose villages will absorb the largest number of
resettled people (2108), and a brick and tile yard in Hengxian County. The caned food plant
would need an investment of 1.5 million RMB. It would employee 120 resettled farmers in
Qiaoxu township and generate a net income of 800,000 RMB. The starch mill would
necessitate an investment of 1.5 million RMB, would also employee 120 rmsettled farmers
and generate a net incomne of 800,000 RMB. The investment in the brick and tile yard would
be 2 million RMB; it would provide employment for 60 resettled farmers and produce a net
income of 400,000 RMB.
5.4   Trainng Program
153.        The policy of encouraging agricultural development through training will be
particularly emphasized in the project area. This is seen as a means of developing the
economy and raising the resettled families' production level and standard of living.
Agronomists will regularly visit the reservoir area to introduce new agricultural production
methods, new skills, and high yield seeds. They will also disseminate information on new
and better methods for use in aquaculture and fruit growing. Training possibilities also
include information on management and the administration of township enterprises. It has
been estimated that training costs will rieed a total investment of 0.9988 million RMB or 200
RMB per resettled person.
6.    COSTS OF COMPENSATION AND RESEITLEMENT
154.        The cost of land acquisition has been calculated according to the "Land
Management Law of the People's Republic of China", the 'Land Management
Implementation Methods of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region', and the 'Regulations on
Land Compensation and Resettlement of Large and Medium Sized Irrigation and Water and
Electricit Projects" issued by the State Council. The land compensation expenses are
calculated at 320.535 million RMN. Table VLa itemizes the acquisition cost for the various
types of land involved. Further, 172-5 square meters of bricke and wooder. houses and 25.4
square meters of storehouses will be demolished. The compensation for these is estimated
at 23,7000 RMB.
155.        The production development plan for the 6 directly affected townships in
Guigang City and the 2 in Hengxian County call for a total investment of 28.2873 million
RMB. Of this 5 million will be used to expand township and village enterprises and 0.9988
million will be*used for the various types of mining discussed above, with the res used for
upgrading and opening farmland as described in Section IV above (see Table Vi.b) This plan
54
!'



to development both flrm5and and agricultural techniques as well as local enterprises allows
projections of income increases above the determined targets for 1995 and 2000.
7.    OTHER FACILMTES AFFECTED BY THE INUNDATION
156.        The Guigang Reservoir inundation will impact on cultural aind historic sites,
communication and transmission lines, water conservation and electric power generating
facilities, and tansport installations. The function of some isllations can be protected but
some necessitate reconstruction.
7.1   Cultural and Htoric Sites
157.        Thirteen cultural relics and historic sites will be directly impacted. One is the
ruins of an ancient city from the period between the Southern and the Qng Dynasties, the
other twelve are neolithic. The Shanjiarikou and Jiaolingcong ruins are near the end of the
dam in an area of about 11200 square meters Some will be flooded, others on the river
banks may collapse. Based on the inventory as listed in Table VIc, it is recommended that
approximately 5500 square meters of area containing cultural and historic relics be unearthed.
The cost estimate for investigation, exploration and excavation is 1.3193 million RM.
7.2   Communication and Transmission Lines
158.        Impact on commim!ication lines is virtally negligible. 0.3 km of town-level
lines will be flooded; of that, 0.25 km is in a protected area, the remaining 0.05 km needs
reinforcement. At a unit price of 1780 RMB per km, this investmnent totals about 900 RMB.
159.        4.32 km of 10kv tansmission line will be inundated; of this, 3.47 km is within
a protected area, leaving only 0.85 kn within the reservoir area but still needing only
reinforcement. The unit price of compensation is 1780 RMB per kIn; total cost is therefore.
approximately 1510 RMB.
7.3   Water Conservation and Electric Power Generating Istlalations
160.        Inundation will affect 3 small hydropower stations with an installed capacity
of 111 kw. At a unit price of 7446-9288 RMB per kw, compensation amounts to about
0.8486 million RMB.
161.        13 electric pumping stations with an installed capacity of 808 kw will also be
impacted. Of these, 3 stations with an installed capacity of 145.5 kw can be protected from
flooding. The remain ten statiomn amounting to 662.5 kw must be reconstructed. At a unit
price of 1279-l8' "er kw of installed capacity, this investment totals about 1.1206 million
RtMB.
162.        A furtier 22 turbinre-pump stations with 42 pumps will be affected by
inundation. Of these, 4 stations with 5 pumps ca i be protected; the remaining 18 must be
reconstructed. At a unit price of 41,355-174,602 RIB per turbine-pump, the total investment
is about 3.9521 million RMB-
163.        The compensation for all forms of water conservation and electric power
generating facilities totals 5.9213 million RMB.
55



7.4   Trasportation I       oissaliations
164.        Ihe reservoir flooding will impact on roads bridges and docks. The affected
facilities and compensation therefore are as follows:
a.    Grade 4 Highways
*     1.5 km in prowectd areas
b.    Simple Country Highways
*     5.12 kan in protected areas
0     25.3 kan must be reconstructed; at a unit price of 180,305 per km
*     the total compensation is 4.5618 RMB
c.    Simpit vuntry Roads
*    4.59 an in protected areas
*     5.21 km must be reconstrUCted; at a unit price of 7420 RMB per km
O    the total compensation is 38,800 RMB.
d.    Bridges
*     16 at a total of 136.2 m in protte areas
*    4 highway bridges (tOtal length 30 m) must be reconstructed. The unit
price is 4252 RMB per meter.
*     19 pedestrian bridges (tomal length 397.9 m) must be reconstructed.
The unit price is 1484 RMB per meter.
*     the total compensation for rebuilding bridges is 1.1609 miion RMB.
e.    To further compensate for inundated docks and bridges and for the loss of
some direct tansport routes, it will be necessary to construct:
-    7 freight docks at a unit price of 296,800 per dock and
-    78 passenger docks at a unit price of 8904 RMB per dock.
*     It is finther necessary to acquire 27 ferry boats at a unit price of 8904
per boat.
*     Total compensation for docks, bridges and routes is 3.012 million
RM B.
165.        Total compensation costs for inundation of the Guigang Reservoir is 114.1758
million RMB. The compensation costs are bioken down in Tables VIl.a and VII.b. The
annua investment plan detailed in Table VII.c demonstrates that the annual investment should
cover the funds required for completing the removals and reconstruction necessary before
flooding. The relevant investment are scheduled between 1994 and 1999. Given the current
economic situation, the annual planned dynamic investment is calculated on the basis of an
inflation of 10% annually.

8.    CONCLUSION
166.        In designing the resettlement and compensation plan, numerous steps were
taken toward reducing the socio-economic impact of the project. Among these were
emphasizmng flood protection measures, thus cutuing land acquisition and the size of the
population needing rettlement. Addition plans to upgrade existing and open new farmland
and to develop local enterprise so as to support maintenance of the resettled population in
their original locality serve to reduce the negative socioeconomic effects. According to the
baseline data, the eight villages and small towns in the reservoir area were in the middle to
upper economnic level in 1990. According to projections, they will be able to reatain this
level follo0ing proJect completion, between 1995 and 2000.
167.        The following measures have been formulated for implementation by the
project proponents:
a.    Emphasize flood protection measures;
b.    Reapportion land, particularly increase the amount of cultivated and
non-cultivated land apportioned to the direty affected villages;
c.    Use part of the reservoir defense fund to help resettled families
develop production;
d.   Guarantee the resettled fanilies a certain amount of electricity at a
preferential price;
e.    Determine a set period during whilch they will not levy the public grain
tax on villages directly impacted by inundation and on families whose
grain fields have been inundated;
f.    Give preference to members of the resetled population when recruiting
workers, cadres, or students, and that they formulate preferential
policies and enforcement measures for reducing taxes, providing loans,
and supporting economic development.
168.        These measures form the basis of the related action plan 'The linplementation
Programme of Land Acquisition, Removal and Immigrant Resettlement in the Reservoir
Inundated Area for the Second Stage Constuction of Guangxi Xijiang IWW Project" (March
8 1994).
