I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a project designed to provide financial and
institutional support to Tunisia's electrical and mechanical industries
(EMIs). The project is a follow-up of a first Tunisia EMI Project 1/ (Loan
2113 TUN) approved in March 1982. The EMI-1 project followed the Bank EMI
Sector Review 2/ carried out in 1979-80, which was instrumental in the
Government's selection of EMIs as a priority subsector for the country's
industrial development. Preparation of the proposed project took advantage of
the work recently completed on the financial sector 3/ and industrial
protection 4/ in Tunisia, and the ongoing work to prepare a package of reforms
of the country's industrial development policy.
1.02     The proposed Bank loan of USt54.0 million would be made to the
Government of Tunisia, which would pass on the loan proceeds as follows:
(i) US$50.0 million to three development banks through subsidiary loans,
for them to finance eligible projects in EMI priority subsectors;
these three banks being:
- Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET), USt2O.0
million;
-  Banque Tuniso-Koweitienne de D&veloppement (BTKD), US$15.0
million; and
-  Societe Tuniso-Seoudienne d'Investissement et de Developpement
(STUSID), USMl5.0 million.
(ii)  US14.0 million as a grant to two non-financial institutions that
provide support to the development of EMIs, namely:
- Centre Technique des Industries MHcaniques et Electriques
(CETIME), US$2.1 million; and
-  Institut National de la Normalisation et de la Propriete
Industrielle (INNORPI), US0l.9 million.

II. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Structure and Performance
2.01     Manufacturing industry in Tunisio has been a relatively fast growing
sector of the economy: in the 1960's, it grew by 7.4Z per annum in real terms
and, in the 1970's, at an average annual rate of 12%. In 1982, economic
performance was poor, essentially as a result of a fall in output of the food
processing industries (due to lower agricultural productions), technical
delays in the operation of some manufacturing plants (notably, in chemicals
and cement), and the general slowdown of the world economy, particularly in
Europe. Growth resumed in 1983 and 1984 with rates of 8.2% and 9.4Z in real
terms, bringing the 1981-1984 average growth rate to 6.8Z.
2.02     During the 1970's, growth of the manufacturing sector was one of the
main sources of GDP growth, which averaged 7.4% per annum in real terms. In
the last four years (1981-1984), GDP growth slowed down to a 3.4% annual
average, in line with the general slowdown in the world economy. Consequently,
the share of the manufacturing sector in GDP increased, from an average of
7.5% in the 1960's to 10.0% in the 1970's and 14.0Z by 1984, as shown in the
following table:

/2 Estimate
2.03     Tunisia's manufacturing sector is well diversified.  Until 1981, food
processing remained the most important subsector, contributing 25.0% to
manufacturing value added. In 1982, textiles became the largest subsector,
mainly because of a fall in agricultural production due to climatic problems.
The fastest growing subsectors in the 1971-1981 period have been construction
materials (18.9% average growth in real terms), chemicals and miscellaneous
industries (14.2%), textiles (14%), and electro-mechanical industries (EMI)
(12.9Z). As a result of these developments, the structure of the
manufacturing sector has substantially evolved since 1971:

2.04     In 1981-84, Tunisia maintained a high investment level of about 30X
of GDP. Investments in manufacturing industry, which constituted 11.7% of
total investments in 1971, kept increasing and reached 22% of total
investments in 1983, as shown below;

/1 Estimate
2.05     The public sector has traditionally been dominant in tne
manufacturing sector. Over the 1980-1984 period, it averaged 56% of total
investments, primarily in chemicals (fertilizers), construction materials
(cement) and agro-industries (sugar). Public sector investments are generally
capital-intensive and have high incremental capital-output ratios (see table
2.4 below, and Annex 1). Whereas 47.9% of total investments in 1980-1984 were
in construction materials and chemicals (the two subsectors where the public
sector is most dominant), the contribution of these subsectors to total



4
manufacturing value added was only 23.3%. In contrast, the two subsectors
where the private sector is dominant (textiles, and miscellaneous industries)
accounted for only 18.7% of total investments during this period, but
contributed 38.2% to total manufacturing value added.

2.06     Employment creation has been one of the main objectives of industrial
policy.  Between 1975 and 1980, over 30% of total new employment (equivalent
to 65,000 jobs) was created in manufacturing industries, and the share of
manufacturing industries in total employment increased from 17.2 to 19.1%.
However, over the 1975-1981 period, the increase in employment in
manufacturing industries, 5% per year on the average, remained well below the
the 10% or so annual increase in capital stock in the sector.  The average
cost (in 1980 prices) of creating a job in the nonagricultural productive
sectors increased from about TD 6,000 in 1972-1976 to TD 10,000 in 1977-1981;
to a large extent, this cost increase reflects the very large investments made
in the chemical and construction industries. More recently, as the rapid
growth in labor supply has been recognized to be a major constraint affecting
Tunisia's future development, the Sixth Plan has set as a priority objective
the allocation of resources towards more labor-intensive activities. So far,
however, employment creation has fallen short of Plan targets (by about 23X in
nonagricultural activities over the 1982-1984 period), primarily because
relative factor prices did not change in favor of labor 1/, and new
investments were less labor-intensive than planned 2/. A major change in wage
and investment policies would be necessary to reach the Plan macroeconomic
targets; specific reforms are proposed in the Bank's recently completed
Employment Study (para. 2.14) and will be submitted to the Government for
discussion in the near future.
1/ On the contrary, the accelerated rise in wages has resulted in a 15%
increase in the relative cost of labor between 1981 and 1983, largely
offsetting the relative decline observed during the previous years.
2/ The share of directly productive, mostly labor-intensive, investments (as
opposed to infrastructure investments for example) increased only
marginally, and within the relatively labor-intensive sectors, actual
investments were more capital-intensive than expected.

2.07     As a result of the greater emphasis given in the early 1970's by the
Government to the development of export-oriented industries (Law 72-38 enacted
in 1972), manufactured exports increased by an average rate of 14.4Z in real
terms from 1971 to 1981 (10.Z between 1976 and 1983), leading to a fourfold
increase in their real value between 197.1 and 1983 (from TD 120.0 million to
TD 526.4 million). This was substantially faster than the increase in
manufacturing value added, which averaged 12X over the 1971-1981 period (8.4X
between 1976 and 1983). At the same time, exports of manufactured products
accounted for an increasing share of total exports; manufactured exports
(excluding processed food) rose from 32% of non-petroleum exports in 1971 to
79.3% in 1983, as shown in the table below:

2.08     In addition, the composition of Tunisia's manufactured exports
changed substantially during the 1970's (see table 2.6 below).  Whereas 52.9%
of all manufactured exports in 1971 consisted of processed food, this share
fell to 13.5% in 1983. On the other hand, the share of textiles and leather
increased from less than 6% in 1971 to almost 40% in 1983. Over the same
period, chemicals nearly doubled their share, to almost one third of
manufactured exports in 1983. Exports of electro-mechanical industries (EMI)
also grew substantially in the second half of the seventies, and now represent
9.5% of total manufactured exports.

Plan Objectives and Strategy
2.09     The main objectives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1982-1986) are (i)
to ease the growing unemployment problem, (ii) to reduce interregional income
disparities, and (iii) to maintain the country's long-term social stability
and creditworthiness, at a time of growing financial and balance of payments
constraints due to the expected decline in petroleum exports. To achieve
these objectives, the Plan calls for a substantial slowdown in the growth of
private consumption, and a reduction of the high investment rate which, in the
last few years, has been increasingly financed through borrowing abroad.
2.10     In the face of declining revenues from hydrocarbon exports, the
Government has decided that industrial diversification is necessary to support
further export growth. Among industries to be promoted are electrical and
mechanical industries, where substantial opportunities for both
import-substitution and exports have been identified and where prospects for
employment creation and reinforcement of existing industrial linkages are the
strongest. Chemicals, construction materials, food processing and textiles
industries are also to be strengthened, and existing capacity rehabilitated.
In addition, substantial investments are planned for further exploration and
development of hydrocarbons (offshore gas), mining, energy substitution and
improvements in energy efficiency. Also, the Government plans to take
appropriate policy measures to promote private investment, particularly in
small- and medium-sized manufacturing facilities away from the coastal area.
Recent Developments
2.11     During the first three years (1982-1984) of the Sixth Plan, the
budgetary and balance of payments position deteriorated sharply; the budget
deficit increased from 2.5Z of GDP in 1981 to 6.9% in 1984, while the current
account deficit rose from 7.6% to 8.8% of GDP. This was due mainly to a
substantial rise in wages (20% in 1982-1983), increases in subsidies (from TD
144 million in 1981 to TD 251 million in 1984) and an increase in the trade
deficit (from TD 654 million in 1981 to TD 980 million in 1984). There is
cause for some concern since the contribution of the petroleum sector to the
economy is declining and future petroleum price movements are unlikely to



-7-
restore the favorable financial position which the country enjoyed during the
last decade. In 1982 the economy stagnated, for three main reasons: a
prolonged drought depressed agricultural output and agro-industry production,
technical problems hampered phosphate-based and cement output, and tourism was
adversely affected by the recession in Europe. In 1983, the economy showed a
modest recovery due to buoyant growth in manufacturing output. This, coupled
with an upturn in agricultural output in 1984, brought the average annual
growth rate to 3.4% for the 1982-1984 period, still well below the Sixth
Plan's projections of 5.7Z p.a. (see Annex 2). Demand continued to expand
rather strongly in 1982-1984, and investment exceeded 30% of GDP compared to
the Plan's target figure of 28Z. At the same time, the growth of consumption
(4.6% p.a.) -- triggered mainly by the wage increases of 1982 and 1983 --
surpassed the growth of GDP (2.4% p.a.), thus reducing the domestic savings
rate from nearly 24Z of GDP in 1981 to 20X in 1983. This trend was reversed
in 1984, however, as consumption grew at a rate slightly lower than GDP (4.9%
versus 5.5%), thus bringing the national savings rate up to 21X. The strong
pressure of demand in 1982 gave rise to an unprecendented high inflation rate
of 13.6%. Following the intensification of price controls, inflation
decelerated to about 9X in 1983, and to an estimated 7Z in 1984.
2.12    Due mainly to the decline in net petroleum earnings and an increase
in imports, the current account deficit of the balance of payments also
deteriorated in 1981-1983; and even more sharply, in 1984. The current
account deficit increased from 7.6% of GDP in 1981 to 9.1% in 1982. In 1983,
following the tightening of import controls, it was reduced to about 7.6Z of
GDP. This favorable trend, however, proved to be shortlived, as the external
deficit worsened in 1984 (reaching 8.8% of GDP), due to disappointing results
in tourism and textile exports and to a further increase in imports. These
emerging external conscraints and Tunisia's increasing debt burden make all
the more important the need to foster export growth, and that of manufactured
products, in particular.
Constraints in the Manufacturing Sector
2.13     A significant part of Tunisian industries have developed with import
restrictions, price controls, investment licensing and direct subsidies.
These measures, which were justified for infant industries, have developed
over time into a system that does not encourage efficiency, productivity, nor
optimal use of installed capacity. This is shown by the results of an
Effective Protection Study financed by the Bank under the EHI-I Project (Loan
2113-TUN); the results pertaining to the EMIs indicate that industries with
the highest level of protection have limited abilities to export, serve
primarily the domestic market, and have the lowest economic and financial
rates of return. The same study also shows that public enterprises have
generally benefitted from the highest levels of protection, while showing the
lowest rates of return:

The Effective Protection Study is being carried out for several other sectors
as weLl (textiles, construction materials, footwear, chemicals), and further
results have become available in December 1984 (para. 3.24). As is
illustrated in the first results, domestic-oriented industries are
significantly Less efficient than export-oriented ones. A rationalization of
the protection system is thus likely to be an important policy tool for
further encouraging the efficiency of the sector and the growth of exports.
The whole issue of the protection system is now under study (para. 2.18), and
an action plan to improve this overall system is expected to be formulated in
1985-1986.
2.14     There are ither reasons that account for the low productivity of
Tunisian industries. First, the small size of the domestic market has meant
that for most industries with Limited (if any) export orientation, economies
of scale could not be realized; whenever possible, a reorientation of some of
these industries towards exports should help overcome some of the above
constraints. Second, managemaent problems and tue current wage system hamper
the functioning and expansion of existing enterprises. The virtual absence of
sound national labor management relations have resulted in frequent individual
and collective conflicts, and rising absenteeism. The current wage structure,
which strongly favors unskilled labor (in excess supply) while disadvantaging
workers at the supervision level (in short supply), creates little incentive
for workers to increase their level of skills; furthermore, opportunities for
continuous training within the enterprise are rarely provided for. Finally,



-9-
little has been done so far to relate wages to producrion norms, and wage
adjustments to productivity gains. While the lack of performance incentives
has had a negative impact on labor morale and productivity, the prevailing
system favoring seniority, has left enterprises with little flexibility to
apply promotion criteria based on merit. At the same time, the virtual
absence in Tunisian enterprises of national labor management procedures has
also been responsible for the lack of relationship between wages and the
individual and/or collective prodictive performance. The above-mentioned
Employment Study (para. 2.06) has identified a number of corrective measures,
aiming at: (i) improving the quality of enterprise management; (ii) restoring
a more balanced wage structure according to prevailing relative scarcities;
(iii) bimplifying and partially liberalizing wage negotiations and adjustment
procedures; and (iv) increasing the flexibility of wage structures, so as to
strengthen their role in manpower allocation.
Bank Role in the Manufacturing Sector
2.15     The dialogue between the Government of Tunisia and the Bank on
industrial development, is of long standing and has kept evolving over time.
It always endeavored to address the major constraints on this development and
has been a multifaceted and productive one. Tnrough its first loans to
industry, the Bank aimed at providing general support to industrial develop-
ment; later on, it aimed at promoting industrial decentralization and labor-
intensive industries, and financing high priority industries (e.g., EMIs and
SSIs) in support of their priority in the Government's strategy. Bank support
to industrial development in Tunisia has consisted mostly of lines of credit
to BDET (para. 5.17), which has now received eight Bank loans totalling
US$129.2 million (net of cancellations) of which US$14.9 million remained
undisbursed as of January 31, 1985. Most of these funds financed manufac-
turing industries; first through unrestricted lines of credit (Loan 1504-TUN,
and part of Loan 2113-TUN), then through lines with special foci: on Small-
Scale Industries (SSIs, Loans 1505-TUN and 1969-TUN), EMIs (Loan 2113-TUN;
paras. 3.23-3.25) and Export Industries (loan approved in April 1985). A
credit line for a pilot SSI scheme (Loan 1505-TUN in 1978) prepared the ground
for a US$30 million loan to SSIs (Loan 1969-TUN in 1981) that used for the
first time commercial banks along with BDET as intermediaries.
2.16     Bank loans have also assisted BDET in meeting its resource
requirements while helping strengthen its organization and improve its
performance. Through its representative on BDET's Board, IFC has offered a
substantial contribution in this regard. The Project Performance Audit Report
of September 1981 on loans 648-TUN, 798-TUN and 881-TUN, covering the third
(1969), fourth (1972) and fifth (1973) loans to BDET, concluded that
considerable progress had been made in terms of institution building and
management performance, and that these loans had contributed to changing
BDET's role from that of a supplier of equity funds for public sector
industries, to that of financier and advisor of private investors. BDET,
however, still needed to strengthen its promotion and supervision capacity,
and to improve its evaluation of physical and financial contingencies of
projects. The present project, along with the Export Industries Project,
would build upon the last three projecLS to continue addressing the
shortcomings noted in the 1981 Project Performance Audit Report.



- 10 -
2.17     In addition to the lines of credit provided to BDET, four loans were
made directly to industrial enterprises in Tunisia: the first was in July
1974 (Loan 1042-TUN) to the Gafsa Phosphate Mining Company, to introduce
advance mining technology. It was followed in August 1983, by a technical
assistance loan for the mining sector (Loan 2346-TUN). A loan to SOGITEX in
October 1981 (Loan 2012-TUN) aimed at rehabilitating the textile industry.
Finally, a foundry project (Loan 2301-TUN) was approved in June 1983 to
modernize and expand a large foundry, SOFOMECA, which should help improve the
integration of the EMI sector in Tunisia. In 1982 the Bank made a loan to the
Government which included a component to develop and promote new industrial
projects (Loan 2197-TUN). The two main agencies involved were CEPEX (to study
export promotion) and CNEI (to study specific subsectors and their potential
for growth).
2.18     Reference was made earlier (para. 2.13) to a study financed by the
Bank to assess effective protection and its impact on industrial efficiency.
The results of this study will be used by the Bank in its continuing dialogue
with the Tunisian authorities, the objecti-es of which are the identification
and eventual adoption of policies conducive to higher industrial efficiency.
In this connection, a Bank mission was in Tunisia in January 1985, to design
and submit recommendations on Ci) reducing tariffs and quantitative
restrictions, (ii) improving pricing policies, and (iii) fostering higher
productivity and efficiency in public enterprises. The mission has made use
of the results of the Employment Study and of the Financial Sector review
which was completed in December 1984 and is scheduled for discussion with the
Tunisian authorities in mid-1985 (para. 4.11).

III. THE ELECTRO-MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES (EMIs)
Structure, Characteristics and Performance
3.01     The development of electro-mechanical industries (EMI) is an
essential stage in a country's industrialization process, as these industries
include the working and shaping of metals, involve the design, development and
fabrication of a great variety of man-made products and constitute an
essential link between the production of components/subassemblies and that of
end-products. Compared to other industrial subsectors, EMIs in Tunisia still
have a substantial untapped potential. In recent years they increasingly
aimed at foreign markets (para. 3.05), but remained mostly inward-oriented.
In 1984 they represented 14% of industrial value added and 2.2% of GDP, as
compared to 13% and 1.8% respectively in 1980. The development of the sector
has taken place primarily in import-substituting assembly industries producing
consumer and durable goods and relying to a large extent on imported
components. As a consequence, the value added in the sector has remained low,
at about 25% on the average, as shown in the table below;

3.02     The modern EMI sector is dominated by about 18 large public
enterprises 1/ (steel mill, foundries, ship repair, vehicle assembly,
household appliances and mechanical hardware), which account for more than
half of the sector's output; overall, however, it comprises a large proportion
of small or medium size industries 2/, with the majority of enterprises.
engaged in steel structure/platework, metal products and other intermediate
goods. In addition to the modern sector, the EMIs comprise an estimated 5,000
independent artisans, mostly involved in the production of traditional or
substandard metal products for household consumption.
3.03     EMIs in Tunisia have started from a small base and grown rapidly at
an average annual rate of 18Z during the 1960s and 13X during the L970s.
Between 1980 (when the Government had not yet selected ENIs as a priority
sector) and 1984 this rate fell to just below 10% p.a., essentially as a
result of a marked slowdown in both Tunisia's and the world's economic growth;
yet it compared very favorably with GDP and overall manufacturing growth which
averaged 4.0% and 7.9% p.a. respectively, as shown in the table below:

- 13 -
Thus, as a result of the general slump in economic growth, EMI performance in
the first three years-of the Sixth Plan (1982-1986) has fallen short of
expec:ations; growth in value added was 8.8% p.a. on average, against a target
rate of 13.6%. With the exception of lead foundries and lead products (which
experienced a decrease in output), all EMI subsectors substantially expanded.
Consistent with the priorities set in the Sixth Plan, the fastest-growing
subsectors were those of capital and intermediate goods, including both
mechanical (earth-moving machinery, lifting and hoisting equipment,
agricultural equipment) and electrical equipment (meters, electric cables).
By their rapid development EMIs have contributed to alleviate Tunisia's
employment problem; since 1980, 15,900 new jobs have been created in the
sector, i.e., more than 19% of all jobs created in manufacturing.
3.04     In recent years, the growing demand for EMI products has been
increasingly met by local production, which accounted for about 32% of total
EMI consumption in 1983, as compared to an estimated 25Z in 1978 (para. 3.06).
Yet EMI imports still represent a significant share of total imports; 39Z in
1983 (TD 822 million). Capital goods make up the largest fraction of EMI
imports (about 66% in 1983) and mainly comprise advanced equipment (e.g.,
machine tools, telephone equipment) and standard machinery (e,g.,
lifting/hoisting and earth-moving machinery, pumps, mining and drilling
equipment, boilers and furnaces, electrical switchgear/switchboard equipment,
etc.), part of which is slowly being replaced by local products (para. 3.08).
Imports of intermediate goods (18% of all EMI imports) consist essentially of
iron and steel primary products. Imports of consumer and durable goods (16%
of EMI imports) mainly comprise household appliances, hardware, transport
vehicles, and components and parts for the automobile and radio/TV local
assemblies.
3.05     The development of the sector has also been accompanied by an
increase in exports, which averaged 19.8% p.a. in real terms over the
1976-1983 period, compared to 13.6% for manufactured exports. As a result,
EMI exports, of which 60% are electrical machinery and electronic products,
accounted for about 10% of Tunisia's exports of manufactured products in 1983
compared to 6.52 in 1976 aud take up an increasing share of the sector's
output -- 16% in 1983 versus 11% in 1976. Less than half of EM¢ exports
originate from foreign firms operating on an "offshore" basis under Law
1972-38 that manufacture electrical equipment and assemble electronic
products, measuring instruments, and radio/TV sets.
Subsectoral Patterns
3.06     EMIs in Tunisia comprise production in all three conventional
groups: (i) consumer and durable goods; (ii) capital goods; and (iii)
intermediate components and subassemblies. The share of each group in the
sector's production, domestic demand and foreign trade is shown in the table
below:

3.07     Consumer and durable goods (hardware, metal products, household
appliances and radio/TV sets, furniture, private cars) account for about 30Z
of total EMI output in Tunisia and meet about 43% of the domestic demand.
Most of these industries are capital-intensive, involve the assembly of
imported inputs and are little integrated with the rest of the sector; their
output therefore has a relatively low value added content (ranging from 15 to
25%) 1/. This has resulted in uncompetitive prices, and made it necessary to
protect these industries by substantial import duties; e.g., 50-70X on
household appliances and about 140% on automobile (nominal rates). The low
efficiency and productivity of these EMIs stem from weaknesses in the
organization and management of plants as well as from the excessive
diversification of product mix and the fragmentation of the small domestic
market, which have seriously hampered the integration of local parts and
components. The Government is seeking to increase the integration of these
EMIs and their value added content, and has engaged in the promotion of EMIs
producing intermediate goods, such as foundry castings (para. 3.08).
3.08     Intermediate goods (10,000 tons of foundry castings in 1984, about
170,000 tons of construction rods, wires, pipes and parts) account for 30X of
total EMI output and meet about 40% of the domestic demand for these
products. Compared to the consumer/durable goods industries, the tPchnoiogies
used in the production of intermediate goods rely less on imported inputs and
more on local products, resulting in a higher value-added content (about
40-50% of output) and in lower tax and duty related charges. Furthermore,
because of the relatively moderate effective protection given to these
industries (about 30-50%), they have been encouraged to select appropriate
technologies, operate in a relatively efficient manner and maintain their
prices at levels competitive with those of foreign products. However, the
foundry subsector, which should be a backbone for the development of EMIs, has
remained underdeveloped and weakly integrated within the whole EMI sector.
Tunisian foundries produce at competitive prices and in small series, low
grade castings of iron and steel, for varied uses on the domestic market.
However, they have not been able to upgrade the quality of their production.
1/ Essentially because their contribution to final products consists
primarily of labor, the cost of which is considerably lower than
ready-to-assemble imported inputs.



- 15 -
A 1982 Bank foundry subsector study recommended measures to raise
productivity, improve quality and enhance sectoral integration. These
measures are now being implemented by the Government and supported through
Loan 2301 of 1983, financing the modernization and expansion of SOFOMECA, one
of the two major suppliers of foundry castings in Tunisia.
3.09     Capital goods have experienced the fastest growth in the EMI sector
since 1980 (16.2% p.a. on the average, compared to 9.8% for all EMIs), and
account now for 40% of the sector's output. Although their contribution to
meeting local demand practically doubled over the past six years, it remains
low, at about 20Z. Capital goods comprise mainly an important steel structure
and platevork subsector (76,000 tons in 1984), a ship repair yard, a truck and
bus assembly plant, diesel engine assemblies, and efficient industries
producing basic electrical equipment (transformers, meters, cables, electric
motors) and agricultural implements. Recently, new lines of production have
been established to fill a long-standing gap in the structure of Tunisia's
EMIs: non electrical machinery, hoisting/lifting and earth-moving equipment
and agricultural machinery. The technologies used are labor-intensive and
involve a relatively high proportion of local inputs (value added represents
35% - 45% of output value). In general, these industries have been able to
maintain prices competitive with those of foreign products, induced to do so
by a very low effective protection (with rates lower than 50% on the average,
as compared to rates higher than 100% for consumer goods). Their
competitiveness stems essentially from the moderate cost of labor which
offsets the fiscal charges on inputs and the lower productivity of labor
(about half that in Europe).
Market Prospects and Development Strategy
3.10     Tunisia's comparative advantage in the EMI sector lies essentially in
(i) its labor force with still relatively low wages (despite the 1982-1983
increases) and increasing productivity (although substantial efforts remain to
be made; para. 2.14); (ii) its preferential access to the EEC market although
this is being progressively eroded; (iii) its proximity to the Middle East and
sub-Saharan Africa; and (iv) an investment code favorable to foreign
investment. Any strategy for the development of EMIs, however, must take
account of the small size of the domestic market of about 7 million
inhabitants, and the necessity in a number of production lines to complement
import-substitution with exports, to ensure an economically efficient scale of
production.
3.11     The recent evolution of EMIs in Tunisia has been accompanied by
substantial improvements to the structure and operation of these industries
and confirmed the sector's growth potential and priority it received in the
Sixth Plan (1982-1986). In line with the Plan's objectives (para. 2.10), and
in the light of domestic and external demand and the country's comparative
advantages in EMIs, Tunisia should focus on increasing the local value added
content of its output and therefore concentrate on the following two
priorities for the development of the sector:



- 16 -
(a)  further import substitution of selected capital and intermediate
goods relying on labor-intensive and relatively simple technologies.
This concerns primarily goods for which the domestic market is large
enough to sustain economic operations and those which can achieve a
high degree of sectoral integration and thus encourage labor-
intensive subcontracting ventures. These include: (i) the foundry
subsector, where present and future production capacities 1I/ are
insufficient to meet domestic demand, in terms of both quantity and
quality. Despite the constraint set by the economies of scale
required to justify the production of specific castings, the success
achieved so far by newly created private foundries, with small but
specialized productions of high quality castings, warrant support for
further expansion of the subsector; (ii) the steel and platework
subsector (industrial boilers, furnaces, pressure vessels, lifting
and hoisting equipment, and products such as metal furniture); and
(iii) selected mechanical works such as small earth-moving and
construction machinery and nonautomotive agricultural machinery
(ploughs, harvesters, pumps), where local production -- very recent
in some instances -- meets only a small portion of domestic demand
and therefore has potential for further expansion; and
(b)  production of capital and intermediate goods with a clear export
potential, where a high level of productivity has alr^ady been
achieved locally, but where the above potential has been only
partially tapped due to production capacity constraints 2/.
Priority should be given to producing those particular products where
Tunisia's comparative advantage is strongest (e.g., higher level of
labor intensity), rather than diversifying production too much in an
attempt to meet the entire domestic demand to the detriment of export
markets. This group would include in particular electrical machinery
-- such as motors, transformers and electric meters, water-heaters,
switchboards/gears, cables, etc. -- the production of which meets
only 30-35% of local demand and where exports represent a large share
of total production.
Investment and Pipeline
3.12     Reflecting the priority given by the Government to the development of
EMIs, the volume of investments allocated to this sector by the Sixth Plan is
nearly twice that earmarked in the Fifth Plan (1977-1981); investment outlays
in the sector would amount to TD 385 million, representing 24% of total
projected manufacturing investment, compared to 13% during the Fifth Plan. If
achieved, this program would accelerate the growth of EMI value-added from
13.3% p.a. under the Fifth Plan to 15.4% p.a. under the Sixth. Given that the
manufacturing sector and GDP are projected to grow at rates of 10.5% and 6.0%
1/ Taking account of the modernization and extension of SOFOHECA, currently
underway.
2/ The fact that one of the first three export trading companies established
in 1984 (the privately-owned S.I.C.A.M.E.) specializes in the export of
EMI goods confirms the existence of a large export potential for the
sector.



- 17 -
p.e. respectively, the EMI sector would thus assume an increasing importance
in the development of Tunisian industry. The Plan projects that by 1986, the
sector would represent about 17.4Z of manufacturing value added and 3.31 of
GDP, thereby bringing the structure of Tunisia's manufacturing sector closer
to that of countries of similar size and level of development 1/.
3.13     Out of the TD 385 million planned investment, basic metals represents
TD 66 million (17Z), mechanical industries TD 181 million (471), steel
structure and platework TD 76 million (20X), and electrical and electronic
products TD 41 million (11). This sectoral allocation reflects a sound
development strategy of concentrating on the production of capital and
intermediate goods and a shifting away from consumer and durable goods.
3.14     So far, implementation of planned investments has only slightly
fallen short of targets. In comparison to TD 198 million of projected outlays
for the 1982-1984 period, actual investments have amounted to TD 178.3
million, representing about 18X of manufacturing investment against a targeted
221. This results from higher total investment outlays in manufacturing (due
to cost overruns in the construction materials and chemicals subsectors) and
from delays in the implementation of particular projects in the EMI sector
(e.g., vehicle assembly and electronic components projects). The actual
allocation of investments among EHI subsectors over the last three years has
substantially conformed to the Plan's objectives except for mechanical
industries whose share was only 391 compared to a projected 471 of total EMI
investments.
3.15     EMI investments planned for 1985 amount to a total of TD 106 million,
of which TD 84 million concern projects already under implementation (e.g.,
extension/modernization of SOFONECA, renewal of equipment at the El Fouledh
steel mill, vehicle assembly and components), with the remaining TD 22 million
covering new projects, mainly in basic ontals (e.g., steel wires and metal
rolling) and mechanical industries (vehicle assembly and components, and
diesel engines) (Annex 3). Investments approved by Agence de Promotion des
Investissements (API) for 1986 and beyond total about TD 145 million; given
the average implementation rate (about 601) of EMI projects approved by API,
investment outlays over the 1986-1987 period can be expected to be at least TD
80-85 million. Thus, the Plan's investment targets are likely to be met.
Approved investments (Annex 3) concentrate on capital and intermediate goods
and are mainly in the steel structure/platework subsector (e.g., refrigerating
and air-conditioning equipment, radiators, fire-extinguishers, industrial
ovens, metallic barrels, tanks and cisterns), mechanical industries (e.g.,
pumps, mining and lifting equipment, agricultural machinery and mechanical
parts), and electrical industries (e.g., electric motors, batteries,
transformers, meters, switches and control panels, telephone equipment).
Sectoral Constraints and Issues
3.16     Like most other manufacturing activities in Tunisia, the EXI sector
operates within a highly controlled economic environment, characterized by a
restrictive system of import licenses, high and increasing tariff duties and a
1/ See Tunisia - Review of the Electrizal and Mechanical Industries, Report
No. 2666-TUN.



- 18 -
combination of price control mechanisms, investment laws and approval
criteria, which strongly discourage domestic competition. As a consequence,
the limited role played by the market has given rise to a number of economic
distortions which hamper the efficient development of the manufacturing sector
in general, and the EMIs in particular. These distortions are essentially
biases against (i) specialization of firms and intrasectoral integration
(para. 3.17); (ii) labor-intensive investments (para. 3.18); (iii) exports
(para. 3.19); and (iv) production of capital and intermediate goods
(para. 3.20).
3.17     The investment code (Laws 69-35 and 74-74 revised by Law 81-56)
establishes a number of incentives aimed at increasing investments in
manufacturing and fostering regional decentralization. These incentives
clearly favor the creation of new production units rather than the improvement
of existing facilities. Hence, manufacturing enterprises tend to create
separate, seemingly independent companies for each production stage, rather
than extend and/or modernize their existing production lines and specialize in
a limited number of goods. These incentives, while hampering sectoral
integration, provide little encouragement to productivity increases,
innovation and competition. This explains to a large extent the low level of
productivity of Tunisian EMIs, reinforced as it is by the pricing regulation
mechanism. Since prices are administered by the Government on a cost-plus
basis, enterprises are encouraged to increase their profits 1/ by artificially
inflating their direct production costs rather than by striving at cutting
costs and increasing productivity. This, in turn, is made possible by the
protection enjoyed by Tunisian manufacturers against foreign competition
since, as a-rule, imports are severely restricted as soon as a good is
produced in Tunisia. 2/. The Bank is currently reviewing these distortions
and appropriate remedies with the Government (para. 3.21).
3.18     By favoring the creation of new capital-intensive units, the existing
system of investment incentives fails to encourage labor-intensive
investments, even though many problems affecting the manufacturing industries
stem from deficiencies in technical and administrative performance. There are
no incentives for upgrading the quality of labor and of supervisory and
professional staff.  Thus, the "pro-capital" bias of the investment code
discourages expansion and modernization of the labor-intensive activities
where Tunisia is likely to have a comparative advantage. Moreover, the system
of effective protection (para. 3.20), through sheltering the production of
consumer durables and vehicles still at an early stage of integration,
encourages production of goods which create few jobs but drain rare,
subsidized capital resources away from other projects more likely to create
badly needed jobs.
lJ Margins are calculated as a fixed percentage of production costs.
2/ The importation of a particular good is allowed only if it is to be used
directly by manufacturers as input to their production process and is then
subject to the issuance of an "import certificate". The purpose of these
certificates is principally to monitor the use of foreign exchange; they
are issued by commercial banks under delegation from the Central Bank.
The importation of the same good by a nonproducer (trader) for the purpose
of reselling it on the local market is prohibited.



- 19 -
3.19     Despite recent improvements, partly brought about by the first EMI
project (para. 3.24), the incentive system remains biased against exports. By
providing that firms exporting more than 10% of their output were exempted
from income taxes for six years instead of five years for nonexporters, the
old investment codes (Laws 69-35 and 74-74) did not particularly encourage
exports. Although the new investment code (Law 81-56) makes the export
incentives proportional to the percentage of output exported, firms
established under any of the older investment codes have not automatically
become eligible to these export-related benefits; furthermore the
administrative procedures required to give them access to these benefits are
very cumbersome. The existing system of custom (tariffs and import licensing)
and fiscal protection is biased in favor of production for the domestic market
and against exporting. Most exports suffer from active discrimination: their
nominal protection is close to zero (in fact, in most cases, slightly
negative, due to "taxe de formalites douanieres"). Furthermore, complex and
often uncoordinated administrative procedures hinder export activities. In
the case of imported inputs, the duty-drawback system (introduced in 1983) and
other exemption programs do not always allow a complete recovery of duties and
taxes paid on directly imported inputs. The Government has become aware that
the administrative procedures require simplification, harmonization and
general improvement in their application to ensure that they do not stand in
the way of expanding exports. The Tunisian authorities are currently
preparing a pla-n of action on the simplification of administrative
procedures. As part of the Export Industries Project, approved in ApriL 1985,
the Bank would monitor the implementation of such plan.
3.20     Owing to budgetary problems, the general level of tariff duties has
been increased several times since 1980.  Simultaneously, there have been
several product-specific modifications of the tariff which have somewhat
reduced the most striking distortions and have resulted in a marginally lower
average tariff duty rate for the most protected consumer durable products.
However, since imports of these items have remained mostly prohibited, the
slight decline of some tariff rates has had little influence (if any) on
productive efficiency and pricing of the heavily protected goods. Moreover,
the relative levels of effective protection indicate that the production of
capital and intermediate goods continues to be disadvantaged comparatively to
the assembly of consumer and durable goods (para. 3.08). The direct effect of
this discrimination is to drain resources away from the production of priority
goods, towards less efficient activities, as confirmed by the economic and
financial rates of return mentioned in para. 2.13.
3.21     The restructuring of the system of economic incentives cannot be
limited to a single subsector (EMI or other), and must be integrated in the
overall reform of the industrial sector, which is currently under review by
the Bank's Industrial Policy mission of January 1985. The proposed EMI-2 loan
aims at updating and expanding the measures agreed under the EMI-1 loan. In
addition to the condition that subprojects should involve priority goods (as
defined in para. 3.11) for which customs tariffs do not exceed 18% 1/, the
EMI-2 project proposes to gradually phase out quantitative restrictions: only
11 Or 21% in the case of steel structurelplatework. This 21% duty aims at
protecting the local production of metallic frames for doors and windows,
which is regrouped with large steel structures in a single customs item.



- 20 -
tariff protection will be allowed for new EMI goods l/ financed under the
proposed loan, up to the maximum 18Z level agreed upon under the first EMI
loan 2/. The new products will be placed under the liberal system of import
certificates (para 3.17). In exceptional cases, however, justified on an
individual basis by a development bank in consultation with the Bank, the
Government may grant additional protection, for a period not exceeding five
years starting from the date of first production of such goods. Detailed
information on protection arrangements for each subproject output will be
provided in the appraisal reports to be submitted by the development banks to
the Bank for approval of individual subprojects. These policy measures were
agreed upon with the Government (Loan Agreement, Section 4.07). In addition,
the Government indicated during negotiations its intention to extend such
measures to all new products manufactured by projects financed from sources
other than the proposed loan.
3.22     The above measures build upon the objectives of the first EHI project
pending broader and more fundamental reforms that need to be initiated within
the framework of the industrial sector as a whole. The Government has agreed
to discuss with the Bank measures geared to enhancing the efficient
development of the industrial sector as a whole, following completion by the
Bank of the studies recently undertaken in the industrial and financial
sectors (para. 2.18).
Bank Role in the EMI Sector
3.23     Bank involvement in the EMI sector originated in 1979-1980 when
sector work was carried out in close collaboration with the Government of
Tunisia 3/. The report established that EMIs had considerable potential for
growth but were still relatively underdeveloped and that Tunisia had not yet
realized its comparative advantage in this sector. This assessment led the
Government to select EMIs as the priority subsector for industrial development
under the new Five-Year Plan (paras. 2.10 and 3.11). A first Bank-financed
EMI project was approved in March 1982 (Loan 2113-TUN) and became effective in
December 1982; it was designed to help: (i) provide financing, through BDET,
for EMI development; (ii) set a sound incentive framework for promoting this
development; and (iii) establish technical assistance agencies to facilitate
and strengthen the growth of the country's EMIs. It included: (i) a US$28.0
million credit line to BDET for lending to EMI priority subsectors (US$14.0
milliLon) and to other industrial projects (US$14.0 million); and tii) a US$2.0
million loan to the Government for creating an EMI technical center (CETIME)
and a standardization/quality control institute (INNORPI), and for carrying
out an effective protection study.
3.24     The implementation of the EMI-l loan has been satisfactory,
particularly its institution-building component. The funds available to BDET
under the project's line of credit (US$28 million) should be fully committed
by June/July 1985. The promotion priorities set for the EMI component of the
project, i.e., intermediate and capital goods as opposed to consumer goods,

-21-
have been effectively complied with. As of January 31, 1985, eight EKI
subprojects had been approved by the Bank and involved metallic construction
(leaf springs, steel and aluminum pipes, insulated vehicular containers,
wheels), mechanical equipment (vehicle engines for export, wood-working
machinery), and electrical equipment (transformers and water-heaters,
accessories to electric lines). To reduce the discrepancy between the high
exposure of these priority goods under this project and the overprotection of
consumer goods, as well as to ensure competitivity of the subprojects
involved, custom tariffs on priority goods were uniformly limited to a maximu
of 18%; with the exception of steel structure and platework, for which the
agreed upon maximum rate was set at 21Z. Similarly, the two new technical
assistance agencies, central to assisting and fostering improvements in local
EMIs, were promptly created, and are now effectively functioning. CETINE has
been providing technical assistance and guidance to an increasing number of
industrialists and now needs to expand its services and diversify the
subsectors where it can provide assistance (paras. 5.51 and 6.19); INNORPI,
has set more than 800 technical standards and is soon to start delivering
"certification" on locally produced goods that meet these standards, which
should encourage subsectoral integration in the country as well as foster
exports (paras. 5.55 and 6.23). After more than a one-year delay in its
inception (due to the gradual transfer of responsibility from Institut
d'economie quantitative (Ali Bach Hamba) to Centre national d'dtudes
industrielles (CNEI)), the effective protection study has proceeded
satisfactorily but at a somewhat slower pace than originally anticipated
(para. 2.13). This study was presented by the Institute to the Government and
to the Bank in December 1984. Its results will be used in the overall
industrial policy dialogue initiated between the Government and the Bank and
aimed at improving trade and incentive policies (para. 3.21).
3.25     It appears that the new tariffs agreed upon under the EMI-1 project
did not deter investors, since commitment of the line of credit was achieved
nearly within the time foreseen, despite some delay in loan effectiveness and
the overall slowdown of activity resulting from general sluggishness in the
economy. The project was instrumental in helping the Government realize that
there was a substantial need to adjust its protection policy; in particular,
to abate biases in favor of consumer goods, and to reduce distortions in
effective protection. As a result, custom duties have already been reduced on
a number of goods not covered under ENI-1 (e.g., on household appliances and
automobiles, from 70-10OZ and about 200%, down to 50-70% and about 140Z,
respectively). Furthermore, as a result of the dialogue between the
Government and the Bank on the development of EMIs initiated during the
preparation of the EMI sector study in early 1979 and pursued in the context
of the effective protection study and the review of subprojects under EMI-l,
the Tunisian authorities and, in particular, the development banks have become
increasingly aware of the need to only finance EMIs producing consumer/durables
that have high local value added content; indeed some of the development banks
have become increasingly reluctant to finance projects with marginal economic
viability. At the same time, more needs to be done in the area of
policy-related measures (paras. 3.15-3.21); this would be tackled in part
under the proposed EMI-2 project, and more broadly and comprehensively under
the industrial policy discussions to be initiated with the Tunisian
authorities during 1985.

IV. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND ITS ROLE IN EMI DEVELOPMENT
Overview
4.01     Tunisia's financial system consists of the monetary system, other
financial institutions, and the stocks and bonds exchange. The monetary
system consists of the Central Bank, ten commercial banks and the postal check
system. The other financial institutions consist of eight operating
development banks, two savings organizations, eight portfolio management
companies, twelve off-shore banks and five foreign bank representative
offices. For the size of the country (7 million inhabitants) and its level of
development, this is a rather large institutional framework. The stocks and
bonds exchange is not highly developed, and essentially invnlv!s th' trade of
ten-year Government issued or guaranteed bonds and of shares of 44 _ompanies;
nine of these companies are banks. The Government is a shareholder in 39 of
the 44 companies, and the majority owner in 26.
4.02     Commercial Banks. The commercial banks are essentially
deposit-retail banks. They are small by international standards; as of August
31, 1984, the assets of all commercial banks combined amounted to TD 3.1
billion 1/ (US$3.7 billion). Besides short-term credits, commercial banks can
provide medium-term loans up to a maximum of seven years, within limits set by
the Central Bank. Loans over seven years can also be provided by commercial
banks, but only from special resources (i.e. non-deposits) with a maturity of
more than seven years. However, credits over seven years from regular
commercial bank resources can he extended to public enterprises only, but
these credits should not exceed 3% of total deposits of the bank concerned.
4.03     The commercial banks are subject to the monetary policy edicted by
the Central Bank, and its credit controls; in particular, the requirement that
commercial banks invest 43% of their deposits and savings accounts in
Government paper (20%), National Home Savings and Loan Company (CNEL) bonds
(5%), and mediur-term loans to industry (18%). This requirement has made
commercial banks an important source of mediumr-term financing for industry.
4.04     Development Banks.  Up to 1980, there were only two development
banks: Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) and Banque
Nationale de Developpement Touristique (BNDT), specialized in medium- and
long-term (MLT) financing of industry and tourism respectively. Over the
1981-1983 period, another six development banks were created; of these four
were joint-ventures between Tunisia and other Arab countries: the
Tuniso-Koweiti Development Bank (BTKD), the Tuniso-Saudi Investment and
Development Company (STUSID), the Tunisian and Emirates Investment Bank
(BTEI), and the Tuniso-Qatari Investment Bank (BTQI). The other two were
Banque Nationale de D6veloppement Agricole, which only finances projects in
the agricultural sector, and Banque de Cooperation du Maghreb Arabe, which
only finances Tuniso-Algerian ventures. A main reason for their creation was
to attract capital resources from abroad, and channel them into productive
uses on the basis of sound financial, economic and technical criteria. More
recently (1984), another four development banks were created in association
1/ Central Bank's financial statistics report.



- 23 -
with Bahrain, Italy, Libya and Senegal; again, with the primary objective of
mobilizing foreign funds to finance development projects in Tunisia. In
comparison with commercial banks, the newly created development banks have
relatively large share capitals (e.g.,. BTKD and STUSID, TD 100 million each;
BTEI, TD 50 million; BTQI, TD 70 million) subscribed equally by Tunisia and
each of the Arab States involved.
4.05     Interest Rates.  Tunisia has a very detailed structure of interest
rates, which the Central Bank determines. This structure includes all the
discount rates of the Central Bank for short- and mediuar-term paper; these
rates vary with the sector (industry, agriculture, housing, tourism etc.) and
the purpose (construction, seasonal credit, mediumr- and small-size industry,
exports etc.). Interest rates on commercial bank loans are also fixed, and
their levels depend on (i) whether the loan is rediscountable or not, and the
rate of discount, (ii) the maturity of the loan, (iii) the sector, and (iv)
the purpose. For long-term loans, which are offered by development banks
only, interest rates are set by the banks themselves. In early December 1984,
these rates were 12-13%; however, BDET could not charge more than 10.5% on
loans below TD 500,000 1/, to remain competitive with mediumrterm loans
offered by commercial banks. Rates of 12-13% on mediumr and long-term (MLT)
credit compare favorably with annual inflation rates of about 9Z in 1984, and
1OZ anticipated in 1985 and 1986, and 9Z in 1987 and 1988. Spreads are larger
than apparent, because interest is paid six months in advance, and accompanied
by a commitment fee and by commissions; thus 12% and 13% interest rates are
equivalent for the borrower to effective rates of 14.9% and 16.3%
respectively. Local rates, therefore, are quite positive in real terms and
are expected to remain so over the life of individual loans.
4.06     Interest rates on deposits (both sight and term) and savings accounts
are also fixed by the Central Bank with different rates, depending on maturity
(longer maturities having higher rates), nature of the saver (individual or
corporation), size of the deposit (small savers have special rates), and
purpose (e.g., savings for housing). As of April 1985, rates on special
savings accounts range from 6.5% to 9.75% p.a.; rates on certificates of
deposit and long-term accounts range from 5.5% to 10.5% p.a. Compared to
inflation, these rates are marginally positive in real terms.
4.07     PeriodicalLy, the Central Bank revises the general level of the
interest rate structure. The last such adjustment took place in April 1985
when interest rates were increased by about 1.5% on average; this increase was
in response to the general rise in interest rates abroad and the inflation
rate in the country. Development banks have no access to the rediscount
facility of the Central Bank; however, BDET has access to a special TD 8.6
million facility at 9.25%.
1/ Most other development banks do not make loans below TD 500,000.



- 24 -
Financing of EMIs
4.08     In 1983, total credits to the economy amounted to TD 2.7 billion, of
which about 58% (TD 1.6 billion) as short-term and 42% (TD 1.1 billion) as
medium and long-term credit. Commercial banks were the principal providers of
short- and medium-term credit, which they financed from short- and mediur-term
deposits.  The industrial sector has been receiving an increasing portion of
all credit financing; from 49Z in 1980 to nearly 52% in 1984. Long-term
lending to industry is essentially provided by development banks; in
1983-1984, development banks provided nearly 60Z of MLT credit, the balance
(40Z) came from commercial banks, whereas prior to the creation of the new
development banks (1982-83) commercial banks proviued about 70% of total MLT
financing.
4.09     Of all industrial subsectors, EMI is the largest recipient of
institutional credit, as shown below:

Outstanding credits granted by commercial banks and development institutions
to EMIs amounted to TD 269 million in 1983, accounting for 10% of all
outstanding credit and 19% of those to industry. The share of short-term
credit in total credit to EMIs was 59% in 1983, significantly lower than the
65% value it assumed in 1980s; this decrease can be traced back to the
activity of development banks, mainly BDET. EMIs have been a priority sector
for financing and promotion by development banks as reflected by the EMI share
in the banks' total approvals for the manufacturing sector. For the 1980-1983
period, EMIs accounted for 34% of BDET's approvals in industry (para. 5.06);
similarly 37% of BTKD's and STUSID's manufacturing sector approvals went to
EMIs.

4.10     Suppliers' Credit.  In 1972, Banque Centrale de Tunisie (BCT) created
a facility called "credit a la production" which enables domestic
manufacturers in some subsectors to grant mediumr-term credits to their clients
(provided that these are industrial promoters) and to have these credits
rediscounted with BCT. These credits can finance up to 802 of the equipment
cost, for up to seven years, at the same interest rate as rediscountable
mediumrterm credits (currently 9.5%); disbursements are made against
rediscountable paper signed by the EMI supplier and the client. Although
there are incentives for commeesial banks to grant such credits 1/, few firms
have taken advantage of this facility 2/. Under the EMI-1 project, it was
agreed with BCT that an effort would be made to advertise and market this
facility more extensively. To that effect, the list of EHI products eligible
for financing under the project was to be extended to include all EMI capital
goods and supplies manufactured in Tunisia, and the new list was to be
publi3hed through a circular to be issued by BCT. During project
implementation, BCT considered that the periodic updating of the list for each
new product would be difficult to manage. It was therefore agreed that the
circular would be reformulated in terms broad and flexible enough to allow the
extension of the facility's benefits to new products without the need for
frequent updating. Such circular was issued in April 1985.
Study of The Financial Sector
4.11     A Financial Sector Study (FSS) was completed by the Bank in December
1984. It reviews (i) overall monetary and credit policies, (ii) the
institutional framework, and (iii) the utilization of monetary instruments,
and interest rates in particular. The FSS conclusion is that the Tunisian
financial sector is basically efficient, but can benefit from some marginal
adjustments.  Generally, the reco-ndations of the FSS aim at improving the
efficiency of both the intermediation process in Tunisia, and the mobilization
and allocation of domestic resources. Together with a simplification and
harmonization of the overly complex existing interest rate scheduLe, the FSS
proposes an overall upward adjustment in the structure of interest rates.
While in recent years on-lending rates have been positive in real terms, rates
on deposits have been barely positive or slightly negative and below
international levels. The FSS also proposes the introduction of a more
flexible system to allow that rates be more frequently adjusted in response to
changes in the banks' liquidity situation, tLe domestic inflation rate and
international interest rates. The findings of the FSS will be discussed with
the Tunisian authorities beginning in the first half of 1985; the Government
has agreed that this will provide the basis for continuing the Bank-GOT
dialogue on the reform of Tunisia's financial sector and for initiating this
reform. Two of the FSS general recommendations are of relevance to the
proposed project, and are presented below.
1/ In particular, these credits count towards meeting the minimum ratio (18%)
of transformation of deposits into medium-term credits, required from all
commercial banks.
2/ It is estimated that, in 1981 0.5% (at most) of annual EMI output eligible
for such financing (excluding STIA's) was sold with the assistance of this
facility.

4.12     Interest Rates and Cost of Resources  There is a large and
undesirable discrepancy between the commercial banks and the development banks
in the cost of funds and the lending rates. The relatively low interest rates
on deposits at commercial banks has kept the average cost of funds for these
banks at about 6% (sight deposits which constitute 55Z-60Z of the banks'
resources, are remunerated at rates of 1% for enterprises and 2% for
individuals). Development banks, on the other hand, are essentially dependent
on borrowings on the international market and lines of credits from bilateral
or multilateral agencies.  BDET, for example, (which raised $60 million from
the international market in 1983) has seen its average cost of borrowing reach
about 8.5%, and the marginal cost of its borrowing increase to over 11%. At
present, commercial banks make medium-term loans to industry at rates of 11.5%
to 12% allowing them a financial spread of 3.5Z to 4%, while the average
spread on new loans by BDET is about 2.8% through its new lending rate of
12% p.a. BDET's financial margin on its portfolio 1/ has declined between
1979 and 1982 because of increases in the cost of borrowing.  For EDET to
remain viable, its margin over the next two or three years should be at least
2% (Annex 4, Table 7). This can be achieved partly by Government support
until the end of 1986 and partly by further increases of its lending rates.
BDET's relative position vis-a-vis commercial banks and its profitability
would be strengthened if the structure of interest rates were adjusted (with a
view to linking these rates with the cost of resources) as recommended in the
FSS. To that end the interest rate structure and level of BDET and other
development banks will be reviewed with the Bank every year, by December 31 at
the latest. This was agreed upon under the recently approved Export
Industries Loan and was confirmed under the proposed project.
4.13     Foreign Exchange Risk.  At present, the Government carries the
exchange risk on the foreign borrowings of BDET and BNDT.  Up to 1981, this
practice resulted in profits for the Government because in nominal terms the
dinar appreciated in relation to the basket of currencies involved in these
borrowings. Since 1981, the situation has been reversed (particularly,
vis-a-vis the dollar), though the result over a ten-year period is still
positive for the Government. The question of foreign exchange risk coverage
is assuming increasing importance as the new development banks will have to
meet a significant part of their resource requirements through borrowing
abroad: designing and adopting an appropriate foreign exchange coverage
scheme is therefore becoming increasingly important. The FSS has proposed
that subborrowers be charged an increasing cost to cover the foreign exchange
risk and that this cost be related to the currency borrowed in order to
reflect more accurately the risks involved. These principles need to be
translated into a detailed scheme. During the recent negotiations of the
Export Industries Loan, the Government confirmed that the Central Bank is
undertaking a study for designing and instituting a suitable foreign exchange
scheme along the principles recommended in the FSS. It is expected that the
study will be completed and discussed with the Bank by March 31, 1986 at the
latest. The details of the implementation of an appropriate foreign exchange
risk coverage scheme would be prepared through the ongoing discussion of the
Financial Sector Study. Once the scheme is adopted, it would be applicable to
all development bank subborrowers whether or not they are financed with Bank
funds or other foreign resources. In the meantime, under the proposed loan,
the Government will continue to bear the foreign exchange risk, as it has
under previous loans to BDET and, more recently, to STUSID and BTKD.

V. THE PROJECT'S INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
A. Financial Intermediaries
5.01     Three institutions will be the financial intermediaries for the
proposed project: BDET, BTKD and STUSID. BDET is the country's leading
development bank Cparas. 5.02-5.22) and has received eight Bank loans since
1969. BTKD (paras. 5.23-5.36) and STUSID (paras. 5.37-5.47), two new
development banks which were included in the Export Industries Project, were
chosen as intermediaries under EHI-2 in response to the Government's request.
The inclusion of BTKD and STUSID in the project will significantly add to the
number of viable EMI projects financed under the Bank loan. BTKD and STUSID
have already given priority to EMI projects in the past, and the proposed Bank
loan has led them to identify additional, potentially viable EMI projects.
The two institutions are financially viable and well managed; they have put in
place competent organizations and staff to identify, appraise and supervise
projects. BTKD and STUSID attach great importance to a relation with the Bank
because of the support it provides to their overall policies and practices,
and more specifically, in helping establish appropriate project appraisal/
supervision methodology and standards. The Bank's financial support to these
institutions is also expected to strengthen their ability to raise additional
funds from international sources. Detailed descriptions and analyses of the
organization, operations, financial position and resource requirements of
BDET, BTKD and STUSID are presented below.
Banque de Developpement Economigue de Tunisie (BDET)
5.02     Establishment, Staffing and Procedures.  BDET was created in 1959,
and reorganized in 1966 with the assistance of the Bank Group (IFC then became
a shareholder; a list of shareholders is in Annex 4, Table 1). The
institution is well managed and has a competent staff. Its professional and
support staff has increased little in the last few years. BDET has actually
lost several experienced staff to the new development banks and to industrial
companies set up in the last three to four years, and is recruiting new
professionals to replenish its ranks. Of BDET's 76 total professional staff,
27 are working in the Project Promotion and Appraisal departments (Annex 4,
Table 2). A relatively large staff (100, of which 41 professionals) is
presently working in four administrative departments (Personnel,
Administration, Commitments, and Resources & Equity participation); there are
plans however to reduce this number by the end of 1985, when a computerized
administrative system becomes operational.
5.03     In recent years, BDET has placed increasing importance on the
identification and pronction of new projects, and has created a special
department for that purpose. The Promotion department promotes projects which
it h2s identified, and for which a license is established'in BDET's name; it
is responsible for formulating all aspects of the project (financial,
technical and economic) and for finding local promoters and foreign partners.
About 20 projects have been promoted since 1978, of which 15 have been
successfully implemented, mainly in the food-processing and EKI sectors (e.g.,
tractor assembly, drilling equipment, radiators, wood-working machinery,
electronic equipment). They are relatively large, particularly in the EMI
sector, and in most cases have involved foreign partners.



- 28 -
5.04     Project supervision has been and remains BDET's main weakness.  Over
the past years the Bank has increasingly pressed for BDET to reorganize its
supervision activity. An extensive supervision program for 1984 was agreed
upon last year and implemented; it comprised 100-120 visits to subprojects in
the implementation phase, with special attention on those experiencing cost
overruns or implementation delays, or having accumulated substantial arrears.
A better coordination between the Equity Participation and the Project
Appraisal departments has also been established, so that complete financial
documentation on companies in which BDET has an equity participation is now
available in the Project Appraisal department. Staff in this department also
participate in project supervision which has led to the recruitment of three
additional staff in 1984. The fact that BDET experienced a worsening of its
arrears position in the second half of 1984 (para. 5.11) underscores the
importance of improving and strengthening its supervision program. During
negotiations of the Export Industries Loan, a reporting system and a work
program for 1985 concerning BDET's supervision activities was agreed upon,
which will enable BDET's management and the Bank to monitor staff involvement
in supervision, the number and type of projects visited, the kind of problems
encountered by subprojects, and the actions taken by BDET and the project
sponsors to overcome these problems. This supervision system was confirmed
during negotiations of the proposed loan.
5.05     Operations.  BDET experienced a rapid growth in its operations in the
last five years (Annex 4, Table 3).  Approvals of loans and equity
participations almost doubled between 1980 and 1982 to reach TD 63 million,
but fell by 35% in 1983 (TD 40.5 million). This drop reflected a return to
more normal levels of investments in manufacturing (particularly in EMI,
construction materials and chemicals) following the surge in investments which
accompanied the beginning of the Sixth Plan (1982-1986). Moreover,
competition from the new development banks 1/ took away some business from
BDET, and the demand for SSI stagnated 2/. There was a modest recovery in
1984 as approvals reached TD 48 million, an increase of 18Z over 1983.
Overall, during the 1980-1984 period, approvals grew at a slower pace (11%
p.a.) than commitments and disbursements (192 and 17.5% respectively),
auguring a relative slowdown in future operations.
5.06     BDET's approvals between 1980 and 1984 (Annex 4, Table 4) were mainly
for new projects (72%), in the private sector (86%), and consisted essentially
of lending operations (equity participations represented lO% of all approvals
on the average). The manufacturing sector accounted for about two thirds of
the total, reflecting the recent decision by BDET's management to limit its
1/ The more so, as the new development banks readily take substantial capital
participations, and are not expected to deal with projects below a certain
size (TD 1 and 2 million for BTKD and STUSID respectively).
2/ The share of SSIs in the approvals of new manufacturing projects fell from
50Z in 1980 to 20% in 1983, as a result of the substantial increase in
average project costs due to inflation, which pushed a number of projects
out of the SSI category (SSI projects are defined as costing less than TD
500,000 which is a ceiling in need of updating) and to the increasing
share taken by large, capital-intensive projects in the chemicals and EMI
sectors.



- 29 -
intervention in the tourism sector, which represented 23Z and 30Z of all
approvals in 1982 and 1983. Within the manufacturing sector, EMIs took up the
largest share with 27Z of approvals 1/, followed by the food-processing
industries (15M), construction materLals (14Z), and chemicals (13%). The
latter sector, aLong with EMIs, increased substantially its share in BDET's
approvals and consisted mainly of large projects. As a consequence, the
proportion of projects with a cost greater than TD 1 million in total
approvals rose from 44% in 1980 to 57% in 1983.
5.07     Financial Position.  Over the past five years (1980-1984) BDET's
financial position remained sound (for details, see Annex 4, Tables 5-6).
Total assets grew at an average rate of 21.3% p.a., essentially as a result of
the steady growth of BDET's portfolio (18.5% p.a.) -- both in terms of
long-term loans (18Z p.a.) and equity participations (22Z p.a.) --, and the
rapid increase in receivables (para. 5.09). At the same time, BDET's share
capital was increased from TD 10 million to TD 20 million in 1982/83, partly
by incorporating reserves, partly by taking new shareholders (e.g., Sultanate
of Oman). As a result, BDET's debt/equity ratio (5:1 as of December 31, 1984)
remained well below the maximum allowed under previous Loan Agreements (8:1),
which will carry over under the proposed project (Project Agreement, Section
4.04). Despite the decrease in its profitability (paras. 5.14-5.16), BDET has
been able to pay a return on capital of 8%, partly because of Government
assistance (para. 5.16).
5.08     Three recent developments in BDET's financial position are worth
noting: (i) the rapid increase in current liabilities; (ii) the growth in
receivables; and (iii) the increase in arrears on loans (reviewed under BDET's
portfolio analysis, paras. 5.10-5.13). Short-term liabilities more than
doubled over the past four years, from TD 32 million at the end of 1981 to TD
73 million at the end of 1984, mainly on account of short-term borrowings (TD
15.5 million and TD 50.6 million as of December 31, 1981 and 1984
respectively), the majority of which was raised from commercial banks and
Union Tunisienne de Banque (UTB) in Paris, a branch of the Central Bank
specialized in raising funds on the international market. These short-term
borrowings were needed to meet BDET's rapidly growing requirements for loan
disbursements, at a time when it was difficult and expensive to raise
resources from the capital market. In 1983 BDET raised US$60 million (TD 43.5
million) in mediumr-term funds by issuing Floating Rate Notes (FRN), which
enabled it inter alia to repay about US$13.8 million (TD 10 million) of
short-term borrowings. The terms of the FRN were attractive by international
comparison (1/4% above LIBOR, 7 years), yet the cost of this issue increased
BDET's overall resource cost. Borrowing in mid-19:5 of an additional US$66.2
million (TD 55.0 million) on medium term is presently being considered 2/,
11  This share would have been significantly higher (it was 34% for
1980-1983), if EMI approvals had not fallen sharply in 1984.
2/  In the Japanese market (Y 15 billion), of which one third at variable rate
(.25Z over the LIBOR) and two thirds at a fixed rate, over 10 years; BDET
estimates that the overall cost should come to the equivalent of a fixed
rate of about 7.4%, and in the German market (DM 20 million), at an
interest rate to be determined during the forthcoming negotiations of the
loan (May 1975).



- 30 -
which should enable BDET to repay the bulk of its short-term borrowings and
thus further improve its current ratio 1/.
5.09     The second important development in BDET's financial position is the
increase in receivables, which almost quadrupled between 1981 and 1984, mainly
as a result of the growth in overdue payments from the Government on account
of exchange losses incurred on repayments of foreign borrowings 2/. Due to
the depreciation of the dinar relative to all major currencies, and to the US
dollar in particular, these losses have been accumulating since 1981 and
amounted to TD 16.2 million as of December 31, 1984. The Government has
undertaken to reimburse BDET for losses incurred on account of payment of
principal on foreign currency borrowings up to December 31, 1983 (TD 10.5
million). The Government has also undertaken to reimburse BDET for losses
incurred in 1984 (TD 5.7 million for payment of principal and TD 3.0 million
for payment of interest). For the future, the Financial Sector Study has
proposed new principles to cover foreign exchange risks in relation to the
risk of devaluation of a particular currency. A study by the Government on
alternatives for foreign exchange risk coverage is underway. Agreement has
been reached with the Government on completion and review with the Bank of
such study by March 31, 1986. The resulting recommendations will be applied,
by the development banks, to subborrowers (Loan Agreement, Section 4.04 and
Schedule 5; Project Agreement, Schedule 1).
5.10     Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1984, BDET had a loan and equity
portfolio of TD 220.3 million, with loans accounting for TD 193.8 million
(88%), and equity participations for TD 26.5 million (12Z). Loans to industry
represented 75% of total loans, the remainder being in tourism (25%) and other
sectors (transport, services). Loans were well distributed over the various
industrial sectors, with agro-industries, construction materials, EMIs,
textiles and chemicals being the most important, in terms of number as well as
volume. The relatively largest part of BDET's equity portfolio is in tourism
(39.6%. against 49.4% in all industries) but this is expected to decrease in
the future (para. 5.18).
5.11     As of December 31, 1984, total arrears amounted to TD 15.9 million
(8.2% of outstanding portfolio), of which TD 11.8 million was overdue for more
than three months (about 6.1% of outstanding portfolio) representing a 5OZ
growth in arrears over December 1983 3/. These total arrears consisted of TD
9.7 million of overdue principal and TD 6.2 million of unpaid interest; they
affected about TD 58.2 million in outstanding loans, representing 30% of the
outstanding loan portfolio. They were concentrated on a limited number of
enterprises: 22 companies (a substantial number of them in the public
sector), with arrears greater than TD 100,000, accounted for 80% of arrears
not yet brought to court (or 47% of total arrears). The distribution of these
companies arrears is summarized in the table below.
1/ BDET's current ratio fell from 0.53 in 1980 to 0.30 in 1982, and rose
again to 0.53 at the end of 1984.
2/ As opposed to losses on account of interest payments (para. 5.15).
3/ On December 31, 1983, total arrears amounted to TD 9.5 million, of which
TD 7.1 million was overdue for more than 3 months.

BDET's arrears have been worsening for some time (as can be seen in the table
below) and this trend reflects the shortcomings in BDET's supervision
procedures and policy mentioned in para. 5.04; however, the sudden 1984
degradation reflects primarily the poor 1983 and 1984 tourist seasons and the
overall economic slowdown.

conjuncture, significant improvement should be achievable by the end of 1985
or mid-1986 at the latest. The following table presents the relative
distributions as of the end of 1983 and 1984, of the arrears yet to be acted
upon.

5.12     So far BDET's outstanding loans have been secured by adequate
collaterals. About 4% of BDET's loans are covered by Government guarantees;
most of these guarantees are for small-scale industry projects (FOPRODI) and
cover 50 to 75% of the interest and principal amounts involved. As of
December 31, 1984, provisions for risks amounted to TD 6.5 million, equivalent
to 3.0% of total outstanding portfolio, and 56% of arrears over three months.
BDET does not make provision for individual loans, but for the entire loan and
equity portfolio; nonetheless, provisions are discussed on a case-by-case
basis with the auditors; this review, however, is made difficult by the
substantial number of companies in arrears for which financial information is
incomplete.
5.13     So far, pTovisions have beeu adequate to cover losses on loans and
equity participations and amounted to about 55.5Z of arrears of more than 3
months. However, in view of the worsening trend in its arrears situation,
BDET needs to formulate an overall action plan for the collection of its
arrears and review its prov_zion policy. Prior to negotiations for the
proposed loan, BDET submitted to the Bank individual action plans for the 22
companies with arrears larger than TD 100,000 as of December 31, 1984 and
projections of arrears to the end of 1985 and 1986. These were reviewed with
the Bank during negotiations. The action plans foresee that 19 of the 22
companies will have fully repaid their arrears to BDET by end-1986, according
to a repayment schedule agreed with BDET. The three other cases appear more
difficult to resolve and BDET is currently working out with the borrowers a
schedule to obtain full repayment. Overall, taking into account the recent
case-by-case review of its portfolio, BDET has com itted itself to reducing
its arrears to the level of 1983 (about 5% of its total outstanding portfolio)
by the end of 1986. The Bank will closely monitor BDET's overall arrears
position and quarterly reporting was agreed upon to permit the Bank to stay
abreast of future development.

5.14     Profitability.  Despite fluctuations in BDET's financial performance
over the last five years, its income statements for the 1980-1984 period
(Annex 4, Table 5) show a general trend towards decreasing profitability, as
net income (before tax and Government subsidy) amounted to a loss of TD 2.7
million in 1984 compared to a profit of TD 1.09 million in 1982. The decrease
in profitability is due to the fact that the average cost of borrowings
increased faster than interest rates on lending, leading to a substantial
reduction in BDET's margin on borrowing from 1.20 in 1980 to 0.42 in 1983 and
-0.52 in 1984. As a result of discussions held during the 1984 Financial
Sector mission, BDET was allowed to raise its lending rates by IZ in December
1984, to 11.5Z for small- and medium-size industries, 13X for tourism
projects, and 14X for large projects 1/.  After accounting for the payment of
interest 6 months in advance and the commitment fee, taxes and commissions
charged to the borrowers, these increases result in effective interest rates
significantly higher than the nominal rates (e.g., the effective rate corres-
ponding to a nominal rate of 13% is 16.2Z). Further adjustment will depend
inter alia on the discussions to be initiated with the Government in the first
half of 1985, when the Bank's Financial Sector Report is reviewed (para.
4.12). However, the effect on BDET's income of such increases in interest
rates will initially be low, since these higher rates apply only to new loans.
5.15     BDET's cost of borrowing has risen mainly because of its greater
recourse to borrowing on the international market and the ensuing increase in
its debt service, due to the depreciation of the dinar vis-a-vis all major
currencies, particularly the US dollar. As mentioned in para. 4.13, the
Government carries the exchange risk on BDET's foreign borrowings. However,
the Government meets its obligations with substantial delays. In addition to
foreign exchange losses on principal payments (para. 5.09), BDET incurred
losses on account of interest payments; they amounted to TD 1.0 million in
1981, TD 1.6 million in 1982, TD 2.2 million in 1983 and TD 3.0 million in
1984. So far BDET has been able to recover only part of the latter losses
through the annual compensation paid by the Government (para. 5.16) 2/.
In their past annual reports, BDET's auditors have only made very general
references to foreign exchange losses while, given the importance of this
issue, they should have detailed the origin and amounts of these losses.
Auditors would, in the future, disclose foreign exchange losses incurred
during the year (on both interest and principal) and the amounts received from
the Government to cover these losses. This will be followed up during the
course of the loan supervision.
5.16     To meet its statutory obligations to ensure that BDET can make
adequate provisions and pay an 8% return on capital, the Government has
increased its compensation from TD 0.46 million in 1982 to TD 2.95 million in
1983, and estimates for 1984 suggest that compensation for the year would have
to be even larger 3/. During negotiations of the Export Industries loan,
1/ BDET will implement these increases in mid-1985.
2/ Contrary to losses on principal payments, foreign exchange losses on
account of interest payments are not budgeted as such by the Government.
3/ Based on preliminary results for 1984, it is estimated that the Government
would have to make available to BDET about TD 5 million, of which TD 3.04
million would correspond to foreign exchange losses incurred on its
interest payments.



- 34 -
agreement was reached with the Government (consistent with the agreement
reached under the EMI-1 project) that it will guarantee BDET -- if necessary
through payment of a compensation until end-1986 1/ - a minimum profitability
to make adequate provisions, reserves and dividends until end-1986. This
agreement was confirmed during negotiations of the proposed loan.
5.17     BDET's Performance under Bank Projects.  BDET received its first line
of credit from the Bank in 1969 when a loan of US¢9.30 million was provided to
finance industrial and tourism projects. Since then, BDET has received seven
loans, most of them geared to assisting in financing the development of
Tunisian industries (para. 2.15). BDET's performance has been satisfactory,
with Bank funds being disbursed at a rapid pace. In addition, BDET took
advantage of the Bank's assistance to strengthen its organization and improve
its overall performance. However, a few shortcomings are still prevailing
particularly in the area of project supervision (para. 5.04), which BDET will
continue addressing with the help of the Bank through the Export Industries
loan and the proposed loan.
5.18     Forecast of Operations.  BDET foresees a 6% annual growth in its
approvals over the period 1985-1988 (Annex 4, Table 8). This represents a
relative slowdown in operations as compared to the first half of the decade
(para. 5.05). Based on its overall pipeline of applications, BDET should be
able to approve loans and equity participations in the amount of TD 50.5
million in 1985, TD 55 million in 1986, TD 57.5 million in 1987, and TD 60
million in 1988, with equity participations remaining at about 1OZ of the
total.  These projections are somewhat conservative; they reflect three basic
trends: (i) in accordance with its policy of scaling down its exposure in the
tourism sector (para. 5.06), BDET plans to limit the annual level of approvals
in this sector to TD 8 million compared to TD 12 million on the average in the
past 2/; (ii) large industrial projects will diminish in importance relative
to the entire portfolio; and (iii) BDET's operations will thus be focused
again on small-scale industries.  BDET's commitments and disbursements are
projected to remain nearly constant over the period, at about TD 46 and 44
million respectively. This reflects the slower pace of approvals observed in
1983 and 1984 (para. 5.05).
5.19     Financial Projections.  Interest income (Annex 4, Table 9) is
projected to increase at a rate of 11% p.a., reflecting the growth in
portfolio (6Z) and the increases in interest rates recently effected (1X in
December 1984, para. 5.14) as well as those expected in the future 3/. As a
result, the average interest rate on outstanding loan portfolio is projected
to increase from 9.5% in 1984 to 10.8% in 1988. The cost of borrowing would
increase at a lesser pace from 8.4% in 1984 to 8.7% in 1988; the average cost
of new borrowing is projected at about 9.5% (taking into account concessionary
borrowings from bilateral sources, which will partially offset the high cost
of borrowing on the international market), while the cost of existing debt
1/ This requirement (Annex 4, Table 7) would translate into a minimum interest
rate spread of 2Z p.a. in 1985 and 1986.
2/ BDET will only finance extension projects or projects which it promoted.
3/ BDET plans to increase its interest rates by 1% in 1987.



- 35 -
will remain at about 8.3%. The reimbursement by the Government of foreign
exchange losses, amounting to TD 16.2 million in 1985 (which has been included
in the projections as two installments, namely TD 10.5 million in 1985 and
TD 5.7 million in 1986; para. 5.09). will reduce BDET's borrowing needs,
strengthen its equity and generally improve its financial situation (Annex 4,
Tables 10-11). BDET's profitability will thus remain satisfactory as the
return on equity is projected to increase from 6.83% in 1984 to 8.96% in 1988
(Annex 4, Table 7). This improvement would be achieved while permitting BDET
to pay modest but reasonable dividends (8%) from its own resources, build up
adequate reserves and provisions 1/, and at the same time rescind the
Government assistance before the end of 1986, in accordance with agreements
reached under the EMI-1 project (para. 5.16).
5.20     In order to limit its recourse to long-term borrowings and thus
maintain its debt/equity ratio at a reasonable level (5:1), BDET plans to
increase its share capital from TD 20 million as of December 31, 1984 to TD 30
million by the end of 1986 and has already secured the 1985 tranche (TD 5
million) of this increase. Even after this increases, BDET's capital will
remain low in comparison to BTKD's and STUSID's car,ital (TD 100 million
each). Interest coverage, which fell to 1.1 in 191B3 (because of expenses
related to the FRN-loan; para. 5.08), is projected to mprove to 1.2 in 1986,
which is satisfactory. Furthermore, the debt service ratio 2/ would remain at
about 1.1 on the average, partly due to the fact that the US$60 million
FRN-loan is reimbursable in one single payment in 1990. Because BDET is
unlikely, by then, to have made adequate reserves to meet this obligation, it
will most probably have to refinance this loan.
5.21     Resource Position and Resource Requirements.  BDET's resource
position aq of September 30, 1984, summarized in the table below, shows a
resource gap of TD 38.95 million, or 18% of total available resources. IBRD
loans represented about 24% of total foreign exchange borrowings and about 17%
of total resources. Total future resource requirements for the 1985-1988
period are projected to amount to TD 228.7 million (US$276 million), of which
TD 141.1 million (US$170 million) would be in foreign exchange and TD 87.6
million (USt106 million) in local currency. About TD 102.2 million (US$123.1
million) of foreign exchange resources have already been identified and would
thus cover 72% of total foreign exchange requirements. TD 55.0 million would
be raxsed on the Japanese market (Y 15 billion) and the German market (DM 20
million) in 1985, and the remainder (TD 47.2 million) from bilateral (French,
Italian, German and Arab) and multilateral sources (African Development bank,
European Investment Bank, IBRD). The proposed loan of US$20 million (TD 16.6
million) would cover about 43% of the remaining resource gap in foreign
exchange (TD 38.9 million) and about 12% of total foreign resource
requirements for the period. BDET's resource requirements in local currency
would be met by borrowing on the local market and by increasing the share
capital (para. 5.20).
1/ Financial projections have assumed that loan arrears would not increase
above their level of December 31, 1984 (they would thus decrease as a X of
BDET's total portfolio) and provisions would cover at least 60% of these
arrears.
2/ Which is defined as the ratio of net income plus financial charges plus
repayments over financial charges plus repayments.

5.22     These financial projections are based on the assumption that interest
rates on the international market would evolve favorably as present trends
seem to indicate. However, as the situation may change over the next few
years, BDET's resource requirements would need to be reviewed with the Bank on
a regular basis. As agreed upon under the recently approved Export Industries
Loan, this will be done by BDET and the Bank on an annual basis (para. 4.12);
this was confirmed under the proposed project.
Banque Tuniso-Koweitienne de D&veloppement (BTKD)
5.23     Establishment, Ownership and Policies.  BTKD was created on February
25, 1981, following an agreement between the Kuwaiti and Tunisian governments
signed on October 29, 1980. BTKD started operations in March 1981. Its main
objectives are to identify, promote and finance economically and financially
viable projects in all sectors of the economy in Tunisia, and to strengthen
economic and financial relations between Tunisia, Kuwait and other Arab and
African countries. BTKD has a share capital of TD 100 million, equally owned
by the two countries; for the list of shareholders, see Annex 5, Table 1. One
quarter of its capital was paid in at its creation, and the remainder was to
be paid in over the subsequent five years.
5.24     BTKD can take equity participations, make loans and give guarantees,
as well as provide a number of banking services, inter alia accepting deposits
from abroad. BTKD's Policy Statement sets as an objective of the bank's the
development of Tunisia as an international financial center. It also
indicates a target sectoral distribution for its operations: 60% in industry,
20% in agriculture, 15% in tourism and 5% in other sectors. BTKD's equity
participation cannot be more than 15Z of a firm's share capital, except when
BTKD is promotor and lead-financier and its participation can go up to 30Z.
Its maximum exposure in a single company is limited to 10% of its own net
wor-th, and 15% when BTKD is the project promoter. The total of its equity
participations must remain below 50Z of its net worth. BTKD's Policy
Statement stipulates a maximum debt/equity ratio of 4:1. It also stipulates
that BTKD should lend at fixed rates when using its own funds or funds
borrowed at fixed rates, and that otherwise, it should lend at variable rates;
also, that maturities of its lending should approximately match those of its
borrowing. In general, BTKD's financial and operational policies indicated in
its Policy Statement are satisfactory.
5.25     Organization and Staffing.  BTKD has a Board of Directors of ten
members; the President of the Board is a Kuwaiti. BTKD's General Manager is
not a member of the Board of Directors; the present General Manager has had
ten years of service with BDET and is an experienced development banker. As
of late 1984, BTKD had a staff of 74, of which 30 were professionals. BTKD is
organized in five departments: Promotion, Appraisal & Follow-up, Equity
Participations & Representation, Controller's & Treasury, and Administration
(Organization Chart in Annex 5, Table 2). Department directors are qualified
and experienced: the directors of the two operational departments (Promotion
and Appraisal) are engineers with considerable experience in industry, while
the Administration department is run by a former commercial banker. The two
operational departments have a total staff of 14 professionals, while the



- 38 -
Equity Participations department counts 3 professionals. At present, the
Controllers and Administration departments are headed by a single director,
who is also responsible for legal services.
5.26     Appraisal and Supervision of Projects.  On the basis of a sample of
appraisal reports, BTKD's appraisal standards and procedures have been found
satisfactory. However, though the financial, technical and market assessments
in BTKD's reports are of satisfactory quality, these reports are sometimes
deficient in economic analysis. In most cases where such analysis was
missing, BTKD has relied on the work done either by other financial
institutions (involved in joint or parallel financing), Government agencies,
or independent consultants. BTKD has the qualified staff and most of the
know-how to prepare appraisal reports meeting the standards presented in para.
6.12. Some strengthening of in-house capability may be necessary through the
use of specialized consultants and training of staff, particularly in economic
analysis. This was discussed during negotiations and the Bank will closely
monitor the economic analyses in BTKD's appraisal reports. BTKD has still to
effectively organize its supervision activities; the design of supervision
plans and procedures was undertaken in 1984. These plans have now been
completed and a program to implement them, along with a program to improve
reporting standards and procedures, has been agreed upon during negotiations
in February 1985 for the Export Industries Project; this was confirmed under
the proposed project.
5.27     Operations.  As of September 30, 1984 11, BTKD had approved 138
projects, for a total amount of TD 235.7 million of which TD 194.8 million in
loans and TD 40.9 million in equity participations. By the same date,
commitments amounted to TD 151.6 million, and disbursements totalled TD 107.7
million (Annex 5, Table 3). About 46 projects, or one-third of all, have
involved relatively large investments (TD 8 million and above), while 70
(nearly 51%) were significantly smaller (below TD 4 million) (Annex 5,
Table 4). BTKD does not generally finance projects with an investment cost
below TD 1 million, and is interested in technologically advanced projects.
Industry, transport and services accounted for 60% (TD 140.7 million) of total
approvals; construction and tourism, for 18% (TD 41.2 million); agriculture
and agro-industries, for 7% (TD 15.6 million). BTKD's involvement in ENIs has
substantially evolved. In 1981-82, the EMIs share in BTKD's total approvals
was 22.1Z (TD 27.4 million); it was 17.1% (TD 11.8 million) in 1983, and 14.5Z
(TD 6.2 million) as of September 30, 1984. This decrease however reflects
primarily the fact that the average size of the projects approved has dropped
significantly after 1982 (first year of the Plan period). While about one
third of its approvals at present involve projects in the public sector, BTKD
expects to approve less public sector projects in the future, and along with
the other development banks, to play a role in the gradual privatization *
such projects.
1/  As of the date of this report (May 1, 1985), BTKD data for the whole 1984
exercise were not yet available. All 1984 data shown in Annex 5 are
preliminary.



- 39 -
5.28     Pbrtfolio.  As of September 30, 1984, BTKD had a loan and equity
portfolio of TD 85.7 million, of which TD 66.3 million were in loans and
TD 19.4 million in equity participations. Loans to industry, transport and
services represented approximately 87% of total loans; tourism and
construction, 12Z. The dominant part of BTKD's equity portfolio was in
industry, transport and services, amounting to 72% of the total
participations, against 24% in tourism; this is expected to remain in the
future. BTKD's outstanding loans are secured by adequate collaterals.
5.29     As of late 1984, arrears amounted to TD 567,400 or 0.9Z of the loan
portfolio. Of the 11 projects in arrears, only one was in serious default but
involved small amounts: TD 11,300 in principal and TD 9,600 in interest. The
other projects in arrears are being followed up; individual action plans are
being prepared and put gradually into effect. Provisions for risks amounted
to TD 1.3 million, or 1.5% of total outstanding portfolio. This amount was
not adequate and BTKD has since undertaken to increase its provisions to a
satisfactory level.
5.30     Financial Position and Profitability.  At present, BTXD's financial
position is sound. Of its TD 100 million share capital, 75 million has been
paid iD.; the remainder will be paid in this year. In 1985, BTKD will borrow
for the first time on the international market, about TD 42 million. By the
end of 1984 BTKD's current liabilities had increased significantly, from
TD 9.9 million the previous year to TD 18.9 million. This came mainly from
short-term borrowings (TD 13.5 million) that were made necessary by BTKD's
rapidly growing portfolio and the fact that BTKD's share capital was not yet
fully paid in. These short-term borrowings will be promptly repaid in
1985 l/. BTKD made a net profit of TD 4.3 miiiion in 1983 and TD 6.7 million
in l984, corrssponding to 8Z and 8.8% returns on average equity respectively.
These returns are relatively low, especially when compared with costs of
international borrowing; they reflect the fact that about 20X of BTKD
portfolio is in equity participations and that these do not immediately
generate income 2/. In early 1985, BTKD raised nominal rates on its loans to
12% per year for loans up to 11 years, rising to 13Z fot loans with maximum
duration of 15 years 3/, which should compensate for the current poor returns
on BTKD's equity participation. From 1986 onwards, as BTKD will depend fully
on foreign borrowing for meeting its resource needs, BTKD will have to
regularly review its interest rate structure and level. Under the recently
approved Export Industries Loan, BTKD has agreed to such a review with the
Bank every year, by December 31 at the latest. Income statements, balance
sheets and ratios analysis are attached as Tables 5-7 in Annex 5. Under the
Export Industries project, BTKD has also agreed to have its accounts audited
in the future by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. Under the
proposed project, the above two agreements with BTKD were confirmed.
1/ A loan of TD 42 million is confirmed for early 1985.
2/ It was estimated however that by 1986 this income would improve and amount
to about 2% of the average equity portfolio.
3/ As a result, BTKD's effective rates to borrowers (accounting for the
payment of a commitment fee, taxes and commissions) would now amount to
15.1% and 16.2% for nominal rates of 12% and 13%, if payment of interests
is effectively made six months in advance as called for by loan contracts.

5.31     Forecast of Operations.  Expectations are that BTKD's loan and equity
approvals in 1984 will decrease to TD 46.6 million (from TD 69.4 million in
1983 and TD 83.4 million in 1982, first year of the Sixth Plan) as a result of
the general slump in economic activity in Tunisia and Europe. In 1985,
however, loan and equity approvals would begin an upturn and total about TD 50
million. They would pick up again thereafter as a result of the expected
general economic recovery, with an increase of about TD 10 million every year,
also reflecting the efforts made to keep up with the recovery elsewhere and
catch up with the pace of operation achieved in earlier years (Annex 5, Table
8). Equity investments are expected to represent about one fifth of total
approvals. The share of EMI projects in approvals of mnufacturing projects
is expected first to slightly increase (the EMI potential being increasingly
realized), then stabilize at about 33Z. Commitments for the period. 1985-1988
are projected at TD 261.5 million, reflecting tbe evolutions of approvals over
the preceding years, notably the fall in 1984-85. Disbursements, projected at
TD 236.4 million, would show a sim.lar evolution.
5.32     Financisl Projections.  Because BTKD has been essentially using its
share capital so far, and correspondingly still has limited borrowings
(TD 13.5 million as of late 1984), its future average cost of borrowing will
depend very much on borrowing costs in each of the next few years and only
gradually become less sensitive to marginal cost. At present the cost of
international borrowings is going down and soon might be below 10. A
somewhat conservative assumption was adopted: that this cost would stay at
10% for some time and later on (by 1986-88) slightly rise (possibly to l1Z),
resulting in an average cost of borrowing first of about 10% and later on of
about 10.05% (Annex 5, Table 7) for BTKD. Still on the expenditure side, BTKD
will have to set aside substantial provisions in the next few years (Annex 5,
Table 9) to catch up with insufficient past allocations (para. 5.29). The
recent rise in interest rates (para. 5.30) should help BTKD partially meet
these costs. Also, by 1986 BTKD equity investments should show some return;
this return was assumed to be 2% on this part of BTKD's average portfolio.
Yet projections show that BTKD will need to secure an increase in its margin
on borrowings, from 2.1 points in 1984 to about 3.0 points in 1988 (Annex 5,
Table 7) to maintain an adequate return on average share capital. This should
not be particularly difficult, since (a) nominal interest rates on lending
could be slightly increased, and (b) improvements in the collection of fees
and commissions could ensure that effective rates be substantially higher than
nominal ones. BTKD's profitability should thus remain satisfactory and even
gradually improve with a return on average share capital projected to increase
from 10.3% in 1984 to 12.8% in 1988 and allow that reasonable dividends of
about 8% be paid (Annex 5, Tables 10-11).
5.33     BTKD is still far away from having exhausted its indebtedness
capacity; by 1988 its debt equity ratio will have increased to 111 (from 1/6
in 1984), still very low compared to the 4/1 ratio which BTKD's policy
statement allows. The same maximum level for the debt;equity ratio was
included as a covenant in the proposed loan (Project Agreement, Section
4.06). BTKD's interest coverage would regularly decrease over the project
period (from 4.2 in 1985) but remain very sound (2.2 in 1988). BTKD's debt
service ratio would follow a similar evolution, from 4.2 in 1985 down to 1.8
in 1989, which is still very satisfactory.

5.34     Resource Position and Requirements.  BTKD's resource position as of
September 30, 1984 and estimated needs for 1985-1988 (the period covered by
the proposed loan) are as follows:

5.35     By the end of 1988, the resource gap for the project period
(1985-1988) would amount to TD 146.6 million (US$176.6 million), of which
TD 106.9 million (US$128.8 million) in foreign exchange and TD 39.7 million
(US$47.8 million) in local currency. This gap would represent a very
substantial fraction (46.6%) of BTKD's resource requirements for the period
(61.5Z for the foreign exchange component, and 28.2Z for the local currency
component). This results from the very important volume of approvals in past
years (e.g. 1984) which are now being gradually translated into commitments,
and from the still limited efforts spent by BTKD to mobilize necesFary funds.
All identified local resources originate from within BTKD itself: cash
generation (TD 47.9 million), loan collections (TD 40.8 million) and capital
increase (TD 12.5 million). BTKD has yet to borrow on the local market and/or
make use of the BCT rediscount facility, but should have no difficulty in
doing so. Foreign exchange resources identified so far are the TD 42.0
million borrowing made in early 1985 through BCT in UsE, the TD 12.5 million
equivalent capital increase (from foreign partners) and, the US$15.0 million
of the Bank-financed Export Industries project. Raising about US$129 million
(TD 106.9 million) abroad might prove a substantial task and should be
addressed at the earliest possible time. BTKD expects to raise an additional
USW50 million from the international market in 1986, which should be possible
in the light of its successful experience early this year. The proposed loan
of UStl5 million would be small (8.5%) in relation to the remaining resource
gap of TD 146.6 million, and represent 11.7% only of the total foreign
resource gap; it would mainly serve to help BTKD in its resource raising
efforts, and would also provide BTKD with institutional support through normal
Bank supervision.
5.36     The above financial projections are based on the assumption that
interest rates on the international market and in Tunisia would evolve as
indicated earlier. However, as the situation may change over the the next few
years, BTKD's resource requirements would need to be reviewed with the Bank on
a regular basis. As agreed under the recently approved Export Industries
Loan, this will be done by BTKD and the Bank at the time of the annual review
of interest rates (paras. 4.12 and 5.30); this was confirmed under the
proposed project.
Societe Tuniso-Seoudienne d'Investissement et de Developpement (STUSID)
5.37     Establishment, Ownership and Policies.  STUSID was created by an
agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Tunisia on January 6, 1981.
It started operations on May 30, 1981. Its main objectives are the promotion
and financing of industrial, tourism, agricultural and other economically and
financially viable projects in Tunisia, and the mobilization of foreign
capital for these projects. Another of its objectives is to help in the
development of the capital market and to participate in import and export
finance in Tunisia. STUSID has a share capital of TD 100 million, equally
owned by the two countries (Annex 6, Table 1, list of shareholders). One
quarter of its capital was paid in at its creation, the remainder is to be
paid in over the subsequent five years. STUSID can take equity
participations, make loans, provide guarantees and give technical assistance.



- 43 -
5.38     STUSID's Policy Statement gives priority to projects having a
favorable impact on the balance of payments and substantially contributing to
employment creation. It also orients STUSID's operations towards projects of
a substantial size, i.e., of investment costs larger than TD 2 million for
industrial projects and TD 3 million for other projects. Taking equity
participations in projects is important, and STUSID's financial assistance has
effectively been distributed between equity and loan in a ratio of 1:2. No
particular limit is stipulated for STUSID's equity investment in any single
company, but its Policy Statement indicates 15-30% of the company's capital as
an acceptable range. The agreement creating STUSID limits the total of equity
investments by STUSID to its net worth. The Policy Statement also stipulates
that STUSID will not bear any foreign exchange risk and a maximum debt:equity
ratio of 4:1. The same maximum level for the debt:equity ratio was included
as a covenant in the proposed loan (Project Agreement, Section 4.06). In
general, STUSID's financial and operational policies, as detailed in its
Policy Statement, are satisfactory.
5.39     Organization and Staffing.  STUSID has a Board of Directors of ten
members; the President of the Board is from Saudi Arabia. STUSID's first
Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors. At present,
the Chief Executive Officer is a former Director General of the Plan, former
President of STEG (Sociftf Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz), former
Director General of CNEI (Centre National d'Etudes Industrielles) and former
President of SFAX-GAFSA (Phosphates Company). He is an experienced manager
and competent professional. STUSID has recruited 46 professional staff in the
3-1/2 years since it started operations. STUSID has seven departments, of
which five are operational (Industry, Tourism, Agriculture & Agro-industry,
Promotion, and Planning & Follow-up) and two departments are concerned with
administration and finance (Annex 6, Table 2, Organization Chart). The
Planning & Follow-up department coordinates the activities of the other four
operational departments; it is also responsible for managing STUSID's equity
portfolio and following up on its loans, which is a substantial responsibility
since STUSID's policy is to take significant equity participations in the
projects that it finances.
5.40     Project Appraisal and Supervision.  STUSID has sound appraisal
procedures and methods which emphasize financial, economic, and technical
criteria. The review of a sample of appraisal reports, however, has
established that improvements can be made in the economic assessment of
projects. STUSID's in-house capacity in this respect needs strengthening.
This need can be addressed through training of the staff and use of
specialized consultants; plans to meet this need will be discussed during
negotiations. The Bank in its project supervision will pay particular
attention to this question and to progress achieved in this respect. STUSID
has established a detailed supervision/follow-up policy for its projects 1/,
which was most desirable given STUSID's emphasis on equity financing. As
conceived by STUSID, this activity would require a substantial manpower input;
however, it is expected that its cost be covered by representation allowances
1/ According to this program, STUSID attends all Board and General Assembly
meetings of companies in which it has a participation, and produces
quarterly supervision reports on the technical and financial progress of
the project/company involved.

(directors' fees). During uegotiations of the Export Industries Loan,
reporting requirements, including those pertaining to project supervision,
were discussed and agreed upon. This agreement was confirmed during
negotiations of the proposed loan. STUSID has also established an efficient
computerized management information system, covering three areas: (i) project
appraisal, supervision and loan administration; (ii) accounts, budget and
payroll; and (iii) management. As a result of this system, STUSID has been
able to limit the recruitment of support staff while setting up an efficient
supervision system.
5.41     Operations.  As of December 31, 1984, STUSID had approved 99 projects
for a total amount of TD 157.9 million, of which TD 107.4 million in loans and
TD 50.5 million in equity participations. Commitments amounted to TD 92.2
million while disbursements were TD 61.5 million (Annex 6, Table 3). The
TD 157.9 million approvals have involved projects costing in total nearly
TD 1.1 billion, which underscores STUSID's cofinancing objectives (Annex 6,
Table 4). STUSID finances mainly large companies; of the 71 projects financed
by mid-1984 1/, 27 (or 38Z) were each of a cost higher than TD 10 million, and
47.7% of total approvals were for projects costing more than TD 5 million
each. At the same time, 37 projects of less than TD 5 million investment were
also approved (involving a total of TD 18.9 million), which indicates that a
substantial number of smaller projects also benefit from STUSID's assistance.
Two of the larger projects financed by STUSID (and BTKD) have received
financial assistance from the Bank (SOGITEX and SOFOMECA). STUSID's
involvement in tourism is limited to three large projects so far, all
cofinanced with Saudi partners. STUSID has also lent to three financial
institutions (BNDT, BNDA and a leasing company jointly promoted with IFC), and
financed a large urban renewal project in SFAX. Of all projects financed, six
have majority Government ownership (3 in energy, and 3 in urban development);
STUSID's participation in some of the large industrial projects has also
permitted the Government to withdraw from those projects. A considerable
number of STUSID projects are joint ventures, for which it was possible to
attract capital from Arab and other sources and obtain technical and/or
marketing assistance. Altogether 63% of STUSID's approvals are for industrial
projects. STUSID has approved 18 projects in the EMI sector for a total of TD
32.4 million, of which TD 10.2 million in equity participations and TD 22.2
million in loans; approvals of EMI projects account for 31.4% of total
approvals for industrial projects.
5.42     Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1984, STUSID's loan and equity
portfolio amounted to TD 60.4 million, of which TD 35.5 million in loans and
TD 24.9 million in equity participations. During 1984, disbursements for
industrial projects represented 79.4% (TD 13.5 million) of total
disbursements, and disbursements for EMIs amounted to TD 4.1 million, i.e.,
24.1% of total disbursements or 30.3% of disbursements for industrial
projects. A relatively large fraction (49.5%) of STUSID's equity portfolio
was in industry. As of late 1984, STUSID had no loan in arrears, and
maintained a TD 0.3 million provision for risks, or 0.5% of the total
outstanding portfolio. STUSID plans to gradually increase its provisions to
reach 3% of its outstanding portfolio.
1/ As of the writing of this report, detailed data as of December 31, 1984
were not yet available.



- 45 -
5.43     Financial Position and Profitability.  STUSID's financial position is
sound (Annex 6, Tables 5 and 6). Of its TD 100 million share capital, TD 70
million has been paid in, the remainder is to be paid in over the next two
years. The bank is not planning to borrow on the international market before
1986. Its liquid assets (about TD 22.5 million) are invested in the money
market at an average rate of OZ. In early 1985 STUSID raised its lending
rates by 1X to 12X for loans up to 11 years, rising to 132 for loans with a
maximum duration of 15 years 1/. The bank's net income amounted to TD 3.0
million in 1983, and TD 4.6 mullion in 1984, corresponding to 5.9Z and 6.5Z
returns on average equity 2/ respectively (Annex 6, Table 7). These returns
are relatively low due, to a large extent, to the fact that STUSID invests a
large portion (33X) of its portfolio in equity participations (para. 5.34).
Returns on these investments are and will remain low over the next few years,
as they mostly relate to newly created companies, which generate limited
income in their first years. During negotiations, STUSID confirmed its
agreement (as given under the recently approved Export Industries Loan) to
have its accounts audited by an auditor satisfactory to the Bank.
5.44     Forecast of Operations.  STUSID's loan approvals are projected to
grow slowly from TD 21.3 million in 1984 to TD 38.0 million in 1988 (Annex 6,
Table 8). Equity participations are forecast to remain at about one third of
total approvals, averaging about TD 17.5 million a year. Approvals of EMI
projects are expected to increase slightly over the next two years, then level
off at about 36% of approvals of manufacturing projects. Total commitments
for the period 1985-1988 are projected at TD 169.0 million (about TD 92.5
million less than BTKD, and TD 16.8 million less than BDET).
5.45     Financial Projections.  Interest income (Annex 6, Table 9) is
projected to increase at about 34.4X p.a. during the 1985-1988 period,
essentially as a result of the growth in loan portfolio (the latter will more
than triple between 1984 and 1988, from TD 35.5 million to TD 121.2 million).
Simultaneously, the average rate on lending is assumed to rise progressively
from 12.80X in 1985 to 13Z in 1988. By contrast, dividend income would
represent a modest share of total income as returns on investment are expected
to remain low until 1988 (para. 5.43), though on a rising trend (they would
increase from 1.9K of average equity portfolio in 1984 to 3.1% in 1988).
Despite rapidly rising income, the return on average share capital would
slightly decrease in 1986 and 1987 (Annex 7, Tables 10-11), mainly for 2
reasons: (i) in order to meet its resource requirements (para. 5.46) STUSID
would need to resort to long-term borrowings, starting 1986, thus incurring
substantial financial expenses; and (ii) provisions for risks would have to
increase substantially in order to follow the rapid expansion of the loan and
1/ After accounting for the payment of interest 6 months in advance and the
commitment fee, taxes and cormissions charged to the borrowers, these
increases would result in effective rates to borrowers of 15.1% and 16.4K
(for nominal rates of 12Z and 13X respectively), provided borrowers pay
interest 6 months in advance as stipulated in the loan contracts.
2/ Because STUSID is a relatively young institution, with still a modest net
income (relation to its net worth), the rate of return on share capital
should remain for a few years a better indicator than the rate of return
on equity.



- 46 -
equity portfolio (para. 5.43). However, the return on average share capital
would remain close to or higher than 7%, which is considered satisfactory for
a recently created development bank with a relatively large equity portfolio.
Resort to long-term borrowing will not substantially affect STUSID's financial
position as its debt/equity ratio will remain well below 1:1 until 1988, with
the debt service ratio at about 3% (Annex 6, Table 7). Nonetheless STUSID
should become increasingly sensitive to the cost of resources and therefore
confirmation was obtained during negotiations that (as agreed under the
recently approved Export Industries Loan) STUSID's structure and level of
interest rate will be reviewed with the Bank every year, by December 31 at the
latest.
5.46     Resource Requirements.  Total resource requirements for the 1985-1988
period wv4sl. account to TD 179.5 million (US$216.2 million), of which TD 107.6
million (US$1:9.6 million) would be in foreign exchange and TD 71.9 million
(US$86.6 million) in local currency. Foreign currency requirements would be
partly covered by payment of the remaining subscribed capital, by multilateral
sources (IBRD), and through an issue of TD 25 million (US$30 million) on the
international market, leaving a foreign exchange gap of TD 55.1 million
(US$66.4 million). The proposed loan of USW15 million (TD 12.5 million) would
cover about 23Z of the foreign exchange gap and would help STUSID in its
resource raising efforts. Local currency requirements would be essentially
covered by cash generation, loan collection and share capital increase, as
shown in the Table 5.3 below.
5.47     These financial projections are based on the assumptions that
interest rates on the international market would evolve favorably as present
trends seem to indicate. However, as the situation may change over the next
few years, STUSID's resource requirements would need to be reviewed with the
Bank on a regular basis. As agreed upon under the recently approved Export
Industries Loan, this would be done at the time of the annual review of
interest rates by STUSID and the Bank (paras. 4.12 and 5.45); this was
confirmed under the proposed project.

B. Technical Assistance Institutions
5.48     Under EMI-1, the need :o accompany promotional efforts with technical
support services was addressed. The Bank loan included a $2.0 million
technical assistance component 1/ to create two semi-public autonomous
institutions under the aegis of the Ministry of National Economy (MNE), the
Centre Technique des Industries Mecaniques et Electriques (CETIME) and the
Institut National de la Normalisation et de la Propri6te Industrielle
(INNORPI).
CETIME
5.49     Created in late 1982, CETIME first addressed the needs of two
priority subsectors, steel structure/platework and mechanical works, where
needs for technical assistance were high. Starting with those subsectors,
with a view to addressing other sectors later on, CETIME was to provide
primarily the following type of services to EMI enterprises:
(a) In-plant guidance and trouble-shooting to resolve production problems
(e.g., reorganize plant layout and work flow; identify and remove
bottlenecks; make recommendations to improve product quality;
demonstrate more appropriate and efficient practices with regards to
machinery/tools utilization and maintenance).
(b) Assistance to firms on rationalizing existing product mix, adapting
and adopting new and appropriate products and technologies, planning
and preparing expansion (or new) investments.
(c) On-the-job training of technicians, in-plant demonstrations of tools
and techniques, and advice on design/improvement of tools and dies.
5.50     To ensure that CETIME be effectively responsive to the needs of firms
in the sector as well as to encourage these firms to call on CETIME, 4 of
the 9 appointed members on CETIME's Board, including its Chairman, are
representatives from the private sector; with three of them from small- and
medium-size firms. The General Director of CETIME also comes from the private
sector; he is qualified and has extensive technical and managerial
experience. At its creation, CETIME appointed a core staff of eighteen
Tunisians (6 engineers and 12 technicians) assisted by eight foreign experts
(at a cost of about USl.10 million equivalent, all inclusive, for 193
man-months of services), headed by a senior engineer who assists in the
management of CETIME and the formulation of its program, and composed of two
production engineers (one experienced in steel structure/plateworks, and the
other in mechanical works), one product development/design engineer, and four
senior technicians (experienced in welding, mechanical works, tooling and
dies, respectively). By late 1984, CETIME had also hired 20 Tunisians (12
engineers and 8 technicians). CETIME is well organized (in 4 Sections:
Machining, Welding, Electricity & Electronics, Quality Control & Development)
and well run, has evolved sound working methods and has developed a good
system for recording its activities. They bill clients for their services,
V/ Which also financed the Effective Protection Study on manufacturing.



- 49 -
and have been able this way to cover nearly 40% of their 1984 operating costs
(which amounted to TD 560,000). They plan to bring this ratio to slightly
above 50% in 1985.
5.51     In 1983 and 1984, CETIME carried out respectively some 15 and 20
technical assistance interventions, which on balance were successful.
CETIME's development, however, is limited by its still rather ineffective
integration in the whole process of EMI projects identification, design,
development and operation. EMI firms are not sufficiently informed of the
existence of CETIME, nor of the scope and type of services that this agency
can provide. CETIME sits on the Board of API which delivers authorization to
invest in particular projects; however, the project profile on the basis of
which this is done, is far too preliminary (as regards production technology
and process) for this examination to provide a real opportunity for CETIME to
offer its services and demonstrate its competence. A potentially more
effective intervention could be when a project is about to be approved by a
development bank. CETIME as well as the three development banks agree on the
desirability to bring CETIME more systematically and effectively into the
process by which a project is approved, its design finalized, its execution
started and its operation launched. During negotiations, the development
banks committed themselves to involve CETIME in project identification,
appraisal and supervision each time CETIME could make a contribution.
5.52     Meanwhile, CETIME has developed plans to expand, improve and
diversify its services and facilities. This program would be financed under
the proposed project and is described in paras. 6.20-6.22 and Annex 7.
INNORPI
5.53     The need for Tunisia to have a national standardization institute has
been acknowledged since the late 1970s, and the Bank EMI Sector review
(1979-80) recommended that such an agency be created.  In July 1980, the MNE
set up in its Directorate General for Industries a Standardization and Quality
Control Division to prepare standards. In less than a year and with limited
means, a dozen standards (of which seven for EMI products) were prepared in
close cooperation with the manufacturers concerned, and about seventeen more
EMI standards came under preparation. Out of this experience, emerged a
consensus among manufacturers on the need to set up a national institute for
developing standards on a larger scale and at a faster pace, and ensuring that
these standards be adhered to. In March 1981, the Tunisian authorities
formally established the Institute as a semi-public, autonomous agency under
the aegis of MNE. It is responsible for preparing and issuing standards in
cooperation with manufacturers, and for ensuring that goods are produced in
accordance with them.
5.54     INNORPI began operations in 1981 with a small staff of about ten
technicians aiming for the production of about 30 standards in the first year
(with EMIs as a priority), while adapting a greater number of existing
international standards. Under the EMI-1 project (Loan 2113-TUN), INNORPI
obtained the technical support of three foreign experts (at a total cost of
about $245,000 for 26 man-months of services), and preparation of standards



- 50 -
promptly accelerated. The first expert advised MNE on the main orientations
and priorities of the standardization program, and made concrete
recommendations on the Institute's scope of activities, administrative
organization, work procedures, staffing and budget; he also prepared the terms
of reference of the two other experts (one in standardization, one in quality
control) which subsequently came for about one year each.
5.55     INNORPI has now a staff of more than 55 professionals, and is ready
to deliver to goods that have passed successfully the required tests,
certificates of conformity to the standards formulated by INNORPI. To do so,
INNORPI will rely on existing laboratories to perform the necessary tests and
controls, and may occasionally opt for having testing facilities of its own.
This program would be financed under the proposed loan, and is described in
paras. 6.23-24 and Annex 7.
5.56     Both CETIME and INNORPI, being under the control of the MNE, submit
every year (by late October/mid-November) to the MNE, their operation and
budget forecasts for approval. The two agencies are expected to operate to
the largest possible extent on a commercial basis. CETIME (which can already
cover about half of its operational expenses with the revenues) and INNORPI
(which will eventually raise some revenues, once it starts delivering
"certificates" to products made in the country and meeting INNORPI's technical
standards) should be able to gradually reduce their dependence on public
funding, but will probably have difficulties achieving financial autonomy in
the medium term. In the meantime, the type of accounts that they have kept so
far belongs more to the civil service tradition than that of commercial
accounting, and should therefore be substantially revised. Similarly, they
are expected to obtain agreement in principle from the MNE on their management
policy and their financial management; it appears, however, that they are not
free to charge the actual cost of the services that they provide to industrial
firms. In practice, CETINE has been charging only for the time spent by its
staff on assignments, and for a very small fraction of its overheads. Give'A
that both CETIME and INNORPI are still at an experimental and pilot stage,
this policy is reasonable. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
CETIME and INNORPI accounts would be regularly audited and submitted to the
Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01).

VI. THE PROJECT
A. Project Justification, Objectivea and Components
6.01     Project Justification.  In the face of the anticipated decline in oil
revenues and the foreseeable persistence of employment problems in Tunisia,
the need to stimulate further the development and diversification of
industries, and EMIs in particular, is clear. However, a significant fraction
of industries in Tunisia (including EMIs for consumer goods) have developed
under the protection provided by substantial custom duties, import
restrictions and investment licensing, and with the support of direct
subsidies. This has not incited entrepreneurs to strive to achieve higher
efficiency, increased productivity and optimal use of existing capacity. Thus
the need exists to maintain and strengthen the objectives of the EMI-L Project
(para. 3.22), and to move further towards a gradual liberalization of
Tunisia's industrial development and trade policies in the context of this
loan and our economic and sector dialogue.
6.02     Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
build upon those pursued under the EMI-l Project. The project would
(a)  promote the development of EMIs, by financing through BDET, BTKD and
STUSID, the creation, expansion and modernization of viable
enterprises in priority subsectors; and
(b)  further foster efficiency in the EMI development, in three
complementary ways:
'i) assist CETIME to expand the areas where it provides technical
assistance, guidance and on-the-job training to EXI firms;
(ii) help INNORPI initiate its certification activities (which will
make effective the technical standards that it has already
formulated) and establish its technical assistance and audit
program on quality control, in order to facilitate local
integration and improve exports; and
(iii) introduce further improvement to the EXI protection policy
framework to incite firms to achieve more promptly competitive
levels of efficiency and productivity.
These objectives are consistent with those which the Government has set for
the EMI sector for the Sixth Plan (1982-86).
6.03     Project Components.  The project would be supported by a loan of
$54.0 million to the Govern'3ent of Tunisia which would pass on the loan
proceeds to:
(i) BDET ($20.0 million), BTKD ($15.0 million) and STUSID ($15.0
million), through subsidiary loans to cover part of their resource
needs for the financing of eligible EKI projects; and



- 52 -
(ii) CETIME ($2.1 million) and INNORPI ($1.9 million), as grants to
finance the extension of foreign technical assistance services and
the creation of new laboratories and operational sections.
B. Financial Assistance
Financing of EMI Subprojects
6.04     Pipeline of EMI Subprojects (Annex 3).  The three development banks
(BDET, BTKD and STUSID) selected to be financial intermediaries under this
project have financed a significant number of EMI projects in the past, and
maintain a pipeline of projects already approved or under preparation in this
sector. The proposed loan would meet the financial resource needs of these
banks in amounts and proportions that take into account the banks' respective
past experience in financing EMIs and existing pipeline of EMI projects, as
well as their resource situation.
6.05     During the 1979-84 period, BDET has approved an average of 19 EMI
projects per year, for a total amount of TD 53.5 million (about $64.4
million). After a light slowdown in 1983 in the pace at which EMI projects
were being approved, BDET expects a significant recovery in 1985-86.
Investments in 1987-1988 are also expected to be larger than in the
immediately preceding years, as preparation of the Seventh Plan (1987-91)
would help identify new projects. Approvals of new and extension EMI projects
would amount to an estimated total of TD 44.7 million 1/ ($53.9 million
equivalent) over the 1986-1988 period. About 42% of the EMI loans extended by
BDET to EMIs over this period would be covered by the proposed $20.0 million
loan.
6.06     During the 1981-84 period, BTKD financed 48 EMI projects and approved
a total of TD 47.6 million (about $57.4 million). As of mid-December 1984, it
had a pipeline of another 18 projects, for which expected loans would amount
to a total of TD 32.3 million (about $38.9 million). Considering that this
pipeline does not include extension projects, but that it would extend into
1986 for effective approval of some of the EMI projects listed, it was
estimated that, over the 1986-1988 period, BTKD would probably approve about
18 EMI projects for a total of approximately TD 34.8 illion (about $41.9
million) 21. Thne proposed $15.0 million loan would therefore cover
approximately 45% of BTKD loan financing in the EMI sector over the mid
1985-mid 1988 period. As for STUSID, which approved a total of TD 36.7
million (about $44.2 million) for 20 ENI projects since its creation (1981),
forecasts are for approvals of new and extension projects to amount to about
TD 31.9 million in total ($38.5 million) 3/ over the same period. The
proposed $15.0 million loan would thus correspond to 58% of the loans extended
by STUSID to EM¢ firms.
1/  Of which about TD 40 million would be for loans, and the rest for equity
participations.
2/  Of which about 80% is loans, and the rest is equity participations.
3/ Of which about 67% is loans, and the rest is equity participations.



- 53 -
6.07     From the lists of EMI projects approved in 1984 by BDET, BTKD and
STUSID and those considered for possible approval in the future, it appears
that a substantial fraction of the project opportunities recently brought to
realization or maturity (Annex 3, Table 1, Mechanical works) derive from past
projects undertaken in particular subsectors, e.g. foundries (SOFOHECA) and
small engines production (Complexe Micanique de Tunisie, CMT). In the future,
greater promotional efforts should be spent by the three participating banks
to foster the development of two subsectors in particular still underdeveloped
in Tunisia (para. 3.11): (i) hardware goods (e.g. faucets, hand tools) where
economic plants could be justified by the local market (despite its small
size) with only a limited complement from exports in neighboring countries;
and more importantly, (ii) the electric and electronic subsector where, it is
estimated, substantial potential exists for such goods as small motors,
transformers, cables, switches and panels. During supervision of the proposed
loan, the Bank will encourage and support (as in the electronic subsector) the
financial intermediaries to improve, expand and organize the promotion of
projects in these subsectors. This aspect will also be reviewed during
supervision of the Technical Assistance loan (para. 2.17) with CNEI which is
currently preparing a number of studies in these subsectors.
6.08     Eligibility Criteria for Subprojects.  The proposed loan would
finance the cost of imported machinery and equipment to be procured under
eligible EMI projects, estimated to average about 55% of the total investment
cost. Eligible projects would necessarily meet the following requirements:
Ca)  be in the private sector, i.e. involve firms where the State holds
(directly and indirectly) less than 50% of the equity;
(b)  not cost more than *20 million each;
[c)  involve priority subsectors defined below (para. 6.09), or else
exhibit a clear relevance for export (i.e., for new enterprises, at
least 30X of the production should be, or expected to be sold abroad,
and for existing ones, 50% of the incremental production); and
(d) meet the test of minimum FRR and ERR of 12% and OZ, respectively.
These criteria are similar to those agreed upon under the EMI-1 Project.
Furthermore, to ensure that the proposed loan finances a significant number of
projects, subloans should not exceed $2 million if the project is financed by
only one of the participating banks, and should not add up to move than $4
millior. if the project is cofinanced by more than one of these banks. (This
should encourage cofinancing, while maintaining the objective of using Bank
funds over a relatively large number of projects). Assurances to the above
effects were obtained during negotiations.
6.09     The latest field survey suggests no basic change to the conclusions
reached in 1980 on the relative positions of different production lines (by
nature of '-he goods produced) vis-&-vis the levels of protection, domestic



- 54 -
resource cost and financial and economic rates of return (para. 2.13) 1/.
Priorities adopted under the proposed project would, therefore, remain
basically the same -- agreement to this effect was obtained during
negotiations (Loan Agreement, Section 4.07) -- as those under EMI-1 project,
i.e., capital and intermediate goods (para. 3.11) for which tariff duty
protection is limited to 18% (or 21%, in the case of steel structure and
platework products). In the case of priority goods protected by quantitative
restrictions (QRs) on import, the following further condition would also
apply, as under the EMI-1 project:
(a) for the first three years of production, the manufacturer should sell
at a price not exceeding 118X (or 121Z when applicable, see above) of
an international reference price; and
(b) after the third year, if the above selling price cannot be held, the
Government would start authorizing import of competitive goods
representing each year an ever greater fraction of the local demand.
6.10     As noted earlier (paras. 2.15 & 3.21), the Government and the Bank
will be jointly reviewing Tunisia's trade and industrial policy on the basis
of the work undertaken recently by the Industrial Sector mission (January
1985). The discussions with the Tunisian authorities are expected to take
place in 1985. In line with agreements under EMI-1 and the need to liberalize
imports, only tariff protection at maximum levels of 18X (or 21% for the steel
structure and platework subsectors) will be allowed for new El¢ goods
manufactured in subprojects financed under the proposed line of credit. In
exceptional cases, justified on an individual basis by a development bank in
consultation with the Bank, other protection may be granted, but only for a
maximum period of five years from the date of first production. Each
subproject appraisal will provide detailed information on protection
arrangements for the subproject output.
6.11     Appraisal Standards and Format.  For each EMI project to be financed
under the proposed loan, an appraisal report will be prepared by the bank
concerned, or the leading bank if several banks are involved as cofinanciers,
and submitted to the Bank for authorization. Because most EMI projects are
relatively complex each participating bank will be requested to submit to the
Bank an appraisal report for each of the first three projects considered for
financing under the Bank loan. Subsequently each bank will have a free limit
of US00.75 million equivalent. These .:eports would cover inter alia:
1/ Namely, (i) the more protected the production, the higher its domestic
resource cost and the lower its rate of return;
(ii) the productions primarily oriented to the domestic market
(essentially productions of consumer/durable goods, as opposed to capital
and intermediate goods) are the most protected; and
(iii) enterprises in public ownership are involved in productions
that are significantly more protected than others.



- 55 -
Ci)  the description of goods to be produced;
(ii) the ownership structure of the enterprise involved;
(iii) the investment costs (total and foreign exchange) and its components
(by procurement item), as well as the project financing plan;
(iv) a detailed market analysis (local demand, domestic production and
imports, export potential), and marketing arrangements;
(v)  a full description of the protection on the goods to be manufactured
(in terms of duties and taxes, as well as quantitative restrictions/
import licensing when applicable as described in paras. 6.09 and
6.10);
(vi)  an estimate of the number of jobs created (and, therefore, an
estimated average cost per job created), and a special review of the
merits of the project technical design 1/ when this average cost is
larger than TD 20,000;
Cvii) a detailed study of the financial and economic viability of the
project, including the computation of FRR and ERR 2/; and
(viii) a detailed analysis of the cost of imported inputs integrated in
goods manufactured in Tunisia and financed under the project.
6.12     Terms of Subproject Financing.  The participating banks would charge
a minimum interest rate of 12Z p.a. to subprojects financed under the proposed
loan. The rate charged to subborrowers will be reviewed annually by the
development banks and the Bank (paras. 4.12, 5.22, 5.30 and 5.45). The
maturity of the subloans to EMI firms would not exceed 14 years, including a
grace period of 3 years. The final date of submission of subprojects for Bank
approval would be June 30, 1989.
6.13     Procurement and Disbursements.  BDET, BTKD and STUSID procurement and
disbursement procedures are satisfactory; they require in particular that
subborrowers obtain at least three price quotations from suppliers/
contractors. The banks' appraisal reports usually justify the equipment to be
purchased and provide details on its technical characteristics, the names of
the suppliers considered and the prices quoted. Procurement and disbursement
will be carried out in accordance with these procedures. Assurances to this
effect was obtained during negotiations.
1/ If the production process envisaged involves potential hazards, the
appraisal report will deal with environment/health impact and safety
measures.
2/ For the latter, all outputs and tradable inputs (including capital
equipment) will be valued at border prices, whereas appropriate conversion
factors will be-applied to non-tradable imports (e.g., land, building and
labor). Justification will be provided for both border prices and
conversion factors.



- 56 -
6.14     Procurement for equipment under the CETIME/INNORPI project component
will only involve equipment purchase and would be done in the same manner as
above (i.e. taking account of three price quotations from suppliers), because
this procurement will essentially involve a great variety of pieces of
specialized equipment (e.g. for laboratories), of modest individual cost and
in very limited quantities (mostly, a single unit or two).
6.15     Proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance about 55Z of total
investment costs of subloans (para. 6.08); disbursements would be made against
100% of the CIF cost of imported items, 70Z of the cost of goods previously
imported, 60% of the cost of construction, and on a case-by-case basis, the
justified cost representing the imported part of goods manufactured in
Tunisia. Under the CETIME/INNORPI project component, disbursements would be
made against 100% of foreign exchange expenditures and 70% of local
expenditures for equipment and technical assistance. Disbursements would be
made on the basis of standard documentation as detailed in the Bank's
disbursements procedures, except for expenditures below $20,000 for which
disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures. The Closing
Date would be June 30, 1992. The estimated disbursement schedule of the Bank
loan, established on the basis of the historical disbursement profile, is
given in Annex 10.
Financial and Related Covenants
6.16     Onlending Terms.  The Bank loan proceeds would be onlent by the
Government to the banks, in local currency, at the standard variable interest
rate. Each bank would pay a commitment fee of .75% p.a. on the unwithdrawn
portion of its line of credit, and would repay the loan to the Government
according to the composite amortization schedule of the subprojects financed
under its subsidiary loan. Signature of subsidiary loans between the
Government and the three developments banks, satisfactory to the Bank, would
be a special condition of effectiveness.
6.17     The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk as indicated in
para. 4.13. However, in the context of the review referred to in the same
para., this arrangement should gradually evolve toward a framework where
subborrowers would assume part of this risk. Similarly, the need to assure
the banks with a reasonable spread would also be addressed in the context of
this review (para. 4.12).
6.18     Reporting, Accounts and Audits.  All three participating banks will
have their accounts audited every year by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
these audited accounts will be furnished to the Bank within six months
following the close of the fiscal year (Project Agreement, Section 4.02).
Participating banks would prepare semi-annual progress reports on all
subprojects until the end of their third year of operation. These reports
would indicate the performance of individual subprojects against the
performance anticipated at the time of subproject approval (production, sale,
financial situation), as well as follow up measures to improve the actual
performance. BDET, STUSID and BTKD have provided detailed supervision plans
for 1985, satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 5.04, 5.26 and 5.40).

C. Support to Technical Assistance Institutions
CETIME
6.19     As indicated in para. 5.51, CETIME is planning to extend the range of
its services into two new branches and expand further the services that it
already provides in the mechanics branch. These plans would essentially
involvs:
(a) the opening of a mechanics laboratory;
(b) the creation of a Metal Tools section for Foundries;
(c) the opening of a small Electronics division; and
(d) the extension of foreign technical assistance services.
Details on these four components are presented in Annex 7.
6.20     The above plans will require the purchase of a number of pieces of
equipment, machinery, tools, measuring and other instruments (Annex 7). The
aggregate foreign exchange cost component of these purchases (including
contingencies) is estimated as follows:
Mechanics Laboratory                             i400,000
Metal Tools for Foundries Section               *788,000
Electronics Division                            *621,000
Extension of Technical Assistance               $288,000
subtotal                               $2,097,000
rounded to $2.1 million
6.21     About 32Z of the above cost is due to professional services (9
man-years in total), which are essential to help CETIME deliver quality
services in established, as well as new fields. The employment of at least
two of these experts is a condition of loan disbursement on the assistance
component (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1). The experts will be engaged in
accordance with Bank guidelines on consultants.
INNORPI
6.22     INNORPI has performed well under the ENI-1 Project and must now begin
providing control services (starting with the control of measuring instruments
in use in the country) and delivering Certification to products of the EMI
sector (para. 5.55). For this purpose, INNORPI has submitted a program of
development for its facilities which includes the creation of a service of
metrology and the opening of a laboratory to test EMI products. Foreign
technical assistance services would also be needed. Details on this program
are presented in Annex 7.



- 58 -
6.23     The estimated foreign exchange expenditures (including contingencies)
on account of purchase of equipment or services is expected to amount to $1.9
million as follows:
Metrology section                                    $216,700
EMI Laboratory                                     $1,427,800
Extension of Technical Assistance                    $247,500
Subtotal                                     $1,892,000
rounded to $1.9 million
6.24     The employment of at least one of the experts needed by INNORPI is a
condition of disbursement of the assistance component (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1). The experts will be engaged in accordance with Bank guidelines
on consultants.
D. Project Benefits and Risks
Benefits
6.25     The EMI-2 loan should be instrumental in tapping further the
country's potential in the development of electrical and mechanical
industries. Through realizing part of the country's potential in EKE
development, this financing would help achieve better integration, thus
contributing to a strengthening of this priority subsector. Simultaneously,
the project should help alleviate some of the pressure on the country's
balance of payments, since some import substitution should result from the
development of EMIs in the country, and therefore, a lesser share of the
country's consumption of EME goods will need to be met by imports in the
future. Also, the country should be able to expand further its export in a
number of EMI subsectors, thus increasing the inflow of foreign currency.
6.26     The project has a major focus on institutional building.  First, it
would contribute in a significant manner to train further the recently created
development banks in project appraisal and supervision. Secondly, it would
strengthen CETIME, and help it disseminate technical know-how throughout the
EXI sector. At the same time, INNORPI's activities will foster better
sectoral integration and expanded exports, by gradually improving quality.
6.27     Finally, under the proposed project BDET should be able to achieve
significantly higher levels of overall efficiency in the future, when its
supervision practices are substantially improved to provide BDET's management
with detailed, reliable information on individual loan performances and with
advance warnings of upcoming problems. Ihese improvements should lead to a
significant reduction of the level of arrears through implementation of the
agreed upon action program. The loan will also help BDET in mobilizing
resources in the international markets.

Risks
6.28     This project presents no special risks.  The only risk stems from the
need to establish EMI growth in exports, since the domestic market is too
limited, in many cases, to justify an economic scale of production. This
should lead to more emphasis on, and quality of market analyses, as well as to
a greater concern for marketing. On both counts, development banks will have
an important role to play; and along with them, the Bank, through its
supervision activities.  Hovever, the performance of the EMI sector (and its
exporters as well) in the last few years, is encouraging and testifies to the
ability of local entrepreneurs to realistically identify opportunities and
secure their share of the identified markets. On balance, therefore, the
risks appear reasonable and well worth taking.

SECOND EHI PROJECT
Pipeline of EMI Projects
1.       The three participating banks (BDET, BTKD and STUSID) have submitted
suaury project sheets on (i) the projects already approved as of late
November 1984 by their respective boards that might be submitted for Bank
refinancing under the proposed project, and (ii) the projects not yet approved
the feasibility of which is still being assessed (wiether these projects have
been submitted to the bank by potential investors, or would be promoted by the
bank itself).
2.       A number of projects were taken out of this pipeline because they
pertained to one of the following:
i  consumer goods (e.g. refrigerators 1/, ice making appliances 2/);
(ii)  the automobile industry (e.g. ISUZU pick-ups, and OPEL commercial
vehicles 3/, off-road vehicles);
(iii)  goods essentially produced for export, and therefore of greater
interest for the Export Industries Loan (e.g. electronic
components 4/, car radiators 5/, parts for car engines 6/, low
tension electric panels 7/, burners, industrial forge); and
(iv) projects previously reviewed and rejected by the Bank (e.g.
SOFOMECA extension, ship-repairs 8/, cast iron tubs, agricultural
machinery 9/).
3.       On the other hand, the pipeline (Table 1) includes three projects
that would call for particularly careful scrutiny (if bank appraisal reports
are submitted to the Bank for approval) in view of existing reservations
regarding the effective feasibility of these projects; these are:
(i)  mini steel mills (considered by BTKD and STUSID), conceived along the
model of the small mills that have proliferated in Northern Italy
over the last decade and are thriving;
(ii) specialized industrial vehicles (approved by BTKD, and considered by
BDET), needs to be further investigated with regards to expected
sizes of series and feasibility of such sizes; and
1I/ Firms: Le Confort, and Tunisian Cold; 2/ Technogel; 3/ Industries
Mecaniques du Maghreb; 4/ Tunirama and COMEL; 5/ Tunisie-radiateurs;
6/  STUFOM, Vege Moteur and UMEL; 7/  Tunisie 6lectro technique;
I/ SOCOMENA; 9/ C0T.

Page 2
(iii)  small weaving looms (considered by BDET), would concern production of
cloths and fabrics of strictly regional (i.e. Maghreb) interest as a
substitute to traditional handicraft productions.
4.       A salient feature of the above pipeline, whether in its firmer part
(i.e. 21 EMI projects approved) or its less secured elements (i.e. 31 EMI
projects still being reviewed or prepared), is the clear predominance of
projects in the mechanical works subsector: 52.4% of approved projects, and
61.3% of projects yet to be approved. Basic metals come second with 14.3% of
approved projects and 22.6% of projects to come, and electrical industries
come third with 14.3 and 17.9% respectively. The hardware subsector comes
last, falling from 19.0% of approved projects to 3.2% of future projects. The
above pattern is somewhat disturbing as some of the industries (relatively)
poorly represented in the pipeline have been idertified as offering attractive
development opportunities; notably, electrical and hardware industries.
Concerted efforts should thus be made in the future to promote these two
subsectors in particular. In both subsectors, industries can have an
attractive labor content and it should be relatively easy to penetrate
regional markets. Assurance that this promotional effort will be undertaken
will be sought during negotiations.
5.       Overall the pipeline includes a majority of projects of modest to
moderate capital intensity which should contribute in a significant manner to
meet the Government's objective of creating more jobs. This will be closely
followed through project appraisal reports ~nd the data that these should
include (para. 6.12). A good proportion of the projects included in the
pipeline pertain to goods that are either already produced in Tunisia or in
the same category as goods already produced. Therefore, the techuological
processes involved in their production should not give particular problems,
and the main concerns that should remain relate to (i) the size of potential
markets for these goods, (ii) the marketing arrangements that these projects
will include, and (iii) the economic feasibility of the size of operations
that the above markets would justify. Past experience in similar EMIs invites
cautious optimism. The detailed review of subprojects appraisal reports
(occasionally, in consultation -.ith IND and IFC) will remain the decisive test.
6.       As for the overall pipeline expected for the outer years (i.e. 1987
and 1988) where subprojects would still be submitted -,nd approved under the
proposed loan, estimates were developed on the basis of (a) general operation
forecasts of the participating banks, and (b) the shares in these operations
that would involved manufacturing industries, and within this particular
portfolio, that which would involve EMIs. Estimates are shown in Table 2.

7T The interest rate on loans not including commissions is 11.85%, the high
rate is due to high commission amount received on a small loan portfolio.
The effect is reduced next year when the loan portfolio will more than
double.

SECOND ENI PROJECT
Technical Assistance Component
1.       The need to have a national standardization institute was
acknowledged in Tunisia in the early 1970s. Yet it is in July 1980 only that
the Ministry of National Economy (MNE) created in its Directorate General for
Industries (DGI) a Standardization of Quality Control Division to prepare
standards 1/. The success of this Division was prompt and bright, and less
than a year later (March 1981) the Government decided to formally establish
the Institut National de Normalisation et de Propriete Industrielle (INNORPI)
to speed further the preparation of standards and to promote with Tunisian
producers the search for quality and adherence to Lhe standards established.
2.       The need in Tunisia for the State to occasionally provide technical
assistance to local entrepreneurs was acknowledged even before that for a
national standardization agency, and in 1971 the Centre de Pilotage de
l'Outillage (CPO) was created in Sousse to provide training and to design and
fabricate tools and dies needed by enterprises. CPO, however, soon started
suffering from a deterioration in its financial as well as human resources,
and eventually resolved to concentrate on the production of dies only. It
took the 1979-80 Bank's EMI sector review to revive the concern for technical
assistance to firms, and in late 1982 the Centre Technique des Industries
M&caniques et Electriques (CETIME) was created under the Bank financed ENI-1
Project (approved in March 1982). CETIME absorbed the CPO, and started
operation with a focus on two priority subsectors, steel structure/platework
and mechanical works, planning to branch out later on onto other ENI
subsectors. CETIME was established to provide three types of support services
to EMI enterprises:
Ci)  in-plant guidance and trouble shooting (on such questions as plant
layout, bottlenecks, usage and maintenance of tools and machinery);
(ii)  assistance in rationalizing product mix, selecting (and adapting)
technologies and inputs, as well as planning/preparing expansions
(and occasionally new creations); and
(iii)  on-the-job training of technicians, in-plant demonstrations of tools
and techniques, and occasionally, design and improvements of such
tools.
1/ This creation was eventually triggered in part by the recommendation made
by the Bank in its EMI sector review (1979-80) that the country have a
standardization agency.



102                              ANNEX 7
Page 2
3.       Thus both CETIME and INNORPI received financial and technical
assistance and became operational under the EMI-1 Project. Their performance
under the Project was very satisfactory, so that both now envisage to expand
and further improve the services that they provide to firms: CETIME would
create two new sections (on metal tools for foundries, and electronics) and
open a mechanics laboratory, and INNORPI would begin testing locally made
products against previously established standards and delivering certificates
of conformity.
CETIME
4.       By late 1984, CETIME had a permanent staff of 12 engineers and 8
technicians organized in 4 sections: Machining, Welding, Electricity, and
Quality Control and Development. CETIME is well run by a qualified manager
coming from the private sector. CETIME has been assisted by a team of eight
foreign experts 1/ headed by a senior engineer (who assisted CETIME
management) and composed of 2 production engineers (steel structure/platework,
and mechanical works), 1 product development engineer and 4 senior technicians
(welding, mechanical works, tooling, and dies). in 1983 and 1984, CETINE
carried out some 15 and 20 technical assistance interventions respectively,
all recorded in detail and rather successful. CETIME charges firms for the
services that they receive (essentially for the time spent by the staff on
assignment and a small fraction of overheads) and was able this way to cover
40% of its 1984 operating costs.
5.       CETIME has prepared an expansion program, reviewed and found
satisfactory by the Bank, involving:
(i) the opening of a Mechanics laboratory;
(ii)  the creation of a Metal Tools for Foundries section;
(iii)  the opening of a small Electronics division; and
(iv)  an extension of foreign technical assistance services.
6.       Mechanics Laboratory.  The main objectives of the laboratory would
be:  (a) to provide firms with control services on their processes and final
products; (b) to assess the properties of the materials in the production
process and the changes undergone in that process; (c) to help adapt
production technologies and processes; and (d) to control the equipment being
used. The need to open this laboratory was identified through the first two
years of CETINE operation, and the first development phase of the laboratory
was designed after a survey of CETIME's present as well as potential clients
was carried out. This first phase would focus on four basic themes and
involve the purchase of the equipments listed below.
1/ Over a two-year period, i.e. for a total of 193 man-months for a total
cost of about US$l.10 million.



- 103-                            ANNEX 7
Page 3
Theme                                Equipment Needed
1. Materials composition                Spectrometer, binocular microscope.
2.  Materials hardness                  Measuring equipment for metal lumps
(Rockwell, Vickers, Brinell), coating/
facing, and elastic response 'Shore).
3.  Metrology
(control of dimensions for          Ultrasonic and electric micrometers,
parts/coats/diameters, of           section analysers, gears control
shapes for cams/gears/wings,        equipment (for profiles, paces and
of flatness and roughness).         threads).
4.  Surface treatment
(chrome, nickel, copper,            Ovens (4000C) for adhesion tests,
cadmium, heat or electronic         continuity testing and corrosion
galvanization,plastic coating,      testing equipment.
painting).
The costs involved were estimated at the following;
Materials composition                    TD 160,000
Materials hardness                       TD  50,000
Metrology                                TD  80,000
Surface treatment                        TD  30,000
whole Mechanics Laboratory:         TD 320,000
(or Us$ 385,500 equivalent; rounded at $400,000).
7.      Metal Tools for Foundries.  With the exception of the two largest
foundry plants in Tunisia, all others depend on imports for meeting their
needs as regards metal tools. These tools are essentially of four types: (i)
model plates (for use of sand matrices); (ii) parts in non-ferrous metals;
(iii) shells for gravity tapping of parts in light or copper alloys; and (iv)
molds for pressure tapping of the same parts as above. These tools would be
produced by CETIME at the old CPO in Sousse, which should involve designing,
fabricating, and in-plant testing the tools, and would require the creation of
a small specialized operational unit. This creation would call for the
purchase of equipment needed for the design stage (estimated at about TD
30,000) and equipment for the fabrication, the latter estimated to cost about
TD 370,000 as follows.

-  1 high power milling machine          estimated at TD 100,000
-  1 high accuracy milling machine                        100,000
-  1 electro-erosion cutting machine                      100,000
-  1 melting pot oven                                      15,000
-  control measure implements                              10,000
-  1 tool polishing machine                                30,000
Miscellaneous small tools                     about TD 15,000
Total:     about TD 370,000
To establish the above mentioned Unit, CETIME would need to be assisted for
two years by an engineer specialized in tools design and testing and a senior
technician (with particular expertise in tools design). Their respective
foreign exchange cost 1/ would amount to $7,500 and 4,500 per month and the
total foreign exchange cost of their technical assistance would come to
$288,000.
Establishing the "metal tools for foundries" section would thus cost:
Design                        TD  30,000
Fabrication                   TD 370,000
Subtotal                   TD 400,000
or about $481,900; rounded to      $500,000
Technical Assistance                               $288,000
Total                                         $788,000
8.       Electronics Division.  This division would aim ac providing three
types of services:
(a) designing and testing prototype of programmable electronic implements
which are increasingly needed for industrial production controls;
(b) assisting in the design and fabrication of custom printed circuits
and chips; and
(c)  helping existing entrepreneurs in the electronic subsector
(essentially in kit assemblies) expand their technological
involvement.
1/ Representing about 85% of total cost.



-105 -                        ANNEX 7
Page 5
A. Implements for industrial applications.
Designing and testing such prototypes would require the purchase of
(i)  the following equipment:  frequency generator, higher frequency
analyzer, three oscillographs, universal programmer, logic analyzer
and frequency measuring implements, the total cost of which was
estimated at TD 150,000; and
(ii) a stock of components (and accessories), programmable
(microprocessors) and logic/analogic, for a total of about TD 25,000.
B. The design and production of custom chips.
This would require the purchase of equipment for about TD 250,000, as
follows:
(i)  for Design (and drafting),
-   CAD implements, coordinate analyzer, lighting table, and
reproduction equipment
(ii) for Production
(a) mechanical implements; scissors, press, drills of various types
(b) chemical implements  : chains for copper, lead, and gold coating
(iii)  for Welding and Finishing
-   welding machine, milling machine, lathe, brushing machine
(iv) for circuits on either flexible substrata or hybrid, multi-layer
bases; and
(v)  for miscellaneous tools, from common hardware to bending and winding
machines.
C. Finally, CETIME would need some technical assistance to establish and
launch the Division: 1 engineer (specialized in the design and
fabrication of chips, for 1 year, for a foreign exchange cost of about
$90,000.



-106-                          ANNEX7

Thus establishing the Division would cost:
A.  Implements for industrial use      TD 190,000
- Equipment      TD 150,000
- Component      TD  40,000
B.  Chips                              TD 250,000
Subtotal                 TD 440,000
or about $530,800; rounded to   $531,000
C.  Technical Assistance                                  $ 90,000
TOTAL                    $621,000
9.       Extension of Technical Assistance.  CETIME has expressed the wish
that the technical assistance services they have received under the EHI-1
Project be extended; from a team of eight foreign experts for two years, to a
team of four for 1 extra year. The team would consist of
=    1 production/organization/methods engineer, specialized in
electromecanical construction;
- 1 production engineer, specialized in foundries Call metals and light
alloys); and
- 2 senior technicians, specialized in welding and mecanical
construction respectively.
This would represent a total of 48 man-months at an average foreign exchange
cost of $6,000 per month 1/, i.e. a total cost of $288,000.
10.      Finally, the total cost of the CETIME project subcomponent would come
to
Mechanics laboratory                   $  400,000
Metal tools for foundries section      $  788,000
Electronic division                    $  621,000
Extension of technical assistance      $  288,000
TOTAL                              $2,097,000
rounded to $2.1 million.
1/ Based on $4,500 and $7,500 per month of services of a senior technician
and an engineer, respectively.

INNORPI
11.      As planned at the time of its creation (1981), INNORPI began with a
small staff of about ten technicians aiming for the start-up production of
about 30 standards per year (with E-ffs as a priority), while adapting a
greater number of existing international standards. Under the Bank-financed
EMI-1 project (Loan 2113-TUN), however, INNORPI obtained the technical support
of three foreign experts (at a total cost of about t245,000 for 26 man-months
of services) and preparation of standards promptly accelerated. The first
expert advised MNE on the main orientations and priorities of the
standardization program, and made concrete recommendations on the Institute's
scope of activities, administrative organization, work procedures, staffing
and budget; he also prepared the terms of reference of the two other experts
(one in standardization, one in quality control) who subsequently came for
about one year each.
12.      INNORPI has now a personnel of more than 30 professionals and 25
support staff, organized in four departments: Standardization & Quality
Certification, Industrial Ownership & Technological Transfer, Promotion, and
Administration & Finance. INNORPI is managed by a qualified and experienced
engineer. In 1984 their operational budget came to about TD 300,000 of which
INNORPI could cover approximately 15Z with its earnings from services provided
to producers, registration fees and sale of the institute's periodical.
INNORPI has now produced slightly more than 800 standards and is now planning
to begin (i) providing control services (starting with aeasuring instruments
in use in the country); and (ii) delivering "certification"' to products of the
ENI sector (i.e. delivering certificates of conformity to goods that have
passed successfully the required tests against the standards formulated by
INNORPI). To do so, INNORPI will rely on existing laboratories to perform the
necessary tests and controls, and may occasionally opt for having testing
facilities of its own. INNORPI has submitted a program to the Bank for
review; it was found acceptable and is now suggested for inclusion in the
proposed project. It essentially involves:
(a) establishing a service of methodology;
(b) opening a laboratory to test EMI products; and, to support LNNORPI in
doing the above,
(c) securing an extension of foreign technical assistance services.

equipment or services come to the following:
A. "Metrology' section                                   $216,700
