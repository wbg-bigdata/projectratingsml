 ALBANIA/MONTENEGRO - LAKE SKADAR-SKHODER INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM
                      MANAGEMENT PROJECT
                             P084605
                   TF091937 ALB/ TF091939 MOT

                                  Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Albania/Montenegro, Lake Skadar-Shkoder Integrated
   Ecosystem Management Project, TF091937 ALB/ TF091939 MOT, P084605, will be
   partially extended by 3 months from September 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012.

2. Project implementation has progressed well and made publicly acknowledged
   improvements in the transboundary activities for the preservation of the Lake Skadar-
   Shkoder ecosystem. However, one main joint activity was delayed due to some
   technical and organizational issues. The project development objective, to help
   establish and strengthen institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation
   through joint efforts to improve sustainable management of Lake Skadar-Shkoder,
   remains achievable. However, its full achievement would require completion of this
   delayed activity.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to complete the preparation of “Legal
   Harmonization and Bilateral Binding Agreement? and the affiliated operating costs
   (details provided in the attached tables). This Consulting Service includes activities
   related to elaboration of laws/by-laws in Albania and Montenegro in accordance with
   EU Directives on protected areas and to preparation of a bilateral binding agreement
   between the Government of Albania and the Government of Montenegro for the
   protection and sustainable development of Lake Shkoder/Skadar watershed. The
   Recipient approved the related Inception Report on September 20, 2012 and will
   comment on a first draft planned to be delivered mid-October 2012. A final report
   will be discussed and signed by both Project Directors during a one-day stakeholder
   workshop organized jointly in Tirana by end-November 2012.

4. This will be the first extension of the project. There are no overdue audits for the
   project and previous audit reports were found satisfactory to the Bank.
