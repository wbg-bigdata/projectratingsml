                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last project ISR. Project implementation has progressed well and made publicly acknowledged improvements in the transboundary activities for the preservation of the
                         Lake Skadar-Shkoder ecosystem. However, one main joint activity was delayed due to some technical and organizational issues. The project development objective, to help establish
                         and strengthen institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation through joint efforts to improve sustainable management of Lake Skadar-Shkoder, remained achievable at
                         project closing date. However, its full achievement required completion of this delayed activity. Hence, the closing date has been partially extended with 3 months to allow proper

                         a level 2 restructuring) linked to the partially extension of the project closing date with 3 months were received by the Bank on September 21 and 26 respectively. The newly proposed
                         extension of the closing date as December 31, 2012 was prepared and approved by relevant management.

                         The preparation of “Legal Harmonization and Bilateral Binding Agreement? has advanced in accordance with the agreed ToRs, yet it did register minor delays at inception report
                         phase. This specific Consulting Service included activities related to elaboration of laws/by-laws in Albania and Montenegro in accordance with EU Directives on protected areas and
                         to preparation of a bilateral binding agreement between the Government of Albania and the Government of Montenegro for the protection and sustainable development of Lake
                         Shkoder/Skadar watershed. The Recipient commented on a first draft around mid-November 2012. A final report recently prepared will be discussed and signed by both Project
                         Directors during the one-day stakeholder workshop organized jointly in Shkodra on December 20, 2012. The workshop will focus also on the SLC operation manageemnt and the
                         project sustainability beyond closing date.

                         All joint studies and tools for Lake Management have been prepared and finalized by end-September, 2012 (e.g., The Lake Predictive Hydrological Model (PHM), the joint Lake
                         Monitoring Program, the Joint Lake Management Strategy and National Fisheries Plans). The main stakeholders have been actively involved in the preparation and revison of these
                         studies critical for the proper joint management of the Lake ecosystem.

                         In Albania, the rehabilitation works for cultural resources in the center of Shkodra and the stream rehabilitation works have been finalized timely. In Montenegro, the KAP Site
                         Investigation Report with selected BestPractice option for KAP site remediation and the related Environmental Impact Assessment report have been finalized also by project closing
                         date. These documents are now used as input to the technical studies prepared for the launch of new project on industrial waste management in Montenegro. However, in
                         Montenegro, the Vranjina wastewater investment has been canceled since the design work (financed by Government of Montenegro) has not received the final approval by Ministry
                         hence, there was not sufficient time to reallocate respective funds in a sustainable manner to meet the original scope. Also, funds have been canceled for the construction of a visitor
                         center in the National Park due to the delay in finalization of the relevant design (postponed mainly because of the need to update documentation in line with new Urban Law
                         amendments).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Water Administration (MoEFWA) in Albania and the Ministry of Sustainable and Tourism Development (MSTD) in Montenegro confirmed
                         the operational costs for the functioning of the Skadar Lake Commission (SLC) during the last year of project implementation as part of the proposed annual budgets.

                         A stronger binding Agreement that would further strengthen the established structures of SLC and its Secretariat to enable enforcement of joint regulations beyond project closure
                         has been prepared under the Legal Framework Harmonization contract. It will be discussed at a final workshop organized jointly in Shkodra on December 20, 2012. A Memorandum
                         of Understanding (MoU) will also be signed at this workshop between MoEFWA and MSTD for the proper joint use of the Predicted Hydrological Model (PHM).
