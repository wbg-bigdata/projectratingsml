I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Ecosystem and country context. Lake Skadar-Shkoder, the largest lake on the
Balkan Peninsula in terms of water surface, is on the border between Montenegro and
Albania in the Southern part of the Dinaric Alps. Its drainage area is about 5,500 km2,
and it drains to the southeast through the Buna-Bojana River to the Adriatic. The lake’s
freshwater ecosystem with associated wetlands, floodplains, and karstic features,
provides valuable environmental benefits to surrounding communities, and comprises a
national and regional economic and cultural asset. However, the same characteristics
contribute to fragility of the lake’s ecosystem.

2.      During the 1990s, Albania and Montenegro experienced severe economic decline.
This was bad for people’s livelihoods but good for the lake, because it reduced sources of
industrial pollution. Since then, both Governments strived for the revival of the economic
base and attraction of private investments, but they faced several potentially conflicting
development options, including water and nature-base tourism development, hydropower
production, fish extraction, and industrial development. Furthermore, solid waste and
wastewater management was generally weak in the residential areas around the lake.
Also, Albania experienced rapid population growth accompanied by illegal construction
in lakeside areas. However, many factors supported commitment for environmental
protection. National and local governments and local residents in both countries saw
tourism as the main engine for economic development of the Lake Skadar-Shkoder area,
and national spatial and sectoral strategies had identified it as a special interest area to
develop nature, culture, and recreational tourism, which depends heavily on the quality of
environment. These current trends provided a window of opportunity for strategic,
coordinated action to set Lake Skadar-Shkoder on a path of ecological and economic
sustainability.

3.      Government strategy. By the time of the project’s conceptualization and
preparation, the Governments of Albania and Montenegro sought to harmonize their
policies, legislation, and practices with European Union (EU) Directives, including the
EU Water Framework Directive, which sets standards for water quality and calls for
integrated watershed management and transboundary cooperation. In 2003, the
environment agencies of both countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU),
which called for joint monitoring of air, water and soil quality, and pollution; cooperation
in environmental impact assessment; common strategies to develop clean industries and
energy; cooperation to protect the natural environment; creation of a joint regulation to
control international commerce of endangered flora and fauna, industrial and toxic
wastes, and other dangerous substances; joint educational and training activities; and
creation of Working Groups and an Action Plan for implementation of the MoU. In 2008,
a Bilateral Agreement was signed as the legal instrument for joint cooperation for
protection and management of the lake, including the establishment of a Skadar-Shkoder
Lake Commission (SLC).



                                             1
4.      Rationale for Bank involvement. The project built upon, and was designed to
complement the World Bank supported programs in both countries, and was fine-tuned
with the assistance provided by several bilateral partners to Albania and Montenegro for
economic development and sustainable resource use. The Bank involvement in
strengthening institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation of the two client
countries was well justified given the Bank’s experience in implementing transboundary
waters, sustainable tourism development, and natural resource management projects and
a well-recognized comparative advantage among GEF implementing agencies in
downstream implementation phases of action plans. Another argument for the Bank’s
acting as an implementing agency was the proposed project’s direct contribution to the
implementation of the World Bank / German Government supported St. Petersburg
Process, which facilitates debate on transboundary water management problems and
integrated approaches to resolving them.

5.      Higher level objectives to which the project contributes. National and local
strategies and plans in both Montenegro and Albania identified the Lake Skadar-Shkoder
area as a priority for environmental protection, sustainable natural resource management,
and nature/culture-based tourism development. Both sides of the lake are designated as
wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Therefore, the
proposed project was a useful tool for the provision of the direct support to the client
countries in implementing their national plans, abiding by the concluded bilateral
agreements, and meeting their international obligations.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to help establish and strengthen
institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation through joint efforts to improve
sustainable management of Lake Skadar-Shkoder, and the GEO was to maintain and
enhance the long-term economic value and environmental services of Lake Skadar-
Shkoder and its natural resources. GEF Grant Agreements, concluded between the Bank
and each of the two Recipient countries, did not refer to GEO and stipulated PDO only.

7.    To track the progress towards achieving these objectives the following key
outcome indicators1 were proposed:

       Status of key transboundary indicators of lake water and ecological quality
        maintained or improved; and




1
  These are the outcome indicators according to the project results framework, as presented in
Annex 3 of the PAD, and subsequently used in ISRs. Section II Project Description of the PAD
carries an incorrect listing of the key outcome indicators. The four indicators provided in Section
II are not the outcome indicators. They are picked from a larger set of the intermediate outcome
indicators.


                                                2
        Immediate and longer term threats to lake water quality and ecological system are
         reduced on both sides of the border through direct investments, information
         exchange, bilateral planning, and agreements.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.       No revisions were made to the project objectives or key indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      The direct beneficiaries of the project were the communities residing within the
project area, the local authorities, administrations of the protected areas of the lake,
fishermen organizations, and research institutions leading studies related to the lake
ecosystem. Tourist companies operating in the lake area, as well as the satellite small
businesses (catering, handicrafts) were to benefit from the project implementation
through the improved attractiveness of the natural and historic sites of the area. More
broadly, the international community in general would gain from the project because of
the global significance of Lake Skadar-Shkoder.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.     Component 1: Capacity Building for Improved Understanding and Joint
Management of the Lake (Total: US$3.43 million; GEF: US$l.80 million)
This component would build capacity to establish and strengthen institutional cooperation
to operationalize the SLC and its Secretariat. Four technical Working Groups of the
Commission would be established to support priority activities of the Strategic Action
Plan (SAP) including: Planning and Legal; Monitoring and Research; Communications /
Outreach and Sustainable Tourism; and Water Management. The project would support
specific tasks to: (a) create a predictive hydrological model of the lake basin; (b) research
and monitor to better understand impacts of changes in inflowing water quantity and
quality; and (c) harmonize monitoring on both sides of the lake through a publicly
accessible joint database. This component would also support incremental project
management costs in each country.

11.    Component 2: Promoting Sustainable Use of the Lake (Total: US$4.79
million; GEFUS$1.06 million)
This component would promote adoption of sustainable approaches to economic
development of the lake (and its natural resources) by focusing on tourism and fisheries.
It would support environmentally and socially sustainable tourism by improving nature-
and culture-based facilities and attractions; raising public awareness; and providing
technical assistance to local residents considering tourism-based businesses. It would
support sustainable fisheries management by helping to develop lake-wide stock
assessment and fisheries management plans, and by integrating plan results and
recommendations into national plans, regulations, and programs. The project would
provide incentives for fishermen to cease illegal fishing methods and help strengthen
regulatory and enforcement capacity for fisheries management.

12.      Component 3: Catalyze Pollution Reduction Investments (Total: US$11.51
million; GEF: US$l. 69 million)
This component would support selected investments to stimulate pollution reduction
activities: educate and encourage people to replicate demonstration projects of village-
level wastewater treatment and buffer vegetation restoration; and provide TA to catalyze
remediation of the lake’s largest-scale industrial pollution “hotspot.? A demonstration
pilot project for wastewater treatment, based on constructed wetlands, was proposed for
the village of Vranjina in Montenegro, to facilitate education and promote replication. TA
would be provided to the Government of Montenegro (GoM) to prepare a large-scale
remediation investment addressing an industrial “hotspot? at the aluminum plant on
Moraca River (KAP). This would include an inventory of on-site waste; feasibility
study/preliminary design of options for remediation, recycling, and/or disposal; and EIA
of the recommended actions. Restoration of lakeshore buffer vegetation to protect against
siltation and chemical run-off would be demonstrated in Albania. This would include: (a)
restoration of prioritized lakeside groves in erosion-prone areas; (b) implementation of
stream bank erosion control at one site through combined re-vegetation, gabions, and
other small infrastructure; and (c) support to community-driven vegetation and
restoration sites.

1.6 Revised Components

13.    No revisions were made to the project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.      The project underwent one Level 2 restructuring, approved on September 27,
2012. This restructuring was for the extension of the project closing date by three months,
from September 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012. The extension was necessary for
completing the preparation and then signing of several bilateral agreements between the
Governments of Albania and Montenegro on the joint financing, maintenance, and use of
institutional and technical tools of transboundary management of the lake ecosystem and
its resources. Concluding these agreements was important for the achievement of the
PDO.

boundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) was carried out to identify major trends in the
dynamics of lake ecology and its natural resources. The TDA produced information on
the lake’s water quality, some localized pollution hotspots, and condition of fisheries and
avifauna of the lake. It provided inputs for the development of the Strategic Action Plan
(SAP), on which the proposed project components and activities were based.



                                            4
16.      The project design benefited from the existing information on Lake Skadar-
Shkoder water quality represented by a series of monitoring data. Since 1990, research
institutions, predominantly in Albania, carried out fairly systematic monitoring of
chemical and physical parameters of water in the lake. Starting from 2000, a multi-
national consortium of universities based in Albania, Montenegro, Switzerland, and
Germany has been carrying out environmental studies within the framework of the
Integrated Monitoring of Shkodra Lake project. Information on the lake’s fisheries was
more scarce. Data on fish population and distributions up to the late 1980s were
considered reliable, but since then the information has been collected in limited and
discontinuous manner.

17.      Reflection of lessons learned in the design. The PAD mentions multiple sources
of information used for learning lessons from the existing models of cooperative
management of transboundary lakes and seas of Europe. Due to Albania’s involvement,
one of the most relevant examples explored was the GEF grant financed
Macedonia/Albania Lake Ohrid Conservation Project. The main lessons from the
implementation of this project include ensuring that a clear definition of ecological
monitoring criteria is used for tracking achievement of a project’s environmental
objectives; conducting early and intensive public awareness interventions and education
campaigns to achieve stronger stakeholder involvement and participation; creating an
enabling environment for joint decision making by key stakeholders through continuous
facilitation of dialogue, collaboration, and consensus-building; and supporting high
visibility thematic events that are capable of leveraging donor support.

18.     Project preparation was informed by the experiences of a number of other relevant
projects and initiatives for joint management and sustainable use of transboundary water
bodies, including the Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Lake Geneva, Lake Constance, and
Danube River, as well as several natural resource management projects previously
implemented in Albania. A study tour undertaken during project preparation to the
transboundary Lake Neusiedl-Ferto helped to shape the project’s design and to
understand how cooperation can work between countries with substantial differences.
However, adequate conclusions were not drawn from the failure to demonstrate and
promote constructed wetlands under several projects implemented in the past.

19.     Government commitment. Government commitment at appraisal was solid.
Both Montenegro and Albania had adopted national and local strategies and plans which
identified the Lake Skadar-Shkoder area as a priority for environmental protection,
sustainable natural resource management, and nature/culture based tourism development.
Furthermore, both countries recognized the need for transboundary coordination to
achieve these objectives, as reflected in the 2003 MoU, and the 2008 Bilateral Agreement.
Contributions of US$0.74 million and US$8.57 million were pledged by the two
Governments and by local public institutions (National Parks, privatization proceeds, and
municipalities) of Albania and Montenegro, respectively. Commitment was also
demonstrated by the two Governments through their willingness to implement the project
through the designated line ministries within which both countries had appointed a
Project Director (Ministry core staff) and Project Coordinators (project-financed staff).



                                           5
20.     Parallel Funding. Several bilateral and multilateral donors played an important
role in supporting achievement of the project’s objectives by providing parallel funding.
At the time of the project’s appraisal, Austria was supporting tourist infrastructure
development in the Lake Skadar-Shkoder region with the involvement of GIZ. Germany
supported the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Protection of Montenegro
(MoTEPM) in formulating a concept for transboundary development of the lake.
US$112,500 provided by SNV Netherlands for institutional strengthening, stakeholder
participation, and cooperation between the two countries was significant for facilitating
the project implementation. Swiss Government-supported Skadar Lake Forum was a
convenient medium for communication and public outreach. Other aid from the EU and
the Governments of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands covered
regional and spatial planning, water and power supply, waste management,
environmental hot spots, tourism promotion, cultural heritage, traditional agriculture,
handicrafts, etc. - all contributing to the achievement of environmental and development
objectives of the project.

21.     Risk Assessment. Most of the risks associated with the project design were
adequately identified and assessed in the preparation phase. Challenges of implementing
a project in two countries and setting environmental objectives attainable with joint
contribution were correctly assessed as significant. Weak institutional capacity of
implementing agencies was also acknowledged and adequate mitigation measures built
into the project design.

22.     Out of the two most significant interventions, planned under the project for
decreasing pollution stress to the lake, consensus-building on the clean-up of a hazardous
waste dump site near an aluminum plant was assessed as a high risk activity, while
construction of a wastewater collection system and a treatment lagoon was not considered
a risk to the project design. This was one shortcoming in the risk assessment process,
given that installation of waste water treatment facilities is usually controversial for local
communities. Furthermore, constructed wetlands are not yet a conventional technology in
many places that complicates their acceptance by local authorities and communities.
Therefore, including this activity into the project did carry at least a moderate risk.

2.2 Implementation

23.     Project implementation, as well as the progress towards achieving the GEO, has
been moderately satisfactory since the second year of project implementation through its
completion. Part of the planned activities progressed well, producing the expected
outcomes on time, though implementation was not flawless. At the early stage of
implementation, a moderately satisfactory rating was given due to delays in establishing
the institutional capacity within the project implementation units in both countries. Later,
technical issues emerged with two specific investments in Montenegro: construction of a
waste water treatment facility and of a building with joint role of museum and
administrative in the National Park. Issues remained unresolved and investments were not
implemented. Finally, signing of several important bilateral agreements between Albania
and Montenegro, including the one covering recurrent budgetary support to the operation


                                              6
of the SLC, was delayed for about a year, requiring partial extension of the project, and in
the end, occurred ten days prior to the newly established closing date. The lake-wide
zoning and management plan was developed but not adopted during the project life, as
there was no sufficient time remaining for expert review of the documents by the two
Governments necessary for clearing the documents’ signing.

24.     Development Objectives. The Mid Term Review (MTR), held in November
2010, concluded that the GEO remained relevant and no significant changes of the
project design were required. Despite slower than planned disbursement, the MTR found
the project completion feasible by its closing date at the end of September 2012. Good
progress in strengthening institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation was
highlighted with signing of the MoU for the Cooperation in the Field of Environmental
Protection and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources between the Ministry of
Environment, Forestry, and Water Administration of Albania (MoEFWAA) and Ministry
of Spatial Planning and Environment of Montenegro in June 2010. Also, by the MTR, the
SLC had held three meetings making good progress in agreeing on the important
transboundary aspects of the lake’s management. Four joint Working Groups had been
established, funded, and operational. Primary results were reported on stress reduction for
the lake ecosystem: the survey of 2010 showed reduction both in the number of illegal
fishermen, as well as in the overall number of illegal fishing methods used.

25.     The MTR team noted one potential threat to the achievement of the targeted
outcomes. In January-February 2010, Lake Skadar-Shkoder and the town of Shkodra
were heavily affected by floods. Large amounts of silt and trash were introduced in the
lake and its floodplains. Some 15,000 people from the project beneficiary lakeside
communities were forced to leave their homes. The disastrous flood might have a
negative impact on the lake ecosystem and could damage its reputation of a tourist
destination. Subsequent monitoring data did not show a lasting damage to the lake water
quality, and tourist visitation of the lake area was not tangibly affected either, however a
need for improved flood management had been highlighted.

26.     Institutional arrangements. The MoEFWAA and the MoTEPM were the project
implementing entities at start-up. As a result of later institutional changes in the GoM, a
newly reorganized Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro
(MoSDTM) took over the project implementation in Montenegro. Procurement and
financial management services for the project implementation in Montenegro were
provided by a Technical Services Unit (TSU) located in the Ministry of Finance. Each
country appointed Project Directors from the core ministerial staff, and the project-
funded Coordinators. The Albanian Project Coordinator was based in the town of
Shkodra, which proved to be a highly relevant arrangement. Creating and retaining
adequate procurement capacity for the project implementation needs appeared
challenging in both countries, the issue lasting longer in Montenegro. The set-up and
operational rules of the Albanian treasury system hindered transactions from the Special
Account at the earlier phase of the project implementation. The issue was considered
resolved by the time of the MTR, but re-surfaced in the next year before it got finally
settled through the expedition of transactions.



                                             7
27.      Bilateral agreements on post-project joint activities. Albania and Montenegro
signed four bilateral agreements on the joint financing of the lake management
institutions fostered by the project, and the shared use of the lake database, monitoring
program, and the Predictive Hydrological Model. Signing of these documents provides
foundation for sustainable functioning of the established bodies and mechanisms for joint
management of the lake and its resources. One more critically important document on the
establishment of a Shkoder Lake Trans-boundary Park and the adoption of the lake-wide
zoning and management plan was prepared by the project end, but could not be adopted
before project closure. Bilateral signing of this document requires rigorous legal review
by the two Governments, especially because there are already existing national protected
areas on each side of the lake, but differing in categories and regulations.

28.     Construction of the Waste Water Treatment Plant. According to the initial
procurement plan, construction of the waste water treatment plant (WWTP) in the
Montenegrin village of Vranjina should have been commenced in 2009 and completed
early in 2010. Consultant services for the Feasibility Study were commissioned by the
GoM. At the time of MTR in November 2010, the Feasibility Study was still in draft and
required considerable revision. Uncertainty related to the WWTP cost, construction
materials, permitting, and other technical details persisted through 2011. Eventually the
activity was not implemented, as the GoM found the proposed model of WWTP
financially non-sustainable based on the calculation of the economic rate of return on the
investment.

29.     Construction of the migratory bird monitoring station. The Lake Skadar
National Park of Montenegro requested construction of the combined ranger station and
migratory bird monitoring facility. The construction was to be completed in 2010. Lack
of co-financing allocation by the Park administration caused the initial delay of this
activity and the next year amendments to the Law on Spatial and Urban Planning of
Montenegro were passed, posing new technical requirements for the design. Later, the
Park administration secured GIZ support for bird monitoring and asked to reallocate GEF
resources for the construction of an administrative building, including space to host an
ornithological museum. However, works still could not launch, because the official
spatial plan of the area carried a technical error and parameters of the designed building
did not fit into the plan. The error was revealed too late to allow construction before the
project closing date.

30.     Reforestation. Reforestation of Tarabosh Mountain near the Lake Skadar-
Shkoder was planned to protect the lake ecosystem through arresting of slope erosion and
decreasing lake’s sedimentation. This activity progressed well with active participation of
the District Forestry Service and 45,000 seedlings of the native pine species were planted
on the slope. Preparation for cultivating 1 ha buffer plot near Shiroka village commenced
meanwhile. However, a severe fire occurred in August 2011 and destroyed most of the
young plantation. The Government of Albania (GoA) determined a high risk of similar
fires in the future and decided to discontinue reforestation. Cultivation of a lakeshore
buffer site in Shiroka was also found not feasible due to challenging maintenance needs.
Upon agreement with the Bank, the balance remaining for this activity was used for



                                            8
rehabilitating an additional number of streams in Shiroka village, also aimed at
decreasing runoff and pollution of the lake.

31.    Risk. The project was never at risk throughout its life cycle.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.      Design. The project had a well-designed M&E system to track criteria selected
for measuring the impact of the financed interventions. A socio-economic baseline survey
was planned in the first year of the project implementation, to set a reference point for
assessing change in the local understanding of, and engagement in, sustainable tourism
and natural resource management. During project preparation, a one week survey was
undertaken to estimate the number of unlicensed fishermen operating on the lake, and the
frequency of illegal methods of fishing. Results of this survey were later used as a
baseline to follow dynamics of the illegal fish extraction in the course of the project
implementation. A set of basic chemical and physical indicators of the lake’s water
quality were to be chosen to track its dynamics in the first year of the project
implementation. In addition, some specific indicators for evaluating ecological quality
had been suggested at the appraisal stage, such as algal concentration, contents of poly-
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals in
fish tissues, etc. They were also to be agreed about in the early stage of the project life.
However, it had been noted that the project interventions could not influence the lake
water quality in general, and making measurements nearby individual investment sites
was suggested. Two important intermediate outcome indicators appeared in differing
formulation in two tables of Annex 3 of the PAD. This caused certain confusion at the
project completion stage, because the Bank’s ISRs and the present ICR Report used
indicators as worded in the Results Framework (PAD, Annex 3, first table), while the
Recipients picked different formulation of the same indicators from the Arrangements for
Results Monitoring (PAD, Annex 3, second table)2.

33.     Implementation. M&E has been rated moderately satisfactory throughout the
project life. The baseline socio-economic survey was carried out later than scheduled and,
despite the recommendation made at the MTR, did not produce specific indicators of

public attitude to be used for measuring progress. A follow up survey was scheduled for
May 2012, but was not carried out. Recipients’ ICRs use the information obtained from
periodic illegal fishing surveys as a proxy for measuring local commitment to the
sustainable management of the lake’s resources. Two public surveys of the citizens of
Shkodra were carried out in 2011 and 2012 to measure the level of public awareness of
the project and of the joint institutions for lake management. Based on the survey
outcomes, more respondents knew about the Lake Skadar-Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem
Management Project in 2011 than in 2012 (90% and 70% respectively). This survey,
however, is not adequate for measuring the project’s contribution to local understanding
of, and engagement in sustainable tourism and natural resource management, because it
predominantly describes public awareness of the project, rather than commitment to
sustainable resource use.

34.    Changes in the illegal fishing volume were tracked with adequate frequency and
the baseline data were available for measuring progress. The performed studies
demonstrate decrease in the number of unlicensed fishermen in both countries and show
the declining number of illegal fishing methods used. This is an impressive achievement
of the project, because improved management of fisheries allows meeting community
demand for the resource and sustaining fish populations at the same time. The monitoring
plan had some methodological shortcomings. The targets were set for the lake in general,
while progress towards their achievement was measured and results were reported by
country. Also, there was inconsistency between the timing and duration of the baseline
survey and the follow-up surveys.

35.     Lake water quality monitoring parameters had been agreed in 2009, though the
numeric baseline data were entered into the results framework in 2010. All parameters
remained the same in 2011 and 20123. The Recipient’s ICR from Montenegro includes
tables tracking dynamics of water quality tested at multiple points on the Montenegrin
side of the lake. The data show slight improvement, especially in dropping nutrient
pollution levels. However, attribution of these monitoring outcomes to the project
interventions is almost impossible, as mentioned in the PAD. As for water quality
monitoring in the vicinity of investments which might have a positive local impact - that
did not work out. Out of the planned site-specific investments, construction of the
Vranjina WWTP had the highest potential of impacting water quality, but that activity
was not implemented. The other investment, with a likelihood of influence certain
parameters of water quality, had been rehabilitation of streams in Shiroka village. But
works for the stream rehabilitation were completed in the last year of the project life and
no time was left for measuring their impact.

36.    Utilization. The project enhanced lake monitoring capacity in both countries
though the provision of laboratory equipment, training, and the establishment of the joint
database and the lake monitoring program. Bilateral agreements are now signed for the

joint implementation of the monitoring program, which is harmonized with the
requirements of international agreements to which Albania and Montenegro are parties to,
and with the EU acquis; and of the database, hosted at IW:LEARN until 2015 and to be
taken over by the two Governments afterwards. All information on the state of the lake
environment is publicly available for use in planning and decision-making by variety of
authorities and stakeholders.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     The project’s compliance with the Bank’s safeguard policies was reviewed at
entry to ensure that all potential issues had been taken into account in the project’s design.
All relevant safeguard policies were triggered, including: OP/BP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment, OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources,
OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP/BP 7.50 Projects on International
Waterways. The project was rated Environmental Category B and a framework
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the project was carried out and an EIA
report produced. The framework document provided arrangements for performing
Environmental Assessments (EAs) for specific activities under the project should they
require such procedure, and provided guidance on screening of specific activities. The
EIA report did not rule out financing of Category A activities under the project, although
the project was classified as Category B, leaving the project prone to restructuring should
a Category A activity be proposed and selected for implementation. Based on the project
design and the procurement plan, likelihood of any Category A activities was low, and it
would have been preferable to exclude them from the project financing. OP 4.12 was
triggered to address potential social implications of reducing illegal fishing and imposing
stronger regulations for sustaining fisheries of the lake. Process Frameworks were
prepared by both countries to cover this issue. A clear statement was made in the project
documents that its proceeds would not be used for supporting or undertaking demolition
of the existing constructions in the lake area which might be part of the national plans of
the two Governments, and the Process Frameworks did not cover this type of activity.
There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguard policies during
the project life. Safeguard compliance was regularly tracked in the process of the project
implementation and was always been rated Satisfactory.

38.     Rating for procurement under the project varied between Satisfactory and
Moderately Satisfactory. Downgrading in the earlier stage of project implementation was
due to the delay in setting up the project implementation units in both countries.
Deficiencies in procurement capacity lasted longer in Montenegro, where procurement
and financial management services had been delivered by the TSU of the Ministry of
Finance, i.e. outside of the project implementing entity. The issue with hiring a
procurement specialist for the TSU lasted in Montenegro for almost two years. There
were occasional shortfalls in procurement later as well, related to the quality of
evaluation reports and conduct of contract negotiations. The rationale for Moderately
Satisfactory rating in the last year of the project life was the failure to tender works for
the construction of the waste water collection and treatment system and of the
administrative building for the National Park in Montenegro, though the core causes for
not carrying out these two activities were not confined to procurement problems.


                                             11
39.     Financial management ratings also fluctuated between Satisfactory and
Moderately Satisfactory. Once the institutional capacity for financial management got
established in Montenegro TSU, there were no issues encountered later on. A Designated
Account for the project was opened in a sound commercial bank and was smoothly
operated. Acceptable software was used for accounting and financial reporting. Annual
financial statements were being audited by eligible auditors and the audit reports were
being submitted within due dates. All of the issued auditor opinions were unqualified
(clean). On the Albanian side, occasionally during project implementation, concerns had
been raised about the flow of funds from the Designated Account to the Treasury
Account, inadequate documentation of transactions, currency losses, minor ineligible
expenditures, delays in processing payments and financial reporting. Towards the end of
project implementation, all of these issues had been addressed and financial management
remained satisfactory in the last year of the project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.     Operation of bilateral institutions. The project provided support for the
operation of the SLC, its Secretariat, and for the establishment and four thematic bilateral
Working Groups. Also, the project facilitated signing of four bilateral agreements
between the Republic of Albania and the Republic of Montenegro on the financing of
these institutions, as well as on the shared use of the lake management tools produced
under the project. These agreements laid the groundwork for continued funding and
operational support to the created bilateral institutions in the future. However,
sustainability of the bilateral institutions is not guaranteed at this stage, because members’
participation in Working Group meetings was less than desirable, and no Working Group
meeting was held in the last year of the project implementation4. Modest allocations by
the two Governments for SLC operation are now pledged for 2013, while decisions
beyond that time are to be taken in future.

41.    Lake monitoring. The project helped to develop the joint Lake Skadar-Shkoder
monitoring program and the joint database, to be used for tracking key parameters of the
lake ecosystem and facilitating use of the monitoring data for informed decision making
on various upcoming initiatives. Hosting of the database till 2015 is secured from
IW:LEARN and consequent decisions are to be taken by the SLC. The project provided
University of Shkodra with the required pieces of laboratory equipment needed for
tracking key parameters indicative for the condition of the lake environment. As a result,
the University has better capacity for regular monitoring and publishing data on the lake
water quality, and for delivering hands-on training to young specialists of this field.

42.    Protected areas management. The project financed preparation of the
management plan for Shkodra Lake Managed Nature Reserve in Albania for the first time,
to be used and periodically updated in future. A Geographic Information System (GIS)

database was created for use by the administrations of the protected areas for planning
and monitoring purposes. Boats and other equipment provided to these administrations
will serve the needs of patrolling and biodiversity monitoring. A bilateral agreement was
drafted for the creation of a transboundary Lake Skadar-Shkoder Park, and is being
reviewed by the two Governments for the expected signing. Once enacted, the agreement
will significantly strengthen the framework for sustaining viability of the lake ecosystem.

43.     Fishery management. The Albania Fishermen Organization (FMO) and the
newly established fishermen organization in Montenegro, now provided with information
from the joint fish stock assessment, the fishery management plans, and equipment, are
well set for sustainable use of the fish stock of the lake. Establishment of several more
fishermen organizations is expected in Montenegro. A steadily declining trend in the
number of unlicensed fishermen and of the cases illegal fish extraction techniques was
established during the project life, which is an important outcome. However, efforts for
further improvement of fisheries management shall continue beyond project’s closure,
because illegal fishing in Lake Skadar-Shkoder is still an issue, even in the banning
season5.

44.     Clean-up of KAP site. The feasibility study, EIA, and preliminary design for
remediation of the KAP hazardous waste dump site, all produced with the project’s
support, have been discussed and agreed with stakeholders. The GoM and the KAP
agreed on the course of action and financing arrangement for clean-up. The GoM
requested an IBRD loan for the implementation of the Industrial Waste Management and
Cleanup Project, which includes remediation of the KAP site. This project is currently in
the pipeline.

45.    Reconstruction of Besac fortress. The design for reconstruction of the fortress,
produced under the project, was accepted by the GoM. Based on the agreement between
the Ministry of Culture of Montenegro and the EU Delegation, EU funds in the amount of
€0.48 million were allocated for reconstruction, the tender was announced in August
2012, and a Serbian company was contracted for the provision of works in March 2013.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.    The project contributed to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives in
both countries by strengthening public institutions that protect and manage Lake Skadar-
Shkoder, and provided an enabling environment for private sector development in the
tourism sector. The project continued to be relevant in the context of 2011-2014 Country
Partnership Strategies (CPS) of both countries. The Montenegro CPS calls for improving
environmental management and reducing the cost of environmental problems. The

    Final Report, Milieukontakt Albania, January 2013


                                                13
Albania CPS aims at improving conservation, management, and efficient use of the
country’s water resources. The project responded to these priorities with its activities to
strengthen regulation of water, land, and natural resource use that affected lake water
quality and economic value, and contributed to improved environmental services. The
project also contributed to a broader Bank effort to assist Albania and Montenegro in
harmonization of their environmental and natural resource management regulations and
practices with the EU environmental acquis.

47.     The rationale for GEF intervention was well-justified and sound. The project was
designed and implemented in consistency with the IW Strategy for GEF 4, in particular
with Strategic Objective 2 (To play a catalytic role in addressing transboundary water
concerns by assisting countries to utilize the full range of technical assistance, economic,
financial, regulatory and institutional reforms that are needed), and the Strategic Program
3 (Balancing over-use and conflicting uses of water resources in transboundary surface
and groundwater basins). Albania and Montenegro are members of the GEF and the
World Bank. Both countries are signatories to the Barcelona Convention for the
Projection of Mediterranean Sea and its protocols and have developed programs within
the framework of the Mediterranean Action Plan (Lake Skadar-Shkoder drains directly
into the Adriatic Sea through the Buna-Bojana River). Albania and Montenegro are also
signatories to the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a
Transboundary Context, and the Helsinki Convention on the Protection and Use of
Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

48.     The project contributed to maintaining and enhancing the long-term economic
value and environmental services of Lake Skadar-Shkoder and its natural resources. To
achieve this, the project helped the two countries with the establishment and
strengthening of institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation through joint
efforts to improve sustainable management of the lake.

49.     Institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation. The project built
and fostered institutional bodies for the joint management of the lake, including the SLC,
its Secretariat, and four thematic Working Groups. Capacity of the SLC to perform
mandated functions enhanced by the project funded study tours for sharing experience of
the International Commission for the Protection of Lake Constance, the International
Commission for the Protection of the Danube River, and the International Sava River
Commission. However, sustainability of the bilateral institutions will depend on their
lasting financial support by the two Governments. State budget allocations for the SLC a
year prior to the project closing date was established as an indicator of the Governments’
commitment. However, Albania and Montenegro signed a bilateral agreement for joint
financing of the SLC just before the project closing date. Funding of the SLC beyond




                                            14
2013 is subject to future agreement by the two Governments6. Working Groups did not
convene over the last year of the project implementation, which raises concerns about
their viability post-project.

50.     Technical tools for transboundary cooperation. A number of public agencies
and research institutions of Albania and Montenegro received hardware, software, and
training for the creation, operation, and shared use of the joint monitoring program, and
the joint database of the lake. Bilateral agreements were signed between the two countries
in December 2012 on the maintenance, update, and use of these important tools for the
lake’s management. The lake-wide zoning and management plan was developed too, but
not adopted during the project implementation. It will be incorporated in spatial plan
updates once a bilateral agreement is signed on the establishment of Lake Skadar-
Shkoder Transboundary Park and on the adoption of the lake-wide management plan.
The project financed several surveys of the natural and cultural resources of the lake area,
which produced valuable information for the joint management of the lake’s protected
areas and fisheries, and the promotion of cross-boundary tourism in the lake area.

51.     Investments in sustainable resource use. Attractiveness of the Lake Skadar-
Shkodra area for nature and culture based tourism increased through the renovation of the
historic center of the picturesque town of Shkodra located near the lake. The project
provided resources to support the ongoing process of rehabilitation of the town’s cultural
heritage, which has already boosted small business development in the target districts of
the town. A reconstruction plan is developed for the Besac fortress on the Montenegrin
bank of the lake. After completion of works with the secured EU funding, the fortress
area will become another touristic attraction, adding value to the conservation of natural
and aesthetic features of the lake area.

52.     Stress reduction. Targets established in the PAD for the improvement of fishery
management were mostly achieved. In both countries the numbers of unlicensed
fishermen and the frequency of illegal fishing methods obviously decreased. This is a
remarkable outcome of the project intervention, because it reduces risk of the depletion of
fisheries of Lake Skadar-Shkoder, and also proves positive change in the communities’
attitude towards the resource use. For the remediation of the KAP hazardous waste dump
site, not only the preliminary studies and stakeholder consensus building are completed
under the project, but the GoM has already applied for an IBRD loan to finance physical
works for clean-up and waste management at several pollution hotpots in Montenegro,
including the KAP. Demonstration of a pilot WWTP based on constructed wetlands
failed due to the Government’s disapproval of the associated costs derived through the
preliminary studies. Plans for using buffer vegetation against the lake siltation and runoff
were not implemented as designed. Additional number of storm water streams were
rehabilitated instead, also aimed at decreasing lake pollution. However, re-forestation of
the mountain slope and initiation of a community-driven program for cultivation of lake-

 Actual allocations are to be made annually as part of the general budget planning process, based
on the Governments’ fiscal calendar cycle (in both countries fiscal years correspond to calendar
years).


                                               15
shore buffer area would have more significant and longer lasting positive impact on the
lake’s ecosystem than repair and maintenance works on the existing stream canals.

53.       The following results were achieved as measured by key indicators:

54.    The lake water and ecological quality were maintained at the baseline level, as by
the project closure the key physical and chemical parameters of the water quality
continued to be satisfactory by the national standards and according to the European
Council Directives (75/440/EEC, and 78/659/EEC), and the eutrophication status
remained between oligotrophic to mesotrophic.7

55.     The objective of reducing immediate and longer term threats to lake water quality
and ecological system on both sides of the border was achieved partially. The two
Governments established joint lake management structures, the GoM reached agreement
with the KAP on the course of action towards managing the legacy of the KAP hazardous
waste dumpsite, and illegal fishing by lake-side communities of both countries started to
decline.8 The intended establishment of the Lake Skadar-Shkoder Transboundary Park
and adoption of the lake-wide zoning and management plan has not materialized during
the project life, however the documents are drafted and await signing by the two
Governments. The project’s largest investment, aiming at the reduction of point source
pollution of the lake and the demonstration of a good practice in wastewater treatment
system, failed, leading to cancellation of about a quarter of the GEF allocation for
pollution reduction investments. Foresting of the selected mountain slopes near Lake
Skadar-Shkoder to reduce negative impacts of erosion on the aquatic life was initiated,
but did not materialize due to severe forest fire. The Bank and the GoA agreed not to
proceed with the planned community-driven vegetation and site restoration in the
lakeshore zone due to excepted difficulty of maintenance9. The outstanding allocation for

  Actual achievements by the Project closure are 27% illegal fishermen in Albania and 17.7%
illegal fishermen in Montenegro; 8+30 cases of illegal fishing methods registered in Albania
during and beyond the prohibition period, and 103 cases registered over a year in Montenegro.
This is a clear improvement as compared to 43% overall share of unlicensed fishermen and 814
cases of illegal method use over one week Lake-wide, but these data cannot be compared to the
established end values of less than 20% of the overall number of fishermen and less than 100
cases of illegal fishing over one week, due to incompatibility of the measurement parameters used
at the baseline and at the project completion.

pollution of the lake.

3.3 Efficiency

56.     The project was financed with a grant from GEF in order to achieve a global
public good; therefore, calculation of the direct economic rate of return was not attempted
at the time of appraisal. However, economic benefits of the project would include
enhanced sustainability in using natural resources and increased tourism, and increased
tourist visitation to the lake and its surroundings. Also, the project has direct impact on
the efficiency of the national expenditures on monitoring quality of the lake environment
being incurred annually by the Governments of Albania and Montenegro. Both countries
carry out environmental quality monitoring within the lake basin, however, prior to the
project implementation their approaches to monitoring and data collection methods
differed, no common database existed for open and easy exchange of information, and
monitoring programs were not clearly focused on the parameters concerning the lake as a
whole. With the establishment of the joint monitoring program, the Predictive
Hydrological Model, and the joint database of the lake, the same inputs to the
environmental monitoring are expected to produce higher quality outcomes, and the
improved accessibility of the generated monitoring information will contribute to better
informed, balanced, and economically sound planning and decision-making in both
countries.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

57.     Throughout the project cycle the GEO and the PDO, project design, and
implementation remained relevant for the national priorities of Albania and Montenegro,
the Bank’s CASs/CPSs for these countries, and the GEF’s strategic objectives. One of the
global and development targets of the project is fully achieved and the other is achieved
partially, because status of key transboundary indicators of the lake water quality have
been maintained at the project start-up level, and the identified immediate and longer
term threats to lake water quality and ecological system have been partially reduced.
More specifically, the institutional framework for the lake’s joint management has been
created, its basic financial support by the two Governments is guaranteed for 2013, and is
subject to decision for the years beyond. The SLC preformed effectively and remained
operational throughout the project life, while the newly established Working Groups
experienced institutional weaknesses and failed to convene in the last year of the project
implementation10. Technical tools for joint management of the lake were delivered late
and, although operational, they are yet to be applied by the two Governments to the
policy development and decision-making on investments. Extensive background work
has been undertaken and documents prepared for the establishment of Lake Skadar-
Shkoder Transboundary Park and adoption of its management plan for harmonization of
the lake’s management by the two countries. However, the delivery of draft documents

was delayed till the last month of the project life and signing of the bilateral agreement on
the Park and the management plan did not occur before the closing date. It is still pending
half a year after the project closure due to complex procedures required for setting up a
new trans-boundary Park covering the territory with the existing two national protected
areas of differing categories. The project contributed to the lake’s pollution reduction by
preparing an investment into the clean-up of the hazardous industrial dump site in
Montenegro and achieved measurable improvement in fisheries management.
Construction of the pilot WWTP for the promotion of constructed wetlands, as a waste
water treatment technology, did not materialize; and reduction of lake’s pollution through
planting in lakeshore buffer zone was not achieved. All of the above supports moderately
unsatisfactory rating of the overall outcome.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

58.    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Social assessments and survey of fishing practices conducted in the lake area, as well as
the Environmental Assessment of the project - to some extent, covered social aspects
relevant for the project implementation. The pattern of demographic change is clear and
is marked with a strong urbanization trend with shrinking and aging rural population.
Integration with the native residents is not always easy for the newcomers to the urban
settings, while ethnic differences usually do not cause conflicts among Montenegrin,
Albanian, and Serb population of the Lake area. The PAD does not provide any gender
segregated social data. The two potential social issues noted at the project appraisal stage
were a need for fishing pressure reduction on the lake, which might impact livelihoods of
the lake communities, and possibility of Government-led demolition of illegal
constructions around the lake, which might be interpreted as the project supported or
induced activity. Neither of these aspects were problematic in the project lifetime due to
effective planning and application of mitigation measures, public inclusion and
participation being the strongest element of this effort.

59.     Alongside an intense public awareness campaign supported throughout the project
cycle, a matching grant was obtained from the Bank Governance and Anti-Corruption
(GAC) Trust Fund (TF) and its proceeds were used to hire an NGO (Milieukontakt
Albania) which participated in the evaluation of joint project activities, consulted with
local stakeholders, and facilitated reflection of their perspectives over the course of the
project’s implementation. The NGO was active and successful in making public voices
heard by the SLC and the joint Working Groups and integrating interests of local
stakeholders into the work of the lake’s management institutions.

60.    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Institutional capacity building was a central activity under the project: the first
component was dedicated entirely to capacity building for the improved understanding
and joint management of the lake and elements of capacity building were supported
under the other two components as well. Specifically, establishment and operation of the
bilateral institutions for joint management of the Lake Skadar-Shkoder is the main
outcome of the provided institutional support. These include the SLC, its Secretariat, and
four thematic Working Groups. Furthermore, the Albania FMO and the newly established


                                             18
fishermen organization in Montenegro became better organized, equipped, and dedicated
to the sustainable fish extraction practices as a result of the TA provided under the project.
Similarly, capacity of the administrations of the Lake Skadar-Shkoder protected areas
(the National Park on Montenegro side and the Managed Nature Reserve on Albania
side) to patrol the protected territories and to sustainably manage them enhanced upon
delivery of boards and other equipment, training, and development of the management
plan for the Nature Reserve. As a result of the project implementation, technical capacity
of the Shkodra University for monitoring the lake ecosystem improved and availability of
the acquired laboratory equipment for University students improved the quality of
teaching.

61.    (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
The project provided technical assistance to support inventory, feasibility study, its
environmental assessment, and preliminary design for remediating the hazardous waste
dump site at KAP. These outputs were expected to lead to the preparation of an actual
investment in remediation, and the project intended to achieve an agreement between the
GoM and the KAP on the preferred solution and action plan for the site remediation. By
the time of the project completion not only the background studies had been produced
and general agreement reached on the further course of action, but the GoM formally
approached the Bank with the request for an IBRD loan to implement the Industrial
Waste Management and Cleanup Project, which would cover the KAP site among others.
The project concept has been approved by the Bank and expected to go to the Board later
this year. The Lake Skadar-Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Project intended
to facilitate stakeholder’s agreement on the way forward in remediating the dump site,
while its actual outcome exceeded this expectation and led to securing funds for actual
remediation of the site.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.     The project stakeholder workshops were held in Albania in September and
December 2012. Representatives of the national and local governing bodies, protected
areas, NGOs, local communities, and academic circles of both countries spoke positively
about the project’s outcomes. Stakeholders expressed full awareness of the importance of
setting up viable institutional arrangements for the joint maintenance and use of the
lake’s hydrological model, and the monitoring database. A need for producing detailed
terms of reference for the SLC was also mentioned, along with securing its stable funding
by the two Governments, as a prerequisite for its effective operation beyond the project
completion.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

63.     A number of risks were identified in the PAD. Risks of the Governments’
commitment to the preservation of the lake ecosystem weakening under the pressure of
conflicting economic interests, as well as the less than expected growth of tourism or its
development in an unsustainable manner were ranked moderate. Substantial risks
included: weak institutional capacity in both countries, interdependency of the two


                                             19
Governments for joint activities, political constraints to the agreement on the KAP site’s
remediation, and possible demolition of constructions in the lake area being
misinterpreted by the local population as a project-related activity.

64.     Overall, the two Governments were supportive of the lake preservation efforts and
no major compromises of sustainable development principles have been noted. Progress
in preparing and agreeing to the investment in the KAP site’s remediation is also fully
satisfactory. However, the GoM opted to proceed with controversial plans of constructing
hydro-power dams on the Moraca River, which might negatively affect the lake
hydrology and the entire ecosystem. A tender for this construction failed due to the lack
of expressions of interest. Although the Moraca River hydro power project did not come
through this time, it illustrates the risk of existing competition between profitable
investment ideas and certain limitations required for sustaining the lake ecosystem.

65.     Institutional capacity of the project implementing agencies proved to be
problematic, as foreseen, and caused slow start-up and periodically demonstrating
weaknesses in financial management and procurement. Joint implementation of a project
in two countries was associated with challenges of coordinating and fine tuning the
majority of activities, as expected at appraisal. Continued funding from the two
Governments in support to the SLC, its Secretariat, and the four Working Groups is seen
as the decisive factor for viability and success of these institutions. No support was
provided to the Working Groups in 2012 and they could not convene in this last year of
the project implementation. The two Governments made formal commitment for the
provision of modest funding in the amount of €4,000 each for this purpose in 2013,
however, longer-term arrangements for financing are yet to be formalized, which is a risk
to the sustainability of the created institutions.

66.    Finally, establishment of the transboundary Lake Skadar-Shkoder Park and
adoption of the lake-wide zoning and management plan is critically important for
maintaining the long-term value of the lake ecosystem and enhancing its environmental
services. The bilateral agreement for the Park establishment remains under review by the
two Governments. Until the agreement is signed by parties, the future of the Park remains
uncertain.


5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The Bank team was well experienced and knowledgeable, applying successful
global model to local conditions. Much effort went into analyzing available information
and lessons from the establishment and operation of international bodies for joint
management of water bodies elsewhere in Europe. The project was well designed, most
of the associated risks correctly identified, and proper mitigation measures built into the
project implementation arrangements. Only the risks to the quality of non-Bank financed


                                            20
preparatory studies, and stakeholder consent on the placement and construction of the
waste water treatment facility had been underestimated.

68.     The moderately satisfactory rating is mostly due to some weaknesses of the
project’s results framework and arrangements for its monitoring. The PAD noted that the
inputs planned under the project would not produce results to which the status of GEO
indicator could be directly attributed 11 . Therefore, the PAD suggested a narrower
interpretation of the GEO indicator (tracking water quality in the specific investment sites
rather than Lake-wide), however this had not been reflected in the results matrix.
Furthermore, two important intermediate outcome indicators were formulated differently
in the Results Framework and in the Arrangements for Results Monitoring (PAD, Annex
3). This inconsistency caused certain confusion at the project completion phase, because
the set of indicators used by the Bank team in ISRs and in the present ICR Report (as
formulated in the Results Framework) differs from the set of indicators used for the
progress monitoring and the final reporting by the Recipients (as formulated in the
Arrangements for Results Monitoring). Also, Section II and Annex 3 of the PAD carry
inconsistent listing of the key outcome indicators of the project. Some inconsistencies are
found in the project financing plans as presented in various sections of the PAD12.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     The Bank provided adequate support to the project implementation throughout its
life maintaining relevant skill mix and professionalism of the supervision team. The Aide
Memoires provided accurate record of implementation dynamics, issues encountered, and
agreements reached for addressing them. Implementation support covered all aspects of
the project implementation, including fiduciary, procurement, and safeguard aspects. The
Task Team consulted with the Country Manager as appropriate and made full use of the
local expertize of the Country Office based staff. Good working relations were
maintained with the Recipients throughout the project cycle. However, this did not
prevent the preparatory studies and discussions on the construction of the WWTP lasting
too long, resulting in unexpected findings and, eventually, rejecting this activity. The
Bank team should have been more proactive in handling this matter. The Recipient
insisted to keep the construction of the WWTP in the project’s work plan till the closing
date, and despite the involvement of the Bank team, and deadlines established that could
have reduced the period of uncertainty, this did not materialize in re-allocation of the
GEF grant resources and an earlier cancellation of the activity.

  Financing Plan provided on the cover page of the PAD sets the total project financing at
US$19.79 million, while allocations by the project components amounts to US$19.73 million.
Annex 15 of PAD states that the total project financing is US$ 15.7 million.

70.     The Bank team could have more strongly influenced creation and maintenance of
the institutional capacity in the project implementing entities, as well as the quality of
monitoring and evaluation in the course of the project implementation, the latter being
Moderately Satisfactory throughout the project life. Delays and some deficiencies in the
Recipients’ monitoring of the project progress had been noted and recommendations
made, though the quality of M&E and recording of this outcomes did not improve. Also,
the Bank team should have instructed Recipients on the importance of tracking provision
of the pledged parallel financing against the appraisal estimates that had not been
practiced in the course of the project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.    The moderately satisfactory rating is based on the Bank’s moderately satisfactory
performance in ensuring quality at entry as well as during the project implementation.

5.2 Recipient
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.    The Governments of Albania and Montenegro supported the project and
demonstrated good will for joining efforts in the Lake Skadar-Shkoder management. The
signing of four important bilateral agreements on the joint financing of the LSC, its
Secretariat, and the Working Groups, as well as on the shared use of the lake information
systems is a high profile outcome of cooperation between the two countries. The GoA
and the GoM created an enabling environment for participatory conduct of background
studies for the project and for transboundary technical cooperation throughout its
implementation - both unprecedented in the past.

73.    A weaker point in the performance of the two Governments is the delayed
adoption of the lake-wide zoning and management plan. Creating and maintaining
adequate institutional capacity in the PIUs and the TSU of Montenegro was the
Governments’ overall responsibility. There were problems encountered in the provision
of procurement and financial management services at various stages of project
implementation due to insufficient staffing of the PIU and the TSU. Also, the two
Governments provided less than pledged co-financing for the project. The reported joint
cash co-financing amounts to US$272,200, and the in-kind contribution by the two
Governments is estimated at US$170,000, for a total of US$442,000. The appraisal
estimate of Governments’ co-financing was at least US$740,000.13 At the same time, the
two Governments were highly successful in donor coordination throughout the project

life and managed to mobilize parallel financing in an amount exceeding US$28 million
instead of the initially estimated US$5.9 million14.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.    Implementing agencies in both countries delayed creating adequate financial
management and procurement capacity within the project implementation units, causing
slow start-up of the project implementation. Placement of the Albania Project
Coordinator in the town of Shkodra, and the Director in Tirana, was an excellent
managerial decision, given that the SLC works from Shkodra and this town is within the
immediate lake area. The two implementing agencies worked well together, which has
been highly important for technical support and management of multiple joint activities
on both sides of the border. A noted deficiency in the performance of implementing
agencies is that they did not track provision of parallel financing against the appraisal
estimates over the course of the project implementation, and provided rough cumulative
estimates of the received parallel financing after project completion, upon request.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.      The moderately satisfactory rating is based on the moderately satisfactory
performance of the Recipients and the moderately satisfactory performance of the
implementing agencies. The key factor affecting the overall rating is that the two
Governments, although unable to formalize all bilateral agreements within the project life,
clearly demonstrated good will for supporting technical cooperation across the border and
enabled establishment of strong working relations between line ministries, protected
areas, and academic circles of the two countries that were missing in the past, and are
critically important for sustainable management of the lake.


6. Lessons Learned

76.       The lessons learned were:
         It is preferable to finalize a project’s monitoring and evaluation arrangements at
          appraisal, including provision of the baseline data for benchmarking progress in
          the course of implementation. In the initial stage of the project implementation
          efforts were concentrated on getting the key operational functions of the
          implementing entities flowing and organizing other start-up activities, while M&E
          got less attention. Expectations of the baseline monitoring data to be collected and
          organized in the early phase of the project implementation did not fully


14
   Although the parallel financing had not been tracked and recorded in the course of the project
implementation and was estimated after the project close, there is no doubt about parallel
financing being higher than intended, because the actually provided amount (even if not fully
precise) surpasses the expected amount by far.


                                               23
    materialize and negatively affected the quality of M&E throughout the project
    implementation.

   In many of the Bank’s client countries the governments and local communities
    have deficient information on the advantages and disadvantages of using
    constructed wetlands for waste water treatment, and lack trust in this technology.
    Demonstration pilot investments in the construction wetlands had been considered
    or planned under a number of projects in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region,
    but in a number of cases got rejected at the preparation or even at the
    implementation phase. The conclusion is that including establishment of a
    constructed wetland into a project design needs to be approached very carefully.
    Confidence in a true buy-in by the beneficiaries and stakeholders is critical, and
    so is the quality assurance of feasibility studies and designs. It is preferable that
    the latter are covered by the projects and are carried out with the support from the
    Bank’s Task Teams rather than being produced externally, without advise and
    quality control from the Bank.

   Tough decisions have to be made on time if a project activity significantly
    deviates from planned arrangements in terms of its substance or timeline. At the
    project appraisal, completion of the construction of Vranjina WWTP was planned
    by end of September 2009. Challenges faced at the early stage of feasibility study
    and preliminary design hindered further progress of this activity and by the time
    of the MTR in November 2010, the decision on the construction of WWTP had
    not been taken. This status did not change through the end of 2011, though the
    activity remained in the project’s action plan and was rescheduled to commence
    by May 2012 the latest. Less than a year to the project closing date, if not earlier,
    construction of WWTP should have been cancelled, with fair time left for re-
    allocation of the resources earmarked for it.

   Stimulating participation of local communities and NGOs in the process of a
    project supervision, monitoring, and evaluation is advisable as long as the
    rendered support is neutral and does not influence stakeholder opinion. The level
    of public mobilization and ability to make local voices heard is weak in many
    locations where projects are being implemented and may require catalyzing
    interventions. Recruiting a local NGO for enhancing public outreach and
    facilitating feedback on the project progress worked quite well in case of the Lake
    Skadar-Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Project, helping to adjust
    project activities to the stakeholder needs in the course of a project
    implementation.

   It is essential that arrangements for periodic monitoring of the planned support to
    the project from each of the expected sources of co-financing and parallel funding

          challenging task15. This statement proved relevant for the Lake Skadar-Shkoder
          Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. The PAD carries separate co-
          financing estimates of the two Recipient countries and the local sources of the two
          Recipient countries, as well as the expected amounts of parallel funding from
          other donors. Provision of the Governments’ cash contribution had been the item
          recorded in the course of the project implementation, while financing from other
          sources had not been tracked in monetary terms.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Recipient/Implementing Agencies/Partners

77.       (a) Recipient/implementing agencies
The GoM noted in the Recipient’s ICR the denial of five requests for re-allocation of the
project proceeds and for the extension of the project closing date for eight months that led
to failure of the two investment activities planned under the project: construction of the
WWTP and the facilities in the Lake Shkoder National Park. Feasibility study and design
of the WWTP in Vranjina village, based on the constructed wetland technology, took
much longer than expected. Eventually, the GoM found the proposed investment
economically not justifiable based on calculation of the rate of return on the investment.
The GoM turned down the proposed investment and requested a variety of alternatives,
including water purifying “floating islands?, multi-use amphibian machine (dredging,
reed cutting, garbage collection, oil remediation and cultivation), garbage collection truck,
or four additional vessels for the Park ranger service. Rationale for the Bank’s refusal to
pursuing any of these options was that the proposed technologies had either not been well
proven, or would not directly contribute to the reduction of nutrient pollution of the lake.
As for the request for the project extension for the purpose of constructing facilities in the
National Park, an eight-month extension would not have been justified for this single
small activity (estimated at US$40,000).

78.       (b) Co-financiers
Although the project enjoyed donor assistance from Germany, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Austria, the USA, the EU, the Regional Environmental Center, and the
United Nations Development Programme, this support was provided through parallel
financing and there were no co-financiers of the project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

COMPONENT 1: CAPACITY BUILDING FOR IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING
AND JOINT MANAGEMENT OF LAKE SKADAR-SHKODER

The main purpose of the capacity building component was to establish and strengthen
institutional cooperation to operationalize the SLC and its Secretariat, as well as to
establish the four technical Working Groups of the Commission. The SLC was formally
established in February 2008 through a bilateral agreement between Albania and
Montenegro. The project propelled SLC into an active operational mood and supported
establishment of its Secretariat in the town of Shkodra. The thematic joint Working
Groups, each comprising five members from each country, were also created. These
included groups for: (i) Planning and Legal, (ii) Monitoring and Research, (iii)
Communications/Outreach and Sustainable Tourism, and (iv) Water Management. The
Working Groups were structured the way to facilitate implementation of the thematic
activities of the Strategic Action Plan for the lake and actively functioned till 2012.

Under the lead of the SLC, several tools for the joint lake management were produced
under this component, the most important of which are the Predictive Hydrological
Model of the lake watershed, the lake monitoring program, and the joint database.
Bilateral agreements for the shared maintenance and use of these systems were signed by
the governments Albania and Montenegro in December 2012. Based on the study of legal
frameworks regulating lake management in the two countries and ways for their
harmonization, a bilateral agreement on the establishment of Lake Skadar-Shkoder Park
and the adoption of lake-wide zoning and management plan was prepared for signing by
the parties.

Several surveys were carried out which helped to improve understanding of the lake
ecosystem and take informed decisions on the use of its resources. A joint fish stock
assessment was conducted for the second time after twenty five years in Montenegro and
for the first time in Albania, generating valuable data for developing and implementing
fishery management plans. An inventory of the natural and cultural attractions around the
lake pooled information for the promotion of the lake as a tourist destination nationally
and internationally. An inventory of the polluted sites and sources of pollution around the
lake was conducted to help local and national authorities in prioritization and planning of
pollution abatement and clean-up actions, and raised public awareness of the
environmental problems of the lake. A GIS database was created for the use by the
administrations of the Lake Skarad-Shkoder protected areas for the purposes of
management planning and monitoring.

This component also contributed to learning, information sharing, and capacity building
of multiple stakeholders, such as the SLC, Lake Skadar-Shkoder protected areas
administrations, fishermen organizations, University of Shkodra, NGOs, and
communities around the lake.




                                            27
COMPONENT2: PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE USE OF LAKE SKADAR-
SHKODER

The component for promoting sustainable use of the lake aimed to promote balanced
approaches to its economic development and natural resource use, concentrating on
tourism promotion and fisheries management.

Majority of expected outputs were successfully delivered under this component. An
inventory of the natural and cultural attractions around the lake was conducted in both
countries to promote the lake as a tourist attraction nationally and internationally. Site-
specific investments, as well as public awareness events/campaigns were identified and
supervised by the bilateral Working Groups on Planning and Legal, and Communications
/ Outreach and Sustainable Tourism. In Albania, the project contributed to the ongoing
renovation of the historical center of the town Shkodra by rehabilitating facades of
heritage buildings in the selected streets. In Montenegro, the general design was
developed for reconstruction of the medieval fortress of Besac, located on the top of a hill
above the lake. The design was based on the preliminary technical assessment produced
under the EU&EC-supported Regional Programme for Cultural and Natural Heritage in
South-East Europe, and the EU has agreed with the GoM to finance physical
reconstruction works. Delays with approval of the developed design disallowed to
construct an administrative building and a museum in the National Park Skadar Lake in
Montenegro, while other elements of the technical assistance to the Park were delivered
successfully.

Activities for promoting sustainable use of fish stock of the lake were largely based on
the findings of the joint Fish Stock Assessment and the Fisheries Plans produced under
the first component and turned out successful. The project considerably strengthened
capacity of the FMO in Albania by helping in production of five year business plan and
one year action plan to improve fisheries management, and in improving protection of
fish spawning areas, as well as providing equipment to stimulate formalized fishing and
fish marketing activities (boats, outboard motors, nets, IT equipment, refrigerator, and
fuel). In Montenegro, two fishermen organizations were established with the project
support and licensed fisherman received fishing nets as encouragement of practicing
formally permitted fishing techniques. Capacity of the protected areas’ rangers was
enhanced in both countries by provision of equipment and operational support.

This component also supported a public awareness campaign, promotional materials,
craft fairs, the Lake Day, and other events aimed at promotion of sustainable tourism and
resource use.

COMPONENT 3: CATALYZING POLLUTION REDUCTION INVESTMENTS

The component for catalyzing pollution reduction investments was designed to
implement three main activities: (i) educate and encourage people to replicate
demonstration projects of village-level wastewater treatment and buffer vegetation
restoration, (ii) restore water buffer vegetation to reduce sedimentation and runoff into



                                            28
the lake and (iii) provide technical assistance to catalyze remediation of the lake’s largest
industrial pollution hotspot - the hazardous dump site near the aluminum plant (the KAP).

The component had only moderately achieved its objectives. The proposed demonstration
pilot project for wastewater treatment, based on constructed wetland, for village Vranjina
in Montenegro did not materialize. Although the general design for the construction of
this waste water treatment facility was carried out, the GoM claimed the investment to be
financially unsustainable and suggested replacement of the constructed wetland with one
of the alternative technologies suggested by the GoM. This was not feasible due to
inadequacy of some of the proposed solutions and little time remaining till the project
closing date. Therefore, the activity was not implemented.

Re-vegetation of the Taraboshi Mountain slopes facing the Lake Skadar-Shkoder was
undertaken in Albania. Some 45,000 native pine trees were planted on the slope prone to
erosion and preparations were made for cultivating a lakeshore buffer plot near Shiroka
village as well. However, severe fire occurred in August 2011 destroying most part of the
young plantation. As a result, the afforestation was discontinued due to high risk of
similar losses. Community-driven cultivation of the buffer zone was also found not
feasible due to associated challenges of maintenance. Decision was made to use
outstanding resources for rehabilitation of additional number of streams in Shiroka
village, also planned under this component. Cleaning of littered and congested stream
beds and restoring their small infrastructure was carried out successfully, benefitting
villagers and decreasing lake pollution.

Technical assistance for the preparation of investment into the remediation of the KAP
site fully achieved its objective. Preliminary design for the clean-up solutions was
produced and its Environmental Impact Assessment was completed. The GoM and the
KAP agreed on the action and plan and financing arrangement for clean-up. The
Government requested an IBRD loan for the implementation of Industrial Waste
Management and Cleanup Project, which includes remediation of the KAP site. This
project is currently in the pipeline.




                                             29
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project development objective was to maintain and enhance the long-term economic
value and environmental services of Lake Skadar-Shkoder and its national resources. In
the past, both Albania and Montenegro pursued lake management from a predominantly
national perspective with little transboundary cooperation. A forward-looking baseline
scenario, analyzed during the project preparation, showed that it would be increasingly
difficult for the two countries to address mounting challenges to lake sustainability. The
alternative scenario with the provision of the GEF grant funding to implement Lake
Skadar-Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Project would increase efficiency of
the national expenditures on sustaining the lake ecosystem and its environmental services
incurred annually by the GoA and GoM. With the establishment of the bilateral
institutional framework and the development of advanced technical tools for the joint
management of the lake, the same inputs by the two countries would produce higher
quality outcomes, including better informed, balanced, and economically sound planning
and decision making. These results would be attained in case of an alternative scenario
with the provision of GEF grant funding and implementation of the lake Lake Skadar-
Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Project.

The total cost of the GEF alternative scenario was estimated at US$46.6 million,
comprising of US$40.2 million for baseline investments and US$6.5 million for
incremental finance. The project was designed to cover all incremental activities and key
baseline activities. The total project financing numbers do not match well in various
sections of the PAD: the tables in the datasheet provide the amounts of US$19.76 million
and US$19.73 million, while Annex 15 gives the amount of US$15.7 million. The project
was designed with the assumption that significant parallel financing would be provided
by various donors already active in the Lake Skadar-Shkoder area at the time of appraisal
(US$5.90 million), as well as by the local sources of the Recipient countries, such as
administrations of the protected areas and local municipalities (US$8.57 million).

Parallel financing from various sources of funding had not been recorded during the
project implementation and calculations made upon the project’s closure should be
considered as approximate. Despite concerns about the accuracy of reporting, it is evident
that donor organizations as well as the administrations of local municipalities and
institutions made considerable contributions exceeding the estimated amounts of parallel
financing. It is not the case with the Government co-financing, through, which made 60%
of the initially planned amount. It included cash financing and in-kind contribution.

Remarkably, the project outcomes leveraged financing for future activities aimed at
sustainable use the lake’s resources. EU funds in the amount of €0.48 million were
allocated for the rehabilitation of Besac Fortress in Montenegro. Procurement of works is
ongoing. IBRD loan in the amount of US$66 million was requested for the Industrial
Waste Management and Cleanup Project, which includes remediation of the hazardous
dump at the KAP site based on the technical documentation developed under the Lake
Skadar-Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. Concept of the new project
is approved by the Bank and it is currently under an advanced stage of preparation.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Two project stakeholder workshops were held in Albania: one in September 2012 and the
other in December 2012.

On September 20, 2012, the MoEFWAA hosted around table meeting of the project
stakeholders to discuss results and next steps after the project completion.
Representatives of national agencies for biodiversity, water, fisheries, forestry, protected
areas management, University of Shkodra, fishermen organization, Institute of Energy,
Environment and Waters, and Municipality of Shkodra, and NGOs were present in the
meeting. They discussed project achievements and their sustainability. Participants noted
that the establishment of thematic Working Groups has proven to be beneficial for
enhancing linkages between the line agencies, for coordination of their work, and
information exchange. Administrations of the Shkodra Lake Managed Nature Reserve,
University of Shkodra, and Shkodra municipality spoke about benefits of the TA received
from the project and the ways of using their institutional capacity for the joint
management of the lake. Manager of the FMO explained how the project assistance
helped to decrease illegal fishing practice and organize fishermen communities for
sustainable extraction and marketing of fish. Several participants talked about the newly
developed tools for joint lake monitoring and management, discussing details of their
future administration and use. Securing sustainable funding for the bilateral institutions
set up for the joint management of the lake was acknowledge to be the most critical
element of the project sustainability and long term success.

On December 20, 2012, the project closing conference was held in the town of Shkodra,
Albania. It was attended by a wide range of stakeholders from Albania and Montenegro.
Participants acknowledged success of the Lake Skadar-Shkodra Integrated Ecosystem
Management Project in boosting cooperation between the two countries sharing the lake,
as well as in facilitating working relations between individual agencies involved in the
lake management inside the countries and across the border. Representatives of the two
Governments confirmed their commitment to the lake conservation and sustainable use.
Albanian Government declared its intention to work towards including Shkodra Lake into
the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) list
of the nature heritage sites. Participants agreed that the bilateral institutions for the lake
management established with the project assistance would be instrumental in future
decision-making on the strategic approaches to the lake management and on the
investments for sustainable development of the lake area. Discussions covered the
proposed status of the Transboundary Natural Park, and the operation of SLC and its
secretariat post project. The conference closed with signing of four bilateral between
MoEFWAA and the MoSPEM on the joint maintenance and use of the Predicative
Hydrological Model, the lake monitoring program, and the lake database, as well as on
the allocation of operational funds for the SLC and its secretariat.

Porject Objective and Its Relevance
The GEO was to maintain and enhance the long-term economic value and environmental
services of Lake Skadar-Shkoder (LS) and its natural resources, and the PDO was to help
establish and strengthen institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation through
joint efforts to improve sustainable management of LS. These objectives were well set,
because LS as a shared water body can be managed only jointly through joint institutional
structures and implementation of joint management documents and systems. The project
objectives were well achieved through joint efforts of both countries represented by the
MoEFWAA and the MoSDTM.

Project Design and Implementation Arrangements
Project activities were designed through a participatory process involving a lot of national,
local, and transboundary stakeholders; in conformity with the legal framework of
Albania; with consideration of all national and local plans on environmental protection
and economic development; and respecting all treaties, conventions, Memoranda of
Understanding, agreements etc. to which Albania is a signatory and the EU Directives to
which Albania is an aspirator of accession in the short term future. The project
implementation was a direct responsibility of the MoEFWAA and MoSDTM, through the
Project Implementation Units (PIUs) established in each country, local governments, and
local level institutions including protected areas administrations, scientific institutions,
NGOs, fishery organizations, artisans associations, and local communities around the
lake. In general the project implementation was characterized by an active national and
transboundary participatory and involvement process.

Project Outcomes and Achievements
In general the project has achieved all its objectives in the transboundary and national
level. The transboundary objectives included:

a)     The establishment and strengthening of institutional mechanisms for
transboundary cooperation to improve sustainable management of Lake Skadar-Shkoder.
Outcome: Skadar-Shkodra Lake Commission (SLC), Secretariat and technical Working
Groups on Planning and Legal; Monitoring and Research; Communications/Outreach and
Sustainable Tourism; and Water Management are established, are functional and
operational.

b)      Preparation of joint management and monitoring documents for Lake Skadar-
Shkodra.
Outcome: Lake Management Strategy and Fisheries Plans, monitoring program,
Predictive Hydrological Model, joint database are prepared, approved and committed for
implementation by both countries.

c)      Creation of synergies and avoiding overlapping of activities in Lake Skadar-
Shkodra through organization of donor conferences.
Outcome: Two donor conferences were organized, synergies are created and overlapping
of activities are avoided.



                                            36
d)      Promotion of Lake Skadar-Shkodra as a tourist destination
Outcome: Two joint public awareness campaigns have been implemented, rehabilitation
of facades in the cultural heritage street in Shkodra has been done, and preparation of a
joint inventory of natural and cultural attractions has been prepared.

The national level objectives were:

a)     Planned management of the lake.
Outcome: Preparation of the Lake Management Plan and provision of equipment for law
enforcement in support of this plan.

b)      Promotion of pollution reduction.
Outcome: A public awareness campaign to protect water quality associated with cleaning
activities and, rehabilitation of two streams near the lake as sources of pollution have
caused reduction of pollution to the lake water.

c)      Promotion of sustainable fisheries.
Outcome: Preparation of a business plan for the Fishermen Management Organization,
provision of equipment and fuel to strengthen their management capacity, financing for
the protection of spawning areas which resulted in a considerable decrease in illegal
fishing.

Recipient and Partners Performance
Operational experience during the project life can be considered successful. The PIUs in
both countries, stakeholders, and beneficiaries contributed to the smooth operation of the
project at the national and transboundary levels. The two countries, represented by the
implementing ministries - MoEFWAA and MoSDTM - managed to agree on all aspects
of these activities from the beginning until finalization and approval of each joint activity.
The Albania PIU was established at the very beginning of the project implementation. It
was staffed with qualified professionals who have demonstrated high degree of
dedication and commitment to achieve project objectives and timely implementation of
the project activities. The PIU established and kept a very good cooperation and
communication with the PIU in Montenegro and all other stakeholders. The MoEFWAA
remained fully satisfied with the performance of PIU under it. Ministry of Finance of
Albania ensured smooth and timely flow of the Project funds and facilitated financial
audits of the GEF Grant books and accounts.

World Bank Performance
WB team made notable efforts and was highly committed to a successful outcome of this
project working jointly with the Government and local stakeholders to implement the
project activities and achieve the outcomes and objectives. The WB provided very good
guidance and supervision of all project activities, and worked in close collaboration with
other donors to coordinate activities, create synergies and avoid overlapping. Twice per
year WB conducted supervision missions to evaluate the status of activities and put tasks
for improvement of the ongoing activities and timely implementation of upcoming



                                             37
activities. The WB did this in complete consultation with the stakeholder and
beneficiaries, MoEFWAA, counterpart Montenegrin institutions and donors operating in
Lake Shkodra directly or indirectly.

Arrangements for Post-Project Cooperation
The joint institutional structures like SLC, its Secretariat, and the thematic Working
Groups, established with the project support, will continue operation based on the
agreements signed between MoEFWAA and MoSDTM in 2008, 2010, and 2012.
Detailed arrangements are in place for joint activities and information sharing with the
use of Predictive Hydrological Model, the Lake Management Strategy and Fisheries Plan,
monitoring program, and the joint database.

Achievement of Project Objectives
The GEO was to maintain and enhance the long-term value and environmental services
of Lake Skadar/Shkodra and its natural resources, and the PDO was to help establish and
strengthen institutional mechanisms for transboundary cooperation through joint efforts
to improve sustainable management of Lake Skadar/Shkodra. Both objectives - the GEO
and PDO - have been achieved: (i) Immediate and longer term threats to lake water
quality and ecological system are reduced by finalization of site investigation, Feasibility
Study, independent Environmental Impact Assessment for the remediation of improperly
stored hazardous waste in KAP dumpsite, and developing various tools for future
integrated management of the lake watershed area; (ii) Status of key transboundary
indicators of Lake water quality and ecology are improved, as the majority of the basic
water quality indicators have been recorder within Class 1A (or better class A) during
project implementation, and monitoring data for years 2008-2011 indicate constant trend
of improvement of water quality; and (iii) Bilateral Skadar-Shkodra Lake Commission
and four Working Groups have been operational, and during period of project
implementation they adopted development and water use decisions/actions that
eventually led to the singing of four new bilateral Agreements in December 2012
contributing to the integrated management of shared resources.

Achievements by Project Components
Component A. Capacity building for Improved Understanding and Joint Management of
the Lake:
 SLC comprised of 3+3 high-level members established and operational;
 Secretariat for SLC and Bilateral Working Groups established and operational. These
    Working Groups include: Planning and Legal; Monitoring and Research;
    Communications / Outreach and Sustainable Tourism; and Water Management and
    each member group is comprised of 5+5 members officially delegated from relevant
    Institutions;
 Working Groups monitored/improved and proposed more than 11 joint activities in
    the framework of the project;
 Financing for the future functioning of the joint bilateral bodies (SLC, SLC
    Secretariat and Working Groups) agreed among Governments;
 PHM for the Skadar-Shkoder Lake Basin Area completed and adopted;
 Hydrological model being used to predict possible impacts of the proposed four
    developments on the Lake: a) development of a new hydropower infrastructure on
    Moraca river, b) dredging of the Bojana/Buna River, c) pollution from land-based
    sources and d) extreme event analyses;
 Joint Lake Management Strategy, including National Fishery Management Plans for
    each country, completed and adopted;
 Joint Lake Skadar/Shkoder monitoring program prepared with special attention to the
    monitoring requirements from international agreements and respective EU acquis;

                                            38
Component B. Promoting Sustainable Use of the Lake:
 General design for reconstruction of medieval Besac fortress on the Lake shore
  completed;
 Number of registered illegal fishermen on Montenegrin side of the Lake decreased
  from 58% (in 2009) to 21 % (in 2010) and 17 % (in 2011);
 Two joint public awareness campaigns conducted with over a dozen activities held;
 Capacity building on the National Park Skadar Lake conducted thought one year
  support of one officer for tourism and one officer for local communities to the
  National park Skadar Lake administration. After year of financing from the Project,
  one officer has been permanently employed by the National park authorities.

Component C. Catalyze Pollution Reduction Investments:
   Technical assistance provided to the Government for implementing activities related to the
    remediation of KAP hazardous waste dump site and capacity of Environmental Protection
    Agency strengthened for implementation of Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control
    legislation;
   KAP Project Steering Committee established and 14 meetings held for discussing
    activities toward remediation of KAP site which resulted in an unanimous adoption of
    the proposal for remediation for KAP hazardous waste;
   KAP hazardous waste categorization study and options analysis conducted. Based on
    their outputs, a feasibility study/preliminary design for remediation of KAP
    hazardous waste dump site produced and adopted;
   Independent Environmental Impact Assessment on the feasibility study for KAP
    hazardous dump site conducted and the report adopted after two public consultations;
   GoM applied for IBRD financing for reducing environmental and public risks of five
    selected industrial waste disposal sites in country, including the KAP hazardous waste
    dump site.
Recipient and Partners Performance
The GoM closely collaborated with all stakeholders in order to achieve proper ownership
of project and secure future sustainability of project results. MoSTDM, through the PIU
under it, had the overall responsibility for project implementation. Montenegro Ministry
of Finance, through the TSU, performed procurement and financial management
functions. Low capacity of PIU and TSU in the early phase of the project implementation
caused slow start-up, but was overcome in the second year of the project life. Change of
the Project Coordinator at around the project mid term was also an issue that impacted
project implementation, as a couple of months were spent on the selection and
contracting of the new Coordinator. National Park Skadar Lake has established and kept
very good cooperation with Montenegrin PIU from the very beginning of project
implementation and contributed to the successfulness of some project activities.
Cooperation with MoEFWAA, City of Shkodra, FMO, and other stakeholders from Albanian side,
especially the Albania PIU, was smooth and fruitful.       All of joint activities have been
implemented without any constrains.

Bank Performance
The Bank team supported project activities with regular supervision, which is highly
appreciated, and by providing valuable inputs, comments, guidelines and


                                             39
recommendations that improved project outcomes as well as the capacity of project
related country structures. The Bank team played crucial role in management of project
risks and timely implementation of the original plan of activities. However, achievement
of goals of the two activities which failed (construction of a waste water treatment facility
in Vranjina village, and construction of the ornithological station in the National Park
Skadar Lake) could have benefitted from the Bank’s more adaptive management
approach and more intensive dialogue with the Government/local stakeholders in the last
year of project implementation.

Recommendations for the Project Follow-up
 Agree on a long term (at least 5 years) financing scheme and secure funds for smooth
   operation of the joint institutional structures (SLC, its Secretariat and Working
   Groups);
 Mainstream joint strategies and programs developed under the project into future
   national strategies and programs;
 Initiate creation of early warning system for natural disasters on the bilateral level
   using the Predictive Hydrological Model;
 Develop Lake Basin Management Plan in accordance with Water Framework
   Directive;
 Support establishment of additional fishermen organizations and their capacity
   building on the Montenegrin part of the Lake, and facilitate sustainable management
   of fishery by creating network of fisherman organizations in both sides of the Lake;
 Continue reconstruction and sustainable use of vast historical heritage around the
   Lake;
 Reduce household pollution on the Lake and pollution from Moraca and Drin rivers;
 Reduce discharge of untreated waste waters to the Lake;
 Invest in reduced industrial pollution of Skadar Lake, especially the red mud basin
   and hazardous dump site in KAP.
