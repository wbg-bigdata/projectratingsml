PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1509-RO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introductiion
The project was the seventh loan in the agricultural sector in
Romania and the fourth in a series of eight loans made between 1974 and 1981
in the development of the irrigation and drainage subsector. The eight loans,
totalling US$545 million, were made during these years to help develop
irrigation in approximately 1.1 million ha.
Objectives
The main objective of the project was to increase and stabilize crop
production by introducing irrigation in place of rainfed cultivation and by
providing drainage, soil erosion control, flood protection work, reclamation
of saline soils and levelling for those parts of the area to be brought under
furrow irrigation. The project was also to assist farms in intensifying-l
cultivation throuigh provision of additional farm machinery arid in providinig
equipment for operation and mairnternance of project works.
Implementation Experience
Project conctructiori started in 1979 but slowed downi iii 1981 due
partly to technical diffi.culties but mostly because of Romania's financial
difficulties at that time. The country's construction industry was over
committed and budget allocations were insufficient to meet the financial needs
for projects already underway.  As a result, project implementation will
require nine years rather than the six expected at appraisal
(paras 3.02-3.14). 1/  Consequently, full development benefits will not be
reached until 1988 instead of 1986 as was anticipated at appraisal.
The estimated final cost of the project is US$157.9 million which
represenits an overrun in dollar terms of 2.82 over the appraisal esLimate, due
to the occurrence of higher rates of dollar inflation than projected at
appraisal. 1/ In Lei terms, the actual cost is 10.5% less than the appraisal
estimate due largely to the exclusion of part of the area (2,890 ha) and
reduction of the volume of several works (para 3.15).

Results
Despite delays, the project satisfactorily accomplished its
objectives. The main irrigation, drainage, and flood control components have
been or will shortly be comnpleted. 1/ The project's re-estimated rate of
return is 122 compared to the appraisal estimate of 14%, due primarily to
lower prices for farm outputs and international commodity prices fo. grains,
higher crop production costs and higher O&M costs because of higher energy
costs in punmping.
Sustainability
Under the preceding projects in the subsector assisted by the World
Bank, Romania has been able to demonstrate suitable capability for operating
and maintaining similar project infrastructure and sustaining the agricultural
benetits at or above the anticipated levels. The orgai 'zational changes
introduced between 1980 and 1983 (paras 6.01-6.04) will enable MAFI to operate
and mraintain this project more efficiently and more responsively to local
conditions than it was capable of doing in the past.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The Viisoara project benefitted from lessons learned in the design
and preparation of preceding projects. The project scope was confined to a
single purpose, and the government's preparation benefitted from consideration
of alternative designs, selection of least cost alternatives, and design
improvements based on experience in the preceding projects. However, project
implementation began before the World Bank's prcject performance audit reports
for the recently preceding projects were undertaken. As a result, some
lessons noted previously continue to be noteworthy, such as the following:
-   monitoring and evaluation of agricultural crop production costs
and revenues need to be improved to analyze any causes for lower
than expected yields, improve input supply and timing decisions.
and provide feedback to research and extension (paras 3.20 and
7.03);
-   an imbalance between loan disbursements and physical project
implementation led to the loan being fully disbursed while
project works were less than 70% complete. A stronger link
between loan disbursements and execution of works should promote
more realistic planning and timely implementation (paras 3.16 and
7.05); and
-   although it was agreed to modify the bidding documents used in
Romania for ICB under Bank-assisted projects to encourage
increased foreign participation, only about 6% of the contracts
awarded after ICB were won by foreign firms. In future projects,
to enhance the transfer of new technology, care should be given
in the design of projects to identify opportunities for
technological improvemernts, increased cost effectiveness and

energy efficiency. It is expected that the direct foreign
exchange requirements for these medium and high technology
systems and equipment would be substantially higher than in the
past.  Essential imported agricultural inputs in short supply and
not available domestically should also be incluided in project
design (paras 3.17 and 7.06). 1/
The following are also points of interest:
-   Romania's economic difficulties affected the timely
implementation of this and the other irrigation infrastructure
projects (para 1.04);
-   project scope was limited to land reclamation investment and
essential operation, maintenance and farm machinery based on the
appraisal recommendation (paras 2.01-2.04);
-   status of engineering at appraisal was adequate and this, along
with stable construction costs, resulted in actual costs being
close to the appraisal estimate (para 3.1.3);
-   direct and indirect sources of funds were used for cost recovery
(para 4.15);
-   under the Government's initiative, signiftcant organizational
changes took place in MAFI, which appear to be beneficial to
project. implementationi (paras 6.01-6.04);
-   government implemernting agencies need to agree oni realistic
annual construction targets, match financial allocations to these
targets, and monitor progress and take action to overcome
implementatiorn delays (para 7.04);

ROMANIA
VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1509-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTI ON
1.01     Agricuultre in the Economy.  Agriculture continues to play an
important role in the process of economic growth despite the rapidly
increasing importance of industry over the last 30 years. In 1984, the sector
employed about 3 million people, or 29% of the total labor forre, andl
contributed roughly 15% of GDP.  About 63%, or l5.0 million ha, of Romania's
land is under agriculture (9.9 million ha under arable crops, 0.7 million
under perennial orchards and vineyards, and 4.4 million under permanent
pastures).  Future agricultural growth is largely dependent on the
introduction of irrigation and drainage in the fertile but low rainfall Danube
basin.
1.02     Foreign Trade.  Agriculture's share in total export earnings has
declined from 23% in 1975 to about 12% in 1983.  Nevertheless, over 50% of
agricultural exports continue to earn convertible currenicy, and Romania has
maintainied a trade surplus in the sector since 1977.
1.03     Sector Organiizationi.  The agricultural sector is organized into
prinarily two tenure categories: (a) cooperatives for agricultural productior
(CAPs), and (b) State AgricultLural Farms (IAS). 1/   A small part (13%) of
arable land is cultivated in small indlividually held piots primarily for
vegetables, fruit, and livestock.  The CAPs rely on their ownr resources and
borrowings from the Banik for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) to finance
new investments and operating costs.  IAS investments are financed from their
own funds, State budget funds, and borrowings from BAFI. Stations for
mechaniization of agriculture (SMAs) provide farm machinrery services und(er-
contract for all CAPs.  Details of the organization of the sector are
discussed in the PCRs for the lalomita--Calmatui Irrigation ProjeAt (Loall
1368-RO) and the Rasova-Vederoasa Irrigation and Agricultural Development
Project (Loan 1247-RO).
1.04     Romania's Land Reclamation Program.  The project is part of a program
to undertake laind reclamation works (irrigation, drainage and soil.erosion
works) to irrigate the entire Romanian plain along the river Danube, the
largest agricultural zone in the country.  The potential irrigable area is
5.5 millioni/ha out of which works totaling 2.8 million/ha were completed by
the end of 1984.  Twenty irrigation systems are involved in this program, out
of which 13 have been completed including the Viisoara project.  The Viisoara
project, together with the two previously completed systems, provides
irrigation facilities for 99% of the irrigation potential of Teleorman

district. (Map 13020 RI) Through provision of irrigation and drainage
facilities in the project area, the project is expected to provide a stable
base for increased production and iT directly to have an impact on incomes an(i
on social and conumercial activities.  Bank assisted irrigation projects
accounted for 23% of Roniania's total investment allocation for land
reclamation during the five-year plan period 1976-1980 and 35.7% for the
1981-1985 plan period, as shown below:

Romania faced financial difficuilties in 1980 and, during the first years of
the 1981-85 Plan, Romnania restrained investments and slowed completion of the
land reclamation and other infrastructure projects initiated during the
preceding Plan. 1/  However, by 1983, the balance of payments situation had
improved.  Romania increased budgetary allocations and the implementation of
its ambitious irrigation program was progressing satisfactorily. Preliminary
projections for the 1986-1990 Plan envisage investments of Lei 100 billion
(US$4.7 billion) in land reclamation. This increased investment (roughly
three times the level in 1981-1985) has been planned to bring the irrigation
area up to 5.5 million ha by 1990, frorn 2.4 million ha at the end of 198:3.
However, based on previous performance, it is likely tthat the achievement of
the target of 5.5 million ha will extend beyond 1990.
1.05     Bank's Involvement in Agriculture and the lrrigation Subsector.  The
Viisoara Irrigation Project was the seventth loan, and the foturth for
irrigation, made by the Bank in the agricultural sector.  This loan of US$40.5
million brought agricultural iending in Romania to US$'371.5 million by 1978,
1/  The Borrower commenlted In thi;s resprw7ect.  The coinuetiiLs are given in Ailnex 6.



-3-
which amounted to lhalf the Bank's total commitments to Romania at that time.
The Bank's strategy has been based on promsoting efficient agricultural
development by providing foreign exchange for infrastructure projects and bv
meeting the need for on-farm development through credit. Several earlier
loans included both infrastructure and credit components, i.e. Sadova Corabia
(Loan No. 1083-RO), Flood Recovery (Loan No. 1169-RO), and Rasova-Vederoasa
Irrigation and Agricultural Development (Loan No. 1247-RO).  After the
Rasova-Vederoasa Project, Bank lending concentrated on single purpose loans,
either for infrastructure or credit, for a single farming activity such as
livestock, or orchards. The Viisoara Irrigation Project was a single-purpose
1^an for irrigation and land reclamation infrastructure.
1.06      Between 1974 and 1981 the Bank made a series of eight loans for the
development of irrigated agriculture totalling US$545 million and covering an
area of 1.1 million ha. The Bank's involvement in these projects contributed
significantly to the advancement of Rornania's irrigation technology.  The
Rasova-Vederoasa Project introduced several important concepts: preparation of
alternative designs; selection of least cost alternatives; and improved design
of canals in loess soils.  During supervisioni of the preceding
Ialormita-Calmatui project and this project, Bank staff assistance helped to
improve the design of drainage works, maintenance, and soil reclamation and
desal in iza ion.
I r.  PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01      Proje.t Identification and Preparationi.  In 1971, MAFT. idelntified the
project wittinl the framework of a study oni the development of the national
irrigation subsector, as a priority investmenit for food production in an area
of highl potential anidi low variable rairifall.  MAEI's Directorate for Land
Reclamation and Agricultural Construction (DIFCA) started preparation in 1973
witth a series of studies which lasted until early 1976.  MAFI's Institute for
Studies and Desigris of Land Reclamation (ISPIF) did most of the elngineering
work, in close cooperation with specialists of the National. Water Council,
Institute for Research and Design of Water Management, the Institute for
Hydro-technic structures, the Ministry of Electrical Energy, ConsLruction
Trusts for Power Lines, Construiction Trusts for Land Reclamation Works (TCIF)
and Regionial Enterprises for Operation and Maintenance (IELIF).  Because of
the high professional level and experience of Romania's specialists, the need
for Barnk assistanece during preparationl was miinimal..  A Bank mission visited
Romania from .January 25-28, 1977 and discussed the status of preparation.
2. .02    In April t977, the (;ovt.rnmt_-iist senit its preparation report to thle
Banik.  As proposed by the Goverrncmn il, thle project i ncludud:

The proposal did not include provisions for either farm machinery or operation
and maintenance (O&M) equipment. The Government estimated total project cost
at about US$145.0 million equivalent.
2.03     Appraisal.  Based on the preparation report, an appraisal mission
visited Romania in May 1977.  During appraisal, the fish breeding component
was deleted and provisions for essential farm machiniery, O&M, and land
levelling equipment were included.
2.04     Ne_otiations.  On October 28, 1977, the Bank invited BAFI for
negotiations of a proposed loan of US$35 million.  The negotiations were held
from November 7 throughl 15, 1977.  The negotiationis focussed primarily OnI the
loan amount, which was increased to US$40.5 million to equal revised estimates
of the foreign costs of the project and revisions to the implementatior
schedule.
2.05     Effectiveness.  The Board approved the loan on January 12, 1978, and
it became effective otn May 15, 1978.
2.06     ProjeCL Settinig.  "he Project is located about 100 km west of
Bucharest within the administrative jurisdiction of the Teleorman District.
It is bournded by the Vedea river oni the east, thie Calmatui river in thie west,
and the Danube river in the south (IBRD Map No 13020 RI). About Il% of th?
project area constitutes a part of tthe old Dantube flood plain, and tl.e
remainder coris>ts of several Lerraces above the flood plain, the largest oS
which-the Viisoara Terrace--is about 80,000 ha.  It is bounded by the Vedea
River on lhte east aild thie Cotl ITatui River in the west.  Rivers cut across arud
drajn muc,h of ttle terrares, but supplemental draiinage is eventually required
on two-thi rds of the total area.  About 85% of the Itrid has slopes of 1).0% or
less, wit-h a general s]ope towards the lDnube.  Soi.ls over most of thle area
are highly fertile browni and reddish chernozems, rich il humus, Withl goodl
water retent'otI capacity and muderate peririeability.  The climate is
-haracterized by warm summers and cold winters.  Average anruIal rainifall is
i50 ITmim of wh i  35() nmi Of ocr largc ly between April t?D October.  In 1917,
il,3O(0  na were already irrigated and the balanTce of 96,000 ha were under
raiftd COTd Li t iolS .  PopulatioT1 i n the project area in 1977 was about 153,W500
pt rSOn\S, )o which over 60% were engcage(1 in agriculture.  Farm emnployrmienit
amounted to about 38,700 persons, about 92% on CAP tarms and 8% on [AS farms.
Alexandria, an industrial city of 47,000 inhabitants, lies on the northern
edge of the project; Zininicea, a port on the Danube with 17,000 inhabitants,
is at the southern edge.  The project area has been well linked with national
roads and the railway system.  Almost all villages have been accessible by
asphalt roads.

2.08     Project Description.  The Project's main features at appraisal were
to include:
(a)  new and supplementary irrigation works (pumping stations and
distribution systems) to supply water from the Danube for about
110,290 ha, including 98,120 ha new irrigation and 12,170 ha
existing irrigated area;
(b)  new and supplemenitary drainage works to serve about 77,540 ha;
(c)  soil erosion works for about 10,800 ha;
(0)  land levelling for about 30,350 ha to be irrigated by furrows;
(e)  flood works in sections of the Calmatui river to protect about
2000 ha; and
(f)  farm machinery, O&M equipment, and other minor works.
Details of works actually executed compared to estimates made at appraisal are
shown in paras 3.08. Total project costs at appraisal were estimated at
US$153.5 million including physical and( price cu,ntingencies.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Start-up.  Prior t.o Loan effectiveness in May 1978, preliminary
activities had started, such as organiization of constructioni sites,
mobilization of constru-tion equipment and preparation of bidding documents
for procurement of equipment. All final designs had been completed by ISPIF
on time.  Responsibility for construction was with the Constructiorn Trust for
Land Reclamation (TCIF), headquartered in Bucharest.  As a result of the 1983
reorganization and decentralization of agriculttural construction, this
responsibility was transferred to the Enterprise for Execution and
Exploitation of Land Reclamation Works (IEELI!) of the Teleorman District,
headquartered in Alexandria.  On procurement, most of the ICB-related actions
were completed by end of J.978-mid-1979 (para 3.17).
3.02     Physical Implemeritationi.  Annex 3, Table I shows the cumulative land
area irrigated. Start of construction activities was reported in March 1979
as satisfactory. ISPIF, had proposed to substantially change the design of
the main pumping station on the Danube river, converting it from a floating
station to a stationary pumping station to be fed by Danube water through
underground steel syphons.  The Bank examined the proposed change and found
the new solution acceptable, both technically and economically.
3.03     The September 1979 supervision mission reported satisfactory progress
of wcrks.  MA'FI infat:;wd tLhe mission that an area of some 45,000 ha would be
ready for irr igation by May 1980.  (However, irrigation did nuJt in fact
comnire lunt 1: 91  ).

placing of concrete. No work had as yet started in the Zimnicea area,
Calmatui and on the surface drainage systems. No significant progress was
reported on tile drainage works and land levelling either.
3.05     In March/April 1981 it was reported that the irrigation component in
the Viisoara system was progressing well and that new areas totalling some
20,000-28,000 ha would be irrigated during the 1981 irrigation season. (In
fact 19,800 ha were irrigated). The drainage components of the Viisoara,
Zimnicea and Calmatui systems, as well as land levelling, were significantly
behind schedule and works on the Calmatui irrigation system had not yet
started. Except for progress achieved on the Viisoara irrigation
infrastructure, the general conclusion was that progress of construction had
slowed down. It was also reported that budgetary allocations for 1981
(Lei 209 million) were inadequate to cover either the estimated cost of 1981
works (Lei 708 million), or the additional cost of works carried over from the
1980 program (Lei 292 million based on September 30, 1980 data). The Borrower
was requested to revise its implementation schedules to avoid slippages beyond
the originally agreed completion dates. This was reiterated in a letter sent
by the Bank to BAFI on September 14, 1981. It became clear that shortage of
fuel, cornstruction materials and especially budgetary allocationis were
serious problems, especially the latter, in view of a sharp reduction of
investmernts proposed for land reclamation works under the new Five-Year Plan
1981-1985.
3.06     In May 1982 the Batik mission reported that there was a continued
shortage of financial and material support for all on-going Banlk-financed
irrigation projects including the Viisoara Irrigation Project; 1/ actual
progress was estimated at 547. compared to the appraisal estimate of 90%.  The
mission held several discussions with officials of BAFI, MAFI anid the Minister
and was told eventually that the Ministry was planning to act immediately to
redress the investment policy related to irrigation and to make efforts to
obtain reasoniable and realistic budgetary provisions during this Plan period.
This was followed up by the Bank in a letter anid discussionis held in Bucharest
in July 1982.  In Novemlber 1982, a Bank supervision missioni was iniformled that
the investment program for the agricultulral sector had been revised and that
the Governmecnt had agreed to introduce significant increases in the provisions
for irrigation arid drainage.  A detailed finanicirng programii was submitted by
BAFI which implied that the project would be almost completed by end of 1985,
leaving only some I.ei 15 million to be invcsced in 1986.
3.07     A detailed updated implemenitatiorn schedule for CY 1983 was submitted
to the Bank duiring the May 1983 supervision mission, based on a decision by
'he Ministry to att.sich special priority to irrigation.  The October 1983
mission reported that progress in cornstruction slowed down again, this time
mainly because of fuel short-ig-s an(d because some of the mechanical equipment
was diverted in eiarly 198.3 to tlp expedite implementationl of a crash program
for rice development in the soulth of the counitry.  The latter has adversely

3.08     In 1984 Implementation started to gather some momentum and, in
general, the rate of progress started to improve.  This was esptecii;ly evident
in the construction of main canals by using the canial lining m.;-hin,e pror.ired
under a previous Bank-financed project.  By end of 1984, the rniTl irrigaitioi
infrastructure works as well as all the necessary distribution networks were
completed and the on-farm equipment procured.  These works now serve a total
net irrigation area of 107,330 ha, compared with 110,290 ha estimated at
appraisal.  The differences  re suunmarized as follows:
Appraisal
Estimate     Actlal    Difference
a)  New Irrigation areas                      98,120      96,039    - 2,081
b)  Improvement to existinig irrigation       12 170      11,292         876
Total        110,290    107,333    -- 2,957
The overall redu..tion of 2,957 ha is due primarily to the exclusion of the
Calmatui valley (2,890 ha). The Governmenit plans t.o develop this area
separately (para 3.19). In addition, fewer improvements tc the existing
irrigation systems were needed, 876 ha (7%) less than anticipated.  On the
other hand, new irrigation outside the Calmatui valley was 809 ha (1%) more
than anticipated (Arlnex 2, Table 1).
3.09     Surface drainage works were to be executed over an area of 77,821 ha,
of which 15,296 ha were partially arained before the project by existing but
inadequate drainage systems.  These were to be remodelled and significantly
improved. By end of 1984, only 3,135 hla of new drainage facilities were
ready.  In 1985, however, the implementing enterprise reportedly managed to
cover an area of 11,800 ha with new surface drainage canals, in addition t.o
13,300 ha of remodelling and "moderrnizinig" existing draiz.?ge systems.  Thus,
at the end of 1985, only 36.3% of the total volune of works s-is completed.
The remaining 49,586 ha are planned to be completed by the end uf 1986.
Subsurface ti.le drainage was estimated to be needed over an area oi some 5,000
ha because of salinity and/or high groundwater levels.  So far only 1,550 ha
have been provided with such facilities. The remaininlg 3,450 ha are planned
to be implemented gradual]y over the next five years, as the impact of the
surface drainage works becomes clear and as the results of the monitoring of
groundwater levels and salinity are more conclusive.
3.10     Out of land levelling planned for 25,600 ha, only 14,42L  ha (56.3%)
were completed by enid of 1985.  The balance is expected to he done in 1986.
3.11     The delays in implementing the various components of the ,rroject were
the resullt of several factors (see also para. 3.07). 1./  Open drainiage andl all
other works, except irrigation, were postponed because of the higher pri-rity
given to irrigation.  The impiciTentation capacity of the IFFELIF was appareT.tly

3.12     Irrigation Water Demand, Supply and Qality.  The cropping patterni
and water demand anticipated at appraisal is still expected to materialize at
full development in 1988. Nevertheless, the design of the system and the
carrying capacities of its canals and pipelines are flexible enough to
accommodate some changes in the long run, if needed. Also, the basic water
conveyance networks for the furrow irrigated areas were designed as dual-
purpose systems, to better serve crop rotation needs and to provide more
fle3 bility. This means that an area irrigated during one cropping season (or
part of it) by furrows could easily be shifted to sprinkler irrigation when
needed. Project water demand estimates, therefore, appear reasonable and
well-based. On the supply side, the Danube river is a reliable source of
water, both in terms of quantity of flow and quality.
3.13     Project Costs.  Total project cost was estimated at appraisal to be
Lei 3,070 million (equivalent to US$153.5 million), of which Lei 810 million
(or US$40.5 million equivalent) was estimated as the foreign exchange
portion. The rate of exchange (US$l=1.ei 20 at appraisal) changed several
times during project implementation (Annex 2, Table 3). Actual costs
(including expenditures still to be made in 1986) amount to Lei 2,746.2
million (US$157.87 million equivalent).  Actual costs were lower in Lei terms
by 10.5% compared with the appraisal estimate (Annex 2, Table 4), due largely
to the exciusion of the Calmatui valley from the project (2,890 ha) and
redu^7tion of volume of several works. A comparison of work qtuantities,
appraisal vs. actual, is shown in Annex 2, Table 4. Details of project costs
after implementation compared with the appraisal estimates are shown in
Annex 2, Table 5.
3.14     The foreign costs (direct and indirect) of the project at comlpletion
were an estimated US$41.1 million, US$ 0.6 million (1.5%) higher than
estimated at appraisal.  While BAFI's completion report showed foreign
exchange costs at US$59.9 million, BAFI did not provide the completion mission
with any data to support the estimate. 1/  The assLumptions made durinig the
appraisal on direct and indirect foreign exchange composition of the costs of
different types of works, supplies, and services appear to be still valid and,
therefore, were used as the basis to estimate the foreign exchange cost at
completion in the report.
3.15     Proiect Financing.  According to the Appraisal Report, the Bank loan
of US$40.5 million was to finance the full foreign exchange component which
was estimated at 26% of total project cost. The remaining local cost of
US$113.0 million (74% of total project cost) was to be met by the State budget
(73M), BAFI loans (19%), and CAP contributionis (8%). During implementation,
the respective financing contributions of the State, BAFI, anid CAPs chaniged as
shown in Annex 2, Table 6. The share of local cost financing by the State
increased to 79% due to the lower share of financing by CAPs at only 2%.
Also, the State contributed foreign exchange above the loan amouirt, estimated
at US$0.6 million, caused by the higher rate of Dollar inflation than
projected at appraisal.  Overall, as a result of the savings in Lei terms, thce
respective local cost contributions by each of the three sources were less
than anticipated at appraisal.

3.16     Disbursements.  Actual disbursements compared to anpraisal estimates
are shown in Annex 2, Table 7. Disbursements started one year behind the
appraisal schedule due partly to delay in loan effectiveness, and partly to
delay in start of construction caused by the change in design of the pu.mping
station. In 1981 and 1982, disbursements lagged by up to 18 months due
largely to inadequate local budget allocations (para 3.14). However, the loan
was fully disbursed by March 31, 1983, nine months before the Loan Closing
date (December 31, 1983). One reallocation of loan proceeds was made at the
Borrower's request when, in June 1980, US$2.0 million was moved from Category
(3), Unallocated, to Category (1), Equipment and Spare Parts (US$0.2 million),
and to Category (2), Materials (US$1.8 million).  Supervision missions noted,
however, the imbalance which had developed between loan disbursements arid
progress of physical execution.  By the time the loan was fully disbursed,
project works were less than 70% completed. The imbalance is attributed
largely to the fact that two-thirds of loan disbursements were made for
equipment and spare parts procured within the first two years of the Loan,
while physical construction subsequently suffered delays due to inadequate
budget allocations (paras 3.05-3.08).
3.17     Procurement.  As agreed during appraisal and the subsequent loan
negotiations, the loan financed only equipment and materials, following the
Bank's Internationial Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.  Most of the
necessary bidding actions were concluded in 1978--1979.  Foreign suppliers were
awarded contracts amounting to about US$2.4 million (6%) oult of a total ot
US$40.5 million procured urnder GCB. There were no major issues regarding
procurement. However, a minor controversy occurred regarding tthe procurement
of three mobile cranies of 40 tors each.  The bidding process started ifi
December 1978, anid on March 30, 1979 the Bank approved award of thie contract
to a British firm. In July 1979, "Romagrimex", the Ministry's procurement
agency, proposed to change its previous decision by switching the award of
contract to a Japanese firm whose bid offered cranes which were larger and
more expenisive.  The Bank was unable to agree to such change after completion
of the bid evaluation process. The Bank agreed, however, to an alternative
proposal to invite new bids for 45-ton cranes (January 1980).  The results of
the niew bid evaluation were approved on June 24, 1980 and, bv this, the issue
was finially resolved. The list of equipment and materials procured under the
loan is shown in Annex 2, Table 8.
3.18     Accounts and Audit.  BAFI has maintained separate subloan accounts
for World Bank disbursemernts.  BAFI's accounts are audited annlually by the
inspectors of the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the Romaniian law,
which is satisfactory to the Bank. In addition to this annual audit, special.
spot checks are made on Bank financed projects to comply with the Bank's
auditing requirenents.  However, the quality and the scope of these are not
clear hecause they do not extend to verification of accounting records of the
sub-borrowers to ascertain whether separate accounts are maintained for
project financed expenditures. BAFI also has an internal audit department
which reviews its internal corntrol procedures.

Loan Agreement. Irrigation of the Calmatui valley area was to be developed
utilizing water to be supplied from the existing Cringeni dam after its
storage capacity was increased under a separate project to be filianced by the
Government. At negotiations, the Bank agreed to include this componlent with
assurances from the Government that (a) plans for increasing the Cringeni dam
storage to a capacity adequate to assure full water requirements for 2,890 ha
net would have been formally approved by the Council of Ministers by December
31, 1980; and (b) the storage capacity of the dam would have been increased by
December 31, 1982 so that sufficient water would be available to adequately
irrigate the above area in the Calmatui valley. The NWC was responsible for
planning and implementing this component, including construction of the
Cringeni dam irrigation distribution system ai'd river training flood control
works.  In the course of prepa3ring this componient, an alternative water Source
was identified, which studies indicated could be cheaper than increasinig the
Cringeni dam storage capacity for supplying water to the Calmatui area.
However, in view of the length of time needed to complete these studlies and
the additional time required for construction, by 1983 the Governmenit reached
a decision to develop the Calmatui valley area under a separate project at a
later time.  In retrospect, the decision by the Bank and the, Government to
make implementation of this component contingent on satisfactory c(ompletion of
plans and studies covering both technical and economic criteria, throughl dated
covenarnts in the Loan Agreement, proved correct.
3.20     BAFT' has regularly furnished quarterly progress reports in accordanice
with the format agreed upon during the negotiationis.  Certain improvements in
progress reporting need to be considered.  At present, the total actuial
expenditure on the project is reported without giving a breakdown of
expendlitures needed to monitor progress of inidividulal project componenLs.   IT
addition, detailed information on crop production, costs and revenues should
be provided (separately for irrigated and rainfed areas) for each CAP anid IAS
farm in the project oni a seasonal basis in order to monitor progress of crop
productiorn and costs from the beginning of irrigation.  I'he objective is to
enable project and farm managers to identify where implementation needs to he
improved and agricuLtural practices need to be strenigthened as farmil
development proceeds uLlder the project.  Thus, agricultural data shoUld be:
monitored comprehensively over the entire project area oni a farm-by--farm
basis.  Such moniloring would: (i) provide the means for analyzing causes of
lower than expected yields in order to make necessary adjustments for the
followinig yearts prodtuction cycle; (ii) improve input supply and timing
decisions; and (iii) provide feedback to the research institutes and extension
service.  While irrigation pumping records were made available to Banik
missions, information on irrigation applications at project farms shouldl be
reported to be able to moniitor irrigation distribution impacot onz farm yields.

After irrigation commenced in 1981, the trend to decreasing areas of wheat
commenced, and changed from 29% in 1980 to 21% in 1.984. Barley was introduced
in 1981 and has remained in the cropping patterni. The other significant
changes are increasing percentages of soybeans, sugarbeet and alfalfa. Double
cropping of maize silage after winter cereals is expected to inicrease to 13%
and at full. development the cropping pattern is expected to be similar to that
envisaged at appraisal. Any future increases in cropping intensities are
largely restricted to early harvested winter cereals. Annex 3, Table 3 shows
the emerging cropping pattern of those IAS and CAP farms which conuiernceo
irrigation in 1981.  The CAP farms show a decreasing area of winter cereals
and a corresponiding increase in maize whereas the IAS farms have a higher and
stable area of maize throughotut.
4.02      Crop Yields.  Under rainifed conditions, crop yields are low compared
to irrigated yields and are highly variable; principally reflecting the low
and erratic rairnfall regime characteristic of the zone.  Annex 3, Table 4
shows rainfed and irrigated yields in the project area up to 1984.
4.03      The developmenit of irrigated yields in the project area since tthe
introduction of irrigaLiori in 1981 is traced for those IAS and CAP farms which
commriienced irrigationl in 1981 (Anrnex 3, Table 4).  Yields are variable fromn
year to year and the causes of this require further investigation, since
several factors may be involved.  Project officials described 1983 as a poor
agrilcltural year, in that high temperatures were coupled with a lonig drought,
period, and the low yields wer-e attributed to those factors.  H3owever, a
shortage of input.s (fertilizers, herbicides anid pesticides) nmay have also
contributted and as previously noted, these aspects require further
iorves t i go; t i mi.  Al so the adequeaq y of i r r i got i on s tpp I i e s ci ori ng peak dernma 1I
periocds may also hiave been a problem.  Conversely 1984 was descrribed as a goodi
yeair climaLi cally and this is reflected in the yields.  Future irrigated
yields assumwe the usage of fertilizer and inputs at the rates recommiended by
EBAI I to  rcib Ieve t he respect ive yiells .  The compar isouns between appraisal,
BAF 3!, ar!ld missioll estimates are showTI in Annex 3, Table 6.  Thie wheat and

and the labor have any experience in irrigated crop technology (including
water application). Consequently, it is reasonable to expect a slow buildup
in yields in the first years followed by a more rapid buildup of yields as
experience is gained together with the acretion of improved sail conditions
due to improved cultural practices and fertilization accompanying irrigation.
Nevertheless, provided that a full supply of inputs is assured (including
water), combined with good management it is reasonable to assume a buildup to
the full anticipated yield over four years, on the average.
4.05     Changes in ARricultural Practices.  Provided that soil moisture is
adequate, the increased use of fertilizer on irrigated crops is the principal
key to increased crop yields.  The planned total requirement for available
plant nutrients at full project developmenit, which is 2.7 times the amount
used prior to the project, will be 15,700 tons of nitiogen (N), 8,600 toils of
available phosphate (PzOs) and 4,800 tons of potash (Kz0), based on thie
fertilizer rates for each crop that are recommended by BAFI/MAFI (Annex 3,
Table 7).  This represents an average for all crops of 239 kg/ha of available
nutrients.  The appraisal estimated that at full development, requiremenits of
anumonium nitrate (33.5% N), superphosplhate (18% P205) and potash
(60% KzO) would be about 75,000 tons. This is equivalent to 190 kg/ha of
available nuti-ients, assukmitng 35,000 tons each of ammoniun nitrate arid
superphosphate and 5,000 tons of muriate of potash.  The plannled requiremenet
exceeds the appraisal estimate due to differences in recommended fertilizer
rates including inicreased use of potash.
4.06      It is extremely importanit that Lhe required levels of fer-tilizer are
applied in order to achieve the yields estimated.  The wide variation in yield
and the uneven buildup has been attributed by the authorities prirncipaliy to
climatic var-iations but as previously outlined, other factors may have
contributed, particularly possible shortages of inputs especially
fertilizers.  Some evidence of a shortage of fertilizers was evident; at one
CAP farm visited wheat, maize and sugarbeet were short supplied 16%, 20%, aridc
37% respentively and sugarbeet was supplied with a mixture in the iincorrect
nutrient proportion.  Another farm quoted a total supply shortage of 19%.  A
further farm visited (outside the project area) reported shortages of
fertilizer for wheat, barley, maize and soybeans of 39%, 33%, 26%, and lS%
respectively.  However to reach a firm conclusion as regards fertilizer
shortages, further detailed investigations are required. Similarlv, further
investigations arc required concerning the adequacy and timeliness of water
applicaitions arid also availability and timing of supplies of pesticides. In
addition, irrigated crops require higher labor inputs than rainfed crops and
some labor shortages were reported in moving sprinkler units at times of peak
demand.
4.07     A wide range of insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and
pre-emergence weed killers are used oni all crops--the largest doses being
applied to sugarbeet, vineyards, and orchards. The use of these chemicals is
increasing.  Although periodic shortages of plant protecLioni materials have
occurred, it is riot apparent that it has been a serious constraint to yields.

4.09     Farm Machinery Services.  The project provided farm machinery to SMAs
and to IASs in the project area to meet incremental requirements for crop
cultivation, harvesting, and transport, after introduction of irrigation and
to replace some worn out machinery. The project area is served by eight SMAs
which provide machinery inputs for the CAPs on a rental basis. They also
provide major repair services. A factory in the project area manufactures
spare parts and subassemblies for tractors. The IASs have their own sections
for mechanization and repair. Prior to the project there was one tractor to
every 78 ha of arable land. With the additional agricultural machinery
provided with the project, the ratio improved to one tractor to every 60 ha in
1984. Meehaniizationi is currently 100% for sowing, land preparation, and
cultivation (except vegetables); 100% for harvesting cereals; 70% maize; and
99% sugarbeet. Full mechanizationi is expected by 1990 for all crops (except
vegetables, grapes and fruit).
4.10     CroL_Production and Costs.  Updated estimates of future production
after full development in 1988, and witlhout the project, are shown in Annex 3,
Table 8.  Incremental production1 under the project after full development
would amouriL to about 350,000 tons cereals, 16,000 tonis soybeans, 3,000 tons
sunflower, 203,000 tons sugarbeet, and 78,000 toins vegetables and fruit. The
changes with respect to the apFraisal estimate are due largely to the updated
yield expectatioins discussed in para 4.03.  Crop production costs adjusted for
actual anid forecast yields have been derived from data provided by BAFI fron
project records, planning data and from CAP and IAS farms.  The costs
conpoinernts are seed, fertilizers, pesticides, machinery charges, transport.
charges, labor and other chlarges. Costs of individual crops have shown
considerable variatiorn from year to yea. even when adjusted for yields
achieved.  Total production costs estimated at full development show an 42%
iincrease over appraisal estimnates witth significant increase in maize (67%) andl
wheat 39%).
4.1l    .Marketi ng.  Surplus prodIuction in the project area is purchased anld
marketed entirely by State controlled and operated agencies, known as
centrals.  Fach central collects and distributes a specified conunodity or set
of commodities.  Production plans are closely coordinated witLh commodity
demand and use, and purchase and distribution of conmmodities by the centrals
are assured through annuial contracts with the production units.  The cer.tral
for cereals and sunflower seeds has in and near the project area 23 permanient
collection stations, and 13 silos with 316,000 tons capacity. The central
sells to food industry agencies for domestic marketiig, reserve storage, and
exports. The central for vegetables and fruits maintains processing, storage,
and marketing facilities in Teleorman district, including a canning factory at
Turmu Magurele.  This central also collects and distributes grapes to agencies
'or wine production and marketing.  Vegetable oil factories in Rosiorii de
Vedea process most of oilseed and soybean output from the project area. A
sugar fdctory at Zininicea processes sugarbeets from ttie area. Romania's
production of cereals and most major crops has beeni distributed largely for
domestic conisumlrpLtioni, anid incremental outiput from the project area is expected
to help raise the curretL  levels of per capita consumption, and to meet future
popiliat iLThl iTlerrse which is estilnate-d at 1% p.a.  Pomania also has tried to

5.01     Proiect beneficiaries.  Data on the beneficiaries of the project are
sumnarized in Aninex 4, Table 1.  Project farms have Leen able to raise incomes
of about 34,000 members.  Since 1978, average annual CAP farm earnings per
active members have increased from about Lei 12,000 to about Lei 22,000, an
increase of 83% in 6 years. IAS members' earnings have increased from an
average of about Lei 20,000 to about Lei 26,000, an average increase of 30%
over the same period.  MXP members' earnings are dependent, to a large extent,
on the farmers' productivity, while IAS members are salaried government
employees subject to salary adjustment policies.  The difference in the rates
of increase in earnings has helped to reduce the income disparities between
CAP and IAS employees. (See para 5.04)
5.02     Employment.  In Romaniia, as in other semi-industrialized countries,
agricultural act;vities are hindered by a declining rural labor force due to
urban migration and aging of the rural populationi. Increased mechanization
under the project has enabled farms to increase productivity while active farm
members have declined from 38,700 in 1978 to 34,200 in 1984, anid the nrumbers
of unskilled seasonal labor have also declined.  At the same time, about. 2,100
additional technical and higher skilled jobs have been created at the IEELIF's
which operate the irrigation system, the SMAs, and agroindustrial storage and
processing facilities in the vicinity of the project. On project farms, job
skill levels have increased as the result of investmenits in irrigation anid
more scientific :-gricultural production.  IEEL,IFs, the SMAs, and DGAFI have
tundertaken additionial professionial staff training courses in hanldlinig
irrigation equipmienit, operating and maintaining new farm machinery, and new
cropping techriologies under irrigated conditions.
5.03     Increased Production.  At full developmenit in 1988 the total volulle
of production-i is expected to irncrease by 255% above the future witthout
situation, (Ainnex 3. Table 8). The most significant increases which reflect
the changes in cropping patterns compared to the pre-project situation, are
the increase in the maize area and the decrease of wheat.  The analysis
assumes that the volumie of pro.'uction in the future without project under
rainfed conditionis would not increase as it is expected that the cropping
pattern would remaini the same.  Under rainfed conditions, this is a reasonable
assumption as lack of soil moisture is the principal factor limiting crop
yields.  Without ir-rigation agricultural development can be expected to remain
static.
5.04     Price..  Input and ouLput prices are conitrolled in Romania.  Between
1964 and 1980 prices were revised only once, in 1977.  During this period
there was a two--tier pricing system, whereby TASs paid somewhat lower prices
for inputs andl received lower output prices than did the CAPs. In 1981,
Romania embarked oln m<jor price reformlls which abolished the two tier pricing
system in order tLe ;r fng doiiiest ic prices c1 ser to world prices.  Producer
prices werc incre&.ed by 12% in 1981 and 10% in 1982'.  Premni urns of I)-50% can
be added to the new contra(ctu .il prices depe nding oni the peor [ecttar- yield of

Annex 3, Table 9.  Average sales prices, including premiums, realized from
1981-85 on farms in the pro'ect area are shown in Annlex 3, Table 10.  The
above changes are expected to allow for more equitable earnings betweeli the
IASs and CAPs, and provide on-farm incentives for more efficient production
and higher yields.
5.05      Value of Production  Farms in the project area produce a range of
tradeable and non-tradeable commodities.  The value of incremental oUt.tput of
these commodities as a result of the project comprise the project's
quantifiable benefits.  The tradeable outputs, mostly grains, oilsee(ds, arl(i
fruit either supplement current exports or substitute for imports.  The
noni-tradeabtle outputs are mainly vegetables and aniimal fodder.  The    tal.
incremental net benefit of the project at full development is est. limated at Iei
929.1 milliorn (U.S$51.6 million) per anntm.
5.06      Ecoqoriic Evaluation.  The economic rate of return (ERR) has beiri
recalculated taking into account the actual results since tthe implemenlatioll
of the project and revised estimates for later years (1985 and( beyotnd) based
on the past 5 years' experience.  Full crop production is expected in 1988 aS
compared to tire appraisal estimate of 1986 due to delays in Construction.  T'hle

5.08      The economic rate of retuirn (FRR) for the project has been
re-estimated at 12%, as compared to 14% at the time of appraisal.  rhe
economic costs and benefit streams are sthown in Annex 4, Tables /t-6.  The
reduction in the rate of returni is mainly attributed to Lower intterniational
commodity prices, higher production costs and highier 0&M costs because: of
rising energy costs.  Howe-er in view of falii.ing oil prices e;nergy rost;is m.yv

development, i.e. small irrigation equipment, barns, sheds and short-term
credit for input needs. BAFI's performance in carrying out the above tasks
was fully satisfactory.
6.02     At the Central Government level, the Ministry for Agriculture and
Food Industry's Department for Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction
(DIFCA) was initially responsible for project implementation and supervision
of physical works. Until July 1980, DIFCA, under its own Deputy Minister of
MAFi, comprised three sub-units: (i) Institute for Land Reclamation Studies
and Design (ISPIF); (ii) Group for Supervising Investments (GSI); and (iii)
DireCtorate for Construction and Land Reclamation Works. In 1980, the Group
for Supervising Construction Investments (GSI) was merged with the Central for
Exploitation of Land Reclamation Works (CELIF), which was headed by a separate
Deputy Minister of MAFI with responsibility for operation and mainitenianice of
all completed irrigation systems. The organizational structure charnged again
in 1981 when the CELIF and DIFCA were merged, forming what is called General
Economic Directorate for Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction
(DGEIFCA)(Annex 5). In July, 1983 changes were also introduced at the
regional and district level agencies, by consolidating a series of
responsibilities and vesting them into one enterprise, the TEFI.F (Eniterprise
for Execution and Exploitation of Land Reclamationi Works) which is responsible
for land reclamation works and operation/maintenance for each district
(Annex 5).  It was felt that decentralization and consolidation would ensure
more efficient utilization of staff and resources, better management of land
reclamationi works, and improved operation and maintenance due to the active
involvement of the operation unit in the construction phase of project
implementation. Each district enterprise--IEELIF (formerly TCIF/
IELIF)--repocts to the General Director for Agriculture aild Food 1n.idustry
(DCtAF' ) of the respective district. Only technical advice or specific
technical instructions are given by DGEIFCA, Bucharest.
6.03     On the whole the above organization changes havc been beneficial to
the project.  Some initial managerial or coordination problems contributing to
project delays, could possibly have been alleviated by the ntew organlizational
arranirer.unL.L  The fact that the Supervision Unit (GSI) was separate from the
design unit until 1981 may have resulted in some lack of coordination between
design and censtruction. Now that they are part of a single execution and
operation enterprise (IEELIF), awareness of quality control should
significantly improve. In addition, because the enterprise which will operate
and maintain the system will be involved at an earlier stage of its
development, actual implementation efficiency should also improve.
6.04     Operation and Maintenance.  As a result of the 1983 reorganization
construction and O&M responsibilities are together in one well organized
district based Enterprise for Execution and Exploitation of Land Reclamation
Works (IEELIF) (Annex 5) unit, and consequently coordination between the
construction stage and the eventual operation of the systems has improved.
Each IEELIF has a series of sections. The O&M sectioni is responsible for
several sub-units, called "systems", each of them responsible for all O&M
functiorns over an area of some 30,000-35,000 ha. These sub-units are well
established, well organized and have adequate technical staff and equiprnent
for carrying out their responsibilities. The IEELIFs have elaborate plans and
timetables for routine mainiternance works and inspections, most of them to be



- 17 -
completed before the start of a new cropping season. They also have well
equipped workshops and qualified engi;eers, mechanics and electricians.
6.05     The electrical transmission lines and installations for the pumping
stations are operated and maintained by the regional organization of the
Ministry of Electrical Energy. The on-farm irrigation equipment, be it
sprinkling or furrow, is operated and maintained by the respective CAPs or
IASs.  The Agricultural Machinery Stations (SMAs) and the IASs are responsible
for the farm machinery, and for major maintenance jobs. Operation and routine
maintenance of this equipment is done by the CAP and IAS farms.
6.06     In addition to their O&M responsibilities, each IEELIF has all
irrigation water scheduling unit, an effective and useful institution at the
field level. Each such unit covers an area of about 30,000 ha and employs
several agronomists, soil-w-ter-plant specialists and soil moisture laboratory
staff, who advise on appropriate water applications, monitor actual water uxe,
and prepare detailed weekly water distribution schedules. Soil moisture is
monitored on a weekly basis during the cropping season, by samples collected
at various depths, from a pre-determined grid of sampling points which are
considered to be represenitative for the area's soil profiles and types, as
well as the crops grown on the adjacent lands. Comparisons with the
respective soil moistures from the previous week are made, and the resulting
projected water needs for the forthcoming week are discussed in detail every
Friday night with the "system's" agricultural, council, the local farmers'
participatory body. After the weekly irrigation plans are approved by the
farming unit representatives, these are considered as mandatory for each CAP
and IAS and are strictly adhered to.  The main objective of this program is to
assure high yields and efficient water use, without adverse effects on the
subsurface drainage conditions.  Having both the water distribution
responsibility and the irrigation water scheduling advisory function in one
unit ensures that water is properly and equitably shared by every agricultural
production unit.  O&W  services rendered by the IEELIFs are considered as fully
satisfactory.
6.07     Sup_ortiKng Services.  Agriculture in the project area is coordiniatedi
by the Teleorman district General Directorate for Agriculture and Food
Industry of MAFI. The General Directorate coordinates the cropping patterrns,
production, seed supply, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation system
maintenance, water distribution and marketing. The Directors of the lASs and
CAPs in the project (and district) submit their annual production programs to
the General Directorate which coordinates these programs in accordance with
the guidelines received from MAFI. In addition, the General Directorates
serve an important advisory function to the production units through their owii
specialists working in collaboration with the specialists from the production
units. These specialists, in the fields of agronomy, horticulture, veterinary
medicine and animal husbandry, mechanical erigineering, economics, and other
miscellaneous fields, have an effective input by providing technical
assistance to the production units.  Training of both IAS and CAP field staff
is provided periodically by the General Directorates through short- and
medium--term courses.  The research stations also play an important role in
training.  For more specialized personnel, higher level courses are organized
during the off-season.  Through these various training programs, the staft of
the lASs andl CAPs are kept abreast of advances in producti.Lon techtiology.

6.08     Cost Recovery.  The cost recovery arrangements have not changed since
the completion of the first Bank-assisted irrigation project,
Giurgiu-Razmiresti (Loan i"82-RO). Costs of on-farm sprinkler and furrow
equipment and land levelling works are financed by BAFE loans to the farms and
are recovered through repayment of the loans. Cost of farm machinery and
implements are recovered through rental rates set for their use. The
remaining costs are recovered through both direct and indirect mechanisms.
The only direct- mechanism, the water charge, is levied in accordance with the
following rates:
(i)  a fixed annual charge of Lei 115 per ha from
cooperatives and Lei 294 from State farms;
(ii)  a water charge of Lei 18 per 1,000 m3;
(iii)  a charge per crop hectare of Lei l13  for cereals,
Lei 183 for alfalfa, Lei 195 for vege ables, and Lei
122 for vineyards and orchards.
The annual revenues generated by the above rates at full development
are estimated to cover about 23% of the annual O&M costs. Indirect
sources of funds are generated through: (i) part of the net earnings of
the IASs; (ii) the differential between the prices of direct and
indirect exports originating from the incremental productioni and the
generally lower farmgate prices; and (iii) various funds and taxes
deducted from the net income of CAPs and IASs.
6.09         An agricultural research station is located oni the eastern
border of the project, whose activities are coordinated by the Academy
of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences. The research station is
instrumental in generating technology in irrigated crop production,
seed improvement, land reclamation and water use, soil management,
plant protection, and varietal improvement of crops.  Research findings
are effectively applied at the field level tthrough linkage with the
advisory specialists in the General Directorates and the production
units. In addition each IEELIF has approximately 10 water management
units, which advise the production units on appropriate water
applications and monitor water use throughout the district according to
established distribution schedules (para 4.14 on O&M).
6.10         The supporting services are well organized and
substantially contribute to the effectiveness of the production units.
6.11         Performance of the Bank.  The frequency of supervision
mission was less than the normal two per year (See Basic Data Sheet)
and a higher frequency may have helped overcome some of the problems
that occurred in 1979/80/81. The composition of the missions was
reasonable. However, an agriculturalist did not participate from May
1980 until September 1984 and more agricultural input into the
supervision mission's would have been useful both to the Bank and the
Borrower particularly during the period when the area under irrigation
began to expand.  Greater input from an agriculturalist would have
enabled more thorough monitoring/evaluation of the agricultural
component. In the project completion report of BAFI, the Bank's
contribution to the project was appreciated in: (i) its assistance
during appraisal of the project components which all have been



- 19 -
implemented with unchanged capacities; and (ii) advice of supervision
missions to BAFI and MAFI on implementation schedules, appropriate
design changes, and quality of work, procurement procedures,
accounting, reporting, and 0&1 practices. Bank personnel provided
valuable assistance to project officials in evaluating alternative
designs, availability and adaptability of foreign construction
equipment and construction practices on loess type soils. Bank staff
enjoyed full, cooperation from Romanian counterparts, both in Bucharest,
as well as in the field, and succeeded to maintain a constructive and
fruitful dialogue at the various central and local BAFI and MAFI
levels. By and large, super-'ision reports fairly reflect the progress
of execution and the issues encountered. Advice given and comments
made by Bank missions were usually welcome and useful, especially
during the discussions held in May and November 1982 concerning ways to
overcome budgetary cutbacks caused by the financial difficulties that
Romania experienced and to accelerate picject implementation which was
suffering from a serious delay.
6.12          Barnk performance on procurement was consistent with its
guidelines and operational policies.  Bank staff alerted the Borrower
and its executing agencies on procurement related problems in a timely
manner.  The Bank did not include, under the reporting requirements, a
request for information on the actual expenditures by major work items,
so that progress could be measured in financial terms and compared to
the schedule of expenditures as contemplated at appraisal. This would
have been a valuable yardstick for measuring actual progress. Also,
the Bank did not establish any linkage between actual project
implementation or expenditures and disbursements, or at least a forriat
for reporting these data for follow-up and comparison with targets
proposed at appraisal. Bank disbursements were generally timely but
some delays occurred in 1979 and 1980 coincidirng with discussions
between the Batik and Romagrimex in connlection with award of contract
for imported autocranes.  These payment delays have been referred to in
BAFI's telexes (3 in 1979) and in discussions with supervision
missions/reports. The Bank's payments were within the normal
processing period with the exception of cases where documents were not
complete.
VlI.  rONCIUSIONS AND RFCOMMENDATIONS
7.01     The Viisoara Irrigation Project hlas been satisfactorily
completed withl exception of some drainage and land levelling works to
be completed in 1986 and subsurface drainage works underway will be
completed over the next five years in line with the results from
monitoring ground water levels and salinity. 1/  BAFI has performed
well in coordinating and stupervising project implementation. In 1981,
new irrigation was available oni about 20,000 ha, about 21% of the
project area.  The project reached full developmernt targets for
irrigation area in i985. Presei!t yields of wheat have reached
appraisal. estimates. while yields of other crops have reached 70% of
1/  The Borrower-'s comments in thi.S respcct are given in Annex 6.



- 20 -
appraisal yields or highier. Full development yields are expected to
reach appraisal levels. The ERR has been estimated at 12% as compared
to the appraisal estimate of 142.  The reduction in economic
profitability of the project is mainly caused by: (i) relatively lower
prices of internationally traded commodities, higher O&M costs because
of increased energy costs and higher production costs. Project success
was also due to provision of: (i) complete irrigation systems, and (ii)
adequate advice from DGAFI staff and the Irrigation O&M Service backed
up by a research station near the area. Variations in supply and the
timeliness of fertilizers and other inputs, including water, may have
contributed, along vith slow develop.nent of farm management and
technical skills, to the inability so far of newly irrigated farms to
stabilize yields. The exclusion of the Calmatui valley area (2890 ha)
and reduction in volume of several works resulted in cust savings of
about 10.52 in Lei terms.
7.02     The delays in implementation have been mainly caused by
constraints which are extraneous to the project, although an initial
delay of about twelve months was caused by the change in design of the
pumping plant.  From 1980 on, funding for the project was restricted as
part of the Government's policy of austerity measures. This
combination of external difficulties and project related problems
caused project completion to be delayed to 1985. No additiornal
construction resources were provided in order to make up for lost time
due to technical and financial problems. 1/
Lessons Learned
7.03     Progress ReporLin_&--Ag_iculture.  In order to (i) analyse any
causes for lower than expected yields; (ii) improve input supply and
timing decisions and (iii) provide feedback to research and extension
it is important that monitoring and evaluation of crop production,
costs and revenues is improved. In order to accomplish the above, BAFI
staff should work closely with farm staff as well as staff of the
Directorate General of Agriculture and Food Industry in the District in
compiling agricultural production data. It is recommended that the
Bank should seek agreemenit with BAFI on a revised format for data to be
made available to tLe Bank for the remaining projects under supervision.
7.04     ProjecL Implementation.  Annual forecasts by Government for
new areas to be brought under irrigation have been ambitious and
unrealistic. Delays in implementation have resulted in the completion
of project works being delayed from the appraisal estimate of 1983
until 1985; with the consequent delays in benefits. 1/ In order to
remedy this situation it is recommended that (a) BAFI/MAFI should in
consultation with the IEELIF (i) agree realistic annual constructioni
targets (ii) match financial allocations with the construction targets
and (iii) monitor progress and take appropriate action to overcome
delays or other shortcomings.
1/  The Borrower's commients ill this respect are given in Annex 6.



- 21 -
7.05     Disbursements.  By the time the loan was fully disbursed
project works were less than 702 completed. The imbalance is
attributed largely to the fact that two-thirds of loan disbursements
were made for equipment and spare-parts procured within the first two
years after loan, while physical construction subsequently suffered
delays due to budget allocations. A stronger link between loan
disbursements and execution of physical works should promote more
realistic planning and timely implementation. It is recommended that
for possible future loans the Bank should consider the following
options: (i) a proportion of disbursements should be tied to civil work
construction and in this connection the Bank should consider the
practicability of ICB contracts for civil works. However, from a
procurement point of view this may be difficult as there is no domestic
system for competitive bidding for civil works in Romania and the Bank
could not accept force account construction (by for example the
IEELIF); or (ii) tranching whereby disbursements would be dependent on
a mid-term or more frequent review of progress.
7.06     PrLcurement:  To encourage increased participation by foreign
bidders and equal treatment of all bidders during evaluation of bids,
the Bank proposed and BAFI and Romagrimex agreed to modify the bidding
documents used in ICB for the procurement of goods under Bank financed
projects. The main modifi_ations were (i) "bid opening on the same day
as bid submission"; (ii) a system establishing bid bond values for bids
which precludes the possibility of determining the bid price before bid
opening; and (iii) deletion of certain unacceptable evaluation criteria
that could affect selection of bids. However, even with these changes,
only about 62 of the contracts awarded as a result of ICB were won by
foreign firms. In future projects, to enhance the transfer of new
technology, care should be given in the design of projects to identify
opportunities for technological improvements, increased cost
effectiveness and energy efficiency. 1/ It is expected that the direct
foreign exchange requirements for these medium and high technology
systems and equipment would be substantially higher than in the past.
1/ The Borrower's comments in this respect are given in Annex 6.

and human resources
Operations Dept.
Ref to Completion Report for Viigoara Irrigation
Project (RO-15o9) and your letter dated
August 13, 1980
The Bank mission who prepared the Completion Report has
made a comprehensive analysis from the technical and economic point
of view. In general terms the report accuratelly reflected the im-
plementation of the project against appraisal estirnations.
In our opinion some conclusions need to be reviewed taking
into account the following remarks:
k) Viigoara Irrigation Project with lo7,ooo ha is one of
the large irrigation schemes financed by the Bank, not
only in homania but in other countries too. Its imple-
mentation needed special technical and monitoring ac-
tions on behalf of the Ministry for Agriculture, Bank
for Agriculture and Food Industry and other ministries
involved in (Ministry for Machinery Building, Ministry
for Material Constructions).
The project which covers a varied area of flood plain,
plateau with two terraces with levels varying up to 6o m,
some valleys and rivers, has been satisfactorily imple-
mented from the technical point of view, fitted in the
original cost estimate in spite of the high inflation
rate in the world and average yields at full production
will exceed the appraisal estirm.ates (some units reached
full production since 1986).
These are the basic conclusions regarding the implemen-
tation of the project and we consider that they could
have been better emphasized in the report.
b) The project was 9olo implemented in a 5 year period
(198o-1984), while the remaining lo; representing drai-
nage works are to be rescheduled fo: the next years.
According to our experience gained while implementing,
over 30 large irrigation projects, drainage works should
be acnieved after irrigation works are completed only
when a humidity excess appears. Consequently, we could
consider that, there is no delay in the execution of
these works, it is rather a deliberate reschedule -made
by our specialists.
On this basis we could say that moot . art of tle pro ject
was implernrented in 5 years inotead of '3 year!3 as mission
estim,'Im.d.

c) In the report it is often mentioned that a slow-down of
execution works in the 1981-1983 period was due to the
lack of bugetary allocations as a result of some finan-
cial difficulties. The main reason for this is a change
in the technical solution to the main pumping station
on the Danube and also in the reorganization of the Cons-
truction Trust (within the district) by establishing an
IEELIF in each district, which implied transfers of equip-
ment and personnal, thus affecting the initial target.
Most of delays were made up for in 1984.
d) Foreign exchange cost of the project was underestimated
by the bank missions not only on appraisal time but also
in the Completion Report.
in order to avoid further di scussions on indirect foreign
exchange we would like to mention that in the BAFI report
we used the foreign exchange percentages for every mste-
rial or equipment agreed by the Bank for other projects.
Despite this, the foreign exchange estimated by BAFI was
59.9 million $ and Bank's mission reduced it to 41.4 mil-
lion $.
e)In connection with your recommendation for including a
larger number of imported articles in future projects we
feel that this cannot be justified from the economic point
of view.
Then materials arid equipments are manufactured by the bor-
rowing country and if their cost is cheaper than thoseiim-
ported, then any provision foreseeing any imports would
involve a higher investment cost and a reduction of eco-
nomic efficiency. At the same time the proposal is not ac-
cording to the Guidelines for proc,Lrement (paragraph 3.1)
and with the Bank's policy to assist in the development
of borrowing countries.
f) Ne strongly feel that in the Completion keport your com-
ments should only refer to the project area and should
not comprise some i7eneral issues relating to the natio-
nal economy especially when they are not justifiable. We
could argue to any kind of suggestion in connection with
the increase of project efficiency , improvement of main-
tainance and operation methods applied in the project but
we do not consider it adequate for the mission to refer
to issues outside tiie project and to make comments and
evaluations which have not been previously discussed with
the partner.
'Phe above mentioned remarks are only the main comments to
tr,e  Completion YReport.
