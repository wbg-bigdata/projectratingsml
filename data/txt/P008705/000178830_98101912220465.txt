APPRAISAL OF
VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
ROMANIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Romania's agricultural sector is an important contributor to the
national economy, second only to the industrial sector. In 1976, it accounted
for about 18.3% of national income, about 36% of labor force, 23% of exports
and about 30% of convertible foreign exchange earnings.  Agriculture has con-
tributed to Romania's economic growth in several important ways: in addition
to providing food, it has been a source of raw materials for industry; a
source of capital and foreign earnings to help finance industrial development,
and a source of labor for growth of other sectors. Irrigation is important -
for stabilizing and increasing crop yields in the southern and eastern plains,
where rainfall during the cropping season fluctuates widely from year to year
and in some years results in crop failures. Only about 35% of the economic-
ally irrigable land is presently irrigated. Government has been emphasizing
expansion of irrigation to achieve growth and greater stability in agricul-
tural production. In furtherance of this policy, Government has requested the
Bank's assistance to help finance the Viisoara Irrigation Project, which is
located in the southern region of Romania, about 100 km west of Bucharest (Map
TIBRD 13020).
ii.       Bank lending to Romania, since it became a member in December 1972,
has totalled US$697.3 million (14 loans) of which US$331.0 million (6 loans)
or 47% is in the agricultural sector. The proposed loan of US$40.5 million
would be the seventh loan in the agricultural sector and the fourth in the
irrigation subsector. Progress on previous loans is generally satisfactory.
iii.      Of the gross project area of 115,340 ha, the proposed project would
provide irrigation and drainage facilities for a net area of 110,290 ha, of
which presently 11% is under irrigation and 89% is under rainfed cultivation;
the remaining area would either continue to be under rainfed cultivation
(3,480 ha) or be occupied by project works and farm roads (1,570 ha). The
project would improve the existing irrigation and drainage facilities on 70% ot
the area presently under irrigation, and would incorporate the remaining 30%
within the new irrigation schemes. About 80% of the project area is owned and
farmed by 42 Agricultural Production Cooperatives (CAPs) and 20% by 5 State
Agricultural Enterprises (IASs). An area of 107,400 ha would utilize a maximum
of about 77 m3/sec from the Danube River flow, while 2,890 ha would receive
water from the Olt River through the existing Cringeni dam, which would be
raised. Supplies from the Danube River would be pumped over varying heights
into the canal networks consisting mainly of concrete lined canals. About
46 large and 180 small pumping stations would pressurize water, which would
be distributed through buried pipe networks on 77,800 ha for sprinkler, and
on 30,350 ha for furrow irrigation. About 2,140 ha would be irrigated, mainly
for rice, by ponding. Surface drainage networks would be provided in 77,540
ha, and tile drainage in 5,000 ha; the latter area is also slightly to



- ii -
moderately saline and would be reclaimed under the project.  Other project
works include soil erosion control works (10,800 ha); river training works
(2,030 ha); land leveling (30,350 ha); deep plowing (63,400 ha); and deep
ripping (2,160 ha). The project would also furnish 1,330 tractors and other
farm machinery, and equipment for operation and maintenance of project works.
iv.       Total project cost, including physical and price contingencies but
excluding interest during construction, is estimated at US$153.5 million, of
which the foreign exchange component would be US$40.5 million (26%). The pro-
posed Bank loan of US$40.5 million would finance in full the foreign exchange
component. Of the local cost (US$113.0 million), 73% (US$83.0 million) would
be contributed from the State budget, 19% (US$21.0 million) would be advanced
by the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) to the CAPs, and 8%
(US$9.0 million) would be provided by the CAPs.
v.        The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA), through its
various departments and trusts, would be responsible for planning, construc-
tion and supervision of all project activities except for the river training
works, which would be designed and constructed by the National Water Council
(NWC). Plannning and design of irrigation and drainage works would be carried
out by the Institute for Land Reclamation Studies and Design (ISPIF), and con-
struction by the Construction Trust for Land Reclamation Works (TCIF); both
organizations are a part of the Ministry's Department of Land Reclamation
and Agricultural Construction (DIFCA). The project works would be operated
and maintained by the Ministry's Central for Exploitation of Land Reclamation
Works (CELIF). All concerned agencies are competent to carry out the pro-
posed works satisfactorily. Procurement of all goods financed directly under
the proposed loan would be arranged following international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Project implementation would
start in 1978 and would be completed in six years by 1983; irrigation would
commence on 20% of the area in 1981, and the whole area would be under irri-
gation in the 1983 cropping season.
vi.       The pipe distribution networks and the on-farm irrigation equipment
serving the CAPs would be financed through BAFI loans. The existing procedures
for on-lending and interest rates have already been reviewed and accepted by
the Bank for previous projects. Arrangements for the supply of other inputs
as well as the marketing aspects of the project are satisfactory.
vii.      At full development in 1986, the total value of agricultural pro-
duction would increase by 115%; the incremental crop production of various
project commodities would be: maize 269,500 tons; sugar beet 233,800 tons,
vegetables 35,900 tons; soybean 14,900 tons; fruits and grapes 7,500 tons;
alfalfa (hay) 77,900 tons; and silage maize and other fodders 498,100 tons.
Net value of annual production would increase by 150% or by US$35.2 million.
Most of the project output would, directly or indirectly, help to earn or save
foreign exchange. The project's economic rate of return is estimated at 14%.
The project would double labor productivity. Because of the socio-economic
system in Romania, the project would have little direct effect on the incomes
of farm workers, but would help to increase their incomes indirectly through
its impact on the growth and development of the economy.



- iii -
viii.     Agreements having been reached during negotiations on the issues set
forth in the report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40.5 mil-
lion to the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) with the guarantee
of the Socialist Republic of Romania for a term of 15 years including 3 years
of grace at 7.9% interest.






VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
ROMANIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania has requested
the Bank's assistance in financing the Viisoara Irrigation Project. The pro-
posed project would increase and stabilize the agricultural production on a
gross area of 115,340 ha (113,770 ha net), located about 100 km west of
Bucharest in Teleorman district (Map IBRD 13020), by providing irrigation and
drainage facilities. Presently, 12,170 ha of this area is irrigated, mostly
inadequately, and 101,930 ha net is under rainfed cultivation. About 5,000 ha
of saline land, presently under low-yielding cultivation would be reclaimed to
become fully productive. The project area is held by 42 Agricultural Produc-
tion Cooperatives (CAPs) having an active membership of about 35,600; and 5
State Agricultural Enterprises (IASs) which employ about 3,100 workers.
1.02      Romania joined the Bank on December 15, 1972.  The proposed loan
for Viisoara Irrigation Project would be the fifteenth Bank loan to Romania,
bringing the lending total to US$737.8 million. Previous six loans to the
agricultural sector account for a total of US$331.0 million or 47% of total
lending. These are: (i) Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project (US$70 mil-
lion); (ii) Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project (US$30 million); (iii)
The agricultural component of the Flood Recovery Project (US$40 million); (iv)
Rasova-Vederoasa Irrigation and Agricultural Development Project (US$60 mil-
lion); (v) Ialomita-Calmatui Irrigation Project (US$60 million); and (vi) Pig
Production and Processing Project (US$71 million). The proposed loan would
be the seventh in this sector.
1.03      The proposed project was identified by Government in consultation
with the Bank and a preparation report was submitted in January/March 1977.
The project was appraised in May 1977 by a mission consisting of Messrs. S.
Niaz, T. Haile-Mariam and N. Monteith (Bank) and R. Qureshi (Consultant).
This report is based on their findings.
II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Country Background
2.01      Romania has an area of 237,500 km2 and a population of 21.6 mil-
lion (January 1977 census), which is increasing at an annual rate of about
1%. The rural population is estimated at about 11.3 million (53%). GNP per
capita in 1976 is estimated at US$1,450 (based on the Bank Atlas methodology).
2.02      The country is endowed with abundant supply of many natural
resources such as minerals, sources of energy, land suitable for agriculture,



and exploitable irrigation water, but it also depends on imports of some key
raw materials particularly iron ore, and has recently become a net importer of
energy. It is self sufficient in food and is a net exporter of many agricul-
tural commodities, including maize, fruit, vegetables and livestock products.
The State manages resource allocation and product distribution to achieve
its social and economic development objectives which are outlined for each
5-year period in a national plan and are detailed for each year in annual
plans.
B. The Agricultural Sector
2.03      The Setting.  Agricultural land is estimated at about 14.9 million
ha of which 65% is arable, 30% is under pastures and the remaining 5% is
occupied by orchards and vineyards. The soils are generally fertile and the
climate suitable to grow a wide variety of crops, and to raise livestock and
poultry. However, periods of drought and spells of excessive rainfall are
common, causing frequent fluctuations in production and constraining optimal
utilization of agricultural resources. The country has abundant sources of
exploitable irrigation water including the Danube River which is the major
source for areas in the south and the southeast. About 5.3 million ha or 36%
of the agricultural land is economically irrigable, of which about 1.9 million
ha was irrigated in 1977.
2.04      About 9.8 million ha is presently cultivated; major crops are:
maize (34%), wheat and other grains (30%), fodder (15%), potatoes and vege-
tables (5%), sunflower (5%), sugar beet (3%), and soybean and other pulses
(2%). In 1977, the livestock population amounted to about 30.8 million, of
which cattle were about 6.3 million (20%), pigs about 10.2 million (33%),
sheep and goats about 14.3 million (47%). Poultry population was around 91.5
million.
2.05      The agricultural labor force is about 3.6 million (36% of total),
most of which consists of either active members of CAPs or employees of LASs.
A large number of the labor force consists of old members, most of whom are
unskilled and therefore cannot be readily used outside of the agricultural
sector. The young are actively sought by industry in accordance with national
priorities and have a tendency to migrate to urban areas to seek employment.
Consequently, the agricultural labor force had declined by about 40% since
1960 and is expected to continue to decline in the future. This shift of
labor from the agricultural sector is being compensated by stepping up the
rate of mechanization of agriculture.
2.06      Currently, there is one tractor per 76 ha of arable land and one
grain harvester per 176 ha. Fertilizer application is low (100 kg of active
substance per ha), and crop yields amount to about 60% to 80% of the average
yields for other East European countries.
2.07      Agricultural research, training and extension service programs are
satisfactory. Farm workers are generally receptive to new crop and animal
husbandry practices, and the well organized and coordinated institutions
assist them to adapt new technology.



2.08      Agriculture in the Economy.  Agriculture is a basic branch of the
Romanian economy and plays a major role in the country's economic growth. The
agricultural sector is the largest employer of labor and is an important con-
tributor to foreign trade, both as a direct earner of foreign exchange and in-
sofar as its growth saves imports. In 1976, this sector accounted for 18.3%
of the national income, 23% of exports and 30% of convertible currency earn-
ings. Thus, quite apart from the provision of direct inputs from agriculture
to industry, the agricultural sector has paid for a significant proportion of
the imported inputs needed for industry. Agriculture also has been a source
of labor for the growth of industry and related sectors. Thus the develop-
ment of the industrial sector largely depends on a stable agricultural out-
put growth. Despite its importance in the economy, the agricultural sector
remains significantly underdeveloped with low productivity and a low degree
of stability of production growth.
2.09      Annual investments in agriculture increased from Lei 10.3 billion
(US$515 million) during the 1966-1970 plan period to Lei 15.4 billion (US$770
million) during 1971-1975. The sector's share of total investments about
equalled its direct contribution to national income. Despite the increase in
investments, however, annual growth rate of agricultural production was low,
averaging about 3% during 1971-1975, and labor productivity remained at less
than one-third that of industry. This was due mainly to unfavorable weather
(low rainfall in 1973 and 1974, and floods in 1975), and partly a result of
insufficient investments relative to the absorptive capacity of the sector.
There is a need to increase investments in agriculture to help attain stable
growth and development of the economy, and to raise productivity of farm
labor.
2.10      Future Development.  Government strategy has been, and rightly, to
intensify agriculture through investments in irrigation and mechanization with
a view to raise labor and land productivity, and to raise gross production of
livestock oriented crops both for domestic consumption and for indirect and
direct exports. In addition, Government's present policy is to allocate
increasingly larger share of investments in agriculture to CAPs, which is a
move in the right direction because it promotes efficient allocation of re-
sources within the agricultural sector. In the past the IASs had received
a higher share of investments relative to their share of cultivated land and
as a result the marginal productivity of capital has tended to be lower in
IASs than that of CAPs.
2.11      During the 1976-1980 plan period, agriculture's share of national
income is projected to decline slightly, but compared to the 1971-1975 plan,
annual average investment would increase by 51% to about Lei 23.2 billion
(US$1.2 billion), about 50% of which would be allocated to CAPs, and AMEs
and 16% to IASs. Investments in irrigation infrastructure and farm machinery
would also rise; area under irrigation would increase by 58% from about 1.5
million ha to about 2.6 millon ha. There would be one tractor for every
60 ha of arable land; fertilizer application rate would also increase sub-
stantially and yields of major crops are expected to rise by 30% to 40%.
In accordance with the long-term national planning, the quantities of live-
stock would continue to increase at substantial rates and their quality



-4-
would continue to be improved by crossbreeding with imported stock and selected
local breeds. Total agricultural output is projected to grow by an annual rate
of 5.1% to 7.6%; the increase in 1976 was 17.2%. The proposed project is an
important component of Government's plan to achieve these objectives.
2.12      Previous Agricultural Projects.  Progress in the implementation of
the Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project (Loan 1082-RO), the Sadova-Corabia
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1083-RO), the agricultural component of the
Flood Recovery Project (Loan 1169-RO), and the Rasova-Vederoasa Irrigation
and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1247-RO) is satisfactory. Con-
struction of the Giurgiu Project would be completed on schedule by the end of
1977; about 50,000 ha (50%) is under irrigation during the current cropping
season. Construction of project works under the Rasova Project are well under
way. Out of the nine procurement contracts, eight have already been awarded.
These also include the procurement for the Ialomita-Calmatui Irrigation
Project (Loan 1368-RO) which became effective only in June 1977. Physical
facilities for four of the eleven dairy units under the Rasova project are
nearing completion and purchase contract for the import of about 4,600 heifers

A. The Project Area
3.01      Location.  Bounded by the Vedea River in the east, the Calmatui
River in the west and the Danube River in the south, the project area is
located in the Teleorman district about 100 km west of Bucharest (map IBRD
13020). Alexandria (population 37,500) which is the headquarters of the
district, is located at the project's eastern boundary; Zimnicea (population
15,000), a port town on the Danube, is at its southern boundary.
3.02      Topography and Drainage.  About 13% of the project area constitutes
a part of the old Danube Flood Plain, which is now protected by a dike; the
remaining area consists of several terraces that are 5 m to 75 m above the
Flood Plain, and generally slope towards the Danube River. The largest and
the highest terrace, called the Viisoara Terrace, is 60 m to 75 m above the
Flood Plain and contains about 80,000 ha; the Zimnicea Terrace, which has
6,530 ha and is the smallest in area, is only 5 m to 15 m high. Tributaries
of the Vedea and the Calmatui Rivers cut across and drain the terraces,
except the area south of Izvoarele River where numerous closed depressions,
having no access to any natural drainage are found. The narrow valley of the
Calmatui River, which slopes into the Suhaia Lake, is often flooded by the
flow of the Calmatui and the Urlui Rivers. Except for about 32,750 ha, mostly
in the north, drainage of the project area would have to be improved to
maximize benefits from irrigated agriculture.
3.03      Population.  Total population in the project area is estimated at
153,500, of which about 61,800 (40%) constitutes the active labor force.



Labor employed in the agriculture sector is estimated at 38,700 of which about
3,100 are employed by the State farms and the remaining 35,600 are active
members of CAPs. Most farm workers belong to this area, and are literate.
Generally they are healthy and hard working.
3.04      Electricity and Water Supply.  All towns and villages in the project
area are served with electricity, which is supplied from the national grid.
Each village household draws its water supply manually from shallow open wells.
The towns, however, are provided with piped water supply.
3.05      Communications.  Three primary roads that link Alexandria with
Zimnicea in the south, with Turnu Magurele in the southwest and with Rosiorii-
de-Vede in the northwest pass through the project area. In addition the road
from Rosiorii-de-Vede to Turnu Magurele serves the northwestern part. Several
secondary roads connect project villages with these primary roads, and almost
all villages are accessible by asphalted roads. The existing farm road net-
work, which is mostly ungraveled, serves the agricultural needs of the project
area adequately. The railway line connecting Alexandria with Zimnicea and
Rosiorii-de-Vede forms the eastern boundary of the project area; another line
which links Rosiorii-de-Vede with Turnu Magurele is at the project area's
northwestern boundary.
B. Natural Resources
3.06      Climate.  The climate is characterized by warm summers and cold
winters. Thirty years of climatic data at Alexandria indicate an average
monthly maximum temperature of 30 0C in July and August and an average monthly
minimum of 5 C in April and 7 C in October. Annual precipitation averages
550 mm, of which about 350 mm occurs in the cropping season (April-October).
Periods of drought and of above average rainfall are not uncommon; these
respectively emphasize the need for irrigation and drainage. Further details
are in Annex 1.
3.07      Soils.  Detailed surveys indicate that the soils mostly consist of
Chernozems which have developed over deposits of loess. They are very fertile,
have a sandy loam to clay loam texture and a fairly uniform deep protile, ot
low to moderate permeability and a good water retention capacity. These soils
are moderately rich in organic matter and contain 2% to 3% calcium carbonate.
About 22% of the area to be irrigated is categorized as Class I; 64% as
Class II; 11% as Class III, mostly on account of its eroded nature and salt
accumulation; and 3% as Class V.
3.08      Water Resources.  All internal rivers that flow through the project
area are small and some only flow intermittently. Their discharges vary but
do not exceed 20 m3/sec. These rivers therefore cannot provide water for
the project. Their supplies are however used for some small local irrigation
schemes, and also for fisheries development in several small storages that are
created for this purpose. Groundwater of low quality is mostly available
throughout the project area at variable depths, but in quantities that would



-6-
be inadequate to irrigate large areas. The only reliable sources of irriga-
tion water for the project area are the Danube River to the south and the Olt
River (normal flow about 400 m3/sec) to the west. Water would have to be
either pumped or supplied through storages from these sources for use in the
project area. Because of relatively smaller supplies in the Olt and the uses
to which its supplies are already committed, the project has been designed to
use the Danube supplies. In the future (after 1990), however, a part of the
project area (37,400 ha) would receive water from the Olt-Vedea Canal (Map
IBRD 13020), which would be fed from the Olt River. The Cringeni Dam, which
would be the source of water for 2,890 ha of the project area in the Calmatui
Valley, would also receive water from the Olt River.
C. Land Tenure and Farm Organizations
3.09       The project area is either owned or controlled by the State.  Of the
gross area of 115,340 ha, 91,800 ha (80%) is cultivated by 42 CAPs and the
remaining 23,540 ha (20%) is operated by 5 IASs. About 8,000 ha of CAP land
(8%) is distributed among eligible cooperative members as individual plots for
their personal use in sizes that do not generally exceed 0.15 ha per member or
0.3 ha per family. The land owned by a CAP varies from 600 ha to 5,500 ha
with an average size of about 2,180 ha, and the size of a State farm ranges
from 2,100 ha to 10,400 ha. Farm sizes have little or no influence on income
to farm workers whose income is determined in accordance with the directives
issued by the State and the national wage scales.
3.10       The governing body of a CAP is its General Assembly whose member-
ship consists of working adults in the CAP. The Assembly elects the CAP's
President, and is responsible for preparing its annual plans ratifying all
purchase and sale contracts and allocation of CAP's income, all in accordance
with the general guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry
(MAIA). All executive functions are performed by a Council. CAPs meet the
labor requirement from their members and normally do not hire labor. Mem-
bers are presently entitled to receive a minimium remuneration of Lei 1,000
(US$50.00) per month if planned production is achieved and a bonus is paid
if production exceeds the target. Further details are in Annex 2.
3.11       The chief executive officer of an IAS is its Director, who is
appointed by the Ministry. He is assisted by a Chief economist and the chiefs
of the farms in the IAS. The governing body of an IAS consists of its top
management, representatives of the unions and the Party and the elected repre-
sentaties of the workers. IASs employ all labor required, some of which is
seasonal. Labor is paid in accordance with the national wage rates; unskilled
workers (urban and rural), for example, receive about Lei 1,200 (US$60) per
month. Further details are given in Annex 2.

D. Agricultural Production
3.12      Land Use.  Of the gross area of 115,340 ha, the net cultivable area
is presently 114,100 ha; the remaining is occupied by waterways and roads. Of
the net area, about 101,930 ha (89%) is under rainfed cultivation and 12,170
ha (11%) is presently irrigated, of which 6,530 ha is on the Zimnicea Terrace,
2,140 ha on the Danube Flood Plain and 3,500 ha is scattered on the Plain and
on the terraces in blocks varying in size from 40 ha to 540 ha. Except for the
Zimnicea Terrace, which is irrigated by supplies pumped from the Danube, these
areas are irrigated either from small storages on internal rivers or from
groundwater. Presently the cropping intensity on the unirrigated land is 100%;
it is also about 100% on the irrigated land due to inadequate water supplies.
Cereals (maize and wheat) occupy 62% of the area, while oilseeds (soybean and
sunflower) are cultivted on 11%. Sugar beet (2%), vegetables (3%), grapes and
fruit (5%) and fodder crops (17%) account for the remaining 27%.
3.13      Production.  Present crop yields are low for the irrigated area due
to inadequate supplies, but are reasonable for the rainfed area as production
is supervised by well-qualified technicians and reasonable amounts of inputs
are applied. Due to wide variations in rainfall, however, the yields are
subjected to substantial yearly fluctuations (+ 40%) and in some years, due
to long drought periods, there may be a complete failure of some crops. With-
out irrigation, this erratic pattern of crop yields is likely to continue.
Based on five representative years, the average yields of major crops under
unirrigated conditions are: maize 3.2 tons/ha, wheat 2.5 tons/ha, alfalfa (hay)
4.3 tons per ha, sunflower 1.6 tons/ha and soybean 1.3 tons/ha. Under existing
irrigation average yields of major crops are: maize 5.1 tons/ha and alfalfa
(hay) 8.1 tons/ha. Areas under various crops, their yields under present and
future without project conditions, and corresponding total production are
summarized in Annex 1, Table 2.
E. Farm Inputs
3.14      Seeds, Fertilizer and Pesticides.  Improved seeds are multiplied
on research stations and selected State and cooperative farms. Seed production,
processing, testing, quality control and distribution is entrusted to special
organizations (SEMROM, AGROSEM, etc). Seeds of high quality are produced in
large quantities; substantial quantities are also exported. In Romania,
fertilizer production of ammonium nitrate and superphosphate is estimated to
exceed 5 million tons per year, but about 110,000 tons of potash are imported.
The average fertilizer application rate in the project area is about 270
kg/ha (active substance about 80 kg) consisting mainly of ammonium nitrate
and superphosphate. Currently, State farms receive higher allocation of fer-
tilizers as compared to CAPs, but this disparity does not exist if lands are
irrigated. Plant protection measures are usually adequate and timely. Most
plant protection chemicals are produced within the country; the present
production amounts to over 25,000 tons.



-8-
3.15      Farm Machinery.  CAPs in the project area are served by nine Sta-
tions for Agricultural Machinery (SAMs), whose activities are supervised and
coordinated by the Teleorman District Agricultural Mechanization Enterprise
(AME). The State farms own, operate and maintain the equipment required by
them. As an average there is one tractor to every 80 ha in the project area,
but it is estimated that at least 1/4 of these are used principally for trans-
port of agricultural inputs and output. Land preparation is completely
mechanized, while seeding, fertilizing, spraying of pesticides and harvesting
operations are mechanized to a considerable degree on the State farms and to
a lesser degree on the CAPs. About 10% to 15% of the tractors are usually
replaced annually, and additional tractors, trailers and harvesters will be
required to intensify cultivation and cope with increased production following
introduction of irrigation.
F. Agricultural Research and Extension
3.16      Agricultural Research. The Academy of Agriculture and Forestry
Sciences coordinates all agricultural research in Romania, which is carried
out in 13 institutes, 6 central stations and 41 research stations. These
facilities, which are well distributed throughout the country's ecology
zones, are staffed by about 1,600 scientists and cover about 80,000 ha.
The Teleorman Research Station, located close to Alexandria, is carrying
out research in the applied aspects of irrigated agriculture.
3.17      Agricultural Extension.  Extension services are provided by the
General Directorate of Agriculture in each district, and by the General
Directorate of Teleorman in the project area. This Directorate is staffed by
specialists in crop and livestock production. In addition, each CAP or IAS
has its own resident specialists, who are furnished to the CAPs by the General
Directorate of Agriculture, and to the IASs by the Department of State Agri-
culture. The extension staff has a direct say in improvement of cultural
practices and application of technology instead of an advisory role. Research
findings rapidly pass into practice and the supervisory staff of each CAP
and IAS adequately monitor their application. Training to field staff is
provided at the General Directorate through short and medium term courses.
Further details are in Annex 1.
G. Investment Financing
3.18      Investments in projects, which specifically benefit the IASs, are
financed generally from the State budget and from compulsory savings of such
entities. The major sources of financing investments in CAPs are loans from
the Bank for Agriculture and Food industry (BAFI), and savings of the co-
operatives. Financing of investments in State enterprises under BAFI loans
is relatively small but is expected to increase in future. Investments in
those components of large-scale irrigation works, however, which serve both
the IAS and CAP lands are financed through the State budget; such funds are



- 9 -
channelled through BAFI. Short-term credit for production, and credits
for marketing and processing of agricultural products are also extended by
BAFI to suitable borrowers.
3.19      BAFI was founded in 1968 for channelling funds exclusively for the
agricultural sector. It has six specialized departments, three of which
administer the financing of production, marketing and processing of agricul-
tural products. The other three are responsible for planning, financial
control and general administration. BAFI operates through 39 branches,
with one branch in each district, and 92 sub-branches. The project area
is served by the district branch at Alexandria, and two sub-branches located
at Rosiorii-de-Vede and at Zimnicea.
3.20      BAFI obtains funds for its operations from the State budget, deposits
by various State enterprises and cooperatives, borrowings from the National
Bank of Romania, foreign loans and its own statutory capital of Lei 800 mil-
lion (US$40 million). For large-scale investments financed by,Government,
BAFI obtains funds from the State budget at no interest. Deposit funds with
BAFI bear an interest of 1.5%. BAFI borrows from the National Bank at 1% per
year, and extends long-term loans at interest rates of 3% to 4% per annum and
short-term production loans at 4%. These interest rates are positive because
of a near zero rate of inflation in Romania, allow BAFI to cover its adminis-
trative expenses and have been accepted as reasonable for the previous Bank-
financed projects. BAFI loans for permanent irrigation and drainage facili-
ties and erosion control works are repaid within 25 years including 5 years
of grace, and loans for portable irrigation equipment are repaid in 8 years
including 3 years of grace. These terms can be adjusted by BAFI to avoid
excessive financial burden on the borrowing entities. Most of BAFI's net
profits are returned to the State budget.
3.21      At present most investments in IASs are financed from the State
budget, funds for which are channelled through BAFI; credit financing is
of minor importance. Normally, about 70% of the on-farm investments in CAPs
are financed through BAFI loans, but in special cases, up to 95% of such
investments may be financed by BAFI; CAPs are required to contribute the
balance. CAPs and IASs are required to retain a part of their net annual
incomes for financing production expenses in the next cropping season. If
CAPs need additional funds as a result of the project, BAFI has well coordi-
nated plans and adequate resources to provide them with necessary short-term
credit.
H. Marketing
3.22      Agricultural produce in Romania is marketed by 13 State controlled
and operated Centrals; each deals in specific commodities like cereals, sugar,
vegetables and fruits etc. Around larger towns and cities, private markets
are operated by peasants for selling the produce from their individual plots.
In each district, there also exist agrocoop markets that sell produce from
CAP lands that is in excess of the contract quantities to be delivered to the
State marketing agencies. Both the private and agrocoop markets handle only
a small volume of produce.



- 10 -
3.23      Each marketing Central is represented in the country's 39 districts
by a marketing enterprise, which is the Central's executing agency. Each
enterprise has several collecting centers which are suitably located throughout
the district. All enterprises and their collecting centers are well equipped
to collect, handle and distribute various commodities without excessive losses.
Prices, which are fixed by the State, play little or no role in allocating
produce among various domestic markets. The marketing enterprises, however,
do have adequate incentive in terms of margins to promote distribution as
planned.
3.24      The project output would be marketed by four Centrals through
their enterprises and their sub-units. As all production plans are closely
coordinated with produce use and its distribution, adequate measures have
already been planned for handling anticipated incremental output. Storage,
processing and transport facilities would be improved and expanded under
separate arrangements. Further details are in Annex 3.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The main objectives of the project are to increase and stabilize
crop production in a gross area of 115,340 ha, and to raise labor productivity.
These would be achieved by providing works and facilities that are described
below; further details are in Annex 4.
B. Detailed Features
Irrigation Works
4.02      The project area would be served by 3 irrigation systems:  (i) the
Viisoara System, which would cover a gross area of 99,720 ha (98,320 ha net),
including a rice area (2,140 ha) and scattered plots (3,500 ha) that are pre-
sently irrigated from local schemes; (ii) the Zimnicea System, which would
consist of 9,210 ha gross (9,080 ha net), including 6,530 ha of irrigated land
on the Zimnicea Terrace; and (iii) the Calmatui System with 2,930 ha gross
(2,890 ha net). These systems are illustrated on Map IBRD 13020. About 3,480
ha would remain unirrigated.
4.03      Viisoara Irrigation  System.  This System would be designed to uti-
lize a maximum of 69.5 m3/sec of the Danube flow, which would be diverted into
the main canal at Km 569.7 of the River. An intake regulator in the flood
protection dike would feed the canal. In periods (usually in September) when
the Danube stage is low, a floating pumping station (SPA-1) consisting of
three barges, each fitted with six pumping units would raise the water into
the canal, which would discharge into the Suhaia Lake on the Danube Flood



- 11 -
Plain, and a fixed pumping station (SRP) on the northern shore of the Lake
would lift a flow of 57.5 m3/sec over about 77.3 m into the main canal on
the Viisoara Terrace. Data on pumping stations and canals is summarized in
Annex 4, Tables 1 and 2.
4.04      The main canal on the Terrace would be about 40 km long.  At km 28.8,
a repumping station (SRP-1) would further lift about 15.9 m3/sec over 16.0 m
to irrigate the northern and the western parts of the project area. Eleven
distributary systems offtake from the main canal - two (CD-1 and CD-2) in the
Flood Plain, and nine (CD-3 to CD-l1) on the Terrace. A pumping station (SRP-
2) designed to lift 3.3 m3/sec over 60.0 m would be located on the eastern end
of distributary CD-2 to irrigate higher areas on a nearby terrace. All dis-
tributaries and canals on the Terrace are concrete-lined, except for the tail
11 km of the main canal which would be kept unlined to permit its enlargement
and link up with the future Olt-Vedea canal in the north (para 3.08). Tertiary
canals would offtake from the distributaries at a normal spacing of 4 km, and
would feed the pressure pumping stations.
4.05      Operation of the canal system would be automated by the use of
hydraulically operated constant downstream water level gates at suitable loca-
tions. Total length of the canals in the System would amount to about 203 km,
which would involve an earthwork of 9.8 million m3 and concrete lining of
about 1.8 million m2. About 100 structures consisting of regulators, drops,
bridges, siphons and weirs would be constructed on the System.
4.06      Irrigation supplies would be pressurized by two types of outdoor
pumping stations: (a) fixed or central, which would consist of 2 to 8 pumping
units and would serve relatively larger areas varying in size from 460 ha to
2,500 ha; and (b) individual stations, which would consist of semi-mobile pump-
ing units and would serve smaller areas (200 ha to 250 ha). Each fixed station
would feed a buried network with distribution pipes spaced 612 m apart; while
the individual pumping station would directly supply the distribution pipe and
thus such stations would be located 612 m apart on the distributary canals.
The individual pumping stations are more economical than the central stations
at any discount rate, but the use of the former is limited to those areas where
ground slopes are flatter and mostly furrow irrigation would be practiced.
There would be a total of 38 fixed stations for 57,030 ha; their discharge
would vary from 300 1/sec to 1,400 1/sec. The individual stations would
number about 176 for a total area of 39,150 ha; each station would have 2
pumps with discharge varying from 30 1/sec to 90 1/sec. Total power capacity
would be 40,370 kw at the central stations and 19,700 kw at the individual
stations.
4.07      The existing rice area (2,140 ha) would continue to be irrigated by
the basin method. About 65,830 ha, with ground slope mostly varying from 1%
to 3%, would be equipped for sprinkler irrigation; the remaining 30,350 ha
would be irrigated by furrows. A typical plot, to be irrigated by sprinkler
or furrow, would measure about 123 ha (612 m x 2,016 m).  A fixed or central
pressure pumping station would serve up to 20 such plots, while an individual
pumping station would supply only 2 such plots. For sprinkler irrigation,
hydrants would be located 72 m apart; for furrow irrigation, their spacing



- 12 -
would be increased to 216 m. Each hydrant would serve, by rotation, 6 lateral
positions - 3 on either side of the distribution pipe, but would have the
capacity to feed only 2 laterals simultaneously. Sprinklers would be spaced
18 m apart; each would irrigate an area of 18 m x 24 m at an intensity of 6.6
mm to 7.1 mm per hour. Each hydrant would feed 16 to 20 furrows through
portable aluminum and butyl pipe. Length of furrows would not exceed 200 m.
4.08      Zimnicea Irrigation System.  Presently this System is designed to
utilize 5.3 m3/sec from the Danube for irrigating an area of 6,530 ha on the
Zimnicea Terrace north of the Pasarea Canal, but about one-third of this area
does not receive adequate supplies due to insufficient carrying capacity in
the Pasarea canal which is used as the main conveyance for the System. Also
some of the surface drains serving Zimnicea Terrace do not have proper outlets.
Under the project, these constraints would be removed and the existing System
would be enlarged to (a) extend irrigation on 2,550 ha in the Danube Flood
Plain, south of the Pasarea Canal; and (b) extend irrigation, in future, in
the Contesti-Bujoru area (3,800 ha) lying to the east of the project boundary.
4.09      A new floating pumping station (SPA-3) with a capacity of 5.3 m3/sec
would be constructed about 1 km west of the existing station (SPA-2) at km
556.2, and would be linked with Pasarea Canal through a one km long new canal.
About 60% of this station's capacity would be used to extend irrigation out-
side the project area (Contesti-Bujoru area), whose share cost has been
excluded from the project cost estimate.  Capacity of the Pasarea canal would
be enlarged to 10.6 m3/sec at head and 4.9 m3/sec at tail. The two repumping
stations at Zimnicele and Gorganu, that lift water from the Pasarea Canal into
the canals on the Terrace have adequate capacity to meet the needs of the
Terrace. However two fixed pumping stations (SRP-5 and SRP-6), with an in-
stalled capacity of 2,300 kw, would be constructed on the Pasarea canal to
supply water to irrigate by sprinklers about 2,550 ha on the Danube Flood
Plain south of the Pasarea Canal. The distribution network from these 2
stations would be similar to that described in para 4.07.
4.10      Calmatui Irrigation System.  This System would be constructed to
irrigate 2,890 ha net in the Calmatui Valley by utilizing the water to be
developed at the existing Cringeni Dam after its storage capacity is increased
by 1982 under a separate project to be financed by Government. Supplies from
the Olt River, regulated at the raised Cringeni Dam, would feed the Calmatui
Irrigation System. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that: (a)
plans providing for an increase in the storage capacity of the Cringeni Dam
adequate to assure the full water requirements of 2,930 ha gross (2,890 ha
net) would have been formally approved by the Council of Ministers by December
31, 1980; and (b) the storage capacity of the Cringeni Dam would have been
increased by December 31, 1982, in order that sufficient water would be avail-
able to adequately irrigate the above area in the Calmatui Valley.
4.11      Releases from the Cringeni Dam would flow to the Calmatui Valley
through the Calmatui River channel, which would be improved under the project.
The present river channel has relatively flat bed slopes (1 in 1,000 to 1 in
5,000), is shallow and has insufficient capacity to carry the flood flows. In
most reaches, the River channel is silted up due to its meandering course and



- 13 -
in 3 out of the last 5 years about 2,000 ha were affected by river floods.
Under the project, the Calmatui River channel would be canalized between
Cringeni Dam and Suhaia Lake (87 km) to carry flood flows of 55 m3/sec up to
the Urlui confluence, and 77 m3/sec below the confluence, which have a prob-
ability of occurrence of 5%. The River channel would be straightened, cutting
off most meanders, and embankments would be constructed wherever necessary to
avoid river spills. Six fixed pumping stations, and four individual stations,
would lift water directly from the River and would supply pressurized water to
distribution networks for sprinkler irrigation. Size of area served by these
stations would range from 160 ha to 870 ha. Other features of distribution
network and on-farm equipment would be similar to that described for the
Viisoara System in para 4.07.
Drainage Works
4.12      Surface Drainage Networks.  The surface drainage networks to be con-
structed under the project would serve about 77,540 ha (Map IBRD 13020); the
remaining does not require any drainage works. About 41,730 ha, located north
of the Izvoarele River, contains heavier soils and flatter ground slopes and
would be provided with open drains at a spacing of 700 m. In the southern
part (18,700 ha), with medium soils and steeper ground slopes, a number of
isolated closed depressions exist. In this area the drains would have a
variable spacing of 500 m to 700 m. Twelve mobile diesel pumps would be pro-
vided to drain the depressions. All drains would discharge by gravity, either
directly into the Vedea or the Calmatui Rivers or into their several tributa-
ries. These drainage networks would be designed to remove in two to three
days the runoff resulting from a storm precipitation of 60 mm, which has
a probability of 5%. The average specific discharge would be 0.55 1/sec/ha.
Total length of drains would be about 760 km.
4.13      In the Danube Flood Plain and the Calmatui Valley, drainage would
be provided in the whole area (17,110 ha). A part of the Danube Flood Plain
and the Calmatui Valley are already served by inadequate existing drainage
systems, which would be remodelled under the project. New drains would be
added, where necessary. The design criteria for these drains would be the
same as for the Terrace drains, except that the specific discharge would be
0.84 1/sec/ha to include seepages from the River and the Terrace slopes.
Spacing between drains would be reduced to about 400 m. Total length of
drains would be 386 km, of which 141 km would be the aggregate length of the
remodelled drains. The capacity of the existing 5 drainage pumping stations
in the Flood Plain would be increased from a total of 16.5 m3/sec to 22.4
m3/sec.
4.14      Tile Drainage.  Under the project, tile drainage would be installed
in about 5,000 ha, of which about 4,700 ha is in the Danube Flood Plain and
300 ha in the Calmatui Valley. These areas consist of gleyed soils, which
are slightly to moderately saline, and are presently under cultivation, some
with salt-tolerant crops. Following completion of irrigation and drainage
works under the project, these areas would be reclaimed in 2 to 4 years by
leaching. Tile drains would be spaced 30 m apart. Most drains would out-
fall into surface drains or canals either with the assistance of eight new
pumping stations, that would be constructed under the project, or by gravity.
Data on drainage pumping stations is summarized in Annex 4, Table 4.



- 14 -
4.15      Power Supply Works.  The total installed capacity of all new irriga-
tion (143,080 kw) and drainage (700 kw) pumping stations, would amount to
143,780 kw (Annex 4, Tables 1 and 4). About 467 km of 20 kv power lines and
a number of transformer substations would be constructed under the project.
Miscellaneous Works
4.16      About 10,800 ha affected by soil erosion, would be protected in a
variety of ways: providing terraces on cropped land or pastures; reseeding
pastures on steeper slopes; constructing diversion banks at the edge of ter-
races; constructing gully stops and protected waterways, etc. About 30,350
ha consisting mainly of the area to be irrigated by furrows would be leveled.
Total excavation is estimated at about 15.2 million m3, with an average of
about 500 m3/ha. Deep plowing would be carried out on about 63,400 ha to
break up a shallow but dense pan that has formed about 20 to 25 cm below
ground surface as a result of cultivation. Deep ripping would be carried out
on about 2,160 ha, located mostly at the bottom of the depressions in the
southern part of the Viisoara Terrace, to break up the clay layers that have
deposited over time by waters accumulating in these depressions. Other works
would consist of relocation of roads, pipelines, and adjustment of farm bound-
aries to permit the formation of standard rectangular blocks for irrigation.
About 50 observation wells to monitor groundwater movement, and buildings and
facilities for operation and maintenance of the project works would be pro-
vided.
Equipment
4.17      Farm Machinery.  About 1,330 65-hp tractors, 400 cereal and 160
fodder harvesters and some cultivating and transportation equipment (Annex 7,
Tables 1 and 2) would be provided to SAMs (for CAPs) and IASs under the proj-
ect. About one-half of this equipment would replace the worn out machines
over the next three to five years and the other half would be provided to
cultivate, harvest and transport the increased production following introduc-
tion of irrigation; tractor availability would then increase to one tractor
per 67 ha.
4.18      Operation and Maintenance Equipment.  The equipment, listed in Annex
7, Table 2 is considered necesssary for the operation and maintenance of the
project works and would be provided to the Teleorman IELIF under the project.
C. Water Requirement and Availability
4.19      Water Requirement.  Net water requirements for project crops were
estimated at 3,388 m3/ha; the highest monthly net demand of 1,187 m3/ha would
occur in July. The overall system efficiency has been computed at 69%. Gross
water requirement at source would be 4,910 m3/ha, which would amount to a
total demand of 559 Mm3 during the cropping season, and 196 Mm3 (35%) in July.
About 545 Mm3 (97%) of the total demand would be met from the Danube River
through the Viisoara and the Zimnicea Irrigation Systems, and the remaining
would be supplied from the Cringeni Dam (Olt River). Further details are in
Annex 5.



- 15 -
4.20      Water Availability.  The main source of water for the project is
the Danube River which, in a year of low flow, carries a minimum of 2,100
m3/sec in October and 5,600 m3/sec in July. In other months of the cropping
season, river flows are higher (Chart 17853). Diversions for the project area
from the Danube River (107,400 ha net) in the months of July (highest) and
October (lowest) would be about 77 m3/sec and 6 m3/sec respectively or less
than 1.4% and 0.3% of the average river discharge in a year of low flow.
About 97% of the project area, therefore, would have an assured supply of
water from the Danube River.
4.21      The remaining 2,890 ha net in the Calmatui Valley would receive sup-
plies from the Olt River through the Cringeni Dam, which would be raised to
provide additional storage capacity. Raising of the Dam would be carried out
by 1982. Total water requirement for this area would be about 15 Mm3, of
which about 5 Mm3 (2.0 m3/sec) would be in July.
4.22      Water Quality.  The Danube water, near the site of the floating
pumping stations for the project is potable and is classified in C2S1 category,
which signifies good quality irrigation water.
4.23      Water Rights.  There is no international agreement among the Danube
River riparian states for the use of its water for irrigation but a convention
exists for development of the River for mutual benefits, and for protection
of navigation and water quality. The International Water Commission for the
Danube River, of which Romania is a member, is mainly concerned with schemes
which may interfere with navigation and water quality. The maximum diversion
for the project, in July, would amount to about 1.4% of the minimum river flow
in that month. Even when all of the 2.34 million ha that are potentially
irrigable from the Danube River have been equipped for irrigation, the aggre-
gate diversions from the Danube would not exceed 20% of its flow (1,130 m3/
sec) in July; 11% (440 m3/sec) in September and 4% (90 m3/sec) in October.
Diversions for the present and future projects dependent on the Danube River,
therefore, would not adversely affect the Danube supplies for international
navigation. There is no reason to expect, therefore, that the project would
raise issues on the use of Danube waters, and no agreement of other riparians
would be required. However, as for the previous Bank financed irrigation
projects in Romania, Government has furnished a letter of representation to
the Bank setting forth Romania's treaty obligations on the use of Danube
waters and confirming that the project presents no problem on the use of
international waters.
D. Status of Engineering
4.24      Various alternatives were studied by the Institue for Land Reclama-
tion Studies and Design (ISPIF) for the project's main works. The works
described above including the canal alignments have been chosen by ISPIF as
the most economical and appropriate; this choice is acceptable to the Bank.
ISPIF has already completed detailed designs and major drawings of all works;



- 16 -
detailed drawings would be prepared about six months ahead of the construc-
tion. Design of the River Training Works in the Calmatui Valley would be
carried out by the National Water Council (NWC).
E. Cost Estimates
4.25      The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies
but excluding interest during construction, is estimated at Lei 3,070 million
(US$153.5 million). This estimate is net of taxes and is based on expected
December 1977 prices. The foreign exchange component, which includes both
direct and indirect foreign costs, is estimated at US$40.5 million or 26% of
total cost. The cost estimates are based on unit rates of work that are
prevalent in Romania under the system of regulated prices of materials and
wages. Cost of equipment expected to be procured from foreign suppliers,
has been calculated at the international prices likely to prevail at the end
of 1977, and is estimated at US$8.0 million. Customs duty on imported equip-
ment averages about 15% and is estimated at about Lei 20 million (US$1.0 mil-
lion). It is not included in the cost estimate. Because detailed engineering
has already been carried out, physical contingencies have been provided at
7-1/2% of irrigation and drainage works and at 5% of other minor items. Price
contingencies on foreign exchange cost are compounded at annual increases of
7.5% in 1978 and 1979, and 7% thereafter. Due to a near zero inflation in
Romania, price contingencies on local costs are provided at 1% per annum.
Project's cost estimate is summarized in the table below; details are in Annex
6, Table 1.

- 17 -
F. Financing
4.26      The proposed Bank loan of US$40.5 million, to be made to BAFI, would
finance about 26% of total project costs, and would be equivalent to 100% of
the estimated foreign exchange component. The State budget would contribute
Lei 1,660 million (US$83.0 million) or 54% of total cost (or 73% of local
cost), which would be channelled through BAFI. BAFI loans to CAPs would
amount to Lei 420 million (US$21.0 million) or 14% of total cost (or 19% of
local cost), and the CAPs would contribute the remaining Lei 180 million
(US$9.0 million) or 6% of total project cost (or 8% of local cost). Normal
practice in Romania is to amortize irrigation projects in 25 years. BAFI
loans to CAPs for buried pipelines would be for 25 years including 5 years of
grace, and for on-farm equipment 8 years including 3 years of grace. However,
in accordance with the current Bank policy, the proposed Bank loan would be
made on standard terms for Romania, i.e. 15 years including 3 years of grace.
G. Implementation Schedule
4.27      The project works would be constructed in six years (1978 to 1983)
in accordance with the implementation schedule in Chart 17854. Irrigation
would commence in 1981 on 20% area (22,200 ha) and would cover 46% area
(50,800 ha) in 1982 and the full area in 1983. An estimated schedule of
expenditure is given in Annex 6, Table 2, and is summarized below:
Calendar Year                      1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983
Annual Estimated Expenditure        5.0    27.8    54.7    54.6       8.9      2.5
(US$ million equivalent)
Cumulative Expenditure              5.0    32.8    87.5   142.1   151.0   153.5
(US$ million equivalent)
H. Procurement
4.28      Although Romanian laws provide for international competitive bidding
and for joint ventures involving foreign and domestic enterprises, in practice
all irrigation works are constructed by Romanian Construction Trusts, which
are experienced and familiar with local conditions, methods and regulations.
This practice is acceptable to the Bank as because of regulated wages and
prices of materials, the Romanian construction costs are likely to be less
than those which might be bid by international contractors. Equipment and
materials equivalent in cost to the estimated foreign exchange component of
the project (US$40.5 million) would be procured under the proposed loan.
It was agreed during negotiations that items costing US$40.5 million



_ 18 -
including contingencies (Annex 7, Table 1) would be procured following inter-
national advertising and competitive bidding in accordance with the "Guide-
lines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits - March 1977".
Romanian manufacturers would be allowed a preference of 15% or the applicable
customs duty, whichever is lower, but the application of the preference has
not affected so far the outcome of bidding on previous irrigation projects,
and is not expected to significantly affect the result of bidding on the pro-
posed project. It is expected that foreign suppliers would win contracts
for most of the construction equipment (dozers, motor graders, motor scrapers,
tile laying machines and cranes) estimated to cost about US$8.0 million.
Other items to be procured through international competitive bidding (about
US$32.5 million) are available domestically and, based on experience with
previous Bank-financed irrigation projects, it is expected that the Romanian
manufacturers would be successful in bidding for these items. The remaining
equipment and materials (Annex 7, Table 2) estimated to cost about US$34.4
million equivalent would be procured under Romanian procedures and would not
be eligible for disbursement under the proposed Bank loan.
I. Disbursements
4.29      The proposed Bank loan of US$40.5 million would be disbursed, net of
taxes, over six years as follows:
(a)  Equipment and spare parts         -   100% of foreign expenditures
(US$27.4 million)                     and 100% of local expenditures
ex-factory
(b)  Materials                         -   100% of foreign expenditures
(US$11.1 million)                     and 100% of local expenditures
ex-factory
(c) Unallocated
(US$2.0 million)
An estimated schedule of disbursements is at Annex 8. Disbursements under the
proposed Bank loan would be made against standard documentation.
J. Environment and Health
4.30      The project area is free of endemic diseases like malaria and
bilharzia. The project would neither adversely affect the environment nor
the public health. Construction of irrigation works, which consist of canals
with fluctuating supplies and piped distribution networks, would not promote
mosquito breeding or spread of malaria. Drainage of several depressions in
the southern part of the project area would promote healthier conditions
around such areas.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
The Borrower
5.01      The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) would be the
borrower under the guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Romania. BAFI has
the prime responsibility for the development of the agricultural sector. In
addition to functioning as the only source of credit for the agricultural
sector, it also acts as a fiscal agent to the Government in respect of channel-
ling State funds for investments and for collection of revenues due to the
State. Its other duties include financial control and supervision over proj-
ects that are financed either by the State or BAFI. BAFI already has adequate
legal, financial and administrative powers to discharge its responsibilities
effectively.
5.02      The chief executive officer of BAFI is its President, who is
appointed by a State Decree. He is assisted by a Senior Vice-President and
a Vice-President. BAFI's Board of Directors consists of the President, the
two Vice-Presidents, and representatives of various departments of this bank,
certain ministries, and of other related organizations. BAFI has six depart-
ments, of which three are operational and the other three deal with planning,
accounting and administration activities; it has 39 branches--one branch in
each district, and 92 sub-branches.
5.03      BAFI has a statutory capital of Lei 800 million (US$40 million) and
a reserve fund representing accumulations of net profits of Lei 800 million
<US$40 million). Its other sources of funds are the State budget, short-term
borrowings from the National Bank of Romania and deposits from socialist
organizations. BAFI would meet the project expenditures from a special
project account, which would receive funds from the annual State budgets and
through disbursements from the proposed Bank loan. Because of its strict
policies and procedures governing recoveries of loans from its borrowers and
their deposit accounts, and rigid control and inspection of operations at the
project level and disbursements, there are no reported losses due to bad debts.
BAFI's net worth was Lei 1,600 million on December 31, 1976. BAFI is, and is
expected to continue to remain in good financial condition.
Implementing Agencies
5.04      The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA).  The overall
responsibility for planning, construction, operation and maintenance of all
project works, except works relating to power supply, and river training in
the Calmatui Valley, would rest with MAIA. The responsiblity for the former
would rest with the Ministry of Electrical Energy, and for the latter would
be with NWC. The general organization of MAIA is illustrated in Chart 16194,
and its departments responsible for project implementation are described
below. Project procurement would be arranged by Romagrimex, which is a State
enterprise responsible for import and export under MAIA.



- 20 -
5.05      Department of Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction (DIFCA).
The responsibility for planning, design and construction of project works would
rest with DIFCA, which is headed by a Deputy Minister and is organized in four
directorates of (i) Construction and Local Development; (ii) Technical, Invest-
ment and Cooperation; (iii) Planning and Finance; and (iv) Supply. The plan-
ning and design of the project works are being carried out by ISPIF, which is
under the Technical, Investment and Cooperation directorate. Project construc-
tion would be undertaken by the regional branch of the Construction Trust for
Land Reclamation Works (TCIF), which is under the Construction and Local Devel-
opment directorate. Project construction would be supervised by the Group for
Supervising of Investment (GSI), which is also under the Technical, Investment
and Cooperation directorate. All the above units of DIFCA are adequately
staffed and, after having successfully completed similar irrigation projects
serving 1.9 million ha, have the required experience to carry out the project
works satisfactorily.
5.06      National Water Council.  NWC, which is headed by a Minister, has
the overall responsibility in the country for (a) planning water projects;
(b) design of flood control and river training works and their construction;
(c) design of dams primarily for water development, and their construction;
(d) water management; and (e) pollution control. NWC has a specialized con-
struction trust, which undertakes all construction jobs for the Council. Of
the project works, NWC would have the responsibility for design and construc-
tion of the river training works in the Calmatui Valley.  It would also be
responsible for raising the Cringeni Dam. Organization of NWC is illustrated
in Chart 17855.
B. Operation and Maintenance
5.07      The irrigation and drainage works, to be constructed under the proj-
ect, would be operated and maintained under the direction of the Central for
Exploitation of Land Reclamation Works (CELIF) which is headed by a Deputy
Minister of MAIA and has the responsibility for operation and maintenance of
all completed irrigation projects. CELIF has 17 operational units, called
enterprises or IELIFs, which are based in districts. Each IELIF has several
sub-units, known as Systems; each System maintains about 20,000 ha to 25,000
ha of irrigated land. Typical organization of an IELIF is shown in Chart
16192.
5.08      The project's irrigation and drainage works would be operated and
maintained by the Teleorman IELIF, which is already satisfactorily maintaining
(a) the existing Zimnicea Terrace irrigation scheme (6,530 ha); (b) the fully
automated Olt-Calmatui irrigation project (47,000 ha) west of the project
area; and (c) a part (54,000 ha) of the Bank-financed Giurgiu-Razmiresti irri-
gation project east of the project area, of which about one-half area was com-
missioned in May 1977 and the rest would be commissioned in May 1978.  Two new
Systems would be established under the Teleorman IELIF to operate and maintain
the works under the project; their headquarters would be at Alexandria and
Zimnicea. The new Systems would be adequately staffed by technicians and
supervisors who have either worked in other tnits before or have been trained



- 21 -
for this purpose. Equipment for operation and maintenance (Annex 7, Table 2)
to be furnished by the project, would be handed over to the Teleorman IELIF.
5.09      The power supply works would be maintained by the Ministry of Energy.
The on-farm portable equipment would be maintained by the farm entities, and
the farm machinery would be maintained either by the AMEs or the IASs.
5.10      The annual operation and maintenance cost of the project works is
estimated at Lei 157.0 million (US$7.85 million). Details are given in Annex
6, Table 3. Annual consumption of electric energy, in an average year, is
estimated at 180 million kwh which, at Lei 0.33 per kwh, would cost about
Lei 59.4 million (US$2.97) million. The country's generating stations and
the national grid have the capacity to supply the above requirement of elec-
tric energy for the project. After 1990, whenever the northern part of the
project area receives water from the new Olt-Vedea Canal, the annual power
requirement for the project would reduce by 27 million kwh (15%).
C. Supporting Agricultural Services
5.11      MAIA has a General Directorate of Agriculture in each district;
agriculture in the project area would therefore be supervised by the Teleorman
Directorate based at Alexandria., This General Directorate plans and super-
vises agricultural programs including input supplies in cooperation with CAPs
and IASs. Extension effort is furnished by this Directorate through its
specialist staff who advise the resident specialists at each farm whenever
required. This Directorate also serves as the main center to provide train-
ing to the technical staff of the farm entities in the Teleorman district.
Adequate arrangements exist for distribution of seed and fertilizers. The
existing AME and SAMs in the project area, as well as the mechanization
units of the IASs, are well organized and equipped with maintenance work-
shops. These would be able to maintain the farm machinery furnished under
the project adequately.
D. Recovery of Project Costs
5.12      All investments in the project, except for on-farm buried distribu-
tion pipelines and portable irrigation equipment which would specifically serve
CAP lands, would be financed from the State budget and the proposed loan. The
cost of these (excepted) facilities, excluding price contingencies, is esti-
mated at about Lei 600 million (US$30 million). About 70% of this cost would
be financed through BAFI loans to CAPs and the remaining 30% through contribu-
tions of the CAPs. The BAFI loans would be recovered in accordance with the
terms of these loans, which have been reviewed in connection with the previous
Bank-financed projects and are satisfactory (para 3.20). Of the remaining
investments, cost of farm machinery would be recovered fully through unit
rates charged by AMEs for mechanization services. Cost of all other items,
estimated at about Lei 2,010 million (US$100.5 million), also excluding price



- 22 -
contingencies, together with the annual operation and maintenance cost of Lei
157 million (US$7.8 million) would be recovered through direct and various
indirect mechanisms.
5.13      According to the existing procedures in Romania, the only direct
cost recovery is through a nominal water charge, which depends on (a) type of
crop; (b) volume of water used; and (c) type of farm organization (CAP or IAS)
and method of irrigation (sprinkler or furrow). This charge amounts to about
Lei 350 (US$17.50) per ha. Prior to 1976, there was no levy for type of farm
organization and method of irrigation, and the total water charge approximated
Lei 220 (US$11.00) per ha. With the new rates, the total water charge would
amount to Lei 39.3 million (US$1.97 million) per year; this would recover
about 25% of the annual operation and maintenance cost, and would result in
a Cost Recovery Index of about 10%. Details are in Annex 9.
5.14      Government would also recover project costs indirectly through (a)
IASs' contribution to a Depreciation Fund kept by BAFI (Annex 2); (b) annual
profits made by IASs on their operations, a part of which is credited to the
State Treasury (Annex 2); (c) net returns to the State from investment of
CAPs' Development Fund; (d) profits made by the State by buying tradeable
commodities at low administered domestic prices and exporting them at much
higher world prices; and (e) general linkage benefits to the economy as a
result of the increased and stable output from the project. Although it is
difficult to quantify these indirect recoveries accurately, it is expected
that these would enable recovery of all of the remaining project investments
financed by the State within a few years.
5.15      Because of the socio-economic system in Romania, water charges have
little or no direct resource allocative or income distributive effect. The
volume and timing of irrigation water application is controlled by a Govern-
nient agency (IELIF) in accordance with the recommendations of concerned re-
search institutes; price of water does not influence use of irrigation water.
Also, as the project would have little or no direct influence on income of
farm workers (para 6.08), the low water charge would not mean a corresponding
high income to the workers. Furthermore, the price of water can be expected
to change with the general revision of prices of agricultural inputs and out-
puts, although the latter have not changed in the last decade. Because of
these reasons, any increase in water charges is neither essential nor recom-
mended.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.16      The existing accounting and auditing procedures in Romania are quite
strict and satisfactory. BAFI's accounts are subject to a continuous audit by
independent internal inspectors, and an annual audit by inspectors from the
Ministry of Finance and the Court of Superior Control. The Court, which
reports directli to the President of the country conducts an independent audit
of BAFI's accounts and of results of audits by inspectors from the Ministry of
Finance. Details are in Annex 10.

5.17      BAFI will keep separate accounts for all project expenditures in-
cluding those related to goods and services financed out of the proceeds of
the proposed Bank loan. These accounts will be audited according to the
existing procedures. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that a
report on project accounts, audited by the Ministry of Finance, would be sub-
mitted to the Bank annually within five months of the close of the Romanian
fiscal year.
F. Monitoring
5.18      In order to measure project implementation against the proposed
schedule and project performance, following completion of construction,
against project benefits foreseen during appraisal, BAFI would submit neces-
sary information through periodic reports to the Bank. This would include
data on progress of construction of all physical facilities under various
project components, progress in the procurement of equipment and materials
and data on project expenditures. Information on area brought under irriga-
tion, cropping pattern followed, crop yield and output, and relevant data
on operation and maintenance cost of irrigation and drainage works would be
submitted annually. During negotiations, details of the format in which the
above-stated information would be furnished to the Bank was agreed.
5.19      During negotiations, it was also agreed that promptly after comple-
tion of the project, but not later than May 31, 1985, BAFI would prepare and
furnish to the Bank a report on the execution and initial operation of the
project, its cost, the benefits derived and to be derived from it, the per-
formance of the Bank and BAFI of their respective obligations under the pro-
posed loan agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes of the proposed
loan.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production
6.01      Without the project, the cropping pattern would remain the same, but
yields would increase by about 10% due to continuing improvements in rainfed
technology. With the project, the cropping pattern would be modified in pur-
suance of Government policy to intensify production of livestock oriented and
industrial crops on irrigated lands. The major changes in the cropping pat-
tern would be (a) to reduce the wheat area by about 50% and increase grain
maize by about 40%; (b) to grow maize (silage) as a double crop after wheat
on 14,230 ha (13%); and (c) to slightly more than double the area of sugar
beet and soybean. The average yields with the project would increase over
the first four years of introduction of irrigation; the yield of maize would
be 110% higher compared to the without project situation. Similarly, the
yield of alfalfa would increase by 96%, sugar beet and soybean by 79%, sun-
flower by 50%, and wheat by 48%. The expected increases are based on actual



- 24 -
achievements over large irrigated areas, both within and outside the project
area, and would mainly result from the strict control of production inputs
under the supervision of well trained technical staff which would ensure (a)
adequate and timely irrigation; (b) effective drainage; (c) increased input
of fertilizer; and (d) adequate and timely use of machinery.
6.02      At full development in 1986, the gross value of agricultural pro-
duction, including byproducts, valued at the domestic farmgate prices, would
increase by 115% from about Lei 500 million (US$25.0 million) to about Lei
1,070.0 million (US$53.5 million). Present and future without, and future
with project cropped area and production are summarized in the table below,

B. Markets
6.03      The additional project output would be:  maize 269,500 tons, alfalfa
(hay) 77,900 tons, soybean 14,900 tons, sugar beet 233,800 tons, grapes 7,300



- 25 -
tons, vegetables 35,900 tons, pasture 32,500 tons, and maize (silage) 470,100
tons; output of other crops would decline or remain unchanged. As discussed
below and in Annex 3, no serious marketing problems are foreseen for the proj-
ect's incremental production.
6.04      About 20% of the additional output of maize and other fodders
could be utilized by the expected increase in the livestock population with-
in the project area; the remaining 80% is likely to be used to feed a rapidly
growing livestock population in other parts of the country. Domestic use of
these commodities as livestock feed would help to earn foreign exchange, in-
directly, through export of livestock and livestock products. Since 1965,
for example, Romania has succeeded in increasing export of cattle to convert-
ible currency countries by about 300%. Italy, Federal Republic of Germany and
United Kingdom accounted for about 90% of the export of about 140,000 head of
cattle and about 40,000 tons of meat. Recently exports of beef and lamb to
Middle East countries have increased substantially.
6.05      The domestic market outlook for sugar, vegetables and fruits is
also favorable. The per capita consumption of these commodities is low com-
pared to, for example, Yugoslavia, which has about the same level of per
capita income. The incremental output of such commodities from this and from
all other Bank-financed irrigation projects in Romania could satisfy no more
than 30% of additional output which would be required to raise the domestic
per capita consumption of these commodities to the same levels as those in
Yugoslavia.
6.06      The incremental output of oil cake (soybean) would help to reduce
import of this commodity, of which Romania is a net importer. A part of the
other project commodities may be exported. Romania is a net exporter of
nearly all of the tradeable project commodities, particularly maize, vege-
tables, fruits and grapes. Annual export of maize averages nearly 400,000
tons. About 70% is exported to France, United Kingdom, Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy and Austria; the remaining 30% is exported to USSR and East
European markets. From mid-1960 to early 1970, annual volume of exports of
fresh and canned vegetables increased from 170,000 tons to 350,000 tons.
Main outlets included Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Republic and USSR.
Details about markets are in Annex 3.
C. Prices
6.07      Because of the nature of economic management in Romania, market
forces have little or no influence in determining domestic prices.  Domestic
prices are fixed by Government and rarely vary in response to changes in
demand and supply. The present official domestic prices of project inputs and
outputs, which are considerably lower than prices of comparable commodities
elsewhere, have not changed significantly since the mid 1960's, and the proj-
ect's output is not expected to alter them. For these reasons, two sets of
prices have been used to evaluate project benefits--the official domestic
prices for both inputs and outputs in the financial analysis of farm budgets;
and prices derived from the Bank's forecast of world prices for 1977-85 for



- 26 -
tradeable commodities and the official domestic prices for the non-tradeables
in the economic analysis. These prices are given in Annex 3, Table 1.
D. Producer Income
6.08      Farm budgets have been prepared for two cooperative farms (CAP I,
area 1,520 ha, and CAP II, area 2,200 ha). These indicate that the net farm
incomes on account of the project would increase respectively by 245% and
165%. Details are given in Annex 9.
6.09      These farm budgets are quite typical and indicate the magnitude by
which farm incomes, both in CAPs as well as in IASs, would increase over the
project area. Inspite of such increases, the project would have little direct
effect on increasing the salaries of employees in the IASs or the remunera-
tions to active members of CAPs. All workers in the IASs are employees of
the State and are paid according to national wage scales. The current normal
wage for unskilled farm worker on an IAS amounts to about Lei 1,200 (US$60)
per month. Similarly, each active member of the CAPs is presently entitled
to receive a minimum remuneration of Lei 1,000 (US$50) per month, which the
member supplements with income from his individual plot. This remuneration
is paid only if planned production is achieved. The remuneration to employees
of the IASs and active members of the CAPs is unlikely to change in future
with the project unless Government revises its national wage scales, because
the Romanian socio-political system does not permit a significant income
disparity among labor of comparable quality throughout the economy. This
would not affect farm worker's incentives to participate in the project,
however, because failure to work according to the yardstick established by
Government would, by law, result in (a) forfeiture or reduction of remunera-
tion; and (b) loss of right to individual plot. The farm workers who are
unwilling to work under these penalties would have limited employment oppor-
tunities elsewhere as the labor market is under Government control. Bonuses
are paid only if production exceeds planned targets and these serve as posi-
tive incentives. In the long-run, the project would help to increase the
income of the farm workers in the project area indirectly through the proj-
ect's impact on the growth and development of the economy and general increase
in incomes. In fact, these indirect project benefits would also flow to other
workers within and outside the agricultural sector, as in the past, when real
wages would increase with the national income.
E. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.10      Main Benefits.  The main quantifiable benefits of the project are
(a) about 115% increase in the gross value of crops produced in the project
area; and (b) prevention of flood damages over an area of about 2,030 ha.
Most of the project output would, directly or indirectly, help to earn or
save foreign exchange. The project would also have unquantifiable linkage
benefits through its effects on increased and stable supply of raw materials
to forward-linked enterprises, and would about double labor productivity from



- 27 -
Lei 12,870 (US$644) to Lei 27,660 (US$1,383).  Project cost would be equiva-
lent to about Lei 26,600 (US$1,330) per ha or about Lei 79,300 (US$3,965)
per farm worker.
6.11      Beneficiaries.  The project would have little direct effect on
incomes of the 35,600 active members of CAPs or the 3,100 employees of IASs
(para 6.08). The primary beneficiary would be the State, but the project
would help indirectly to raise real wages and standard of living of the
population through its impact on growth of the economy.
F. Economic Rate of Return
6.12      The economic rate of return on the investments in the project, based
on quantifiable benefits, is estimated at about 14%. The rate of return on the
irrigation and river training works is estimated at 14% and 11% respectively.
Extension of irrigation to the Calmatui Valley area would yield about the same
rate of return as for the whole project, but the rate of return on investments
in improvement of drainage and in supply of supplementary irrigation to the
existing Zimnicea irrigation scheme would amount to about 30%. Details are in
Annex 11.
6.13      The risk of not attaining project objectives is low.  Design of the
project has been prepared in detail by ISPIF, which has successfully designed
many other schemes, including about 1.9 million ha which are presently under
irrigation. The project would be constructed by the construction trusts of
DIFCA and NWC, which have succesfully constructed other similar projects in
Romania. Project cost has been estimated on administered domestic prices
which are not expected to change significantly during the period of project
implementation. Government also has satisfactory plans to supply the farmers
with the necessary complementary inputs and agricultural services.
6.14      The projected yields and their development are based on experiences
from similar irrigation schemes in the southern region of Romania, and are
reasonable. However, even if the time of yield development, from any given
area, extends from 4 to 6 years, the economic rate of return on the project
would be about 12%. Reducing the projected yield of maize (the main crop)
by 20%, or lowering prices of all tradeable outputs by 20% would result in a
rate of return of 11%. Therefore, even under pessimistic assumptions about
the projected benefits, the economic rate of return on investments in the
project would remain satisfactory.
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following:
(a) plans providing for an increase in the storage capacity of the
Cringeni Dam adequate to assure the full water requirements of



- 28 -
2,930 ha gross (2,890 ha net) would have been formally approved
by the Council of Ministers by December 31, 1980; and the stor-
age capacity of the Cringeni Dam would have been increased by
December 31, 1982, in order that sufficient water would be avail-
able to adequately irrigate the above area in the Calmatui Valley
(para 4.10);
(b) procurement of equipment and materials, listed in Annex 7, Table 1,
and estimated to cost US$40.5 million would be arranged following
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines (para 4.28);
(c) a report on project accounts, audited by the Ministry of Finance
would be submitted to the Bank annually within five months of the
close of the Romanian fiscal year (para 5.17);
(d) necessary data and information would be furnished to the Bank,
through periodic reports, to measure project implementation and
performance against scheduled targets (para 5.18); and
(e) promptly after project completion, but not later than May 31, 1985,
BAFI would prepare and furnish to the Bank a project completion
report (para 5.19).
7.02      With the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$40.5 million to the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry,
with the guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Romania for a term of 15 years
including 3 years of grace.

ROMANIA
VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agriculture
1.        General.  Romania has a total area of 23.7 million ha, of which about
14.9 million ha (63%) constitutes agricultural land, 6.3 million ha (27%) is
under forests and the remaining 2.5 million ha (10%) is non-arable.  Of 14.9
million ha agricultural land, about 9.7 million ha (65%) is arable, and under
cultivation, 4.5 million ha (30%) is under pastures and meadows and 0.8 mil-
lion ha (5%) is covered by orchards and vineyards. A total of about 5.3 mil-
lion ha is irrigable, of which about 1.5 million ha was irrigated by the end
of 1975. During the 1976-1980 plan period, another 1.1 million ha is to be
provided with irrigation facilities. Currently about 1.9 million ha is under
irrigation. By the 1981 cropping season, a total of about 2.6 million ha is
expected to be irrigated; at that time the increase in the irrigated area,
since 1970, would amount to about 300%.
2.        Much of the country, especially in the plains of south and west, has
good soils and exploitable water resources.* In the plains, temperatures, are
suitable for a cropping season from April to October, but fluctuations in
rainfall, which often result in periods of either inadequate soil moisture or
excessive rainfall can limit production. Soil erosion, caused by wind and
water also affects production in some areas with steep ground slopes. Major
crops are maize (34%), other grains (30%), fodder (15%), potatoes and vege-
tables (5%), sunflower (5%), sugar beet (3%), and soybean and other pulses
(2%). In 1977, Romania had 6.3 million cattle, 10.2 million pigs, 14.3 mil-
lion sheep and goats and 91.5 million poultry.
3.        Project Area, Topography and Drainage.  The project area is located
in Teleorman district; its headquarters Alexandria lies on the project's
eastern boundary, about 100 km west of Bucharest (Map IBRD 13020). The proj-
ect area includes a gross surface of 115,340 ha between the Vedea River in
the east and the Calmatui River in the west. The Danube River, which would
provide water for irrigating most of the project area, lies at the southern
boundary. The project area includes two types of relief - the Danube Flood
Plain, and the terraces that lie about 5 m to 75 m above the Plain. The
former constitutes the old flood plain of the Danube River, which is now pro-
tected from the River by a flood dike, and contains about 14,430 ha. The
Suhaia Lake, which has been created by blocking off the outflow of the
Calmatui River into the Danube, is an important feature of the Flood Plain.
Presently this Lake is used for irrigating the Rice Area (2,140 ha) and for
fish culture. There are six distinct terraces, of which the largest and the
highest is the Viisoara Terrace (80,000 ha), in the north, at an elevation
of 60 m to 75 m above the Flood Plain and the lowest is the Zimnicea Terrace
(6,530 ha) in the south at a height of 5 m to 15 m above the Plain. Other
terraces lie between these two. Three streams intersect the project area:



ANNEX 1
Page 2
the Urlui (a tributary of the Calmatui River); and the Izvoarele and the
Nanov Rivers, both of which flow into the Vedea River. Numerous small dams
on these rivers create lakes for development of fisheries. Most of the area
north of the Izvoarele has gentle slopes and is well drained by the natural
streams belonging to the Urlui and the Vedea systems, but about 18,700 ha
lying to the south abounds in closed depressions which have no access to
natural drainage.
4.        Climate.  The climate in the project region is basically continental
with warm summers and cold winters.  The main veather station is located at
Alexandria; two other nearby stations are at Turnu Magurele and Rosiorii-de-
Vede, both of which are outside the project area. Long-term data recorded
at these stations is available; data at the Alexandria station is presented
in Table 1. Average monthly maximum temperatures vary in the cropping season
(April to October) from 180C in April to 300C in July and August, and average
minimum from 50C in April to 160C in July and August. First frost occurs
around end October. Annual precipitation averages about 550 mm at Alexandria,
of which about 350 mm (63%) occurs during the cropping season. It is fairly
evenly distributed during the year although the monthly average distribution
cover indicates relatively higher values in May-July and lower values in
February and March. The annual rainfall can be as low as 310 mm, and as high
as 772 mm. Drought periods often last longer than 10 days, and a 72-day long
period was recorded in July-September 1945. The average pan evaporation totals
895 mm per year. Relative humidity varies from a low of 58% in July and
August to 71% in October. Wind velocity averages 2.1 m/sec in the cropping
season.
5.        Soils.  Detailed soil surveys, including chemical and mechanical
analyses, have been carried out by specialized institutes in Romania and a
detailed soils map of the project area is available. Most soils consist of
chernozems of high agricultural value, which have developed on loess deposits.
The southern part of the high terrace and the lower terraces are covered by
chestnut and chocolate chernozem soils. The central and northern parts of the
high terrace consists of moderate to strongly leached chernozems and some
transitional areas to Brown Forest soils. The chernozem soils are sandy loams
and clayey loams. They are deep uniform soils, contain calcium carbonate in
the lower profile and high organic matter in the upper profile. These soils
are fertile, although nitrogen and in most cases phosphorus will have to be
applied for-high sustained yields. Soils in the central and northern parts
of the project area contain a higher clay content. Both the eastern part
of the Danube Flood Plain and the Vedea valley consist of slightly humic to
humic, deep, uniform alluvial soils of light texture. Within this area,
especially in the Flood Plain where water table is high, some soils have a
conspicuously gleyed profile. About 4,700 ha in the Flood Plain consists of
slight to moderately saline soils; this phenomena has become more prominent
after construction of flood protection dikes along the Danube River and the
creation of the Suhaia Lake. Depth of groundwater in the project area varies
from 1 m to 3 m below the surface in the Flood Plain, and 10 m to 20 m on the



ANNEX 1
Page 3
terraces. About 10,800 ha contain eroded soils; these are located on the
steep sides of valleys and slopes of various terraces.
6.        Land Classification.  According to the USBR terminology, about 22%
of the project area is classified as belonging to Class I; 64% to Class II;
11% to Class III, mostly on account of its eroded nature and salt accumula-
tion; and 3% to Class V, mostly having ground slopes larger than 10% and thus
being unsuitable for irrigation.
7.        Present Land Use and Yields.  The area presently available for cul-
tivation is 114,100 ha, of which about 12,170 ha is irrigated and the remaining
is rainfed. Of the irrigated area, 3,140 ha is in the Danube Flood Plain,
6,530 ha in the Zimnicea Terrace and the remaining 2,500 ha is scattered
throughout the project area in isolated blocks that measure 40 ha to 540 ha.
The two largest blocks - the Zimnicea Terrace, and 2,140 ha in the Danube
Flood Plain receive water respectively from the Danube River and the Suhaia
Lake; the rest are irrigated by local sources - either groundwater or small
storages on the rivers in the project area.
8.        Grain maize is grown on 32% of the cultivated area, while autumn -
sown cereals (principally wheat) occupy 30%. Industrial crops cover about 13%;
these are sunflower (8%), soybean (3%) and sugar beet (2%). Alfalfa, vetch,
pastures and maize (silage) account for another 17% of the cultivated area.
The remaining 8% is occupied by vineyards and orchards (4%), vegetables (3%)
and rice (1%). Inspite of an advanced standard of husbandry, present average
yields are low (maize 3.6 tons/ha, wheat 2.5 tons/ha) due to fluctuations in
rainfall and a consequential low use of fertilizers. Yields are somewhat
higher in the Danube Flood Plain because of better soil moisture conditions.
In the irrigated areas present average yields of maize and alfalfa (hay)
amount to 5.1 tons/ha and 8.0 tons/ha. The area under various crops, their
present average yields and production are summarized in Table 2.
9.        Future Land Use and Yields.  Without the project, the present crop-
ping pattern is not expected to change, but the yields would improve by about
10% primarily due to technological advances normally expected in a country
like Romania, where agricultural research is emphasized.
10.       After project implementation, the cultivable area would reduce by
330 ha to 113,770 ha due to the land occupied by project works. The cropping
pattern would also change in pursuance of Government's policy to intensify
production of livestock oriented and industrial crops. Changes would consist
of a reduction of area under wheat (16%), sunflower (3%), vetch (2%) and
forage maize (2%), and an increase of area under grain maize (13%), soybean
(4%), alfalfa (3%) and sugar beet (3%). Another major change would be a 13%
increase in the intensity of cultivation; almost all double crop cultivation
would be for silage maize.
11.       Crop yields would increase significantly following project comple-
tion because of: (a) timely and assured water availability; (b) higher levels
of and more precise use of fertilizers; (c) better prediction and timely action



ANNEX 1
Page 4
for the use of pesticides and herbicides; (d) improved surface and sub-surface
drainage; (e) application of soil erosion control measures; and (f) additional
availability of farm machinery. Yields of major crops, compared with the
future without project situation, would increase as follows: maize by 110%;
alfalfa by 100%; sugar beet and soybean by 80%, sunflower and wheat by 50%.
The yields are expected to increase in four years following introduction of
irrigation, by 30%, 70%, 90% and 100%. Crop yields would increase on areas
irrigated previously in two years by increments of 50% and 50%. The adopted
crop yields, although lower than those obtained on research and demonstration
farms, have been actually achieved under project conditions in other irrigated
areas of the region. Maize yield, for example, at the research and demonstra-
tion farms has averaged 12.0 tons/ha against 8.0 tons/ha assumed for the proj-
ect.
Farm Inputs
12.       Labor and Mechanization.  Land preparation is completely mechanized,
while seeding, fertilizing, spraying and harvesting operations are mechanized
to a considerable degree on the State farms and to a somewhat lesser degree on
the cooperative farms. The degree of mechanization also varies with the crop.
For example, harvesting of maize, wheat, oilseeds and fodder is almost fully
mechanized on IASs, while harvesting of maize and fodder is mechanized to a
lesser extent on the CAPs. Harvesting of sugar beet is mostly by labor.
Manual labor is used for weeding and harvesting of vegetables, and is occa-
sionally employed for weeding of field crops and spraying of pesticides. It
is also used extensively for various operations in the orchards and vineyards.
Because of underemployment of the present labor force and increasing mechan-
ization, labor requirements for the project can be met from local sources.
13.       Mechanization services are provided to the CAPs by the Central for
Agricultural Mechanization, which is under MAIA (Chart 16194). This Central
has an Agricultural Mechanization Enterprise (AME) in each of the 39 districts;
each AME has 16 to 19 Stations for Agricultural Machinery (SAMs). A SAM
serves 6 to 8 CAPs and performs all field operations on a contract basis at
rates that are fixed by regions. The project area CAPs would be served by
9 SAMs - all are under the Teleorman AME. Each of these SAMs is well equipped
with large (65 hp) and small (45 hp) tractors, harvester combines, seeders,
balers and other essential implements, although some of the tractors have com-
pleted their useful life, and need replacement. The central workshop of the
AME, as well as the SAM repair shops are adequately furnished with tools, re-
pair equipment and qualified mechanics. Several mobile workshops are also
attached to these stations, which service and carry out minor repairs to farm
machinery in the field. Farm machinery and implements required by the State
farms are owned, operated and maintained by them. Each of the 5 IASs in the
project area has a separate section within its organization which manages all
of its equipment. These sections are also well equipped with all necessary
machinery, implements, repair facilities and qualified staff for the proper
upkeep of farm machinery and equipment.

14.       The project would furnish 1,330 new 65-hp tractors.  About 1,000
worn out tractors would be replaced during the next 5 years at the rate of
about 15% of the available number of about 1,350; the rest would be added to
enable more timely preparation of project land and to intensify agricultural
operations following project completion. A number of cultivators, seeders and
harvesters, and trucks and trailers for transportation would also be provided
under the project to meet the additional needs imposed by the project. The
farm machinery to be furnished under the project is listed at Annex 7, Tables
1 and 2.
15.        Seeds.  Improved seeds for all project crops are available in Romania
in the required quantities, and would be used in the project area. Seed devel-
opment and multiplication is a continuous process. Production of elite seed
is entrusted to the research stations and to the selected State and coopera-
tive farms under a State organization (SEMROM). Processing of seeds is also a
responsibility of SEMROM. Testing and certification of seeds is done by spe-
cial organizations under the Ministry. Seed distribution is arranged by
another State organization AGROSEM. Romanian seeds of maize and sunflower are
considered of high quality and are exported to several countries.
16.       Fertilizers.  In spite of a rapid increase in manufacturing capacity
of fertilizers and an output now approaching 5 million tons 1/ per annum, the
application of fertilizers on unirrigated land is not optimum because of em-
phasis on export. The allocation of fertilizers to State farms and coopera-
tives, based on a formula which takes into account soils, climatic conditions
and cropping patterns, is reviewed each year by the Ministries of Agriculture
and Chemical Industries. First priority is given to the irrigated areas and
the State farms; the rainfed areas on the CAPs received a lower priority. Fol-
lowing introduction of irrigation, the project area would receive priority in
the allocation of fertilizers which would be increased to the levels recom-
mended by research and the results from a soil fertility laboratory to be
established in Alexandria next year. It is estimated that at full development,
requirements of ammonium nitrate, superphosphate and potash would increase by
approximately 2.4 times from about 31,000 tons to 75,000 tons.
17.       Plant Protection.  Romania's production of phytopharmaceutical
products has increased from about 8,000 tons to about 25,000 tons during the
last decade.  It iuclude6 a wide range of iusecticides, fungicides,  *  -
and pre-emergence weed killers. The current use of these chemicals seems
satisfactory but detailed quantitative data are not available. It can be
assumed that because of past performance in similar projects, the centrally
planned Romanian system will be able to supply the necessary input of phyto
pharmaceutical products for the project. Plant protection efforts are super-
vised in each district by an inspectorate under the General Directorate of
Agriculture. This unit has 5 centers in Teleorman district staffed with 12
specialists and provides back up to the resident staff at the CAPs and the
1/   A Urea plant is located at Turnu Magurele near the project area's south-
western boundary.

IASs. The resident staff can also call upon a central aircraft spraying unit
for the application of plant protection chemicals to crops.
Agricultural Research and Extension
18.       Agricultural Research.  The Academy of Agriculture and Forestry
Sciences coordinates all agricultural research in Romania, which is carried
out in 13 institutes, 6 central stations and 41 research stations. These
facilities, which are well distributed throughout the countries ecology zones
are staffed by 1,600 scientists and cover 80,000 ha. the Teleorman Research
station is located about 15 km east of Alexandria just outside the project
boundary but on similar soils and under similar climate to the Viisoara proj-
ect area. A small substation is located in Alexandria. The Teleorman station
is staffed by 10 specialists, three of whom are occupied in seed development,
producing 6,000 tons of elite seed. Research on irrigation rates and tech-
niques has commenced on about 30 ha and a unit to determine water consumption
of various crops has been established since 1975. Post graduate training of
staff is encouraged on a rotational system. A veterinary clinic, engaged in
both research and extension, is located in Alexandria and staffed by nine pro-
fessionals.
19.       Agricultural Extension.  Extension service are provided by the
General Directorate of Agriculture in each district. The Directorate of
Teleorman has 25 graduate specialists in crop and livestock production who
advise 28 agronomists and 12 animal specialists located in LASs and 97 agro-
nomists and 37 animal specialists located on CAPs. They also receive support
from a seed production group with five professionals, a land reclamation group
with five agriculturalists and 20 engineers and a survey group. The inter-
cooperative council has a professional staff of an agronomist, livestock spe-
cialist and an economist to provide close supervision of specialists located
on CAPs, thus maintaining a high professional standard and assuring that re-
search results are evaluated and applied rapidly in the field. Each council
serves about four CAPs.
Livestock
20.       In the project area, there are 45,600 cattle, of which dairy cows and
heifers number 15,700; 42,700 pigs; 98,000 sheep and 140,000 poultry.  Much of
the livestock is in the State farms and the cooperative farms; each of these
farms has at least one animal fattening or dairy unit.  An appreciable number
is kept by the individual CAP members, who feed the livestock from the crop
refuse of their own individual plots. By 1990, the number of pigs in the proj-
ect area is likely to increase by 150%, and dairy cows by 50%; sheep and poul-
try numbers will remain relatively stable. The increased number of livestock
would consume about 20% of the incremental fodder production under the project.
Each village has a health center for animals belonging to CAPs and individuals,
whereas each IAS has separate health facilities for its own livestock.

VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agricultural Production Organizations and Investment Financing
A. Background
1.        In pre-World War II Romania, a large portion of the agricultural
land was owned by landlords and the church, but was cultivated by tenants.
There were also a number of peasants who owned and cultivated their small
farms. In 1921, an attempt was made to limit ownership to a maximum of 300
ha per family, but the pattern of land ownership and production remained
virtually unchanged until 1945.
2.        The transformation of agricultural land ownership and production
from pre-war Romania to the present was achieved in three phases during 1945-
1962. The first phase (1945-1948) of agricultural reform aimed at establish-
ing a small-scale peasant-oriented farm structure. About 1.6 million ha be-
longing to landlords and the church were expropriated; 70% were distributed
among about 0.9 million agricultural workers and small farmers and the re-
maining, combined with existing government owned land, was used to establish
the initial State Agricultural Enterprises (lASs).  At the same time, medium
and large farms were discouraged through the selective use of quotas and
prices.
3.        The second phase (1949-1958) involved a move towards large-scale
farming through collectivization of small farms and expansion of state enter-
prises. The farmers were strongly encouraged through pricing mechanism to
join the collectives, but this was not very successful as the farmers did not
want to lose title to land and were not accustomed to organized group pro-
duction. Consequently, Agricultural Associations were formed in early 1950s,
in which participating farmers pooled their lands without losing titles and
were paid according to their contribution to production. Despite these ef-
forts, about 30% of the agricultural or 45% of the arable lands were still
operated individually in 1958.
4.        The final drive into collectivization was completed during 1959-1962
through determined Government efforts. During this phase, private farms and
Agricultural Associations were merged into what are presently known as Agri-
cultural Production Cooperatives (CAPs).
5.        Since 1962, the structure of agricultural farms has been further
consolidated by reducing the number of farming enteprises. Presently there
are about 4,400 CAPs in Romania, which consist of about 9.0 million ha (60%)
of agricultural land. About 3.4 million families constitute the membership
of these cooperatives. The CAP farms produce about 67% of all cereals, 80%



ANNEX 2
Page 2
of oilseeds, 40% of potatoes and vegetables and almost all of the sugar beet.
The project area contains 42 CAPs with a total area of 91,800 ha (80% of
total) and an active membership of about 35,600.
6.        The present number of IASs in Romania is 392; these contain about
2.1 million ha (14%) of agricultural land. These have a total of about
252,000 employees, and produce about 19% of all cereals, 19% of oilseeds, and
5% of potatoes and vegetables. There are 5 IASs in the project area, which
have an area of 23,540 ha (20% of total) and employ about 3,100 permanent and
seasonal workers.
7.        About 1.5 million ha (10%) of agricultural land is presently cul-
tivated by about 150,000 individual farming families. Most of this area is
located in the mountainous region and is of marginal quality. These farms
produce about 19% of the total milk production, 19% of eggs, 14% of meat and
15% potatoes. There are no private farms in the project area.
8.        Members of CAPs are allowed to retain small plots of cooperative
land, usually not exceeding 0.15 ha per member or 0.3 ha per family, for their
personal use. Production on such plots is intensive with higher yields than
national averages obtained from rainfed areas. In the project area, such
plots total to about 8,000 ha, all of these plots are under rainfed cultiva-
tion. All of the individual plots would be irrigated under the project, but
boundaries would be realigned to optimize layout of the irrigation network.
Members of the CAPs have been consulted about realignment of boundaries and
they have agreed to the proposed works.
9.        Agricultural production organizations are still evolving.  As eco-
nomic activities in agriculture become more complex, the size and nature of
operations change and resource needs increase. Some CAPs have already started
forming Intercooperative Associations in an effort to pool resources for in-
vestments in processing, dairy and beef fattening units. Joint ventures among
CAPs, Intercooperatives and IASs are also on the increase. Such jointly owned
and operated agri-businesses are likely to be increasingly important sources
of output with the growth and development of agriculture.
B. Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Organization
10.       The land and assets of a CAP are owned jointly by its members.  The
management of a CAP is the responsibility of its President, one or two Vice
Presidents, a Management Council and the General Assembly. The governing body
of a CAP is its General Assembly, which consists of all working adults in the
CAP. The General Assembly meets quarterly and is responsible for drafting the
production, investment and financial plans; for ratifying major contracts with



ANNEX 2
Page 3
suppliers, buyers, mechanization enterprises, etc.; and for deciding the allo-
cation of income. A CAP's President is elected by its General Assembly for a
two year term and his appointment is subject to approval of the district's
General Director for Agriculture. The General Assembly also elects the repre-
sentatives of the technicians and the members of the CAP's Management Council
and ratifies the President's choices for chiefs of farms within the CAP and
its chief economist.
11.       The Management Council is the executive body of the CAP which is
responsible for coordinating the CAP's operations and meets once or twice a
week. Its membership consists of the President and Vice-Presidents (if any)
of the CAP, the chief economist, chiefs of the farms in the CAP and the elected
representatives of the technicians and the members. The President and the
Vice-Presidents conduct the day-to-day operations and are assisted by the chief
economist, who is not only responsible for the preparation of a sound invest-
ment plan but also for the accounting and the financial management of CAP's
affairs. The chiefs of farms are the heads of production units and are always
engineers (agriculturalists). They are assisted by a farm economist in charge
of accounting and financial management of the units and by technicians in the
fields of irrigation and livestock.
12.       CAPs do not own farm machinery or equipment but rely on the service
of state owned and operated Agricultural Mechanization Enterprises (AMEs).
These enterprises are responsible for providing all farm machinery and imple-
ments to CAPs, whenever required, in return for fixed charges for various
operations, which may be paid either in cash or in kind.
Allocation of Production Income
13.       Traditionally, the net farm income of a CAP (value of total produc-
tion minus cost of production excluding labor contributed by members) is allo-
cated between two funds: the Development Fund, which is at least 18% of the
net income, and the Consumption Fund, which is at most 82%; allocation between
the two is somewhat flexible and varies from CAP to CAP. The Development Fund
is a compulsory saving mechanism under which funds are set aside for partial
financing of future investment on the CAPs and of production expenses in the
next cropping season. This Fund is deposited with the Bank for Agriculture
and Food Industry (BAFI) and earns 1% to 2% interest. In general, about 85%
of the Consumption Fund is distributed among the members; about 8% is allo-
cated to social security and 7% to emergency and entertainment funds. The
General Assembly of the cooperative has the power to alter the percentages of
Development and Consumption Fund to keep the personal incomes to members in
line with personal incomes elsewhere in Romania.
14.       An experiment to change the mechanism for distributing net farm in-
come and for determining the income to cooperative members is underway. Under
this experiment, which is now under trial by all CAPs, each active member of
the cooperative is presently entitled to receive a minimum remuneration of



ANNEX 2
Page 4
about Lei 1,000 (US$50.00) per month, 1/ which is in line with the minimum
wage for comparable labor employed by IASs. The actual remuneration of an
active member in any given year is increased if actual production is above
the planned targets, but this does not exceed the maximum wage to comparable
labor employed in the State sector.
15.       The average salary of workers in the agricultural sector would
increase by about 29% during the 1976-80 plan (revised to 30% in July 1977)
compared to an average economy-wide increase of about 30%. About 17% of the
additional salary would accrue beginning in the second half of 1977 and the
remaining 12% beginning by mid-1979. In line with this change, the minimum
salary to active members of the CAPs would be increased to nearly Lei 1,290
(US$64.50) per month by 1980.
16.       Salaries of farm workers (including members of CAPs and employees
of IASs) are not substantially lower than salaries of workers in the indus-
trial sector, although labor productivity in the agricultural sector is less
than one-third of that in the industrial sector. The average salary in the
agricultural sector, for example, is about 90% of the average salary in the
industrial sector. This reflects Government policy not to permit a wide
disparity of income among the population.
C. State Agricultural Enterprises
Organization
17.       IASs are owned by the State and are operated and managed by
employees in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA). A single
enterprise may consist of several farms; each farm may specialize in produc-
ing either field crops, vegetables, industrial crops, fruit, milk or meat.
The chief executive officer of an IAS is a Director, who is appointed by
the General Director of IASs in the Ministry. He is assisted by the chief
engineers of the farms in the IAS and a chief economist/accountant. Other
technicians required for the farms are included on the staff. The governing
body of an IAS consists of the top management, chiefs of the farms, repre-
sentatives of the unions and the Party and elected representatives of the
workers. Storage, transport and farm equipment is owned by the IAS; these
are maintained by a Central Service Unit.
1/   This is the normal salary for members of crop producing farm units.  The
corresponding salary for members of livestock farms amounts to Lei 1,500
(US$75.00), and of vegetable, grape and fruit farms Lei 1,200 (US$60.00)
each. If the Consumption Fund in any given year is low, BAFI extends
loan to the cooperative to ensure payment of the guaranteed salaries to
members. Such a loan is usually repayable within one year and carries no
interest. All salaries refer to income before taxes. Taxes on incomes
of Lei 1,000 to 1,200 (US$50-60) per month amount to about 12%. They are
about 13% on income of Lei 1,500 (US$75) per month.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
18.       Salaries of the staff of IAS are fixed by law but vary according to
"norms" 1/ and skills; 80% are paid semi-annually or monthly and the remainder
at the end of the season provided the planned targets are met. If production
exceeds the target, special premiums are paid. The present salary scales are
as follows:
Monthly Wage
Category                                     ---(Lei)----
Directors                                     3,100-4,200
Farm Manager                                 2,300-3,800
Economist/Accountant                          2,000-3,250
Farm Mechanic                                 1,980-2,960
Technician                                    1,380-1,800
Clerk                                         1,130-1,320
Unskilled Worker                              1,020-1,420
The above salary scales will be increased beginning some time this year in
accordance with Government plan to increase national wage scales during the
current Five Year Plan.
Distribution of Profits
19.       The profit of an IAS is defined as the gross value of production
less production costs, which include cost of labor and depreciation on all
capital investments in the IAS. Payments concerning depreciation are made
by the IAS to BAFI, who maintains a Special Depreciation Fund, which is used
as a source of financing future investments in the Public sector.
20.       Normally, about 10% of the profit is credited to a Consolidation
Fund, which is used to finance minor on-farm investments on any enterprise
under the Ministry. About 40% of the profit is allocated to Risk Insurance
Fund, which is used to meet extraordinary losses. The remaining 50% is
credited to the State budget. Profits in excess of the planned, after pay-
ment of labor premiums, are allocated between the Consolidation Fund, the
Insurance Fund and the State budget in the ratio of 25%, 30% and 45% respec-
tively.
D. Inter-Cooperative Associations
21.       Inter-Cooperative Associations (ICAs) are production units which
are formed by a group of CAPs, and in some instances by CAPs and IASs, to
invest in and manage projects which require higher resources than can be
1/   "Norm" refers to the expected volume of work, which should be performed
under given conditions, and usually corresponds to a 10-hour day and a
25-day month.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
provided by a single CAP (or IAS). At present, activities of the Associa-
tions are limited to livestock production, operation of greenhouses and pro-
duction of tree crops but their activities are likely to expand in the future.
There are about 230 ICAs in Romania, but there are none in the project area.
22.       The administrative structure of ICAs is similar to that of CAPs
in that the association is managed by a President, a Management Council and a
General Assembly. All officials or representatives in the Management Council
or in the General Assembly are members of the owner CAPs (or LASs) who have
been assigned to work full time in the Association. The net income from all
activities by the ICAs are utilized in the same way as in the CAPs (para 13).
However, each member CAP (or IAS) is entitled to a share of the part of the
development fund in proportion to the initial capital subscribed by each
member. Any member can withdraw its membership in the Association at any time.
23.       The concept of ICA is relatively new to the Romanian agriculture;
it evolved only in the last few years. As in other sectors of the economy, the
organization of agricultural production has been evolving and is likely to con-
tinue evolving in the future. The technology of production is changing and the
Romanians intend to develop their agriculture by establishing vertically and
horizontally integrated projects. This may require more sophisticated manage-
ment practice and a larger capital outlay than can be provided by individual
CAPs, especially those CAPs which are relatively poorly endowed with resources.
The establishment of ICAs is an attempt to pool resources of mainly smaller and
poorer CAPs for investments in activities which may be difficult to undertake
by a single CAP. This is probably in the right direction, but it is too early
to judge on the performance of the ICAs, compared with other existing produc-
tion organizations.
E. Investment Financing
24.       Once a project is included in the annual plan, the CAP or IAS pre-
pares a technical and financial proposal with the help of staff from BAFI and
the concerned General Directorate of Agriculture. This proposal is normally
backed up by detailed studies and designs made by relevant institutes. After
the proposal is approved by the competent authority, it is reviewed by BAFI
and a decision to finance the project is taken.
25.       Investments in CAPs and ICAs are financed from the Development Fund
(para 13) and from BAFI loans. The Fund may finance up to 30% of the costs
and the BAFI loans up to 95%, depending on the project, the financial status
of the cooperative, etc.
26.       Loan repayment periods vary; periods for typical loans are:  vine-
yard or orchard 10 years; feedmill 12 years; dairy unit 20 years; on-farm
irrigation equipment 8 years including 3 years of grace, and on-farm buried
irrigation pipe network 25 years including 5 years of grace. Current interest



ANNEX 2
Page 7
rates on investment loans to CAPs amount to 3% including interest during con-
struction, with penalty rates of up to 5%. 1/
27.       At present most investments on IASs are financed from the State bud-
get, funds for which are channelled through BAFI; credit financing is of minor
importance. In future, however, credit financing of investments on IASs is
likely to increase. Such lending would also be handled by BAFI. Interest
rates on investment loans to IASs range from 2% during construction to 4%
thereafter; penalty on delayed payments ranges up to 6%.
28.       In the past, preference in allocation of investment funds was given
to IASs because these are considered as the model farm organizations. Due to
CAP's larger share of production and employment, however, Government has re-
cognized that the growth of the agricultural sector depends largely on the
development of agriculture in the cooperatives and consequently more effort is
now being made to increase Investments in the cooperatives. CAP's share of
investment in agriculture would increase from about 45% during the 1971-1975
plan period to about 50% during the 1976-1980 plan.
December 21, 1977
1/   The low interest rate is in line with generally low prices of other
inputs and outputs in Romania. Interest rates play little or no resource
allocative role in the country because they are "taxes-on" rather than
"prices-of" capital.

ROMANIA
VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Marketing, Markets and Prices
A. Marketing
Organization and Management
1.        Marketing of agricultural product in Romania is entrusted to State
owned and operated marketing Centrals. 1/ These Centrals were established in
late 1960's to assist MAIA in the procurement, storage, processing and distri-
bution of agricultural products. Unlike other departments of the Ministry,
however, the Centrals are independent economic units with separate but coordi-
nated plans, budgets and accounts. Presently, there are 13 Centrals which
specialize in marketing specific commodities such as cereals, vegetables and
fruits, sugar, meat, milk, etc. Each Central has its headquarters in Bucharest
and an enterprise in each of the country's 39 judets (districts). The enter-
prises are the executing agencies of the Centrals and procure and distribute
products through their sub-units known as collecting centers. 2/
1/   A number of "peasant free markets", which sell produce from individual
plots of CAP members or private farmers, also exist but their importance
is insignificant. There are also marketing cooperatives (Agrocoops)
which are owned and operated by members of cooperatives. They were
established about 5 years ago to market crops produced on individual
plots and products from CAP lands in excess of contracts agreed for
delivery to State marketing agencies. Virtually all products marketed
by Agrocoops are vegetables and these marketing institutions handle less
than 5% of total marketed vegetables. So far, the performance of Agro-
coops has not been satisfactory because the market is under the virtual
control of State marketing institutions. Since the price ceiling for
all products is fixed at low levels, the viability of the Agrocoops
depends on efficiency in physical handling of products; they have not
been successful in achieving this objective. For this reason, the Agro-
coops are not viable institutions and their importance is likely to
diminish in future.
2/   The exception is the Central for sugar which does not have an enterprise
in each district and the collecting centers. This Central owns and
operates 13 sugar refineries. The refineries procure and transport the
raw materials, process them and distribute the final products (sugar,
candies, etc.).



ANNEX 3
Page 2
2.        Normally, each Central is headed by a director general who reports
directly to the concerned Deputy Minister. He is assisted by directors of
commerce/marketing, economics/accounting and technical matters. The composi-
tion of each enterprise's administrative personnel is similar to that of the
Central, and a chief engineer, a marketing specialist and an economist or an
accountant are normally on its staff.
3.        The enterprises and their sub-units are well equipped to facilitate
smooth flow of products without excessive losses. Storage losses of well
dried grains are estimated at about 2% but are higher for perishable commodi-
ties. The number of the collecting centers in any region and the market facil-
ities which are available to them vary depending on the mix and volume of com-
modities handled. However, care is taken to allocate collecting centers among
different localities and to provide them with adequate supplies in accordance
with planned production of commodities.
Procurement
4.        All procurements and sales by the marketing enterprises (or Centrals)
are arranged through standardized and legally binding contracts, which are
signed at the beginning of each year. These contracts specify types, volumes,
prices and places of delivery. Frequency of deliveries vary depending on the
production cycle; livestock products are delivered daily or weekly. The
delivery plans of contracting farms (CAP or LAS) are evaluated periodically,
based on frequent visits to farms, by experts from the concerned collecting
centers for assessing prospective outputs. This helps the marketing Centrals
in reviewing planned sales for domestic consumption or export.
5.        The CAP and the IAS farms are responsible for the delivery of prod-
ucts to the collecting centers but all costs of transportation are paid by the
Centrals. Each farm is expected to provide its own packaging materials; the
collecting centers reimburse the IAS farms for such materials (about Lei 17
or US$0.85 per ton for grain) but not the CAP farm, who are allowed to take
back the packing materials after delivery.
Distribution
6.        Normally, the collecting centers distribute the produc.-ts ti-v  i;-
ent outlets in accordance with the State plan. These outlets consist of the
export markets, the domestic food processing industry and the retail markets
most of which are owned and operated by the marketing Centrals. Distribution
of feed to the livestock subsector is also their responsibility.
7.        Presently, most marketing Centrals are responsible for the physical
handling of commodities for export, and a few export through other specialized
agencies of MALA such as FRUITEXPORT, which specializes in export of fruits
and vegetables. However, identification of international market prospects and
sale agreements, and planning of international deliveries are responsibilities
of the Ministry's export organization (AGROEXPORT), which operates in collabo-
ration with the Ministry of Foreign Trade.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
8.        All production plans in Romania are coordinated with expected prod-
uct use and its distribution. Since prices are fixed by law and play little or
no role in allocation of outputs, performance of agencies marketing domestic-
ally is limited to efficient physical handling and distribution of commodities
in accordance with the State plan. The Centrals, enterprises and collecting
centers are well staffed and organized, and are provided with the necessary
facilities to allow them to perform their functions properly. They are revenue
earning entities and derive their incomes from "profits". Their costs of
operation, retained "profit" margins and contributions to the State budget are
fixed in accordance with established Government guidelines. The marketing
margins of the collecting centers amount to about 10% to 15% of purchase prices
but this could vary according to the complexity of processing involved.
Marketing of Project Output
9.        Adequate measures have already been planned for handling anticipated
incremental project output, which would be marketed by four existing Centrals
through their enterprises and their sub-units. The Central for Sale of Cereals
and Compound Feedstuffs (CVPC) would market wheat, maize, soybean and sun-
flower. The marketing of fruits and vegetables would be the responsibility of
the Central for Vegetables and Fruits (CPLF). The Centrals for Sugar (CIZ)
and grapes (CVV) would market, respectively, sugar beet and its products, and
grapes and related products. In line with Government policy of promoting
integrated agricultural development, the following storage and processing
facilities would be constructed as a part of the current Five-Year Plan to
serve the project area: (a) three grain silos (capacity of 240,000 tons); (b)
a sugar factory (capacity to process 400 tons of sugar in 24 hours); (c) a
canning factory (capacity of 5,000 tons); (d) an oil factory (capacity of 70
tons of oil in 24 hours; and (e) a feedmill (capacity of 80,000 tons). The
combined capacities of existing and planned processing facilities would be
adequate to meet the needs of the project area. The new facilities, which
are not part of the project, would be financed by Government under separate
arrangements. Construction of the new facilities would be completed in time
to satisfy project needs. Because of the existence of well-organized market-
ing Centrals, and the planned expansion of processing facilities, there would
be no organizational constraints to the marketing of project output.
B. Markets
10.       With the project, production of wheat and vetch will decline while
production of sunflower, fruit and rice will remain virtually unchanged. Ad-
ditional project output will be obtained from: maize (269,500 tons), alfalfa
hay (77,900 tons), soybean (14,900 tons), sugar beet (233,800 tons), grapes
(7,300 tons), vegetables (35,900 tons), pasture (32,500 tons) and maize sil-
age (470,100 tons).
11.       A part of the additional output of project commodities could be
exported and a part consumed domestically, but it is difficult to determine



ANNEX 3
Page 4
the distribution of this output between the two markets because this depends
on national production of the commodities (and their substitutes) and on
demand for exports. The long-term demand for exports is particularly diLfi-
cult to predict because this depends on global supply and demand for such
commodities and production and exports from Romania are insignificant to in-
fluence the world market. However, even if all of the additional project
output is to be consumed internally, the outlook for expansion of sales to
this market is favorable.
12.       Maize and Fodder Crops.  About 60% of the project area would be
occupied by maize and fodder crops (alfalfa, vetch and pasture). Virtually
all of the additional production of these commodities is likely to be used
to feed a growing livestock population throughout the country. Although there
is no data to show the projected additional demand for feeds at the national
level, predicted incremental supply of feed from all domestic sources, and
the proportion of the additional demand which could be supplied from the proj-
ect area, it is unlikely that any project is approved by the concerned author-
ities unless the disposition of the incremental output is reasonably assured.
Furthermore, the rapid growth in the livestock population in response to grow-
ing export and domestic demands indicates a substantial increase in the derived
demand for feed. In the project area alone, total livestock population is ex-
pected to increase by over 50% by mid-1980's. This additional livestock pop-
ulation could absorb about 20% of the incremental output of maize and other
fodder crops. The remaining 80% of the incremental output of these crops
would be used to feed livestock outside of the project area.
13.       Even if the additional production of maize, for instance, cannot be
absorbed by the domestic market, the potential for expanding export of this
crop is favorable. Romania is a net exporter of maize with annual exports
averaging about 390,000 tons/year up to the mid-1970's. The major tradi-
tional importers included UK, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Austria and USSR. The quality of Romanian maize meets international stan-
dards and the export prices are attractive to help in the expansion of exports
to the traditional and other markets.
14.       Sugar.  At full development, the additional output of sugar beet
from the project area would yield an equivalent of about 33,000 tons of sugar
per year. This could easily be absorbed by the domestic market. Presently,
the per capita consumption of sugar in Romania is estimated at 15 kg compared
to per capita consumption of about 30 kg in countries such as Yugoslavia,
Spain, Portugal and Greece. About half of the domestic production of sugar
is exported to earn badly needed foreign exchange, leaving only the remaining
50% to be consumed domestically. Even if exports are assumed to remain un-
changed in the foreseeable future, the production of sugar would have to be
increased by at least 320,000 tons to raise the domestic per capita consump-
tion to about 30 kg, provided there would be no imports. The total incre-
mental production of sugar from this and other Bank financed irrigation proj-
ects in Romania (Giurgiu-Razmiresti, Rasova-Vederoasa and Ialomita-Calmatui)
could satisfy no more than 50% of the additional domestic production which



ANNEX 3
Page 5
would be required to double the present level of per capita consumption.
This means that the risk from an inadequate market for sugar is low because
the domestic market is capable of absorbing all of the incremental output
from the project.
15.       Vegetables and Grapes.  As a result of the project, total production
of vegetables and of grapes would increase by 35,900 tons and 7,300 tons,
respectively, all of which could be consumed internally. According to the
current Five-Year Plan, for example, the per capita consumption of vegetables
is expected to increase from a low of about 40 kg in 1975 to about 70 kg in
1980, or a total increase of about 690,000 tons. The incremental output of
vegetables from this and from other Bank financed irrigation projects in
Romania could satisfy no more than 30% of this additional demand.
16.       Romania has a well established export market for vegetables and
fruits in Eastern Europe and USSR, and in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Czechoslovakia, German Democractic Republic and the USSR account for more
than 50% of Romania's exports of vegetables and fruits. In the past ten
years, exports of fruits and vegetables to the above mentioned and other
markets have increased steadily. If this trend continues, the prospect for
expanding exports is favorable. The country's proximity to the traditional
markets and the reasonably developed ground transport link to these tradi-
tional markets could give an added advantage to Romania over potential com-
petitors.
17.       Soybean.  The incremental output of soybean will yield about 12,000
tons of oilcake and 3,000 tons of oil. Romania is presently importing about
100,000 tons of oilcake per year and imports are likely to increase in future
with growth in the livestock population unless the domestic production of
oilseeds is increased. The project output of oilcake can substitute for only
12% of the current level of imports. The additional output of oil is also
likely to be consumed domestically because demand is increasing. By 1980
alone, the consumption of vegetable oil is expected to increase by about
70,000 tons.
C. Prices
Domestic Prices
18.       Because of the system of economic management in Romania, market
forces have little or no influence in determining domestic prices. Prices
are fixed by the Government and vary according to quality of products and in
some instances according to the delivery dates; the present prices have not
changed significantly since 1963, and the recent revision of prices (January
1977) has not affected prices of agricultural products. Domestic production
prices reflect the cost of production plus a pre-determined "profit" margin.
Prices of all commodities, which are low when compared with prices of compar-
able products in other countries, reflect low prices of inputs including
labor.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
19.       The IASs are required to sell their products to the marketing enter-
prises or their sub-units, but the CAPs make their deliveries based on con-
tracts signed with the marketing agencies at the beginning of each cropping
season. Prices of cereals received by the CAPs for their contract deliveries
are higher than those paid to the IASs. Prices of oilseeds are uniform
throughout Romania, except for soybean whose contract price for the CAPs is
higher than that received by IASs.
20.       Domestic prices of vegetables, potatoes, fruits, sugar beet and
grapes are fixed by grades and dates of delivery. No price differentials
exist between CAP and IAS production and in most cases among regions, but
prices vary between a maximum for early delivery and superior quality crop
and a minimum for later delivery and poor quality crop. However, they cannot
decline below the floor or exceed the ceiling prices.
Prices Used for Project Appraisal
21.       The average of official farmgate prices of project commodities which
are applicable to all producers throughout Romania, and CAP contract prices
are shown in Table 1. For financial analysis of farm budgets, the CAP con-
tract prices are used. For economic analysis, however, prices of tradeables
have been derived from the Bank's forecast of world prices for the period
1977-1985 and for the non-tradeables, official domestic prices are used. The
former category includes cereals, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, grapes and
sugar beet (sugar); the latter includes mainly fodders and crop residues.
Romania is a price-taker in the world market and project output of tradeables
would have little or no influence on international or domestic prices.

VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Description of Project Works
A. General
1.        The project works would consist of (a) irrigation works to serve a
net area of 110,290 ha; (b) drainage works to serve about 77,540 ha; and (c)
miscellaneous works, which include soil erosion control and river training
works, land leveling, deep plowing and ripping and other minor works. The
project's irrigation and drainage networks are illustrated in Map IBRD 13020.
Detailed description of each of the above categories and the works included
therein is given below.
B. Irrigation Works
2.        The project area would be served by the following three independent
irrigation systems:

ANNEX 4
Page 2
The first two systems (107,400 ha net) would use the Danube supplies, and
the third system (2,890 ha net) would receive water from the existing
Cringeni storage reservoir (see Map IBRD 13020) on the Calmatui River but
only after the dam has been raised (not a part of this project). Following
the raising of the dam, the additional storage would be filled by supplies
from the Olt River.
Viisoara Irrigation System
3.        Floating Pumping Station.  This Station (SPA-1) would have a capa-
city to pump 69.5 m3/sec over a maximum head of 5.2 m. Because of a wide
fluctuation (+ 5.0 m) in the Danube water levels, a floating pumping station
is more economical than a fixed station. The Station would consist of three
barges, each fitted with six pumping units. Each unit would be rated at 500
kw, and the total installed power capacity would be 9,150 kw (Table 1).
Pump intakes would be fed through a short dredged channel that would link
the Danube with the floating basin, where the barges would be moored. The
pumps would deliver water, over the protective levee, into a discharge basin
at the head of the main canal. The intake channel and the intake regulator
located in the flood protection levee would be able to feed the discharge
basin (and the main canal) by gravity in most of the cropping season, when
the Danube stage is at elevation 18.55 m or above. The Station would need
to be used only when the Danube stage is lower.  In a year of average flow,
supplies would need to be pumped only during the month of September, which
would amount to about 13% of the total demand for the cropping season.
4.        The Canal System.  The Danube Flood Plain, up to the foot of the
Viisoara Terrace, is about 9 km wide. The most economical alternative for
conveying the Danube supplies to the Terrace is to let the main canal flow
into the existing Suhaia Lake, which is formed at the junction of the
Calmatui River and the Danube flood protection levee, and to pump (Station
SRP) the required supplies from the northern shore of the Lake into the main
canal on the Terrace. Before the main canal's entry into the Suhaia Lake,
distributaries CD-1 (capacity 2.4 m3/sec) and CD-2 (capacity 6.3 m3/sec)
would branch off respectively to the west and east to serve those areas on
the Danube Flood Plain. The latter would also be the channel into which the
effluent from tile drains serving this part of the Danube Flood Plain would
discharge (para 30). This effluent would not exceed 20% of the distributary
flow at any time, and therefore would not adversely affect the quality of
irrigation water.
5.        On the Terrace, the main canal would be about 40 km long and would
have a capacity of 57.5 m3/sec at its head. At km 28.8, a re-pumping station
(SRP-1) would lift about 15.9 m3/sec to irrigate the northern and western
parts of the project area, which are at higher elevations. Nine distributary
systems (CD-3 to CD-li) would offtake from the main canal on the Terrace,
four of these would be fed by the main canal reach downstream of the repumping
station SRP-1.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
6.        At some future date (around 1990), the Olt-Vedea canal from the Olt
River would feed the tail end of the main canal and the northern end of dis-
tributary CD-10, so that in years of average and high flows in the Olt River,
about 37,400 ha of the area commanded by the Viisoara System could be sup-
plied from the north by gravity. This arrangement would save about 27 million
kwh of electric energy annually, which would be equivalent to about 50% of
the energy required to pump Danube supplies for this area or 15% of the total
energy requirement for the project. In years of low flow in the Olt, this
area would be supplied from the Danube River. The last 11 km of the main canal
(capacity at tail 1.6 m3/sec) would be kept unlined, so that this portion
could be enlarged (future capacity 20.0 m3/sec) and lined later in accordance
with the requirements of the Olt River scheme. This would not result in ex-
cessive seepage losses, as the canal capacity is small and soils are not sandy.
7.        Except for the tail reach of the main canal, and the two distribu-
taries in the Danube Flood Plain, all other canals would be lined with con-
crete. Bed width of the lined canals would range from 12.0 m to 0.5 m and
depth would vary from 3.5 m to 0.7 m. The larger canals would be lined with
cast-in-place concrete slabs 6 cm thick; the smaller sections would be lined
with pre-cast concrete slabs, joined with bitumastic putty. The main canal
in the Flood Plain would have a bed width of 30 m and a depth of 3.0 m. In
the Flood Plain, the banks of the main canal and the banks of the two distri-
butaries would be protected by placing rip rap over a layer of filter. Data
on canal sections is given in Table 2. Tertiary canals would offtake from
the distributaries at a normal spacing of 4 km, and would feed the pressure
pumping stations. Total length of the canal network would be about 203 km;
this would involve an earthwork of about 9.8 million m3, and concrete lining
of about 1.8 million m2.
8.        Operation of the canal system would be automated by the use of
hydraulically operated constant downstream water level gates at the regulating
structures. Some canal reaches would have adequate capacity to store flow
variations resulting from differences between supply and demand. At suitable
locations, escape weirs would be provided to spill surplus water into the
canal downstream or nearby natural drainages. A total of about 100 structures
would be constructed on the canal system. Of these, the important structures
are: the intake regulator at the Danube; 29 gated regulators and drops; 25
road bridges; 2 railway bridges; 14 siphons and 12 escape weirs.
9.        Pumping Stations.  A total of 4 fixed pumping stations would lift
irrigation supplies within the Viisoara System; of these two stations (SRP
and SRP-1) would be located on the main canal, one (SRP-2) on the tail end of
distributary CD-2, and one (SRP-3) on the Suhaia Lake. Data on the pumping
stations is given in Table 1. The biggest station (SRP) would be at the foot
of the Viisoara Terrace and would consist of 10 pumping units capable of
lifting 57.5 m3/sec over a maximum head of 77.3 m. Each unit would have a
rating of 6,000 kw, and the total installed power capacity of the station
would be 60,640 kw. Two steel pipes with a diameter of 3,200 mm would deliver
pumped supplies at elevation 90 m to the discharge basin at the head of the



ANNEX 4
Page 4
main canal on the Terrace. Station SRP-1 would have four pumping units with
a capacity to lift 15.9 m3/sec over a head of about 16 m.  Two pipes, with a
diameter of 2,000 mm would deliver the pumped supplies to the main canal (14.0
m3lsec), and one pipe of diameter 1,000 mm would convey water to distributary
CD-8 (1.9 m3/sec). The installed capacity of this station would be 4,040 kw.
10.       Station SRP-2 on CD-2 would be designed to lift 3.3 m3/sec over
60 m through five pumping units. The installed power capacity would be
3,160 kw. Station SRP-3 would be located on the western bank of the Suhaia
Lake, and would have six pumping units with a capacity to pump 10.7 m3/sec
from the Lake over 4.1 m for the Rice Area. The installed capacity of this
Station would be 690 kw.
11.       Pressure Pumpinp Stations and Distribution Networks.  Irrigation
supplies would be pressurized by two types of pumping stations: (a) fixed or
central, which would serve larger areas (460 ha to 2,500 ha); and (b) semi-
mobile or individual, which would serve smaller areas (200 ha to 250 ha). The
individual pumping stations are more economical than the central stations at
any discount rate, but the use of the former is limited to those areas where
ground slopes are flatter and mostly furrow irrigation would be practiced.
The fixed stations, which would number 38, would irrigate a total of 57,030
ha. Depending on the terrain and land ownership, the size of the block served
by a fixed pumping station would vary from a minimum of 460 ha to a maximum
of 2,500 ha, and the respective discharge would vary from 300 1/sec to 1,440
1/sec. The pressure head at these stations would mostly range from 60 m to 78
m for sprinkler irrigation; at some stations, which would serve furrow areas,
the pressure head would be about 33 m. The number of pumps at a station would
vary from 2 to 8. All pumps would be of the vertical type and would be in-
stalled outdoor. The installed power capacity would range from 150 kw to
;,700 kw; the total for the 38 stations would be 40,370 kw. A typical distri-
bution network supplied from a central pumping station, located at the center
of the block (area about 123 ha) served by this network, would consist of
(a) a buried main pipeline running parallel to the supply canal; and (b) 16
buried distribution pipes -- 8 on either side of the main pipeline. The size
of the main pipe would vary from 800 mm to 400 mm, and the distribution pipe
would vary from 250 mm to 150 m. All pipe above 400 mm diameter would be of
precast reinforced concrete, and below this size would be of asbestos cement
and PVC.
12.       About 176 individual pumping stations would pressurize supplies
for a total area of 39,150 ha; each station would be equipped with 2 semi-
mobile pumping units and would serve an area varying from 200 ha to 250 ha.
These pumping units would be standardized for three discharges -- 90 1/sec,
60 1/sec and 30 1/sec and high (45 m) or low (25 m) pressures. Each pumping
station would feed two buried distribution pipes perpendicular to the canal;
each would serve one plot of about 100 ha to 125 ha on either side of the
canal. The size of this pipe, which would be either of asbestos cement or
PVC, would vary from 250 mm to 150 mm. The electric motors are rated at 100
kw for pumps of 190 1/sec, and at 75 kw for pumps of 60 1/sec and 30 1/sec.
Power is supplied through pole-mounted transformers. Total installed capacity
at 176 stations is estimated at 19,700 kw.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
13.       Sprinkler Irrigation.  About 65,830 ha, having ground slopes vary-
ing from 1% to 10%, would be irrigated by sprinklers. Most of this area has
a slope of 1% to 3% and a mixed micro-relief where either ground depressions
are prominent or poorly draining soils with relatively low permeability exist.
A typical irrigation plot, which would be served by hydrants on one distribu-
tion pipe, would measure about 123 ha (612 m x 2,016 m). A typical block sup-
plied by one fixed pumping station would consist of 16 such plots (total area
1,970 ha); each plot would be served by a distribution pipe branching off
from the main pipe. Typical area supplied by an individual pumping station
would consist of 2 such plots (total area 250 ha). Distribution pipes would
be spaced 612 m apart and their length would vary from 1,872 m to 2,160 m.
Hydrants would be located on the distribution pipes at a spacing of 72 m.
Each of these distribution pipes would have 28 hydrants; each would supply
water to 6 laterals (3 on either side) by rotation, but only 2 could be served
simultaneously. Sprinklers would be spaced at 18 m intervals; each to serve
an area of 18 m x 24 m. The laterals would be of aluminum with a diameter of
10 cm. The sprinkler nozzle would have a diameter of 7 mm, and operating at a
pressure of 3 to 3.5 atmospheres would be able to supply water at an hourly
intensity varying from 6.6 mm to 7.1 m. The lateral would remain in one posi-
tion for a maximum of 11 hours, and the return time would not exceed 14 days.
14.       Furrow Irrigation.  About 30,350 ha having ground slopes less than
1%, would be irrigated by furrow by a type of network similar to that for
sprinkler irrigation; the difference would be that the hydrants would be
spaced 216 m apart on the distribution pipes. Each hydrant would feed 16
to 20 furrows through portable aluminum and butyl rubber pipes with outlets
at furrow spacings. Length of furrows would be about 200 m and the maximum
discharge would not exceed 2 1/sec. About 2,140 ha (rice area) would continue
to be irrigated by the basin method by gravity canals fed by supplies pumped
by Station SRP-3.
Zimnicea Irrigation System
15.       General.  The existing Zimnicea Irrigation System irrigates 6,530
ha on the Zimnicea Terrace, which is located north of the Pasarea Canal at
an elevation of 5 m to 15 m above the Danube Flood Plain.  Presently about
one-third of this area does not receive adequate irrigation supplies, and
some of the surface drains serving this area do not have proper drainage
outlets. Under the project, these constraints would be removed by improving
the existing irrigation and drainage network. The existing System would also
be enlarged: (a) to extend irrigation on the Danube Flood Plain south of the
Pasarea Canal; and (b) to extend irrigation in future in about 3,800 ha in
the Contesti-Bujoru area, which lies to the east of the project area. The
existing System, as well as the works to be carried out under the project
are described below.
16.       Floating Pumping Stations.  The existing pumping station on the
Danube (SPA-2), which supplies water for the Zimnicea Terrace, has a capac-
ity to pump 5.3 m3/sec over a head of 5.2 m. This unit is designed to pump



ANNEX 4
Page 6
in both directions - from the Danube to the Pasarea Canal as an irrigation
unit or from the Canal to the River as a drainage unit. It is used as an irri-
gation unit only when the water level in the Danube is below elevation 19.05;
above this level, water flows into the Pasarea Canal by gravity through the
control gates that exist in the flood protection dike. A new floating pumping
station (SPA-3), having a capacity to pump 5.3 m3/sec over 5.0 m, would be
added to meet the additional requirements of the System and for extension of
irrigation in the Contesti-Bujoru area. About 60% of this capacity would be
needed for extension of irrigation in the ContestiBujoru area. Cost of this
Station allocable to future extension has been excluded from the project cost
estimate. This Pumping Station would be located about one km upstream of
SPA-2 and would be linked with it through a new canal having a capacity of 5.3
m3/sec. The installed power capacity at this Station would be 580 kw (Table 1).
17.       Pasarea Canal.  This canal (15 km long) is an old arm of the Danube
River, which is being used and would continue to be used as a supply canal
for the Zimnicea Irrigation System. It is fed from the River either through
the control gates by gravity (when the River water levels exceed elevation
19.05 M) or by pumping. It has an irregular channel with an uneven bed, and
does not have the capacity, in many reaches, to carry the existing irrigation
requirements. Under the project, this channel would be dredged to enlarge
its capacity to 10.6 m3/sec at head and 4.8 m3/sec near Gorganu at its tail.
The enlarged channel would also dispose of more efficiently the drainage
discharge from the drains of the Zimnicea Terrace in the north and of the
Flood Plain in the south.
18.       Repumping Station.  Two existing stations pump water from the
Pasarea Canal into the existing distribution canals on the Zimnicea Terrace.
These stations are SRP-Zimnicele, and SRP Gorganu; these would not be re-
modelled under the project, as they have adequate capacity to serve 6,530 ha
on the Zimnicea Terrace.
19.       Pressure Pumping Stations and Distribution Network.  The existing
System utilizes mobile diesel units for pressurizing water for sprinkler
irrigation. This system is working quite satisfactorily, and would not be
changed. However to extend irrigation to about 2,550 ha on the Danube Flood
Plain south of Pasarea Canal, two fixed pressure pumping stations (SRP-5 and
SRP-6) would be added under the project, which would serve the new area with
sprinkler irrigation. These stations would respectively have a capacity of
900 1/sec (1,040 kw) and 1,065 1/sec (1,260 kw). The distribution networks
and on-farm equipment for the area would be similar to that described in
paras 11 and 13.
Calmatui Irrigation System
20.       This System would be constructed under the project, except for its
headworks, to irrigate 2,890 ha net in the Calmatui Valley. An earth dam
(Cringeni) with a storage of about 5.0 Mm3 already exists on the Calmatui
River, about 80 km upstream of the project boundary for a local irrigation



ANNEX 4
Page 7
scheme. This dam would be raised, under a separate project, and the storage
capacity would be increased. The cost of such raising would be about Lei 30
million (US$1.5 million), which has not been included in the project cost
estimate but has been considered for the economic analysis. The Calmatui
Irrigation System would be supplied from the raised Cringeni Storage, through
the river channel, which would be improved under the project.
21.       River Training Works.  Upstream of the Suhaia Lake, the Calmatui
River has a catchment area of about 1,350 km2, of which 1,080 km2 (80%) is
between the Cringeni dam and the Suhaia Lake. The Urlui River, which brings
in relatively higher discharges, joins the Calmatui about 10 km upstream of
the Suhaia Lake. The existing channel of the Calmatui has relatively flat bed
slopes (1 in 1,000 to 1 in 5,000), and capacities that are insufficient to
carry its flood flows. In most reaches the River channel is silted up due
to its meandering course; its meanders become more prominent after the Urlui
confluence. About 2,030 ha in the Calmatui valley were flooded in 3 out of
the last 5 years, and in 1972 several floods affected the area in the same
year. The usual flood has a probability of 20%.
22.       Under the project, the River channel would be canalized to carry
flood flows with a probability of 5%; these are estimated at 55 m3/sec up
to the Urlui confluence, and 77 m3/sec below. The trained cross section of
the River would be trapezoidal with a width varying from 2 m to 6 m and side
slopes of 1 in 3. The river channel would be straightened, cutting off most
meanders. At several locations, new embankments would be constructed to
contain the design flows within the improved river channel. Total excavation
involved would be about 2.5 million m3; fill in the embankments would be about
0.1 million m3. Nine water drops would also be constructed at the required
locations.
23.       Pressure Pumping Stations and Distribution Networks.  Six fixed or
central pressure pumping stations and four individual stations would pump
water from the improved Calmatui River channel into their pipe distribution
networks for sprinkler irrigation. Because of the narrowness of the Valley,
the size of the irrigation blocks served by these stations is smaller than the
blocks on the Viisoara Terrace, and would vary from 160 ha to 870 ha. All
other features of the pipe networks and on-farm equipment would be similar to
that described for the Viisoara Irrigation System (paras 11 and 12). Data on
pumping stations is in Table 1.
C. Drainage Works
24.       Of the total area of 110,290 ha that would be irrigated under the
project, about 77,540 ha would require drainage; the remaining 32,750 ha,
mostly located in the northern portion of the Viisoara Terrace, does not
need any drainage works as it has a good soil structure and ideally slopes
towards the natural drainages in the project area. Areas requiring drainage
are located as follows: Viisoara Terrace 60,430 ha, Danube Flood Plain,



ANNEX 4
Page 8
14,220 ha, and Calmatui Valley 2,890 ha. These areas would be basically
served by surface drainage networks, but about 5,000 ha would also be
equipped with tile drainage. The drainage works are described below, and
are illustrated in Map IBRD 13020.
25.       Surface Drainage.  Of the total area of 60,430 ha in the Viisoara
Terrace, 41,730 ha is located to the north of the Izvoarele Valley and 18,700
ha to the south. Soils in the northern part are heavy and the ground slopes
are relatively flat with no closed depressions. The interception drains in
this part would be located at a uniform spacing of about 700 m. In the
southern part which has medium soils, steeper ground slopes, and contains
isolated closed depressions, the interception drains would have a variable
spacing of 500 m to 700 m; the density being dictated by the location of
depressions. Twelve mobile diesel pumping units would be provided for the
evacuation of water trapped in these depressions. Interception drains would
be located perpendicular to the irrigation distribution pipe. The total area
of 60,430 ha is divided into 78 basins according to topography. The details
of these basins are shown in Table 3. All drains discharge by gravity, either
directly into the Vedea and Calmatui Rivers or through their tributaries Nanov,
Izvoarele, Rojistea, and Urlui or into the Pasarea Canal.
26.       The drainage network in the Viisoara Terrace would be designed to
remove in two or three days the surface runoff resulting from the maximum
precipitation in 24 hours with a probability of 5%. The resultant maximum
specific discharge is estimated at 0.55 1/sec/ha. Including the seepage from
the irrigation canals (mostly lined), the specific discharge for the design is
0.57 1/sec/ha. The total length of surface drains in the Terrace would be
761 km giving a density of about 12.5 m/ha. The trapezoidal sections of the
drains would range from a bed width of 0.5 m to 2.1 m, and a depth of 0.8 m
to 2.5 m.
27.       In the Danube Flood Plain and the Calmatui Valley, surface drainage
is to be provided in 14,220 ha and 2,890 ha respectively. In addition to the
specific discharge of 0.57 1/sec/ha referred to above, the Danube Flood Plain
has additional sources of water to cope with; these are (a) seepage from the
Danube Flood protection dikes; (b) seepage from the Suhaia Lake, and other
smaller lakes for fisheries development; and (c) the terrace slopes. The
values of these seepages are estimated at 45 1/km, 25 1/km, and 43 1/km re-
spectively; these are equivalent to an additional discharge of 0.27 I/sec/ha.
Thus, the total specific discharge for the design of the drainage system in
the Danube Flood plain is 0.84 1/sec/ha.
28.       The Danube Flood Plain is already served by an existing surface
drainage system but its density is not adequate. Similarly, 870 ha in the
Calmatui Valley is served by an existing surface drainage system of inade-
quate density. Some of the existing drains would be remodelled and enlarged,
while new drains would be introduced in the areas where no drains exist. The
new drains would be designed according to the criteria stated above. Because
of the larger quantity of water to be disposed of in these areas, the spacing
between the interception drains would be 300 m to 400 m.  Total length of the
drains to be provided in both areas would be as follows:

New Drains                          245 km
Total                            386 km
These drains would provide a density of about 23 m/ha. About 13 km of exist-
ing drains which do not fit into the newly evolved pattern would be demolished.
29.       The total length of surface drains for the whole project area would
be about 1,147 km. These would involve an excavation of about 11.5 million
m3. A large number of water drops, bridges on farm roads and on primary and
secondary roads, and siphons for irrigation canals would be constructed on
the drainage channels.
30.       Tile Drainage.  The Danube Flood Plain consists mostly of gleyed and
humic alluvial soils, some of which are saline. The phreatic level is at I m
to 3 m below ground, and the micro-relief is such as to have a tendency to
store water. It is therefore necessary to install subsurface tile drainage
to supplement the surface drainage network so as to gain adequate control
over the water table. Tile drainage is also essential, in the saline areas
(5,000 ha), to quickly evacuate the relatively saline effluent that would
result from frequent applications of leaching water. Since such effluents
would be small in quantity in relation to the flows of the canals into which
these would be discharged, there is no danger of an appreciable increase in
the salt content of irrigation water.
31.       The following areas would be served by tile drainage:
Area
Moderately      Slightly
Location                    Saline         Saline       Total
--------------(ha)---------------

Total                   2,500          2,500        5,000
The tile drains have been designed for a spegific discharge of 0.69 1/sec/ha
and a soil hydraulic conductivity of 5 x 10   cm/sec (0.043 m/day).  To main-
tain the water table at a depth of 1.5 m, the drains would be spaced at 30 m.
The ceramic tiles would have a diameter.of 7 cm and would be laid in trenches
0.25 m wide and from 1.2 m to 1.7 m deep. The tiles would be surrounded by
5 mm to 7 mm thick gravel layer. The length of each drain would not exceed
200 m. About 85% of the tile drains would discharge into open surface drains
or canals and about 15% would discharge into pipe collectors having a dia-
meter of 20 cm. The total length of tile drains would be 1,411 km and the
length of pipe collector 18 km. In about 60% of the tile drainage area,
the drainage effluent estimated at 3.5 m3/sec would have to be disposed of
by pumping.



ANNEX 4

32.       Drainage Pumping Stations.  Eight new drainage pumping stations
would be installed under the project for pumping the effluent of the tile
drainage network. Seven stations would be in the Danube Flood Plain while
the eighth would be located in the Calmatui Valley. Each station would be
equipped with two to five vertical pumping units. The pumping capacity of
these stations would range from 259 1/sec to 1,555 1/sec; the pumping heads
from 2.0 m to 4.2 m; and the installed power capacity from 60 kw to 120 kw.
The total pumping capacity would be 5,970 1/sec, and the total installed power
capacity would be 700 kw. Twelve mobile diesel units would be provided under
the project to dewater the closed depressions. The capacity of these units,
which individually would range between 10 1/sec to 190 1/sec would add up to
420 1/sec. These units would operate only when required and would be moved
around to serve the lower part of the Viisoara Terrace where most of the
depressions are located. Under the project, the capacity of existing 5 drain-
age pumping stations in the Danube Flood Plain would be increased from a total
of 16.5 m3/sec to 22.4 m3/sec. Details of drainage pumping stations are in
Table 4.
33.       Amelioration of Saline Land.  The project area includes about
2,500 ha of moderately saline land, located in the Danube Flood Plain, and
about 2,500 ha of slightly saline land, most of which is also in the Danube
Flood Plain. Inspite of being affected by salinity, all of the saline lands
are under cultivation - some with only salt-tolerant crops. Under the proj-
ect, this area would be provided with tile drainage, which is the basic and
most expensive part of the soil amelioration measures. Following completion
of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure, leaching operations would
be initiated on the saline lands with an application of 5,000 m3/ha/year.
There would be at least 3 to 4 applications per year, mostly during spring
and autumn when the irrigation system would have spare capacity to furnish
water for leaching. It is estimated that the slightly saline patches (2,500
ha) would be reclaimed in 2 years. Leaching operations would however con-
tinue on the moderately saline areas for about 4 years. In some areas,
especially those at the bottom of depressions, deep plowing would be carried
out to break up clay layers. Gypsum treatment is also envisaged in some
patches.
D. Miscellaneous Works
34.       Soil Erosion Control Works.  In the project area, about 10,800 ha
is affected by soil erosion which is mostly caused by water action. Of this
area, about 7,320 ha would be irrigated, and the remaining 3,480 ha having
ground slopes steeper than 10% would continue to be cultivated under rainfed
conditions. Works under the project would include: improving and protecting
waterways; constructing protection works on the slopes including earth banks,
terraces and diversion banks; providing grassed terraces and reseeding grasses
on steep slopes; constructing gully stops, etc. All of these works would in-
volve an earthwork of about 1.7 million m3.



ANNEX 4
Page 11
35.       Land Leveling.  About 30,350 ha, which would be irrigated by furrow,
would require land leveling. On the basis of a topographic survey carried out
on 5,000 ha with levels on a grid of 25 m by 25 m, the average earthwork in-
volved is estimated at 500 m3/ha. About 20,000 ha (66%) would involve an
average excavation of 420 m3/ha and only about 1,100 ha (4%) would require an
excavation of about 870 m3/ha.
36.       Deep Plowing and Ripping.  About 63,400 ha, mostly located in the
northern half of the Viisoara Terrace and the Danube Flood Plain has developed
a dense clay pan at a depth of about 25 cm below ground as a result of con-
tinuous plowing over time. Deep plowing would be carried out under the proj-
ect to break this pan and to improve the permeability of the top soil layers.
Deep ripping would be carried out on about 2,160 ha, located at the bottom of
depressions in the southern part of the Viisoara Terrace, to break the clay
layers that have deposited over time in these depressions.
37.       Observation Wells.  About 50 wells would be drilled at suitable
points in the project area to monitor groundwater levels following introduc-
tion of irrigation. These wells would be 15 cm in diameter and would vary in
depth from 5 m (Danube Flood Plain) to 15 m (Terraces).
38.       Facilities for Operation and Maintenance.  A number of offices,
stores and warehouses would be constructed under the project as facilities
needed by operation and maintenance staff. These facilities would be used
by the construction forces during the project execution and would be handed
over to the Teleorman IELIF for use by its operation and maintenance staff.

VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Water Requirement and Availability
1.        Need for Irrigation.  Annual rainfall in the project area averages
about 550 mm, of which about 350 mm (64%) falls during the cropping season
(April-October). The minimum rainfall, however, can be as low as 150 mm in
the cropping season. Rainfall amounting to less than 1/3 of the monthly
pan evaporation occurs about 30% to 40% of the time in April, May, June and
October, and 50% to 70% of the time in July, August and September. Dry
periods with rainfall less than 5 mm often extend beyond 10 days; long dry
periods of 50 to 70 days are not uncommon. Even in a year of normal rain-
fall, the effective rainfall is less than the crop requirements. Irrigation,
therefore, is essential if agriculture in the project area is to be developed
to its full potential.
2.        Net Water Requirement.  The net water required for various project
crops was calculated by the Blaney Criddle method using data for the Alexandria
station supplied by DIFCA. These requirements, after allowing for the effec-
tive rainfall available in four out of five years (80% probability) are given
in Annex 1, Table 1. The net water requirement per project hectare, weighted
in the ratio of project crops, is estimated at 3,388 m3/ha, of which the
maximum monthly demand of 1,187 m3/ha would be in July. The net water require-
ment for the irrigated area in the project would amount to about 386 Mm3, of
which 135 Mm3 would be in July.
3.        System Efficiency.  The overall efficiency of the project's irriga-
tion system is estimated at 69%. This is based on efficiencies of 73% for
sprinkler areas (70%) and 58% for furrow areas (30%); these are inclusive of
the conveyance and operational losses.
4.        Gross Water Requirement.  Gross water requirement, at 69% efficiency
would amount to 4,910 m3 per project hectare. This would be equivalent to a
total demand of 559 Mm3 during the cropping season, 545 Mm3 of which would
be supplied from the Danube River and 14 Mm3 from the Olt River through the
Cringeni Dam. The peak requirement in July would be 191 Mm3 from the Danube,
and 5 Mm3 from the Dam. The Cringeni Dam would be raised to store the addi-
tional water required by the Calmatui Valley.
5.        Water Availability.  Ninety-seven percent of the project's water
supply would be derived from the Danube River, which drains about 814,000 km2
in central and eastern Europe, and is a reliable source of water. In an aver-
age year, close to the project pumping stations, the Danube carries high dis-
charges (5,000 to 9,000 m3/sec) between April and October and lower flows
(4,000 to 7,000 m3/sec) during the rest of the year. Typical flow patterns
of the Danube River at Zimnicea Floating Pumping Station for three years



ANNEX 5
Page 2
(representing a typical wet, normal and dry year), are illustrated in Chart
17853. The project's maximum water requirement would be in the month of July,
when the Danube flow, even in a dry year, is seldom below 5,600 m3/sec. Water
supply for the project's irrigation system, therefore, is quite assured.
6.        The maximum area along the Danube that can be economically irrigated
by pumping water from this River is estimated at 2.34 million ha, which would
need an aggregate withdrawal in July of about 1,130 m3/sec, in September of
about 440 m3/sec, and in October of about 90 m3/sec. These pumped diversions
would amount to respectively 20%, 8% and 2% of the average river flows in a
typical medium year, and 20%, 11% and 4% in a typical dry year. It can there-
fore be concluded that even when all of the potential area has been irrigated
from the Danube, its flows would be reduced by no more than 20% in July, 11%
in September and 4% in October; these reductions would, however, leave suffi-
cient flows in the River to sustain international navigation.
7.        Water Quality.  The Danube water is potable and of good quality for
irrigation. Tests made during the past few years, on samples collected down-
stream of the project area show that it contains about 140 mg/l of total
suspended solids and has a pH value of 8.05. The salt content of the water
ranged from 90 mg/l to 120 mg/l.
8.        Water Rights.  The Danube is an international river with Romania,
Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Federal Republic of Germany and
Bulgaria as major riparians. Romania is the largest riparian, and also the
last country through which the Danube River flows before entering the Black
Sea. There is no international agreement between the riparian states for the
use of the Danube waters, but the International Water Commission for the
Danube River, of which Romania is a member, looks after the interests of its
member countries in respect of navigation and water quality. This Commission
is mainly concerned with such schemes which might interfere with either the
river's navigability or its water quality. Maximum diversion for the project,
being only about 1.5% of the minimum river flow in July, would not affect
navigation and therefore would not concern the Commission.
9.        Under Romanian procedures, a large water development project must
receive a clearance from the National Water Council, which manages all water
resources in Romania, before its construction can commence. This Council
has approved the use of Danube water-for this project.

VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Farm Budgets and Recovery of Project Costs
A. Farm Budgets
1.        All workers in the IASs are employees of the State and are paid
in accordance with the national wage scales for comparable labor. Currently,
the normal salary for an unskilled farm worker amounts to about Lei 1,200
(US$60.00) per month. Under a recently approved Government policy 1/, each
active member of the CAP is entitled to receive a minimum salary, currently
amounting to about Lei 1,000 (US$50.00) per month, which is paid only if
planned production is achieved. This means that the project would have lit-
tle or no direct influence on incomes to employees of IAS and members of CAPs
because the salaries of these workers can be increased only if the Government
revises the national wage scales. Despite the apparent lack of direct finan-
cial incentives, the farm workers would have other inducements to participate
in the project because failure to work properly according to Government
established criteria would involve (a) forfeiture of pay or reduction of
salary, (b) loss of supplementary wage for overfulfillment of plans, and (c)
loss of rights to individual plots (in the case of CAPs). Any farm worker
who may not wish to abide by these conditions would have limited alternative
employment opportunities because the conditions of work are about the same
throughout the economy, and the allocation of labor among alternative uses
is under the control of the State.
2.        Although the project would not have any direct influence on incomes
of employees in IASs and members of CAPs, it would increase the income to the
farm units by about 200%. To demonstrate this, farm budgets (Tables 1 to 5)
have been prepared for two CAPS (CAP I located in the Terrace where present
yields are relatively low, and CAP II located in the Flood Plain, where present
yields are relatively high).
3.        The following facts and assumptions have been considered while pre-
paring the farm budgets:
(a) Choice of Sample CAPs. Like most of the CAPs in the project
area, the sample CAPs have diversified agricultural activities
such as crop and livestock production. However, all agricul-
tural activities and the work force are divided into farms;
1/   This policy became effective in January 1977.  See Hotarirea Marri Adunari
Nationale Nr. 23/1975 (Official Bulletin of State Council, December 9,
1975).



ANNEX 9
Page 2
each farm keeps its own separate accounts. Only the farms
which specialize in crop production have been selected for
the farm budget analysis.
(b) Cropping Pattern and Yields. In the CAPs selected for the
analysis, the present cropping pattern is that which actually
exists in these CAPs. The present yields represent averages
for the last five years. The average yields in the Flood
Plain are higher than those in the Terrace because the mois-
ture deficit in the former is not as severe as in the latter.
In the future, the cropping pattern and yields in both CAPs
are assumed to be about the same as for the project area.
(c) Development of Output. Full development is assumed to be
realized four years following commencement of irrigation;
the rate of yield development in the sample CAPs would be
the same as for the project area.
(d) Annual Production Costs. Annual production costs which apply
equally for all farms, are in Table 6. These do not include
water charges and amortization of loans. Prices of inputs,
which have remained unchanged in the last ten years, are in
Table 7; there is no plan to change these prices in the near
future.
(e) Labor. The present and future demand for labor would be met
by the members of CAPs. There would be little additional
demand for labor during any given cropping year as most agri-
cultural operations are fully mechanized. During peak operation
period, especially during the weeding season, additional mandays
would be required but these can be easily satisfied by the
present labor force because underemployment is prevalent.
(f) Output Prices. CAP contract prices which are used to evaluate
outputs are in Annex 3, Table 1.
(g) Water Charges. Three types of nominal water charges are levied
on all CAPs and IASs which use irrigation water. These include
(a) a variable charge of Lei 18 (US$0.90) per 1,000 m3, which
is levied on the volume of water used; (b) a fixed annual charge
per hectare, which is levied on the basis of crops grown; and
(c) another fixed charge per hectare, which is levied on the
basis of the type of irrigation method used (sprinkler or fur-
row). The first two types of levies are applied uniformly to
all CAPs and IASs, but the third levy, which has been introduced
in 1976, is higher for IASs. The scales of the two fixed charges
are as follows:

On the basis of (a) project's cropping pattern, (b) annual
volume of irrigation water to be used, (c) distribution of
project area between CAPs (80%) and LASs (20%), and (d) type
of irrigation method (70% sprinkler and 30% furrow), the
average annual water charge from all users is estimated at
an equivalent of about Lei 350 (US$17.50) per hectare.
(h) Amortization of Loans. About 70% of the cost of on-farm
buried pipe distribution network and portable irrigation
equipment which would serve specifically the cooperative
farms would be financed through BAFI loans. Loans for the
pipe network would amount to about Lei 340 million (US$17.0
million) and those for portable irrigation equipment are
estimated at about Lei 90 million (US$4.5 million). The
loans would carry an interest rate of 3%, but the repay-
ment periods vary from 25 years including 5 years of grace
for the buried pipe network, to 8 years including 3 years of
grace for the portable irrigation equipment. Annual repay-
ment which would recover the principal and interest on the
loans are estimated at equivalents of Lei 230 (US$11.50)
per hectare for the pipe network and Lei 220 (US$11.00) per
hectare for the portable irrigation equipment.

project at full development, are summarized below:

Percentage Incremental Income                           240%               170%
The farm budgets show that after project charges, farm income to CAP I would
increase by about 240% and to CAP II by about 170%. The incremental income
to CAP I (on the Terrace) is higher than that to CAP II (in the Flood Plain)
mainly because present yields on the Terrace are lower than yields in the Flood
Plain. The farm budgets also show that the farm units would be able to meet
their debt obligations to BAFI, pay their water charges and be able to maintain
adequate cash to meet their operating expenses.
5.        In the case of CAPs, a major portion of the additional farm income
would be deposited with BAFI for use as a source of funds for financing future
investments in the CAPs (although the State has control over the ultimate use
of such funds); some would be used as a source of funds to finance various
communal programs such as social security, emergency and entertainment needs.
In the case of IASs, all of the farm income would accrue to various State con-
trolled funds (Annex 2). All risks associated with the project would be borne
entirely by the farms (in the case of CAPs) and by the State (in the case of



ANNEX 9
Page 5
IASs) rather than by the workers on these farms; the corresponding returns to
risk and entrepreneurship would also accrue to the farm units and the State
respectively.
6.        The estimated incremental incomes are attainable because (a) the
projected yields are reasonable, (b) supply of complementary inputs and ser-
vices is assured, and (c) the risk of not achieving project objectives is low.
There would be no serious problem of adapting to the irrigation technology.
The farmers, virtually all of whom are literate, have been receiving and
would continue to receive training in the theoretical and practical aspects
of agricultural production, including field trips to already irrigated areas.
Furthermore, irrigation would be applied under close supervision of trained
and experienced technicians who advise farmers on the timing and volume of
irrigation application, and on other aspects of irrigation and related
technology.
B. Recovery of Project Costs
Costs
7.        Investment.  Government would finance all project investments ini-
tially, but would transfer the cost of on-farm buried distribution pipeline
and portable irrigation equipment serving CAP lands to the concerned coopera-
tives. Of this cost, estimated at about Lei 600 million (US$30.0 million),
excluding price contingencies, about 30% would be contributed by the CAPs.
The remaining 70% would be treated as BAFI loan to CAPs and would be recovered
in accordance with existing on-lending terms, which are satisfactory. Simi-
larly, the cost of farm machinery, amounting to about Lei 300 million (US$15.0
million), without price contingencies, would be financed through the State
budget and recovered through unit rates charged for rendering mechanization
services. Of the remaining investment of Lei 2,010 million (US$100.5 million),
also excluding price contingencies, Lei 1,487 million (US$74.4 million) would
be chargeable to the CAPs and Lei 523.0 million (US$26.1 million) to IASs.
8.        Operation and Maintenance.  The annual operation and maintenance
cost is estimated at about Lei 157 million (US$7.8 million). This would be
financed by the State.
Recovery of Costs
9.        According to existing procedures in Romania, the only direct
mechanism for recovering irrigation project costs is through a nominal water
charge (para 3(g)). For the project area, this water charge is estimated
at an equivalent of about Lei 350 (US$17.50) per hectare. This would yield
a total annual revenue of about Lei 39.3 million (US$2.0 million) beginning
with year 3 of the project (1980) and a lesser amount before that year 1/.
1/   Excluding areas which are currently under irrigation.



ANNEX 9
Page 6
The present value of this recovery, over an assumed project life of 40 years
in constant 1977 prices and discounted at 10%, is estimated at about Lei 270.0
million (US$13.5 million). This would recover about 25% of the operation and
maintenance costs; it would result in a Cost Recovery Index of about 10%.
Details about the streams of costs and recoveries are in Table 8.
10.       In addition to the water charges, the State recovers project costs
indirectly through (a) annual profits made by IASs which are deposited with
various State controlled funds; (b) IASs' contribution to the Depreciation
Fund (Annex 2); (c) profits made by the State by buying tradeable commodities
at administered low farmgate prices and exporting them at much higher world
prices; and (d) general linkage benefits to the economy resulting from the
additional output under the project. The compulsory withholding by the
State of most of the income from the CAPs could also be considered as an
indirect mechanism of cost recovery, because these funds could be used for
investment anywhere in the economy (in the same way as incomes from IASs);
the State has control over the disposition of such funds.
11.       It is difficult to quantify the revenues which would accrue to the
State through the various indirect mechanisms. However, based on the farm
budget analysis above, the incremental farm income from CAPs and IASs, for
example, combined with the water charges, could result in a potential direct
and indirect Cost Recovery Index of 100%. This implies that (a) the direct
recoveries underestimate the revenues which would accrue to the Government
as a result of the project, (b) the direct and indirect recoveries could
exceed the expenditures of the State on the Project to enable Government
to undertake similar development projects in the future.
12.       Because of the socio-economic system in Romania, price of irriga-
tion water has little or no resource allocative or income distributive effect
in the country. The low water charge, which is in line with the generally
low prices of inputs and outputs, is unlikely to result in wasteful use of
irrigation water because the decision on the volume and timing of irrigation
water application is made by Government agencies (CELIF through its branch
offices) according to recommendations of concerned technical institutes.
Furthermore, the price of water can change only with a general revision of
agricultural prices because of the close inter-relationship among the various
prices. Since the additional farm income would not have a direct influence on
incomes of CAP members or employees of IASs, the apparent low water charge
would not mean a corresponding high income to the farmers and would not have
any effect on income distribution. Because of the above reasons, an increase
in water charge is neither essential nor recommended.

ANNEX 10

ROMANIA
VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Accounts and Audit
A. Project Accounts
1.        The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) would keep separate
accounts for all expenditures related to the project. Project investment funds
to be financed from state budget would be transferred quarterly to BAFI by the
Ministry of Finance for disbursements.
B. Audit and Control System in Romania
2.        To support its highly centralized decision-making process, Romania
has an elaborate control and audit system designed to keep the manager of the
economy advised on the progress of, and deviations from, planned activities.
This control system has three major objectives: (i) to audit accounts to en-
sure accurate financing status; (ii) to determine that resources are being
used in accordance with national plans; and (iii) to recommend desirable
changes in resource use.
3.        The system is organized like a pyramid.  At the top is the Court of
Superior Control, while at the bottom are accountants who check and approve
routine transactions at the enterprise level. The numerous organizations per-
form either "Internal Control" or "External Control". These controls can
further be divided into two broad categories: the preliminary control which
covers day-to-day transactions; and the posterior control which resembles
annual audits. Thus an enterprise, during a period of one year, is inspected
by (i) its own chief accounts officer; (ii) the internal controller, who
reports both to the general manager of the Central and Minister concerned;
(iii) inspectors from the financing banks, who report to the Ministry of
Finance; (iv) controllers from the Ministry of Finance; and (v) inspectors
from the Court of Superior Control.
Internal Control System
4.        Preliminary Control.  The chief accountant at each commercial unit
is responsible for checking and approval of all financial transactions. He
reports directly to the general manager of the unit and reports disagreements
to the manager of the supervising unit. To ensure the objectivity and inde-
pendence of the chief accountant, he is nominated by the supervising unit or
the Ministry concerned and cannot be changed by the management of the unit he
audits.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
5.        Posterior Control.  This is performed by special "Internal Control
Units" at least once a year for all enterprises, unless specifically exempted
by the Ministry of Finance. Such exemptions are given to very small units
which are audited once every 2-3 years. The audit involves a check of 14
items listed in Law No. 5 of 1970. Some of the checks are:
-    Inventory:  quantity, quality and value;
-    Payments, receipts, etc.:  their accuracy and validity;
-    Documents:  e.g. orders, checks;
-    Entries in accounting books:  their conformity to the rules
of the Ministry of Finance;
-    Status of assets and liabilities:  actual vs. book entries;
and
-    Techno-economic indicators:  e.g. productivity, input/output
ratios, etc. and their accuracy.
External Control System
6.        This audit function is performed by organizations outside the opera-
tional units such as banks, Ministry of Finance and the Court of Superior Con-
trol. This also involves preliminary and posterior controls. The preliminary
audit is performed by inspectors in each Ministry (or bank) and the posterior
audit by controllers from the Court of Superior Control.
7.        Four banks (BAFI, Investment Bank, Foreign Trade Bank and the
National Bank) monitor the "economic" use of investments in sectors they fi-
nance. These banks comment extensively on the desirability of an investment
before it is approved by the State, and supervise and certify the appropriate-
ness of investment work before releasing payments against supplies. Their
field branches exercise control on day-to-day transactions.
8.        The Ministry of Finance oversees the work of all ministries.  Through
its own controllers and by reviewing the reports of the Internal Controllers,
it ensures that actual performance conforms to the annual plan approved for
each Ministry, and that the accounts of the Ministry and the Centrals/Enter-
prises under it are maintained properly. The Finance Ministry reports its
findings to the Council of Ministers. Any expenditures exceeding the alloca-
tion in the annual plans approved for a Ministry/Central must be evaluated by
the Finance Ministry and approved by the Council of Ministers.
9.        The Court of Superior Control controls the main State bodies in
Romania such as banks and the Ministry of Finance. It reports directly to
the President of Romania. To perform its function, it receives the following
reports regularly:



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(i) quarterly reports from BAFI and other banks on their
financial status;
(ii) Finance Ministry's audit reports; and
(iii) annual internal control reports from each Ministry,
including recommendations made by Internal Controllers.
The court prepares its report annually and recommends on possibilities of
improving the economic use of resources. It also coordinates the overall con-
trol system and ensures that there is no waste or duplication, and acts as the
counsellor of the State Council.
Conclusion
10.       The existing accounting and auditing procedures in Romania are quite
strict and satisfactory. The continuous audit of different organizations in-
volved in project implementation would ensure that project funds, including
those which would be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan, would be
used properly.

VIISOARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
A. General
1.        The choice of this project, like other irrigation projects, is based
on the principle of efficient resource utilization rather than as a means of
raising incomes to project area farmers. The socio-political system of Romania
has income distribution mechanisms which would pass on the project benefits to
a much wider segment of its population instead of only to the project farmers.
The principal objective of the project, therefore, is to promote economic
growth by increasing agricultural production on an area of about 113,770 ha.
The main constraints to the agricultural growth in the project area are (a)
shortage of soil moisture in most years and (b) excess soil moisture in some
years. The soils are generally very good and the agricultural technology is
fairly advanced, but production is not expected to increase significantly in
the foreseeable future without irrigation. The main source of water for the
project would be the Danube River which flows at the project's southern
boundary.
2.        The project works would include construction of an irrigation and
drainage system to serve an area of about 110,290 ha; river training works to
benefit about 2,030 ha; and provision of farm machinery and operation and
maintenance equipment. The total cost of the project, including contingen-
cies, is estimated at an equivalent to about Lei 26,600 (US$1,330) per ha or
about Lei 79,300 (US$3,965) per worker. The project's main benefits are to
(a) increase agricultural production by about 115% (at domestic prices), (b)
prevent flood damages to physical assets and agricultural lands, and (c) to
double labor productivity from about Lei 12,870 (US$644) to Lei 27,670
(US$1,384). The project would also help to reduce instability in agricul-
tural production caused by frequent shortages of rainfall, ensure an addi-
tional supply of raw materials to forward-linked agro-industries, help to
earn or save foreign exchange, and would eventually help to raise national
income and real wages. Thus, the direct and indirect benefits of the project
on the economy would be substantial, and these benefits would be obtained at
moderate costs and low risks.
B. Economic Rate of Return
3.        The economic rate of return on investments in all project components,
based on quantifiable benefits, is estimated at about 14%. The rate of return
on investments in the river training works is estimated at about 11%. No



ANNEX 11
Page 2
separate rate of return on investments in drainage works has been calculated
because these works (and their benefits) are not independent of the irriga-
tion works. Costs and benefits have been computed over an assumed project
life of 40 years (Table 1). Other assumptions made in calculating the eco-
nomic rates of return are as follows:
(a) Investment Cost. Investment costs have been calculated using
prices prevalent at end of 1977. The cost streams exclude:
(i)  price contingencies, because all inputs and outputs
are evaluated in constant 1977 prices, and relative
prices are assumed to remain unchanged over the life
of the project; and
(ii) cost of farm machinery because this is reflected in
the annual production cost of mechanization services.
(b)  Implementation Schedule.  Project construction would commence
in 1978 and be completed in 1983 (Chart 17854). About 12,200
ha are presently irrigated, and about 98,100 ha would be newly
irrigated under the project. Irrigation under the project would
commence in 1981 and would be extended to all of the new area by
1983. About 3,480 ha (which are grown to pastures, grapes and
fruits) would continue to be under rainfed cultivation because
it is generally located on steep land unsuitable for irrigation;
only erosion works are provided for such areas. Cropped area
under irrigation and under rainfed cultivation during the period
of project implementation, is summarized below and detailed in
Tables 2 and 3.

1981                12.2            12.9            91.5     116.6
1982                12.2            45.2            62.3     119.7
1983                12.2           112.3             3.4     127.9
/1   Including double cropped areas.  By 1983 and thereafter,
the double cropped area (which is included in the newly
irrigated lands) would be about 14,200 ha.
(c) Cropping Patterns and Yields. In the future without the project
the cropping pattern would remain the same as at present (Table
4) but yields would improve by about 10% (Table 5). With the
project, areas under maize, vegetables, soybean, sugar beet and



ANNEX 1 1
Page 3
alfalfa would increase; areas under wheat, sunflower and vetch
would decline. Cropped area would increase by about 14,230 ha
because of about 13% increase in the cropping intensity. Peak
yields from any given area would be obtained in 4 years, follow-
ing commencement of irrigation, in increments of 30%, 70%, 90%
and 100%; the assumed yields would fully develop over the whole
project area in 6 years. Development of output in future with
project is in Table 6.
(d) Benefits from River Training Works. The total area which was
affected by floods from the Calmatui river in three out of the
last five years is estimated at about 2,030 ha. These floods
had a probability of occurrence of 20%. The proposed works
would protect the affected areas against floods with a prob-
ability of 5%. The benefits from the proposed works would
include (a) agricultural incomes which would have been lost
due to floods, (b) prevention of damage to physical assets
(houses, roadt and railroads), and (c) cost of adjustment
during rehabilitation of damaged areas. The last benefit is
difficult to quantify because of lack of data. About 1,470 ha
of the flood affected area is presently used t:o grow cereals,
vegetables, pasture and fruits. A part of the remaining 560
ha is occupied by houses, roads and railroad; and a part is
unproductive. Based on present cropping pattern and yields,
and on replacement values of physical assets, total damages
which could occur to crops and to physical assets is estimated
at about Lei 26.3 million (US$1.3 million). In future, damage
would be larger than at present on account of the expected
increase in the volume of agricultural production. Assuming
(a) the future cropping pattern and yields in the affected agri-
cultural areas would be the same as for the whole project area;
and (b) there would be no change in damages to physical assets;
damages which could be prevented by the proposed river training
works would be about Lei 34.9 million (US$1.7 million) in the
year of flood occurrence or an equivalent of about Lei 7.0 mil-
lion (US$0.35 million) per year over the assumed life of the
project.
(e) Prices of Outputs. Output prices which are used for economic
analysis are in Annex 3, Table 1.
(f) Prices of Inputs. Prices of inputs are in Annex 9, Table 7.
Non-tradeables (such as transport, machinery and miscellaneous
services) have been evaluated using domestic farmgate prices;
and tradeables (mainly fertilizers) using border price equiv-
alents. Since salaries of farm laborers are fixed by the
State and are about the same as salaries of comparable workers
throughout the economy, no shadow pricing of labor is con-
sidered necessary. Even if labor is shadow priced at a wage
rate different from the official rate, this would not have
significant influence on the economic rate of return because



ANNEX 11
Page 4
the labor component of annual production cost and the incre-
mental cost of labor are small compared to costs of other in-
puts as most agricultural activities are fully mechanized.
(g) Annual Production Costs. Annual economic costs of production,
based on border price equivalents of inputs, are detailed in
Table 7.
(h) Operation and Maintenance Costs. Annual costs of operation
and maintenance are detailed in Annex 6, Table 3. Electricity
has been valued at Lei 0.33 (USU1.6) per kwh.
C. Risk and Sensitivity Analysis
4.        Risk.  The risk of not attaining project objectives is low.  Design
of the project has been prepared in detail by the Institute for Land Reclama-
tion Studies and Design (ISPIF), the institute responsible for designing all
irrigation projects in Romania, including projects which have already been
successfully completed. The project would be constructed by the Construction
Trust for Land Reclamation Works of DIFCA, which has successfully constructed
other irrigation projects of similar complexity. The project cost has been
estimated using administered domestic prices which are not expected to change
during the period of project implementation. The Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irriga-
tion Project (the first Bank-financed irrigation project in Romania) is near-
ing completion as originally scheduled without any significant modification in
design or increase in cost. Based on past experience, therefore, the risk of
(a) changes in project design, (b) delay in project implementation, and (c)
increase in project cost estimate, would be unlikely.
5.        The projected crop yields are comparable to average yields obtained
from other irrigation projects in the region. The rate of yield uptake, which
is also based on experiences in other irrigated areas in Romania, is reason-
able because (a) Government has made adequate arrangements to supply the
essential complementary inputs, (b) farm managers and most farm workers have
been receiving and would continue to receive training in the theory and
practical aspects of irrigation technology, (c) irrigation and complementary
inputs are applied under close supervision of trained and experienced Govern-
ment technicians, and (d) the farm workers are expected to participate in the
project fully because failure to do so according to recommended farming prac-
tices would involve severe financial penalties. Therefore, the risk of not
attaining the projected yields within the time assumed is low.
6.        Sensitivity Analysis.  The critical unknown variables which could
vary the estimated economic rate of return are projected crop yields, their
rate of development and prices of tradeable commodities. The projected crop
yields are conservative when compared with yields obtained from other irriga-
tion projects elsewhere in Romania. But, even if we assume that yield of



ANNEX 11
Page 5
maize (the main crop) is reduced by 20% (which is unlikely), the economic rate
of return on the project would be about 11%. If the period of yield develop-
ment is increased from 4 to 6 years, the rate of return would be about 12%.
Reducing prices of all tradeable commodities by 20% would result in an economic
rate of return of 11%. 1/ The economic benefit streams with and without proj-
ect under various assumptions are in Table 8; results of sensitivity tests are
summarized below.

3,500 ha are scattered plots which are irrigated from various local and often
unreliable sources, and (c) the remaining 6,530 ha represent an existing
Zimnicea scheme which is irrigated from the Danube River. The rice and
alfalfa fields are not expected to benefit from the project, and the project
does not include works which are directly chargeable to these areas. The
scattered plots would benefit from the project because of an asssured supply
of adequate irrigation water, proper drainage, and additional farm machinery.
However, because of the difficulty of identifying project costs which are
directly chargeable to such areas, it has not been possible to estimate a
separate economic rate of return on investment in these areas. The Zimnicea
irrigation scheme would benefit from the project because of (a) improved
drainage and (b) increased supply of water to about 1/3 of the area, which
presently suffers from shortage. The economic rate of return on investment in
the drainage and associated irrigation works, which are directly attibutable
to the Zimnicea scheme, is estimated at about 30%.

(July 1975), the coefficient of variation of projected world prices of
cereals, oilseeds and sugar amount to 0.10 to 0.15.
