REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAIN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A SEEDS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic cf Ecuador for the equivalent of US$3.0 million to help
finance a seeds project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Ecuador:  Economic Memorandum" (No. 1033-EC)
was distributed to the: Executive Directors on February 26, 1976. Annex I
summarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.        With the first shipments of crude oil from the Oriente Region
in 1972, Ecuador became a net exporter of oil. This provided the country
with additional resources which at least temporarily removed the savings and
foreign exchange constraints that had severely impeded Ecuador's growth in the
past. Oil income rose from $38 million in 1972 to over $420 million in 1974.
However, during the last year it has become clear that the country's oil
wealth is smaller tharn previously estimated. One year ago, it was estimated
that the country had total -- proven and probable -- oil reserves equivalent
to 5.7 billion barrels. Current estimates are of only 2.5 billion barrels,
owing to a substantial decline in the calculation of probable exploitable
reserves. Moreover, it is now expected that the production levels projected
last year for 1976 will not be achieved until the early 1980s. These revised
estimates, together with a better knowledge of the difficulties to be en-
countered in the exploitation of Ecuador's untapped oil fields, and with the
transitory problems faced by the country's oil exports in 1974-75, indicate
that Ecuador is not likely to accumulate substantial amounts of foreign
exchange reserves in the foreseeable future.
4.        There has beten a sharp decline in petroleum output since mid-1974
because of marketing dlifficulties for Ecuadorian crude in export markets
and a protracted disagreement between the Government and the foreign con-
cessionaires over the taxation of oil exports. The total offtake of oil
dropped from an average of 232,000 b/d during January-June 1974 to 123,000 b/d
during the second half of 1974, and became irregular in 1975, owing to two
breaks in the trans-An!dean pipeline. For 1975, the average production is
estimated at about 165,000 b/d. There has also been a virtual standstill in
exploration during the past two years and the level of proven recoverable
reserves, estimated at: 1.5 billion barrels, has remained unchanged.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

5.        The disappointing performance of the petroleum sector had not been
expected by the Government. Counting on rising petroleum income, the Govern-
ment had adopted policies designed to stimulate further growth. It increased
public expenditures -- including subsidies of essential consumption goods;
offered more generous credit programs for agricultural and industrial invest-
ment; and lifted most quantitative import restrictions. In 1974, import
duties were cut by an average of 34 percent. Moreover, imports of agricultural
inputs and of essential foodstuffs were fully exempted from duties.
6.        The response of the economy to these policies, and to the prevailing
very optimistic economic climate was, in general, strong. Gross investment
grew by 22 percent in real terms in 1973 and growth of GDP at market prices
reached a rate of about 15 percent, far above historical levels (5.5 percent
from 1965 to 1970). Continuing rapid growth in industry, construction, trade
and Government services made it possible to achieve an overall GDP growth
rate of approximately 8 percent in 1974. This was obtained in spite of the
significant decline in the oil sector product, and of the virtual stag-
nation of agricultural production -- which was hampered, until early that
year, by the insufficiency of credit availabilities and by the inadequate
price policies followed up to then by the Government.
7.        The rapid economic expansion was accompanied by inflationary press-
ures. The cost of living index for low and medium-income families in Quito,
which had risen by about 8 percent per annum during 1971 and 1972, increased
by 13 percent during 1973 and by over 23 percent during 1974. While the
inflationary pressure was largely generated by the rapid rise of public
expenditure, the strong expansion of credit to the private sector also contri-
buted to the increasing money supply. Domestic supply could not respond in
full to the growth in demand, which led to higher imports of wheat, oils and
fats, and other products. In construction materials, domestic production did
not keep pace with increases in demand. In manufacturing, the process of
import substitution of finished goods accelerated, leading to rapidly rising
imports of equipment, raw materials and semi-finished products. As a result,
total imports of goods and non-factor services rose from about $440 million in
1972 to $515 million in 1973 and over $1.0 billion in 1974. This import
growth in part also reflects a rise in import prices of 17 percent in 1973 and
28 percent in 1974. Exports -- also including non-factor services -- expanded
from $365 million in 1972 to about $1.1 billion in 1974.     Of the inc ease,
about 75 percent was accounted for by petroleum.
8.         Despite the growth of imports, Ecuador's balance of payments showed,
until mid-1974, a marked improvement. In 1973, Ecuador achieved the first
surplus in its resource balance since the early 1950s, and net foreign ex-
change reserves rose from $128 million at the end of 1972 to $371 million by
the end of June 1974. However, these favorable trends could not be maintained
after mid-1974. As oil exports declined and total imports continued to rise
substantially, Ecuador's reserve position began to deteriorate rapidly. By
August 15, 1975, the country's net foreign exchange reserves had fallen to
$181 million, equivalent to less than two months' imports.

9.        Until 1974, increasing oil revenues brougnt about a substantial
improvement of the Government's financial position. For the Central Govern-
ment 1/ -- which received about 54 percent and 57 percent of total oil rev-
enues in 1973 and 1974 respectively -- these revenues led to a strong in-
crease in current savings and to an expansion of capital expenditure substan-
tially above the growt:h of current expenditure. With current savings rising
to about $68 million in 1973 and $298 million in 1974, the overall cash
position of the Central Government turned from a small deficit in 1973 to a
$62 million surplus in 1974, despite a more than threefold increase in capital
expenditure in 1974. FONADE, established in late 1973 in an effort to earmark
part of the additiona:L oil revenues for the financing of public investment
projects over and above budgetary allocations, disbursed about $93 million
in 1974. Most of these disbursements helped finance the construction of
the Esmeraldas refinecy, and the credit programs of the National Development
Bank and other financial institutions. As a result of the decline of oil
revenues, current savings decreased by an estimated 20 percent in 1975 despite
an improved performance of non-oil taxes. These developments led to a tem-
porary financing gap in the Central Government operations and to the decision
to contain the growth of Government expenditure in 1976.
10.       A number of recent measures have contained the deterioration of
the balance of payments, and foreign exchange reserves are estimated to have
totalled about $245 million at the end of 1975. The measures included a
reduction of the tax-paid cost of petroleum exports by the equivalent of about
US$0.43 per barrel; the concession of higher allowances to oil companies for
their production cost; and the introduction of import restrictions in August
and September 1975. Oil production has recovered, mainly as a result of the
cutback in the income tax rate on oil exports, and is estimated to have reached
over 210,000 b/d towards the end of 1975.
11.       On October 2, the Government announced new financial objectives
for 1976: to achieve additional increases in foreign exchange reserves and
a more balanced budgetary position, which would make it unnecessary for
the Government to borrow further from the domestic banking system or from
foreign commercial banks during 1976. The Government hopes to reduce the
annual rate of inflation from some 15 percent in 1975 to about 10 percent in
1976. Further negotiations with the oil companies are expected to open the
way to increased exploration and development efforts.
12.       Ecuador's cil production is now expected to increase gradually and
to reach about 270,OC00 b/d by 1979-80. An expansion beyond this level appears
feasible, provided that a vigorous exploration and development program can be
brought underway in the near future. Increasing export earnings from petro-
leum, coffee, sugar and manufactured goods, combined with a net inflow of
foreign capital in the order of $265 million a year during 1976-80 -- needed
1/   Including the National Development Fund (FONADE) and the National Parti-
cipation Fund.



- 4 -
largely to finance new gas and oil-related ventures -- should make a sub-
stantial improvement of the overall balance of payments situation possible
after 1976, and permit a moderate increase in foreign exchange reserves.
The extent to which Ecuador's balance of payments situation will actually
improve depends largely on the success of immediate stabilization policies,
the development of oil production, the behavior of oil prices, and the
mobilization of foreign capital.
13.       Although the oil sector will continue to be the major source of
foreign exchange in the medium term, there are considerable uncertainties
with respect to the possible production profile of this sector in the longer
run. Most of the oil likely to be produced until the early 1980s has already
been found. Unless exploration efforts are substantially stepped up and new
oil fields are discovered, production could decline soon afterwards. To make
the most efficient use of oil revenues, the Government therefore intends to
begin to diversify the production base of the economy by developing agricul-
tural and industrial activities in which the country has a potential compara-
tive advantage. Exports other than oil need to be developed -- for example,
natural gas, and agricultural and forest resources. An appropriate use
of the financial resources provided by oil will make it possible to alleviate
the country's most pressing social needs. However, Ecuador continues to
be one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with an estimated per capita
income of $450 in 1974, and a large proportion of the population living at
subsistence levels. Oil has only shifted Ecuador from the upper strata
of the poorest countries to the lower brackets of the middle income developing
countries.
14.       The Government several years ago designed an ambitious development
strategy. It is reflected in the 1973-77 Plan Integral de Transformacion
y Desarrollo and focuses on (a) promoting the diversification of the economy
by fostering agricultural and industrial development; (b) alleviating poverty
in the countryside through rural development programs; (c) upgrading social
services; (d) expanding infrastructure; and (e) improving the absorptive
capacity by overcoming major bottlenecks to development, notably the shortage
of qualified manpower and the administrative weakness of the public sector.
15.       To pursue these broad objectives, efforts have been made to improve
the investment capacity of the public sector. In 1973, a preinvestment
fund (FON --RE) was set up to finance prefeasibility and feasibility studies.
Inventories of projects and project ideas were compiled in the entire public
sector. Also the Government has been able to increase public investment
rapidly. However, progress has been slow in sectoral planning -- particularly
in setting investment priorities in some major sectors -- and in the coor-
dination of investments by region.
16.       Ecuador's development needs, as well as persistent structural and
institutional weaknesses, call for continued external assistance. Although
the country's creditworthiness has improved greatly, it would not be sound
policy for Ecuador to rely on the private capital market as the sole source



of external finance.   Neither the amouncs nor the terms available to Ecuador
in the market would make this advisable. Rather, a mixture of commercial and
official financing will best suit Ecuador-s needs during the next few years.
17.       Ecuador is creditworthy for further lending at Bank terms.     The ex-
ternal public debt outstanding on December 31, 1974 was estimated at US$530
million, of which US$297 million was disbursed. Service on outstanding pub-
lic debt is relatively moderate -- about $85 million in 1975, equivalent to
about 8.0 percent of the exports of goods and non-factor services. The debt
service ratio is projected to fall to approximately 4 percent in 1979-80.
The Bank/IDA share in outstanding and disbursed public debt as of December 31,
1974 was about 19.7 percent, it is exnected to rise.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
18.       Starting with the first loan in 1954, the Bank and IDA have made
twelve loans and six credits to Ecuador totalling US$150.0 million, net
of cancellations. At the end of January, 1976 the Bank and IDA held about
US$115 million, including about US$45.2 million not yet disbursed. The
IFC has made five loan and investment commitments in Ecuador, two in a large
textile companv and three in a development finance company, amounting to
USS4.3 million of which, as of January 31, 1976 US$2.7 million had been sold,
terminated or cancelled. In addition, IFC is considering a loan to help
finance the expansion of sugar production in the Guayaquil area and a plywood
mill near Esmeraldas. Execution of Bank Group financed projects has, on the
whole, been satisfactory, even though it has not been free of difficulties
often caused by the insufficiency of the country's managerial and technical
resources -- a constraint that still is a major obstacle for Ecuador's econo-
mic and social development. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of January 31, 1976, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       Bank and IDS lending were originally concentrated in transportation
and power, where therE: were substantial deficiencies to be overcome. These
two sectors still account, respectively, for about 25 percent and 10 percent
of total past lending. Most of the lending for transportation was to improve
the road network of the country, although one loan was made to help finance
a new port in Guayaquil (FY59). Lending for power has been concentrated in
improvin- generation and distribution facilities in Quito. The first live-
stock development loan (FY67) marked the beginning of a diversification of
lending; since then the Bank and IDA have made four more loans and credits
for agriculture and fisheries, two loans to support industrial development
through two development finance companies, two loans for education and one
loan for water supply. Bank/IDA assistance for the commodity producing and
social sectors account now for about 55 percent of total lending.
2o.       External development financing has also beci provided by IDB and
AID and, to a lesser extent, by other bilateral sources. External financ-
ing by sector and by source thlrough 1n74 is summarized below:

TDB is the largest single lender, having extended most of its loans to Ecuador
from the Fund for Special Operations, which has normally carried a 2 percent
interest rate, a ten-year grace period, and repayment terms of up to forty
years. It is likely that IDB will remain the major development lender in
the immediate future, although the terms will be less concessionary than in
the past. AID loans generally have had amortization and grace periods similar
to those of IDB, with interest at 2-3 percent. Education, health and other
socially oriented activities, as well as agricultural development, have
been receiving increasing attention from the external lending agencies in
recent years. IDB, AID and the Bank Group have coordinated their efforts in
these fields to assure the most effective use of all available resources.
21.       Bank lending is aimed at supporting the Government priorities
outlined in Part I above. This objective will be met by emphasizing pro-
jects that will help strengthen the institutional framework for development
policy -- particularly concerning project planning, preparation and imple-
mentation -- in agriculture and rural development, transportation and other
high priority activities. The highway project and the Second Port of
Guayaquil project, which are being processed for your consideration later this
year, will complete an important stage of the Bank's involvement in Ecuador's
transport sector. These two projects are designed to help the Government
establish the administrative mechanisms and technical procedures required for
designing and implementing appropriate policies and investment projects in the
sector during future years, while assisting also in the overcoming of some
major transportation bottlenecks.
22.       Beyond those two transportation projects, the current Bank program
is heavily concentrated on agricultural and rural development. The Bank can
undertake a major institution-building effort in these fields, which should
yield tangible benefits for Ecuador. Agriculture is, at the same time, the
most important and the most neglected sector of the Ecuadorian economy. Its
potential is far from being adequately realized and its low productivity is



- 7 -
a main cause of the extreme poverty in which most of the Ecuadorian popula-
tion still lives. The current Bank program includes a substantial support
of integrated rural development projects and important assistance for the
development of the country's agricultural potential. All projects pro-
grammed for this sector include sizable technical assistance components,
as a major part of the overall institution-building effort referred to above.
This is reflected particularly in the project that will be presented for your
consideration to aid Ecuador in the preparation of agricultural and rural
development projects, as well as this proposed seeds project. Other projects
in this sector which are planned over the next two years include one agri-
cultural credit, one irrigation and two rural development projects. Moreover,
most of the other prDjects currently under consideration -- for instance,
rural roads, rural electrification and agroindustries -- are also related to
the major objectives referred to above for agriculture and rural development.
/         .;~~ART III - THE AGRICULTURE SECIOR
v~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
23.       Agriculture is the mos    impo  ant secFor of the Ecuado/rian economy
in terms of output and employmen , and scnd oply to oil as a source of
foreign  xchange earnings.   It  as a    rge gro th potential, but it is also
the sec or with the most seriotusLin-st tu jonal!and social problems, and
the oneLI  - the poorest performance                   . The Government's
1968 Agricultural Census showed that one-third of farm holdings were less
than 1 ha, and that i:hree of every four fart$s were smaller than 5 ha.   The
same 75 percent of a:Ll farm holdings compri/sed only 10 percent of total
agricultural acreage. The r'esults of the y1974 census, currently being
analyzed, are not expected/to show any ma or change.     Partly as a consequence
of this situation, and of the relatively/low agricultural productivity, an
estimated 1.5 million persons (the poorei half of the rural population) had
per capita incomes in 1974 of less than the amount estimated to be needed for
basic nutritional requir/ements. Three-/fourths of the rural population earned
less than one-third of the national average annual per capita income.     By
contrast, the 1968 census indicated th&at the wealthiest 1;O percent of the
econ(omically active r1ural population received about 60 percent of agricultural
income.  This situatij n has been aggri avated by the virtual stagnation that has
prevailed in agricult-kre during recept years. Food production per capita
showed barely any increase in the eakrly 1970s and then slipped in 1973. The
overall rate of agri!cultural growth/was only 0.7 percent per year from 1972 to
1974. Real per capita GDP in agriculture diminished from 1969 to 1973 at an
average yearly rat 1,cf 2.4 percent    Since growth in other sectors was quite
strong at the sameTjtime, this tren4 has increased the difference between rural
and urban income ]evels, and has also widened the gap between the demand
and supply of agr.fcultural and livestock products. This resulted in serious
food shortages, significant inflationary pressures and a soaring food import
bill.
24.       Ecuador's agricultural potential is larg(- conugh to permit a pro-
nounced reversal of tlie disappointing treonds rofei rcJi LO 1bove.  The country



- 8 -          (
has a favorable endowment of the resources needed/for a varied and far greater
output.  There are sizable amounts of uncultivate    land, some in almost
completely unexploited zones, that could be devel ped for agriculture and
livestock.   Some events of the past decade -- the remarkably fast transfer of
_-~~ banana production from the Gros Michel to the Cav ndish variety; the return of
rice to the array of traditional exports; and the rq.^d cocoaawe sugar r4&
yields4+n 1974 -- all suggest a promising capability for achieving greater
agricultural output. This potential, however, will not be easily realized.
Over 40 percent of the unexploited arable land and grassland of Ecuador is in
the eastern Amazon area of the Oriente which is largely isolated and un-
inhabited. Another one-third of potential additional agricultural land is in
the Andean highlands where erosion and population pressures have constrained
growth possibilities. The remainder is in the coastal zone whose areas
with the best soils suffer from flooding and insufficient drainage. Further-
more, agricultural production in Ecuador has risen in the past by the exten-
sion of cultivated area rather than by the adoption of improved techniques.
U;tD /fn3,the agricultural sector has operated largely without the support of extension
services; of credit, storage and marketing facilities; and of improved seeds
and other inputs. Technological progess in Ecuador's agriculture -- parti-
cularly in small farms -- has, therefore, been very slow. As a consequence,
average national yields are lower than those in adjoining countries.
25.       The present Government has reacted positively to these problems
in its recent actions, reflecting its appreciation of the importance of
the future of agriculture. Since the beginning of 1974, the Government
has raised producer prices, increased the flow of credit, reduced import
duties on agricultural inputs, and reduced sales taxes on those intermediate
and capital goods used in farming to offset their rising costs. Producer
support prices were raised for rice, meat, milk, sugar, wheat and oil seeds to
counter the deterioration of farmers' terms of trade. The National Develop-
ment Bank -- which is receiving a large share of the country's oil revenues --
increased credit to the agriculture sector from $23 million in 1972 to $45
million in 1973 and $105 million in 1974. Moreover, a Seeds Corporation was
formed in 1973 to promote the production of certified seed. Agricultural
policy continued to improve during 1975. In January of that year, the
Minister of Agriculture announced an ambitious mechanization program and plans
to expand storage facilities while the Monetary Board made loans to agricul-
ture more profitable for the commercial banks than those to industry and to
the commercial sector. The Government also announced during the year its
intention to allocate to agriculture and rural development a higher share of
total public expenditure. At the same time, it has requested Bank technical
and financial support for several projects in these fields.
26.       On the whole, these policies seem to be in the right direction
and are already achieving some success, although they still need substantial
reinforcement. Overall agricultural production in 1974 was impaired by
massive increases in the import prices of machinery, fertilizer, and other
agricultural inputs. The prevailing poor weather, and some uncertainty among
landowners following the approval of the October 1973 agrarian reform law,
also made it difficult to achieve substantial progress toward solving the



- 9 -
main problems of the sector. Despite these negative factors, however, the
previous inadequate production trends have been partly reversed. During
1974, thiere was an increase in wheat production for the first time since 1969
(up 13 percent). At the same time, production of rice rose by 17 percent, of
cocoa by 50%, and of cotton by 65 percent. The preliminary data available for
1975 indicate that agricultural output for domestic consumption has increased
significantly with some crops such as cotton, corn, and rice providing sur-
pluses for export. Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the Government
on rural development has already made possible some progress toward an appro-
priate coordination of policies affecting the rural population. At the
same time, the Government has already started the preparation of several
integrated rural development projects. During the last year, the Bank staff
has been assisting the Government in these fields through several missions
which have visited Ecuador for that purpose. Further missions and the pro-
jected Bank operations cited in para. 22 are expected to contribute to greater
efficiency of the Government's investments in the high priority agricultural
and rural development fields. The Bank's involvement also would help to
underscore the need fDr, and to bring about additional constructive policy
changes at the sectoral and project levels.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
27.       The proposed project was prepared with the assistance of the FAO/
IRRD Cooperative Program. It was appraised in August 1975 by a Bank/FAO
team.  Negotiations were held from February 2 to    Febru.-; 3, 1976, at which
time the Republic of Ecuador was represented by a delegation led by Mr. M.
Calisto, Executive Manager of the National Pre-Investment Fund and included
representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture and Livestock, as
well as of the Seeds Corporation and the National Development Bank. An
appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Seeds Project - Ecuador" (964-EC) is
being circulated separately. A summary statement on the proposed project and
loan is contained-in Annex III to this Report.
General Description
28.       The proposed project is directed tc widening the scope of Government
activities in the production and distribution of improved seeds. Basic
seed production for several important crops began in Ecuador in the mid-
1960s, under the auspices of the National Agricultural Research Institute.
The multiplication and distribution of improved seeds by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock started shortly afterwards. This effort has already
yielded significant results. The existing seeds industry distributed about
3,400 tons of improved seeds of rice, hard corn, wheat and barley in 1974.
Although this already represents a promising beginning, that level was only
sufficient to plant about 14 percent of the national area for these food grain
staples of Ecuador. At the same time, more intensified research is needed
for the development of suitable varieties of soft corn, pastures and beans.



- 10 -
Moreover, a number of existing wheat varieties need to be replaced. As a
consequence, Ecuadorian farmers still mainly use their own seed, which is
generally of very low physical and genetic purity. This, combined with
limitations on other inputs, results in the very low yields which figure
significantly in the agricultural production deficiencies cited in Part III
above. Two years ago, the Government established the Seeds Corporation to
satisfy the need for a more concerted and better organized national seed
system. It subsequently requested Bank assistance for further improving that
system -- a request which led to the present project.
29.       The proposed project would help develop a modern seeds industry,
capable of producing and delivering substantial quantities of high-quality
seeds for most of Ecuador's basic food crops and pastures. It would provide
the means for strengthening seed research and development; field production
of certified seed; seed processing, storage and distribution; quality control
and regulation; and seed promotion. The emphasis of the project is on obtain-
ing better coordination among the present Ecuadorian institutions handling
portions of those activities, and in upgrading them. The crops included in
the project are important to improve food supply, reduce imports, and provide
exportable surpluses. At full development, the project would result in pro-
duction and distribution of some 8,800 tons of certified seed, £J to increasing
its availability for wheat, rice, hard corn and barley, and to making certified
seed available for the first time for soft corn, soybeans, other oil seeds,
beans and pastures.
30.       The proposed project would include the:
(a) Installation of three seed processing plants, including
storage facilities, for up to a total of 13,000 tons of
seeds. These plants would be equipped for weighing,
receiving, drying, conditioning, cleaning, grading,
treating, bagging, labeling, quality control testing,
and storing seeds;
(b) Expansion of storage facilities at the four research
stations responsible for providing breeder's seed and for
producing basic and registered seed, to handle an
additional 500 tons. In addition, the Boliche,
Pichilingue, Portoviejo and Santa Catalina stations
would receive basic testing equipment;
(c) Construction and/or improvement of seed warehouses;
(d) Provision of additional personnel and equipment;
1/   The term "certified seed" is used to define commercially marketed seed
originating from plant breeders' controlled genetic material which meets
standards of purity and quality.



- 11 -
(e) Establishment of a National Seeds Council for national
policy regulation and coordination; and
(f) Training of personnel in different aspects of the industry,
plus related technical assistance.
31.       The main objectives of the proposed project are consistent with
the Government development goals and also with the Bank lending strategy
referred to in Section II above. The project would make a substantial con-
tribution toward raising overall productivity levels in the agricultural
sector. It would increase the access of small farmers to the benefits of
using certified seeds, through the extended networks of distribution centers,
and, also, by making available for the first time certified seeds for crops
largely harvested in the country's poorest rural areas - e.g., soft corn and
beans. Mloreover, Bank support of the project would also include a substan-
tial technical assistance component, to help achieve the institutional im-
provements which constitute one of the major objectives of the project.
32.       The project is estimated to require four years to be completed.
It involves the creation of a National Seeds Council (NSC). The NSC would
be the highest authority on policy matters, and the coordinator of all public
organizations concerned with the seeds industry -- including the National
Agricultural Research Institute (INIAP); the Seeds Corporation (EMS); the
Department of Seeds Certification (DSC) of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
National Development Bank (BNF). The Council would establish national seed
supply targets; review and authorize release of seed varieties and planting
materials for seed muLtiplication and production; approve varieties eligible
for certified seed production; and propose to MAG, and as necessary draft,
changes in seed regulations.   As the Council would be charged with the
conduct of the projeci, a project unit would be established under its auspices
led by an executive director responsible for administering and coordinating
all project activitie, on a day-to-day basis. Members of the Council would
include the Mi..-èLter of Agriculture and Livestock (or his Director General) as
its chairman, and representatives of EMS, INIAP, BNF and the seed growers
association. The establishment of the Council, and the appointment of the
project unit Executive Director would be conditions of effectiveness of `t1i'
Loan (see Sections 6.01(a) and (b) of the draft Loan Agreement). To insure
the project unit's effLicient operation,  the proposed loan provides funds for
its initiation and operations, including the services over three years of an
expert skilled in commaercial seed processing who would serve as technical
adviser.
33.       The primary institutions involved in the national seeds industry
will perform the following phases of the project under the coordination of
the NSC:
Research and Basic Seed Multiplication
(a)  The National Agricultural Research Institute (INIAP) has
developed improved varieties of all major crops in Ecuador, and can main-
tain a regular flow oE breeder's seeds of additional new varieties. INIAP
would continue to be responsible for seed research and for producing



- 12 -
breeder's, basic and registered seeds. The INIAP experimental stations
would concentrate their research on the development of new varieties --
especially for such crops as soft corn -- to replace older, low-yielding
ones. INIAP's seed multiplication activities would be geared to producing
the quantities required for the project's goals.
Processing
(b) The Seeds Corporation (EMS) was created and will remain res-
ponsible for promoting the production of certified seed based on the regis-
tered seeds it purchases from INIAP. Its first year of operations was suc-
cessful in terms of recruiting seed growers and setting up marketing centers.
EMS' production activities would continue to depend on the well-established
system of contracting with selected seed growers in different regions. The
present force of forty registered seed growers (selected on the basis of their
competence, reliability, location, size, and availability of machinery and
irrigation facilities) would be expanded by EMS to approximately 100. To
handle the increased production, the project provides for the establishment of
three large processing and storage centers. Two would be in the Sierra
region, one south of Quito for wheat, barley and highland pastures, and one in
the Austral zone for soft corn and highland beans as well as wheat. The third
center is to be in Guayaquil for rice, hard corn, beans and oil crops. EMS
would distribute the certified seeds through its national network in 25 towns
and cities -- which would be upgraded by the project through the replacement
of nine aged warehouses and the construction of one new center. EMS will also
promote the use of certified seed, and the formation of a seed growers'
association.
Quality Control
(c) The Department of Seeds Certification (DSC) would continue
to govern the quality control and regulation of seeds which are prerequisites
for the proposed project to succeed. Since 1969, the DSC's main activities
have been field inspection and seed testing. It would remain in charge
of assuring effective quality control of all activities directed to the
production of basic, registered and certified seed. DSC already has made
a modest but satisfactory beginning in its inspection and regulatory work.
Under the project, its responsibilities would increase substantially as
seed testing methods would have to meet criteria established by the Inter-
national Seed Testing Association. DSC would also cooperate with EMS in the
establishment of four seed promotion centers. Since the technical level of
DSC's staff needs substantial improvement, the project includes specialized
training, the services of a seed certification consultant, and the recruitment
of additional professional staff for the project (six new field inspectors and
four new seed analysts).
Credit
(d) The credit needs of seed growers registered with EMS would
continue to be met by the National Development Bank (BNF) which is also



-1 3 -
channelling ATD funds to the growers of certified oil seeds. This Bank,
which is Ecuador's main agricultural credit instituLion, present]y lends
to seed growers for up, to 80 percent of total investment, at 9 percent
interest with up to seven years of amortization.    These favorabLe terms
reflect the high priority that thie Government has given to the production
of improved seeds in its strategy to raise agricultural productivity.
Assurances have been received that the BNF will continue to make adequate
provision for the credit requirements of seed growers (see Section 3.04 of
the draft Loan Agreement). Similarly, the BNF would ensure that credit will
be available to crop producers, including small farmers, for obtaining im-
proved seed.   This, arid the requirement that production loans to farmers be
tied to their purchasE of certified seed, would form an important component
of an expanded seed promotion progran (see Section 3.04 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
34.       Over the life of the proposed project, the EMS would be expected
to recover its full costs from the sale of certified seeds. To bring this
about, the Government intends to increase the current price of such seeds
and to maintain prices thereafter at a level-that will enable EMS to ea'rn
a 10 percent financiaL rate of return.    This would be sufficient to finance
all its operating costs and its debt service. The higher prices would still
permit substantial additional profits for the farmers who purchase the im-
proved quality seeds. Financial models show that there is a wide range
within which certifiedl seed prices could be increased and still remain ar,
attractive investment to farmers. Although the better quality of the new
seeds would more than compensate for their higher cost, the amount of the
price rise is likely t:o be kept moderately low in order to establish the
market and to maximize the incentive to farmers.      However, there is a pos-
sibility of some init:Lal farmer skepticism to the projected seed price
increase which might result in somewhat lower sales of seed than was pro-
jected and thus affect: EMS' finances adversely. In the light of these
circumstances, it was agreed that the NSC would review seed prices at least
once a year, and that the Government would adjust those prices and otherwise
aid EMS to obtain the agreed rate of return (see Section 4.05 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
35.       The overall cost of the project is estimated at US$5 million
equivalent including a foreign component of $3 million and local costs of
$2 million.  The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange
requirements.  The local costs of the project would be borne by the
Government ($1.15 mil:Lion) and the EMS ($850,000).
36.       The Government would relend up to $2.0 million of thie proposed
Bank loan to EMS for a 12 year period, including four years of grace, at
9 percent interest, to finance the portion of the project the Corporation
would carry out. The local costs of EMS investments would be financed by
its own resources, provided by the increase in its capital which was ap-
proved by its sharehoLders in August 1975. The Government would finance all
local costs for the parts of the project to be executed by other agencies.



- 14 -
Procurement and Disbursements
37.       All contracts for civil works and machinery and equipment for the
seed processing plants would be awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement, as
will the other machinery (notably basic testing equipment, a cleaner, scale
and bagging machine for the INIAP plants) and vehicles whose cost exceed
US$100,000. Equipment and civil works costing less than $100,000 would be
procured under local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
38.       Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan will be for (i) 100 percent
of the foreign costs of the processing and storage equipment for the EMS
plants; (ii) 40 percent of the costs of transport, assembly, installation
and test operations of the foregoing equipment (equivalent to the foreign
exchange component); (iii) 100 percent of the foreign costs of all imported
machinery, equipment and vehicles other than those required for the EMS'
plants; (iv) 40 percent of total cost of civil works (equivalent to the esti-
mated foreign exchange component); and (v) 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of consultant services and overseas training. Retroactive financing in
an amount not exceeding US$100,000 is proposed to cover the cost of consul-
tant services provided after January 31, 1976.
Benefits and Risks
39.       The benefits of the project consist of the incremental yields
derived from the use of certified, rather than ordinary seeds. These certi-
fied seeds have to be produced domestically, so as to be adapted to Ecuador's
diverse micro-climates. The yield increases expected as a result of the
project are 12 percent for soybeans, 20 percent for barley, corn and wheat,
and 25 percent for rice. These estimates assume no increase in the use of
fertilizers and other complementary inputs, and no other improvements in
farming practices. The larger scale, more progressive farmers are likely to
profit first from the provisions of certified seed. However, the seeds to be
produced include those for the crops usually planted by small farmers who
would also be assured of an improved availability of credit for seed purchases
(para. 33 (d)). Substantial numbers of small farmers therefore would benefit
as well. The project would increase the availabilities of certified seeds, up
to twice the current level, or 30 percent of total requirements. Based upon
the expected yield increases, the project's economic rate of return has been
estimated at 48 percent. Even if yields were to increase by only half of the
expected proportions, the rate of return would still be 16 percent. Moreover,
the additional agricultural production made possible by this project would
reduce the country's food import bill by more than $4 million in 1980. The
execution of the project does not entail substantial ecological risk. Some of
the institutional aspects -- particularly the coordination of all project acti-
vities and of related extension and credit facilities in the framework of the
National Seeds Council -- are fairly complex and would require a close
monitoring by the Government and by Bank supervision missions to ensure the
timely achieving of the project objectives in this respect.

PART V' - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft LoELn Agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are tieing distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Additional conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan are the
establishment of the NSC and the appointment of the Executive Director, as
well as the signing of an agreement between the Government and the National
Development Bank governing the use of project funds (see Section 6.01(c) of
the draft Loan Agreement). The draft agreement otherwise conforms to the
normal pattern of loans for such projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend l:hat the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

June 27, 1968; Effective Date: August 30, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is more than three years behind schedule because of
initial difficulties owing to inexperienced project staff, delays in recruit-
ing experts, and later because of shortages of counterpart funds. As a re-
sult of a reorganization in 1974, project administration has improved and the
project is now progressing satisfactorily. Twenty-three of 28 project schools
are now in operation. The Government has authorized funds to finance the
local cost component of the project. The Association has extended the
Closing of this Credit: until December 31, 1976 in order to conclude the
construction of the remaining five project schools.
Loan No. 555-EC   -  Fjsheries Project; US$5.3 million Loan of September 5,
1'68; Effective Date: September 4, 1969; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
This project. had a slow start owing mainly to institutional problems
and less than anticipated demand for the fishing vessels included in the project.
The project is now proceeding satisfactorily towards its scheduled termination.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Consultants are now concluding the final stages of the preparation of a
fishery training school, which should be opened shortly.
Credit No. 222-EC - Third Livestock Development Project; US$10.0 million
Credit of December 10, 1970; Effective Date: September
30, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. There was a slowdown in
lending from May 1973, when negotiations regarding changes in interest rates
for subloans were begun, until the issue was settled in May 1974. However,
the credit is now fully committed and is expected to be fully disbursed by the
Closing Date. The objectives of the project are being met, and the demand for
investments for subloans for beef and dairy development is good.
Loan No. 721-EC - Development Finance Companies Project; US$8.0 million
Loan of February 5, 1971; Effective Date: October 15,
1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
Disbursements are running slightly behind the original schedule, but
the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date (March 31,
1976).
Credit No. 286-EC - Third Power Project; US$6.8 million Credit of February
15, 1972; Effective Date: December 15, 1972; Closing
Date: May 15, 1976.
The generation components of the project were completed with excep-
tion of the Cumbaya by-pass which had to be redesigned to overcome geological
difficulties found while building the tunnel for the Nayon power plant. The
transmission and distribution components of the Project remain to be completed.
The beneficiary, Empresa Electrica de Quito, effected a tariff increase in
December 1975; approved new organizational statutes; contracted for an asset
revaluation study; and obtained a settlement of the outstanding debts of the
Municipality of Quito. On the basis of these actions, the Association agreed
to extend the Closing Date to May 15, 1976.
Credit 425-EC - Milagro Irrigation Project; US$5.5 million Credit of August
17, 1973; Effective Date: January 17, 1974; Closing Date:
August 13, 1979.
Civil works are proceeding on schedule although there has been some
delay in awarding bids for some project equipment. The arrival of a construc-
tion consultant has been scheduled to fit the expected arrival of the equipment.
Consultants have been retained to carry out the feasibility studies for a possi-
ble second project.
Loan 930-EC - Second Development Finance Companies Project; US$20.0 million
Loan of August 17, 1973; Effective Dates: COFIEC February 27,
1974; CFN March 4. 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.

Loan 1030-EC - Guayaquil and Guayas Province Water Supply Project; US$23
million Loan of July 23, 1974; Effective Date: January 29,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
DisbursemerLts have been considerably slow, owing to delays in
effectiveness and chatnges in management and engineering consultants. How-
ever, procurement is now under way. Lower than anticipated revenues and
cost increases are likely to create financial problems in the medium-term,
and the Bank has started to discuss alternative solutions with the Borrower
and the Government.
Loan 1157-EC - Vocational Training Project; US$4.0 million Loan of September 3,
1975; Effective Date: November 24, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction of
the first phase of the Guayaquil vocational training center has commenced and
the equipment provided for this phase by the Federal Republic of Germany has
been delivered. Design work for the remainder of the civil work is about half
completed. Furniture and equipment lists are under preparation.
