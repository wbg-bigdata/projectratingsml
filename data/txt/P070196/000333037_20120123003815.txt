1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Since 1997, Gabon has been experiencing a gradual decline in oil output because its current oil fields
are aging and the government is aware that oil dependency is no longer a feasible policy option for
Gabon. It is also aware that no single alternative resource can be exploited on a sustainable basis at a rate
capable of offsetting the projected shortfalls in petroleum revenues. In view of these constraints, the
Government of Gabon is taking steps to diversify sources of growth and employment. Promising areas of
economic diversification include mining, forestry, and fisheries, as well as new sectors like tourism,
information and communication services, and technology. It was projected that a more efficient
management of the forests, fisheries and mining sectors, along with the expansion of rubber and agri-
business sectors, could boost the non-oil GDP growth rate from 2.3 percent in 2004 to 3.5 percent on
average from 2005 to 2008 and that the expected gains from non-oil sectors would somewhat offset the
declining oil production (to achieve an average GDP growth of about 1 percent during the same period)1.
Gabon will also need to ensure the sustainability of its natural resource base and protect the environment.

2. To foster shared and more diversified growth, Gabon’s challenges consist of: (i) improving efficiency
and equity in the use of the country’s resources, both natural and financial; (ii) diversifying the economy
by improving the investment climate for responsible private sector development; and (iii) improving
governance, through improved transparency and accountability in the use of its resources and public
service delivery. The management of natural resources is central in this agenda.

3. The baseline situation in the main natural resources sectors (forest, biodiversity and environment,
fisheries, and mining/oil), covered by the NRM-DPL, is presented below. The baseline situation refers to
the beginning of 20042, when the reform process was set in motion about one year before Appraisal of the
operation, and was covered by the Letter of Development Policy (Forestry, Fisheries, Biodiversity and
Environment).
    Forestry: the baseline situation can be characterized as follows: (i) allocation of commercial forests
    was made exclusively on an administrative basis and no plan existed for shifting to a more
    competitive and transparent allocation system; (ii) the list of concessions, the names of
    concessionaires and their position in relation to fiscal, environmental and other legal obligations was
    highly confidential information which could not be disclosed to the public or development partners;
    (iii) the spatial distribution of logging rights were unorganized and resulted in many overlaps; (iv) the
    Government was inclined to maintain the monopoly of the national timber marketing company
    (Société National des Bois Gabonais or SNBG) despite the increasingly strong opposition of the
    private sector; (v) the tax regime remained largely unapplied and recovery rates were low3; (vi)
    progress made on sustainable forest managements plan was very limited with a low engagement of
    the operators and a lack of commitment from the Government; and (viii) the credibility of control
    operations undertaken by the Ministry of Forestry was low. Given the limited transparency in the
    sector, it was also felt that Gabon’s governance efforts would not be recognized domestically and
    internationally, unless a third party was associated with control operations.

  Extract from the Macroeconomic Outlook section in the Project Document

  The Project Document refers to 2004 as the baseline situation as it was considered that the DPL operation started
setting in motion the reform process on that year.
3
  As of January 2004, the Government had been able to recover less than 10 percent of the forest revenues for 2002
and 2003. As of January 2005, following improved tax collection discipline during 2004, it had recovered 30.6
percent of 2002, 2003 and 2004 tax arrears (US$8.9 million out of US$27.3 million).

                                                        1
    Biodiversity and Environment: Gabon is endowed with huge biodiversity wealth and the President
    created a network of National Parks to support biodiversity preservation in 2002. However, the
    national parks are not immune from economic activities (mainly logging and mining). Improvements
    in the legal framework related to environmental management were made in the 1990s and beginning
    of the 2000s, in particular through the adoption of an Environmental Framework Law (“Code de
    l’Environnement? Law 16/93 of August 26, 1993) and subsequent implementing regulations
    including a decree on environmental impact assessment (Decree 405 of May 15, 2002). However,
    systematic enforcement of these provisions was still lacking.

    Fisheries: The fisheries sector was marked by a weak policy and governance framework, especially
    with regard to industrial fishing. The knowledge base on fish stocks remained largely unknown.
    There was little transparency in licensing and collection of fees, and little capacity for monitoring and
    control. List of licenses and international agreements were not made public. Because of limited
    institutional capacity, the Fisheries Department4 only relied on unilateral declarations from
    companies. The number of boats operating in Gabonese waters was not monitored. Illegal fishing was
    believed to be important, but quantitative information was missing.

    Mining and Oil: Although the mining/oil sector is a potential source of growth for Gabon, its
    contribution to economy was below potential at the time, in terms of production and employment. A
    number of constraints explain the underperformance of the sector including: (i) contradictions
    between the Mining Law, regulations and contracts; (ii) lack of security of mining titles; (iii)
    inconsistencies in the fiscal regime and (iv) lack of environmental and social policy, laws and
    guidelines, combined with the lack of capacity to monitor mining project impacts. In a context where
    declining oil revenues increase incentives for the Government to expand mining production, these
    weaknesses –and specifically the latter- may deprive the country and the local populations from
    important benefits and may cause severe environmental damages (incl. water pollution, land
    degradation).

4. Rationale for Bank assistance. The Bank’s involvement in the NRM-DPL built upon the support
provided to the forest sector and the environment through the Forest and Environment Project (Projet
Forêt Environnement – PFE) which closed in 2002. The PFE helped improve knowledge base on
Gabon’s forest resources; it also helped prepare the 2001 Forest Law and strengthened technical
capacities of the Ministry of Forest (also in charge of Environment). While the project was rated
satisfactory, the OED indicated that its sustainability was unlikely as structural governance issues were
persisting in the forestry sector.


5. At that time the World Bank was also developing policy-based lending for environment and NRM
sectors in Cameroon as well as policy analytical work in the other countries of Congo Basin. During
preparation of the operation (in 2004), it was thus decided to shift from a Sector Investment Lending
approach to a Development Policy Loan (DPL). This instrument was aimed to overcome these systemic
weaknesses in the forestry sector through a well-structured reform agenda. It was also considered that the
reform agenda should be extended to other critical Natural Resources sectors (fisheries, mining) to
unleash their potential contribution to growth in a context of declining oil resources. Environmental
monitoring of economic activities was also central to the overall NRM reform package.

 At that time, the Fisheries Department was under the Ministry in charge of Forests. It is now under the Ministry in
charge of Agriculture (Government reshuffling in November 2008).

                                                         2
6. The support was designed as a programmatic DPL, with two successive operations: the DPL-1 with
two tranches (US$15 million) and the DPL-25 with a single tranche (US$10 million). It was also decided
that a separate GEF-financed operation (US$10 million) would be prepared and implemented
complementarily to the DPL and would focus on capacity building of the National Agency in charge of
the National Parks (Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux6 – ANPN, under creation at that time) as well
as on the community participation in the park management. The World Bank has closely coordinated with
the other partners involved in the targeted sectors to ensure strong synergies (See Section 3.1 on
Relevance of the operation Design and Section 5.1 on Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry).

7. This ICR covers only the DPL-17 and for the purpose of the report, the operation will be referred to as
NRM-DPL.
1.2. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8. The development objectives of the proposed operation are to increase the contribution of natural
resources to national income, and to help reduce the country’s heavy dependence on declining oil
resources while protecting the resource base and improving management efficiency (as per para. 66 of the
Project Document8).

9. The Outcomes and Medium-term objectives of the operation were presented in the Annex 2 of the
Project Document (see Box 1).

Box 1– Outcomes and Medium-term objectives of the NRM-DPL operation (as per Annex 2 of the
Project Document)
Overall framework
   Previous progress is consolidated, and further steps enjoy continued political backing
   Regular budget, financial management and procurement procedures become operational at Ministry of
  Forestry and Ministry of Mining serving as pilots for other sectors.
Forests
    80% of remaining concessions are under management plans, compared to less than 30% at start of the
   program
    80% of forest area tax is collected, compared to about 30% at start of the program
    Non-compliance with environmental, social and fiscal rules ceases to be an attractive option. Improved
   business confidence leads to additional job creation in the processing sector
Biodiversity / Environment
    10% of Gabon’s territory is under effective national parks status with a secured legal and institutional
   framework
    Social and environmental impacts of mining, fishing and forest programs are monitored. Public
   consultation and collaboration with civil society are improved.


Fisheries
    Basic transparency and knowledge-base are in place to inform public debate on modernization of

  As per the Project Document, the DPL-2 was to be presented to the World Bank in FY08, however, it never
materialized.

  The ANPN was officially established with the Law on National Parks (law 003/2007) promulgated on September
11, 2007.

  This ICR does not cover the GEF-financed operation that is still under implementation and is planned to close on
June 30th, 2013. A separate ICR will be prepared for this operation.

  It is however worth noting that the development objectives of the operation are presented with different language
in different sections of the Project Document.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

10. Four policy areas were supported by the NRM-DPL.
    Policy Area 1 – Forests: The NRM-DPL was building on long engagement of the World Bank in the
    forestry sector and specifically intended to support Government to: (i) review all logging permits,
    (ii) repossess those that were in the hands of non-compliant companies and individuals, (iii) step up
    the enforcement of fiscal measures and the obligation to prepare sustainable forest management plans,
    (iv) strengthen forest controls in the field, (v) change the mode of access to permits from
    discretionary to transparent and competitive, and (vi) adopt new transparent and competitive
    allocation procedures, and (vii) cancel the monopoly held by the SNBG on the sale of the major
    timber products.
    Policy Area 2 – Biodiversity and Environment. The NRM-DPL intended to support Government to
    (i) create an appropriate legal framework that would regulate National Parks (law on National Parks);
    (ii) to address overlapping of mining and forest concessions within Parks and protected areas,
    (iii) strengthen the Government’s capacity to systematically monitor environment impacts of
    economic activities.
    Policy Area 3 – Fisheries: The NRM-DPL was the vehicle for the Bank to engage in the fisheries
    sector in Gabon; it intended to support Government to: (i) enhance knowledge of the country’s
    fisheries resources, (ii) improve transparency of licensing and collection of fees, and (iii) improve the
    monitoring and control system to protect over-exploited species and marine areas under protection
    status.
    Policy Area 4 – Mining and Oil. The NRM-DPL intended to support Government to (i) support the
    Government’s commitment to enhance transparency in oil sector through its adhesion to EITI, and (ii)
    enhance its capacity to ensure mining development that takes into environmental and social
    dimensions.
1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

Not applicable
1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

11. The only significant change relates to the institutional set up. At the time of the preparation and
negotiations of the NRM-DPL, line ministries (in charge of Forestry, Fisheries, Mining) were identified to
be in charge of their respective components consistent with their mandates and expected to coordinate
fulfillment of the prior actions/conditions for the release of the successive tranches. This proposed


                                                      4
institutional set up proved to be inefficient and soon after NRM-DPL negotiations and effectiveness of the
operation could only be achieved after intervention by the Prime Minister’s Office.

12. In 2007, the Government thus took the decision to formally establish a coordination mechanism under
the Prime Minister’s Office and to designate a high-level civil servant with the rank of advisor to the
Prime Minister as overall coordinator of the NRM-DPL. An inter-ministerial committee was immediately
set up by the DPL Coordinator.

      waters to operate a satellite-based geo-positioning system connected to the Fisheries Department.
      (xi) Formal expression of interest of the Government of Gabon to adhere to the Fully achieved
      EITI initiative.
      Comments: The Government of Gabon had expressed its agreement to participate to the EITI prior
      negotiations of the operation. In addition, a letter was sent to the World Bank Managing Director on July 28,
      2004, that formally confirmed the Government’s commitment to implement the EITI. In December 2005,
      the Government of Gabon published its first EITI report, which covers information for 2004.
                          Tranche 2 (Triggers, as per Legal Agreement11)12
             List conditions from Legal Agreement/ Program Document                                   Status
      (i) A satisfactory financial audit of all expenditures made under the first tranche       Fully achieved
      of the Loan has been completed under terms of reference and by an auditor
      satisfactory to the Bank.
      Comments: A financial audit of the expenditures made under the first tranche of the Loan has been
      conducted by the auditing firm Price Waterhouse Coopers, under terms of references jointly agreed by the
      Borrower and the World Bank. The financial audit confirms that: (i) all the expenditures made under the
      first tranche of the Loan were in line with the provisions of the inter-ministerial regulation establishing the
      flow of funds procedures from the Central Bank (BEAC) to the line ministries; and (ii) all the expenditures
      were used in accordance with the annual work programs prepared by the line ministries.
      (ii) Prior Actions undertaken by the government prior to the negotiations of this         Fully achieved
      Agreement have been continuously implemented, satisfactory to the Bank.?
      Comments: The prior Actions undertaken by the Government that triggered the release of the 1st tranche of
      the NRM-DPL have been sustained by the Authorities in a satisfactory manner (cf. Tranche Release
      Document, dated June 16, 2011).
      (iii)-a. The Government has approved, rejected or requested additional                    Fully achieved
      information on all forest management plans within six months after their
      submission on the basis of technical justification in line with forest management
      regulations prepared in consultation and in agreement with the Bank.
      Comments: the Ministry of Forestry has adopted technical guidelines against which the management plans
      submitted by the private operators are assessed. These guidelines clearly define the criteria set up under the
      articles 21 to 23 of the Forestry Code (Law 016/0) adopted on December 31st, 2001.
      Over the period 2001-2011, the Forestry services have received 29 management plans: as of June 2011, 19
      had been reviewed and approved in a period of less than 6 months (average period of 4 months); 5 had been
      technically validated and were to be formally approved by the Minister and 5 were under review. During the
      2007-2011 period (NRM-DPL period), the rhythm of submission of the management plans has significantly

     increased and during 2010 alone, 10 management plans were submitted.
     (iii)-b. The Government has enforced the forest fiscal regime set forth in law           Fully achieved
     15/2003 of December 30, 2003; has agreed with the Bank prior to submitting any
     amendment to this fiscal regime; and has cancelled all forest permits that did not
     comply with the area tax by the end of each fiscal year.
     Comments: No change to the fiscal regime was made during the period of the operation. The Ministry of
     Forestry and the Ministry of Finance have worked hand-in-hand over the past three years to better identify
     the forest titles that are not in compliance with the the Forestry Law and/or Fiscal Laws. As a result, many
     forest titles have been cancelled and the areas involved returned to the public domain over the past 4 three
     years: (a) May 2007: 116 titles13 (1.8 million ha), (b) October 2008: 56 titles14 (553,243 ha), (c) August
     2009: 87 titles15 (1.5 million ha) and (d) June, 2010: 63 titles16 (889, 000 ha).
     (iii)-c. The Government has recruited an internationally-recognized third-party          Fully achieved
     observer to assist the Borrower’s MEFEPEPN in monitoring logging activities,
     and to ensure public information on forest control and penalties, under terms of
     reference and through a selection process undertaken in consultation and in
     agreement with the Bank
     The Ministry of Forestry has recruited, on a competitive basis, a international firm to serve as a third-party
     observer to assist in monitoring logging activities and ensure public information on forest control and
     penalties. The firm has been selected on an open competitive basis. The Terms of References were jointly
     prepared by the Ministry of Forestry and the World Bank and cover the following activities: (i) Clarification
     of the control procedures/tracking system; (ii) Capacity building of the forest control services and
     acquisition of equipment; and (iii) Participation of other stakeholders in forest control.
     (iii)-d. The Government has adopted transparent procedures and criteria for the          Partially achieved
     auctioning of forest permits, and a participatory three-year plan for future forest
     permits and concessions, in consultation and in agreement with the Bank.
     Comments: the rules governing the procedures and criteria for the auctioning of forest permits were adopted
     on October 8, 2008 with the issuance of two regulatory texts: (a) a Decree establishing the auctioning
     modalities and (b) a Decree defining selection criteria for bidders and evaluation procedures The first
     auction was organized during the second quarter of 2009 and resulted in the allocation of 127 titles, covering
     an area of about 1.37 million hectares. No specific issues were reported with respect to implementation of
     the new auctioning procedures.
     A partial waiver was requested for the “three-year plan for future forest permits and concessions? conditions
     as it could no longer be met under the current circumstances: The Government’s adoption of a “log export
     ban? in November 2009 hampered the Government to meet this condition. This measure aimed at promoting
     in-country processing in order to create employment and generate value-added on the territory. However,
     enforcement of the new measure requires inter alia inventories (both forest and processing capacity
     inventories) to ensure alignment between the forest production and the processing capacities and to reduce
     risks of illegal logging. While the inventory on processing capacity has recently been completed, the
     Government of Gabon has just initiated a country-wide inventory of forest resources. The Government of
     Gabon has formally indicated that no new allocation of forest titles would be launched before the forest
     inventory is completed (Letter from the Minister of Forestry to the World Bank, dated December 20, 2010).
     (iii)-e. The Government has completed the restructuring of the SNBG, which will          Fully achieved
     not be entrusted with monopoly nor regulatory function and will not overlap
     with public bodies’ mandates, in consultation and in agreement with the Bank
     Comments: The SNBG has completed its restructuring process, covering the following dimensions:

         target set by the Council of Ministers (Decision adopted in November 2006) which was 165 agents.
         Financial restructuring: at the beginning of the process, SNBG’s debt (both private and public) was
         estimated at US$ 4 million. At the end of 2010, the debt was entirely reimbursed and the SNBG
         presented a positive net result of US$ 6 million. As a result, SNBG’s capital has been reconstituted
         and now amounts about to US$ 2 million.
         Juridical restructuring: SNBG’s articles have been revised to reflect its new mandates and have
         been submitted to the new Board for adoption.
SNBG’s new management has elaborated a robust strategy that competitively positions it in a free market,
and is articulated on the following pillars:
         Expanding SNBG activities to timber processing and wood production (vertical integration);
         Strengthening the export opportunities, mainly to Asian markets; and,
         Supporting national operators (SNBG aims at federating the national operators through the
         provisions services that could be performed more effectively by a specialized structure).
(iv)-a. The Government has continuously implemented the PSFE social and Achieved in
environmental management plan, in consultation and in agreement with the substance
Bank;
Comments: The PSFE (Programme Sectoriel Forêts Environnement), which was under preparation when the
Loan Agreement for the NRM-DPL was signed, never materialized and the programmatic approach was
abandoned in 2008. Nonetheless, the implementation of the pillars described in the Environmental and
Social Management Plan (ESMP) of the PSFE (and in the Letter of Development Policy dated 2004 ), was
pursued by the General Directorate of Environment (DG-Env): the DGE and the World Bank jointly agreed
on an Action Plan on November 2008, that reflected the major pillars described in the Policy Letter, more
specifically: (a) Preparation of a New Code of Environment, (b) Environmental monitoring of the economic
activities (including enforcement of compliance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations) and
(c) Training and sensitization of civil servants and other stakeholders (NGOs, private sector) on
environmental issues and related regulations. Despite the fact that the PSFE materialized, the actions taken
by the DG-Env. to implement the above plan, adequately covered the actions originally planned under the
ESMP.
(iv)-b The Government has conducted or caused to be conducted a socio- Fully achieved
environmental impact assessment prior to any new industrial mining project
under terms of reference developed in consultation and in agreement with the
Bank
Comments: during the operation period, only two new industrial mining projects have been launched:
(i) the Mont Bembelé Manganèse mine in Ndjolé): the EIA report has been prepared by the industrial
operator and submitted to the DGE in December 2008. The conformity certificate was delivered by the DGE
on March 2010.
(ii) the Moanda Metallurgical complex in Haut Ogoué: the Terms of Reference for the EIA were validated in
June 2009 and the final EIA report was submitted to the DGE on May 2010. The EIA is under review by the
DG-Env...
The relevant documentation related to these two projects has been forwarded to the Bank and been deemed
satisfactory.

                                                                                          Fully achieved
(v). The Government has completed a socio-economic and environmental review
of the industrial mining sector, under Terms of Reference and following a
selection process implemented after consultation and in agreement with the
Bank.
Comments : A strategic socio-environmental review of the industrial mining sector has been conducted by a
renowned firm under Terms of Reference validated by the World Bank in September 2008. The review has
provided strong analytical background that is currently being used by the Government as it is in the process
reforming of the mining sector, particularly through the revision of its Mining Code. The review particularly
contributed to : (i) an in-depth analysis of conflicting land-uses in Gabon, (ii) the identification of “growth
corridors? for the mining sector, and (iii) an assessment of environmental and social dimensions of the

     mining sector
     (vi)-a. The Government has designed and enforced conservation measures aimed             Fully achieved
     at protecting and/or restoring populations of fish in over-exploited and/or fragile
     marine areas of the Gabonese Republic.
     Comments: In November 2008 it was jointly agreed between the Government and the Bank that this
     Condition would be articulated around the 3 following concrete actions on the ground: (i) Integral coverage
     of the national and foreign industrial fleet with the VMS, (ii) Enforcement of seasonal closure and (iii)
     Enforcement of the fishing ban in the National Marine Park of Mayumba. All three actions have been
     implemented in a satisfactory manner.
     In addition to these actions, the Department of Fisheries is now leading a coordination effort with the
     different entities involved in monitoring and control activities at sea (including Agence Nationale des Parcs
     Nationaux, and Ministry of Defense, i.e. Marine Marchande and Gendarmerie Maritime) to develop a
     nationwide master plan for monitoring and control activities at sea.
     (vi)-b. The Government completed a socio-economic and environmental review Fully achieved
     of the industrial fisheries sector, under terms of reference and following a
     selection process undertaken in consultation and in agreement with the Bank.
     Comments: The socio-economic and environmental review of the industrial fisheries sector has been
     conducted under Terms of Reference prepared by the Fisheries Departments and approved by the Bank in
     July 2008. The selection process was deemed fully satisfactory. The review has provided strong analytical
     background (including a diagnosis of the current fish stocks) to help the Government define the policy and
     institutional reforms necessary to increase economic benefits to the country while ensuring sustainable
     management of the resources.
2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

13. As illustrated by the table below, this operation encountered major delays (more than 10 years
between the concept review and the closing). The effectiveness deadline was extended twice (by 15
months) as well as the closing date of the operation (by 18 months). The section below analyses the
reasons for such delays.

        Preparation – Change in instruments (from SIL to DPL)
14. As explained in Section 1.1, the operation was initially designed as a SIL. After a lengthy process
(2001-2004) involving consultation with stakeholders (donors, NGOs and academia) and based on
analytical underpinnings17, it was decided that the World Bank would rather focus its assistance on policy



17
   Various studies were conducted at the time of preparation: Fiscal framework in forestry sector, Institutional
review and law enforcement in forestry sector, Diagnosis of mining/oil sector, Survey of industrial fisheries sector,
National-wide Biodiversity survey, Environmental and Social impact assessment of the PSFE (incl. ESMP),
Fiduciary risk assessment...

development instrument. This shift of instrument18 occured three years after the launch of the operation
preparation, when the quality enhancement review was already held: however, it did not trigger a change
in the quality review process of the operation. This shift has significantly delayed preparation and has also
caused major weaknesses in the project design (as explained in the section 5.1 (a)).

15. A sector level fiduciary assessment was conducted as part of the preparation process and concluded
that the DPL operation could only be feasible if associated with mitigation measures, including the
adoption of rules governing the use of the DPL proceeds and the opening of a dedicated account for the
operation proceeds. For the Bank team, in addition to the overall weakness of the public financial
management system and associated fiduciary risks, the rationale for this measure came from the fact that
the Government budget was constrained and it was assumed that, the Ministries and agencies involved in
the NRM-DPL could be negatively impacted by a lack of budgetary resources or allocation of insufficient
resources. The prior action “Preparation of the rules governing the procedures applicable to the flow of
funds for this Loan?, including the establishment of the Dedicated Account, was meant to avoid these
potential difficulties. As such, the NRM-DPL is seen as an “hybrid? instrument as it maintained some SIL
elements (fiduciary requirements).

         Effectiveness – Tense dialogue between the Government and the Bank
16. As per the Legal Agreement, prior actions were to be met before Negotiations. Since during
Negotiations, two prior actions were not fully met19, they were reformulated and two effectiveness
conditions were added20, namely:
    (i) The Borrower has contracted financial management specialists to assist the Ministries of Forestry
            and Mining in developing and managing their budgets in compliance with Terms of
            Reference satisfactory to the Bank; and
    (ii) The Borrower has adopted a regulation related to the management of the proceeds of this Loan in
            consultation and agreement with the Bank.

17. It took 18 months after the Board Approval for the operation to be declared effective. These delays
are not only related to the completion of the Effectiveness conditions as agreed upon during Negotiations
but also to other issues raised by the Bank team as “substantial issues connected to the overall
governance of the forest and which were seen as potential risks for the whole reform package supported
by the DPL?21. As per the two Aide-Memoires22 issued during the period between Board Approval and
Effectiveness, multiple issues were raised by the Bank and a series of actions were required from the
Government and presented as “actions to be taken by the Government prior effectiveness and
disbursement of the first tranche?. While the World Bank argued that these actions were central to the
overall reform program and its success, the Borrower, and particularly the Ministry of Forestry,
considered these requests as additional conditions for the release of the first tranche. (See Box 2).

Box 2: Conflicting views between the Bank and the Government – Delays in effectiveness
     While many issues were raised, the three below were the most sensitive.

   The documentation underlying the switch from a SIL to a DPL (including actions taken to adjust the approach) is
lacking to great extent.

     The first issue concerned reservations expressed by the Bank about the draft legislation establishing a
Forest Fund to be managed by the Ministry of Forests and which would have captured a large part of the
forest revenues including forest taxes. The Bank’s reservations were shared by the IMF which co-signed a
letter to the Government of Gabon expressing the disagreement of both institutions about the proposed
Forest Fund and requesting the Government not to grant the Ministry of Forests authority to capture taxes
that would otherwise go to support the national budget. The Bank and IMF stated that a Forest Fund to be
funded by the national budget voted and monitored by the Parliament would be an acceptable solution in
order to facilitate the sectoral investment program and strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Forests.
The Government considered this letter and the request related to the Forest Fund as an additional condition
for the release of the first tranche.
     The second issue related to delays to reform SNBG. Even though a political decision had been made in
2004 (cf. Prior Action), it was not confirmed through an enforceable legal instrument. At the time,
Gabonese stakeholders, mainly among SNBG and Ministry of Forests staff, were seen by the Bank as
trying to block the SNBG reform. The risk of such an opposition was not well assessed during preparation
of the operation and impacted the initial stage of implementation.
    The third issue related to the establishment of a Dedicated Account in the Central Bank to disburse the
DPL amounts to the various Ministries and agencies involved, and the auditing of this account. Early in the
discussion, Ministry of Finance officials considered this measure as opposing the very concept of a DPL.


18. To address these issues, high-level discussions were held with the Prime Minister’s office in
May 200723; subsequently, the Bank received the following evidence (most of which were not related to
any Effectiveness conditions as per the Legal Agreement).
        Decree 0004888-PR dated May 27, 2007 removing the Marketing Monopoly of SNBG, (not an
        Effectiveness condition)
         Decree 00247-07 cancelling 116 non-compliant logging permits, (not an Effectiveness condition)
        a consolidated work plan of the three line ministries involved in the NRM-DPL to be included the
        Budget Law for 2007, (not an Effectiveness condition)
        updated websites of the Ministry of Finance and line ministries involved in the NRM-DPL with
        maps and lists of existing logging, fisheries, mining and oil permits that were disclosed publicly,
        (not an Effectiveness condition)
        signed minutes of a May 9-11 meetings held in Libreville between the World Bank and the
        Government summarizing subsequent actions that the Government intended to take in furtherance
        of the NRM-DPL implementation in the area of financial management, law enforcement, timber
                                 24
        trade and national parks , and (not an Effectiveness condition)
        The Arrêté 00025/PM, adopted on October 10, 2006 setting the management modalities of DPL
        financial resources): elaborated by the various Ministries involved in the DPL (Prime Ministry,
        Finance, Treasury, Planning, Forestry, Environment, Fisheries, Mining, BEAC) and in close
        consultation with the Bank (Effectiveness condition)
        The contract with the Financial firm (the Tunisian firm SCET) was negotiated prior to
        Effectiveness (and signed only on October 5, 2007). (Effectiveness condition). However, because
        the first tranche was not released, it was not possible to actually mobilize the TA which required
        an advance payment of 20 percent of the total amount of the contract.

19. Effectiveness was finally reached on May 29, 2007, more than two years after Negotiations and
following a complex and difficult dialogue between the Borrower and the Bank. This episode not only

   The Government confirmed that the draft law on the Forest Fund was amended to ensure that, if agreed upon by
the Parliament, it would receive its funding from the regular - National Government budget in line with the single
budget principle and with the regulatory functions of the Ministry of Forests.

greatly impacted the pace of the NRM-DPL implementation but significantly affected the relationships
between the Bank and the Government.

        Implementation –Release of first tranche delayed (Loan Agreement to be amended)
20. Once the operation was eventually declared effective, it took an additional year before the first
tranche could be released. The first tranche could not be disbursed immediately after Effectiveness
because resources were not reflected in the Government’s 2007 Budget Law (as per the “additional
effectiveness condition? agreed upon on May, 2007 and described in the above para.). The DPL resources
were later included in the 2008 Budget Law, and allocated among the targeted Ministries (Forests,
Environment, Mines and Prime Ministry) according to an agreed work plan. The 2008 Budget Law was
formally transmitted to the Bank at the end of February 2008. It then took again some additional time to
proceed to the disbursement of the first tranche as the Loan Agreement had to be amended to correct
some inaccuracies regarding Currencies (confusion between Euros and US$) and include the refinancing
of the preparation funds (PPFs) , that was overlooked during the preparation of the Loan Agreement. The
first tranche (4.1 million Euros) was eventually disbursed on May 21st, 2008.

        Implementation – Good dynamic in reforms affected by political instability
21. The situation significantly improved after the release of the first tranche, and reforms were advancing
at a good pace. The Coordination set up at the Prime Ministry level, as well as the change in the World
Bank supervision team25, quickly provided a new impetus to the operation and good results were
immediately recorded (including progress on Management Plans, tax recovery, and cancellation of non-
compliant titles).
22. However, the late release of the first tranche did not allow the Government to entirely satisfy the
triggers for the disbursement of the second tranche by December 31st, 2008 (initial closing date of the
operation) and a 12 month-extension was requested. In June 2009, the President Omar Bongo Ondimba
died, after 42 consecutive years in power. The political and social uncertainty26 that followed significantly
slowed down the pace of reforms. Consequently, a second extension of the closing date was requested
and granted, bringing it to June 30th, 2011.
23. For the second tranche to be released, eleven conditions needed to be met, in addition to the
satisfactory continuous implementation of the Prior Actions required for release of the first Tranche (see
table in Section 2.1). A partial waiver had to be requested because the formulation of two triggers
(conditions iii-d and iv-a, as spelled out in the Loan Agreement) was no longer aligned with the current
realities in the country, given the time elapsed since Negotiations of this operation: this waiver however
did not mean that the underlying reforms supported by those triggers had not been implemented27 and that
the targeted outcomes and objectives were not met. The second tranche (7.4 million Euros) was disbursed
on June 30th, 2011.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

   Civil unrest erupted when Ali Bongo Ondimba, the late President’s son, won the August 2009 Presidential
elections. While the unrest was rapidly contained, President Bongo’s legitimacy is still contested by some parts of
the opposition and civil society.
27
   As part of the evidences transmitted by the Government to the Bank for the disbursement of the second tranche,
convincing evidence that the underlying reforms related to the two triggers had occurred, as stated in the Tranche
Release Document prepared by the World Bank (June 2011).

24. The Project Development Objective (cf. para. 8) was over-ambitious and the key Outcome indicators
(cf. Box 1) are considered partially disconnected with the PDO: they were indeed more focused on
enhanced governance and transparency in NRM sectors (considered as strategic sectors to eventually
drive economic diversification) than on their contribution to national income or on reduction of
dependence on oil sector (see Section 3.2). Key Outcomes / Medium-Term Objectives indicators were
compiled in the Annex 2 of the Project Document but many were loosely defined, and did not include
baseline/target values as well as means of verification.
25. The Government was in charge of monitoring progress towards development objectives of the
Project, as well as progress towards the satisfaction of the Prior Actions/Triggers. The latter was covered
by the Matrix on “Indicators for monitoring progress towards second tranche release? (Annex 3 of the
Program Document). This Matrix –referred to as Policy Matrix- included measurable and targeted
indicators as well as means of verification.
26. No external monitoring mechanism was included to monitor the outcomes of the operation: it was
considered that the supervision by the World Bank team would adequately serve the purpose of the
external monitoring.
           M&E during implementation
27. After the disbursement of the first tranche, and once the Coordination was established at the Prime
Minister’s Office, it was jointly agreed with the new World Bank team to establish a consensual
monitoring system of the reforms in order to avoid the situation that prevailed before Effectiveness,
where the Government considered that the Bank added new conditionalities. As such, the Policy Matrix
became the core element of the supervision of the operation: it was regularly updated by the Government
(under the leadership of the Coordination) and reviewed during supervision missions (based on inter-
ministerial committee meetings as well as bilateral meetings with the respective Ministries). The updated
Policy Matrix was systematically attached to the supervision Aide-Memoires (see Annex 7). The
Monitoring of the DPO indicators was also covered in the various Aide-Memoire.
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

28. At the time of the preparation of the NRM-DPL, it was envisioned that a DPL-2 on Natural Resources
Management would follow upon satisfactory completion of the present operation. However, because of
the significant delays encountered during implementation of this operation and despite the significant
positive outcomes, it was decided that targeted investment operations would be more appropriate in NRM
sectors in Gabon. A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is currently under preparation and different
options are under consideration: (i) a Technical Assistance is planned for the Mining sector and (ii) an
investment operation is envisioned in the Fisheries sector to consolidate the promising results achieved
under the NRM-DPL.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
       NRM-DPL – highly relevant with Country priorities
29. At the time of the preparation of the NRM-DPL, Gabon’s strategy was focused on diversifying its
economy in the context of declining oil resources: natural resources sectors were seen as potential drivers
for the economic diversification. With regard to forestry, fisheries, biodiversity and the environment, the
NRM-DPL supported the reform agenda set forth in the Letter of Development Policy28 (Forestry,
Fisheries, Biodiversity and Environment), approved by the Council of Ministers in May 2004. It also
supported Gabon’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) with respect to
its oil and mining revenues.

30. In 2009, the newly elected President Ali Bongo Ondimba, presented his economic vision “Gabon
Emergent’’, which aims at modernizing the country and turning it into an emerging economy by 2025.
This strategy is based on accelerating growth and reducing poverty and is looking to capitalize on
Gabon’s comparative advantages in the regional and global landscape. The “Gabon Emergent? vision is
built on three pillars (i) “Gabon- Industry?, (ii) “Green Gabon? and (iii) “Gabon - Services?. The policy
reforms pursued under the NRM-DPL are seen to be the foundation for the “Green Gabon? pillar of the
new economic vision for Gabon29.

     Link to the CAS (and new CPS under preparation)
31. The World Bank portfolio is small in Gabon30: as such the NRM-DPL is key in supporting both
pillars of the CAS: (i) strengthening the management of public resources, both natural and financial, for
improved social outcomes; and (ii) improving the investment climate to foster sustainable, private sector-
led growth.
32. The Country Partnership Strategy, currently under preparation, also prominently highlights the
management of natural resources and the need and willingness to build on reforms supported by the
NRM-DPL. (See Box 3)
Box. 3: Excerpts from the Concept Note for the Gabon CPS (October 2011 Para 73-74) Under the CPS,
efforts will be undertaken to build on the important results achieved under the previous CAS. These include those
reforms achieved through the NRM-DPL which focused on efforts to improve transparency, governance and law
enforcement across several important policy areas, including: (i) forestry, (ii) biodiversity-environment; (iii)
fisheries; and (iv) mining. […/…]
The Government has also clearly indicated its willingness to build a sustainable and responsible Fisheries sector,
as well as its readiness to embrace an ambitious reform similar to that already underway with respect to forestry
and biodiversity. Results achieved under this DPL went beyond the initial expectations (e.g., the regular
disclosure of the fishing licenses and associated tax collection status places Gabon amongst the top countries in
terms of public access to information in the fisheries sector)

     Relevance of the operation design
33. The objectives and targets defined for the operation are recognized as highly relevant and in line with
the country priorities in the NRM sectors; the related Prior Actions and Triggers are also seen as adequate
policy measures to achieve the development objectives of the operation (cf. Borrower’s report). The shift
from SIL to the DPL instrument (as described in Section 1.1 on “Rationale for Bank Assistance?), is also
acknowledged as relevant: the Borrower appreciated the focus on policy issues and the attention given to
reform implementation rather than activities. The additional fiduciary requirements reflected in the DPL
design are also seen as appropriate and the Borrower emphasizes their positive outcomes (not only for the
operation but for the public financial management system as a whole). As such one can confirm that the
DPL was indeed the appropriate instrument to support the reform program on NRM in Gabon.
34. However, there were significant shortcomings in the design of the DPL and critical aspects were not
covered in a satisfactory manner: in particular the decision-making process within the Government and
the potential resistances to reforms have been overlooked and thus inadequately reflected in the
institutional design of the operation.
35. In addition, the needs in terms of technical capacities to satisfactorily implement the reform program
have not been adequately assessed during preparation and solutions had to be found during the course of

29
   Reforms initiated in the Mining sector, and particularly the inclusion of social and environmental considerations
in mining development, are also considered as major inputs under the “Gabon-Industry? pillar.
30
   At the time of the NRM-DPL effectiveness, the WB portfolio in Gabon comprised only 3 operations during the
implementation period of the DPL: the GEF operation for National Parks, the local infrastructure project (PDIL) and
the NRM-DPL.

the implementation. In the forestry sector, the coordination with the project financed by the French
Cooperation did help meet the requirements in terms of capacity building. However, the TA needs in the
Environment and Fisheries sectors had not been anticipated and ad hoc solutions had to be found during
the course of the implementation: an IDF project (US$418K) was granted in 2008 to enhance capacities
of Ministry of Environment and Technical assistance was provided to the Ministry in charge of Fisheries
(through a partnership between the FAO and the Bank).
36. Consequently, implementation has been delayed (as well as disbursement despite the fact that DPL
should be a fast-disbursing instrument), which led the Bank Management to question the appropriateness
of this instrument to address challenges in NRM sectors in Gabon and to eventually postpone the decision
to pursue with the DPL-2 (to be further discussed under the new Country Partnership Strategy under
preparation).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

37. The achievements of the operation are significant. Compared to the baseline documented before the
start of the operation, the condition and status of natural resources in Gabon have improved substantially,
largely due to the significant contribution of the NRM-DPL, as indicated in the table below. The table
describes the Outcomes/Medium-Term Objectives expected under the NRM-DPL31. It is also worth
noting that the two waivers requested for the disbursement of the second tranche did not undermine the
achievement of the Outcomes/Medium-Term Objectives of the operation.




31
  Please note that the table does not cover the Outcomes/Medium-Term Objectives expected under the second DPL
operation, even though some progress was made on those as well.

(Annex 2 – Project document)
Previous progress is consolidated, and further steps enjoy continued political backing          Achieved
The Government has shown ownership of the NRM reforms supported by the DPL operation over the past three years. It
has taken numerous actions to pursue reforms engaged under the NRM-DPL, including the revision of the Mining Code,
the preparation of the Environmental Code: the new economic program “Gabon Emergent? embraces the NRM reforms
initiated under the DPL.

Regular budget, financial management and procurement procedures become                          Achieved
operational at MEFEPEPN and MMEPRH serving as pilots for other sectors.
The Government adopted a regulation on October 10, 2006 (Decree 00029/PM) that defined new procedures (budget,
Financial management and Procurement) to be applied by the targeted Ministries (Prime Minister’s office, Min. Forests,
Min. Agriculture, Min. Mining and Min. Env.) to use DPL proceeds (Prior Action ii).
The financial audit performed by an international auditing firm (Condition i) confirmed that: (i) expenditures made under
the first tranche of the Loan (with the exception of the expenditures referred to in the below para. 20) were made in line
with the provisions of the Decree 00029/PM setting the flow of funds procedures from the Central Bank (BEAC) to the
line ministries; and (ii) all the expenditures were used in accordance with the annual work programs prepared by the line
ministries.
The Government confirmed that the procedures established by Decree 00029/PM under the NRM-DPL operation would
also apply for the proceeds of the second tranche of the NRM-DPL. In addition, it has indicated that these procedures
established had proven to improve the Public Finance system, by significantly decreasing delays of many steps in the
public expenditure chain. While the Government has indicated its decision to engage in a Public Finance reform, it has
emphasized the positive lessons learnt from the NRM-DPL experience and its willingness to draw on them.

80% of remaining concessions are under sustainable forest management plan,                      Achieved
compared to less than 30% at start of the program.
As of February 2005, 3 million hectares (30 percent productive forests) had management plans already submitted to the
Ministry of Forestry or in an advance stage of preparation (no management plans were approved by the Ministry of
Forestry at that time). As of November 30, 2011, 84 percent of total productive forest areas (12.1 million hectares) were
engaged in sustainable forest management plans, with:
         5.6 million hectares with an approved management plan (i.e. 46% of the total area in productive forestry). In
         addition, 1.9 million hectares (out of the 5.6 million) are under the internationally recognized certification
         initiative Forest Stewardship Certification (FSC) ;
         1.0 million hectares with a management plan already submitted to the Ministry of Forestry (i.e. 8% of total area
         in productive forestry);
         3.5 million hectares with a management plan in an advanced stage of preparation (i.e. 29% of total area in
         productive forestry).
The operators are given a 3-year period to prepare a management plan once they are formally allocated a forest
concession (temporary concession). Under the 3-year temporary concession, operators are expected to apply SFM criteria
to logging activities (annual logging areas, minimum diameter).
While in February 2005, 7.7 million hectares of productive forests were hold by small permits holders (outside of
sustainable management dynamic), as of November 2011 only 2 million hectares (16% of productive forests) remain
under small permits.
This achievement was directly linked to the policy actions supported under the NRM-DPL (Condition iii-a), and the
associated outcomes:
    (i)   Guidelines for SFM plans: the Ministry of Forestry has adopted technical guidelines against which the
          management plans submitted by the private operators are assessed. These guidelines clearly define the criteria
          set up under the articles 21 to 23 of the Forestry Code (Law 016/0) adopted on December 31st, 2001. These
          guidelines (that also include wildlife management and social measures) have been elaborated in consultation

                                                         16
            with the private operators and contribute to significantly increase the transparency in the review process of the
            management plans by the Forestry Services.

     (ii)   Improvement of service delivery by the Forestry Services: Over the period 2001-2011, the Forestry services
            have received 29 management plans: 19 have been reviewed and approved in a period of less than 6 months32
            (average period of 4 months); 5 have been technically validated and are to be formally approved by the
            Minister and 5 are under review. During the 2007-2011 period (NRM-DPL period), the rhythm of preparation
            and submission of the management plans has significantly increased and during the sole year of 2010,
            10 management plans have been submitted.

     (iii) Enhanced monitoring capacities of the Ministry of Forestry: beyond, the review of the management plans, the
           Ministry of Forestry has significantly improved their monitoring capacity. With the support of the project
           financed by the French Cooperation, it has established a very detailed database that compiles all the
           information related to forest titles (date of allocation, date of submission of the forest inventory, date of
           submission of the socio-economic survey, date of submission of the management plans…). This database has
           been used very effectively by the Forestry Services to monitor the progress made by the operators and to take
           action in case the operator does not comply with the delays set in the Forestry Code.
80% of forest area tax is collected, compared to about 30% at start of the program                  Achieved
Achievements are particularly substantial in the forestry sector where the NRM-DPL (Condition iii-b) has directly
contributed to a significant improvement of recovery rate of fiscal revenues: the Fiscal Department reports that the
recovery rate of forestry fiscal taxes, which was less than 30 percent in 2005, is now 87 percent of the area fees. The
dramatic decrease in amounts from 2007 to 2008 is due to the cancellation of 1.8 million ha permit in 2007.

                                                                   Area fees (US$*)

  For 2 management plans out of the 19 approved, the Forestry services and the private operators exchanged for
more than 6 months (about one year) before the management plan could be approved by the Administration. This
was due to initial poor quality of the management plan submitted to the Forestry services that required additional
support to upgrade the management plan to a satisfactory level.

Non-compliance with environmental, social and fiscal rules ceases to be an attractive               Achieved
option.
The list of logging titles disclosed by the Government in March 2005 revealed that more than three-quarters of the
existing permits at that time (327 out of the 468 permits) were in default with respect to their payment of forest fees and
taxes. and/or forest law. In total, over the 2007-2010 period, 322 forest titles have been cancelled (and returned to public
domain) for a total area of 4.7 million hectares. The forest titles are now monitored on a bi-annual basis by a joint
committee (Min. Forestry/Min. Finance) that checks their compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The NRM-DPL (Conditions iii-a and iii-b) played a catalytic role to reverse this situation and coordinate Government
action to cancel non-compliant titles: in 2008, Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Finance started to work jointly, in a
systematic manner, to identify forest titles which were non-compliant with forestry and/or fiscal laws and taken
appropriate remedial actions.
The control capacity of the Ministry of Forest will be further reinforced with the recruitment of the third party observer
(Condition iii-c), whose mandates over the following 2 years are to: (i) clarify control procedures and set up a Chain of
control, (ii) build capacity of the forest control services (incl. acquisition of equipments), (iii) enhance participation of
other stakeholders in forest control.

Improved business confidence leads to additional job creation in the processing               Achieved.
sector

In Gabon, logging activities used to be largely oriented
towards log exports, with limited processing on the
national territory. The 2001 Forest Law (law 016/01)
includes a provision to foster in-country processing in
order to create employment and generate value-added on
the territory. Under the period of the NRM-DPL, the
number of processing units has doubled from 49 units in
2005 to 99 units in 2011. In 2010, the total direct
employment in timber processing sector was estimated at
4,325 (no data for 2005).

While no policy action was directly targeting the processing capacities, the enhanced monitoring capacities of the
Ministry of Forests (under Condition iii-a) increased the pressure on operators to comply with legal requirements. In
addition, the Government adopted in November 2009 a regulation that banned log exports.
In addition, the Government has launched, in partnership with the Singaporean company Olam (holding 60 percent of the
joint venture), an ambitious program “Special Economic Zone? (SEZ) in Nkok, about 30 km from Libreville, on a
1,125 hectare area. This SEZ will be dedicated to advanced processing of tropical timber, with a global capacity of 1
million cubic meter per year and direct employment estimated between 6,000 and 7,000. As of November 2011, US$200
million have already been invested in this joint venture SEZ. The SEZ is expected to be operational in mid 2012.

10% of Gabon’s territory is under effective National Parks status with a secured legal           Achieved
and institutional framework.
The Law on National Parks (law 003/2007) promulgated on September 11, 2007 (building on Prior Action vii),
established in its article 69, a secured legal status of the thirteen National Parks created through presidential decrees in
2002. The 13 National Park encompass the country’s diversity of natural habitat and cover 3 million hectares (12 percent
o f the national territory).
In terms of institutional framework, the Law on National Parks also established the National Agency of National Parks,
which is responsible for the daily management of National Parks. A GEF-financed project on Biodiversity and National

Park (US$10 million), implemented by the Bank, supports the reinforcement of capacity of this new agency at the central
level and in three of the National Parks (Loango, Mayumba and Moukalaba-Doudou). The GEF project is rated
satisfactory and is planned to close on June 30th, 2013.

Social and environmental impacts of mining, fishing and forest programs are                     Achieved
monitored.
Despite the Decree 539/PM/MEFEPEPN regulating the environmental monitoring of economic activities was adopted in
July 2005, the General Directorate of Environment (DG-Env) was not well equipped to ensure a proper enforcement of
this Decree. Over the past few years, the DG-Env. has managed to significantly improve –quantitatively and
qualitatively- its capacities to review Env. Impact Assessment (EIAs) and monitor Env. Management Plans (EMPs),
received from private operators (Condition iv-a and iv-b).
          - DG-Env. has prepared a new Environment Law (that is currently under review by the Parliament) as well as
              environmental and social guidelines for mining and forestry sectors.
          - The number of reviews has also significantly increased: while the DG-Env. reviewed only 10 EIAs/EMPs
              reports in 2005, it reviewed about 145 in 2010. The DG-Env has also increased its capacity to conduct
              monitoring missions on sites: monitoring efforts over the past two years were focused on oil operations
              (mainly in the buffer zones of the National Parks), logging operators and gas stations in Libreville.
          - DG-Env has mobilized sectoral experts (from line ministries and in some cases international experts) to
              help the EIA/EMP committee on specific technical aspects. The quality of the review (desk review and on-
              site review) has thus been dramatically improved.

The Ministry in charge of Fisheries has set up a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) (Prior Action ix) that requires the
installation of a beacon (electronic localization device) on all operating vessels33. The number of boats equipped with a
beacon dramatically increased over the past three years: while the coverage was nil in 2008, it increased to 43% in 2009
and 79% by end of October 2010 (with 100% of the national vessels, 89% of the vessels under fishing agreements, 72%
of chartered vessels and 39% of foreign vessels under individual licences)34. Since the delivery of fishing licenses is now
conditioned to the presence of a satellite beacon, the fleet coverage is 100 percent.
The VMS system allows a monitoring of fishing activities and real-time detection of suspicious activities. The
Government uses the VMS to enforce seasonal closure (first quarter of the calendar year) and fishing ban in the National
Marine Park of Mayumba (Condition vi-a).
Public consultation and collaboration with civil society are improved                        Achieved
Before Negotiations of the NRM-DPL, the notion of public participation and stakeholders’ involvement in consultation
and/or decision making processes was not considered by the Government in the natural resource sectors.
The design of the NRM-DPL put an emphasis on disclosure of key information on NRM sectors (Prior Actions v, viii and
ix) , which was seen as an appropriate way to foster public debate and provide the CSOs opportunities to engage with the
Government. Similarly, emphasis was given to extensive consultations (with private sector, NGOs and academia) during
the preparation of the environmental and social reviews of the mining and fisheries sectors (Conditions v and vi-b).
Overall, the NRM-DPL has helped put in place the underpinnings and precedents for a culture of information disclosure,
public consultation and stakeholder participation in the natural resource-related policy making processes in Gabon. (See
Section 3.5-(a) on Stakeholder participation).

Basic transparency and knowledge base are in place to inform public debate on                   Achieved
modernization of industrial fisheries.
Transparency: The list of the fishing permits and the associated collected tax has been published for the years 2008 to

Ministry of Finance. The systematic disclosure of the fishing permits as well as the associated collected tax in Gabon is a
best practice at the international level. This achievement is directly linked with the policy actions under the NRM-DPL
(Prior Action ix).
Knowledge base: The socio-economic and environmental review (Condition vi-b) of the industrial fisheries sector has
provided a strong analytical background to help the Government define policy and institutional reform in industrial
fisheries sector. A major strength of the review lies in the diagnosis made of the current fish stocks36. Main outcomes of
the report were on the following aspects:
           Sustainable management of the resource: The modernization of the management system requires the adoption
          of management units (e.g., per species and areas/depth), the definition of the authorized fishing methods, the
          determination of catch limits for each management units, the adoption of specific management measures (incl.
          management plans). The Ministry in charge of Fisheries has already prepared a series of regulatory texts based
          on the review recommendations.
         Development of the fishing sector: The review discusses the different potential structure for the sector: (i) a
         sector largely dominated by the foreigners or (ii) a sector favourable to the national operators.
          Fishing licensing: The review also reflects on the poor data availability on fish resources and the need to adopt
         an “adaptative management?. This option refers to a management system that continuously adjusts based on the
         data made available through the fishing activities.
          Fiscal regime: The review recommends a flexible fiscal regime that would reflect the profitability of the
         activity and would also contribute to the sustainable management of the resources through differentiated fee
         level for targeted species.
Public debate: The review has been conducted following a very participatory approach, Many stakeholders have been
consulted in the course of the review and a workshop was organized by the Department of Fisheries in October 27, 2010
to debate the main recommendations of the review: the workshop was well-attended by representatives of the different
Ministerial Departments (Ministries of Finance, Planning, Marine Marchande, Environment, National Park Agency, as
well as of the regional organizations (COREP and ECCAS), the donor community, the civil society and the private
sector.

Increased transparency on the country’s major source of income triggering public                Achieved
debate on resource revenue
The major source of income in Gabon was and remains the oil sector. Prior negotiations of the NRM-DPL, Gabon had
expressed its agreement to participate to the EITI (Prior Action xi). On September 27, 2007, Gabon was accepted as an
EITI Candidate Country. The final EITI Validation report was submitted to the Board on July 9, 2010 and on October 20,
2010, the EITI Board designated Gabon as an EITI Candidate country that is “Close to Compliant?37. Gabon was granted
till December 9, 2012 to complete the remedial actions needed to achieve compliance.
The EITI process has been key to increase transparency on oil revenues: reconciliation between payment made to the
Government by oil companies and payments received by oil company is now institutionalized. One key feature of EITI is
the involvement of civil society organizations: national NGOs (member of national EITI committee) have been engaged
in the EITI process for years and are now actively triggering public debates on NRM (cf. Brainforest, whose Executive
Director has received the Goldman prize).
Knowledge-base is in place to inform a public debate on the modernization of the Achieved
mining sector.
Knowledge-base: A strategic socio-environmental review of the industrial mining sector has provided strong analytical
background The review particularly contributed to the following:
        In-depth analysis of conflicting land-uses in Gabon: one of the major outcomes of the assessment is a clear
        identification of the potential conflicting uses of land: all cases have been reported on a GIS-basis;

36
   Contrary to common belief, fish resources in Gabonese waters appear to be very well preserved and likely to
sustain a viable economic activity (very different from the majority of the other coastal
37
   As set out in EITI Policy Note #3, the designation of "close to compliant" applies in cases where the EITI Board
considers that a Candidate country has not only made meaningful progress, but can reasonably be expected to
achieve Compliance within a short period.

                                                         20
         Identification of “growth corridors? for the Mining sector: the approach adopted for the review was to come out
         with a strategic vision for the mining sector: this approach relied on the collection and combination of various
         data (including population, mining potential, related infrastructure and environmental and social vulnerabilities).
         This assessment highlighted the most promising “growth corridors? (GIS-database).
         Environmental and social dimensions of mining sector: a detailed legal review has been conducted on the
         provisions related to environmental and social management of the mining sector existing in the different laws,
         codes and regulatory texts.
Public debate: The draft report of the review has been widely disseminated to the different Administrations as well as
private operators, local and international NGOs and development partners. A two-day workshop was organized by the
Ministry of Mining on March 8-9, 2010: outcomes of the review were discussed and stakeholders debated on how these
should be reflected in the new Mining Law under preparation.


38. While there was no specific key outcome indicator targeting contribution to national income and
reduction of dependence on oil sectors (despite it is clearly stated as a pillar in the Development Project
Objectives, see Section 2.3 on M&E), one can note that:
     (i) the contribution of the forestry formal sector38 to the national GDP has significantly increased
             over the NRM-DPL period (from 2.5 percent in 2004 to 4.7 percent in 2009 see below graph)
             and despite large cancellations of non-compliant forest titles, the fiscal revenues have been
             proportionally adversely impacted thanks to an increased recovery performance from the
             Ministry of Finance;




                  Source: http://data.worldbank.org/country/gabon


     (ii) the contribution of the industrial fisheries sector to the GDP is estimated at about 1 percent in
              201039, with a total commercial value of US$62 million and fiscal revenues of
              US$2.4 million40 and
     (iii) the contribution of the mining sector to the GDP is still low with only 2 percent41 and fiscal
               revenues were estimated at US$20 million in 2009.

38
   The ICR team could only access to data on formal forestry sector. It is however worth noting that the informal
sector is thought to be also important, notably in terms of employment.
39
   Contribution of the total fisheries sector (including artisanal sector) to GDP was estimated at 1.5 percent in 2005
(Document de Stratégie de Croissance et de Réduction de la Pauvreté, 2005)
40
   The fiscal rent (ratio between the commercial value of the captures and the fiscal revenues) of the industrial
fisheries sector in Gabon is very low with an average of only 4% whereas it is of about 7 percent in some Asian
countries.

                                                         21
39. The reliance of the Gabonese economy on oil sector is still important with a contribution of the oil
sector to 40 percent to the GDP in 2009. It is largely above the contribution projected in the Project
Document of the DPL42 and can be explained by the high price of the oil barrel over the past years that
made some oil reserves more attractive to investors: as a result more exploration/exploitation operations
have been initiated than forecasted when the NRM-DPL operation was designed. While it is clear from
above that the forestry sector has strengthened its contribution to national economy over the DPL period,
the same does not apply to mining and fisheries sectors: however, the improvements in terms of
governance and transparency framework sectors are expected to eventually contribute to strengthen their
contribution to national economy.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
40. Despite the fact that Outcomes and Medium-term objectives of the NRM-DPL operation have been
achieved, the above rating seems appropriate because of the important delays in achieving those
(cumulative 30 months more than initially planned), which are interpreted as signs of weaknesses in the
reform program. The shortcomings in the design as described under Section 3.1. also justifies the
proposed rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

     Stakeholder participation


41. Overall, the NRM-DPL has helped put in place the underpinnings and precedents for a culture of
information disclosure, public consultation and stakeholder participation in the natural resource-related
policy making processes in Gabon. New laws (either recently adopted or under preparation) include
provisions related to information disclosure and consultation with stakeholders: Law on National Parks

41
  Strategic Environment and Social Review of the Mining sector, 2009.
42
  The Section B of the Project Document on “Macroeconomic outlook and Debt Sustainability? projected a
contribution of around 32 percent to the GDP for the 2006-2008 period.

                                                      22
(adopted in 2007), Environmental Law (under review by the Parliament), Mining Law (under
finalization). The methodology of consultation and public participation needs to be strengthened with
continued efforts from the Government to share information and involve different stakeholders as well as
with reinforcement of the capacity of the CSOs.

     Poverty impact, Gender Aspects, Social Development
42. Poverty impact and Gender aspects were not covered under the operation. Reforms under the NRM-
DPL focused on central government agencies and it was expected that the “redistribution? aspect of the
reforms would be covered under DPL-2, which, however, did not go forward for the reasons indicated
above. The reviews conducted for the mining and fisheries sectors covered Social Development aspects,
including the assessment of artisanal mining and the local employment that could be generated in the
fisheries sector. The Ministry of Mining has requested further support from the Bank to help organize the
artisanal mining sector43. Other partners (including African Development Bank, Japanese Cooperation,
French Cooperation) support the artisanal segments of the fisheries and forestry sectors.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

26 Inter-Ministerial Coordination (under the Prime Minister’s office)
43. As described in Section 1.6, the institutional arrangements initially designed for the operation proved
inefficient and thus were restructured just after the operation became Effective with the establishment of
the Coordination in the Prime Minister’s Office. The DPL Coordination, including the inter-ministerial
committee, has yielded significant positive results:
         it was useful as a one-stop shop for all of the operation’s implementation, supervision, monitoring
         and reporting requirements.
         It fostered the sharing of relevant experience between the different line Ministries, which did not
         often coordinate otherwise44.
         It enhanced the accountability of the different line Ministries vis-à-vis their commitments under
         the NRM-DPL. The NRM-DPL was seen as a government program where each line Ministry had
         to deliver certain results in order to meet a common objective (disbursement of the second
         tranche).
         It improved the dialogue with the World Bank: the Coordination was particularly efficient in
         facilitating communication between the Bank and the line Ministries and was instrumental to get
         required information from them.
44. As a result, despite the fact that the NRM-DPL has now formally closed, the Coordination is still
active and inter-ministerial committee still meets on a regular basis.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

45. Financial Management and impacts on Public expenditures: as indicated in Box 2, the establishment
of a Dedicated Account, as well as specific procedures for the management of DPL proceeds was not

43
   The Bank has mobilized a $150K grant to work on artisanal mining issues around the Ivindo National Park in
Gabon. In addition, the Ministry of Mining has requested support under its Reimbursable Technical Assistance
(RTA) with the World Bank on artisanal mining.
44
   In particular, the experience gained by the Ministry of Forests in terms of information disclosure was deemed very
useful for the Ministry in charge of Fisheries and, as a result, the latter achieved much more than what was expected
under the NRM-DPL.

                                                        23
welcome by the Ministry of Finance. However, at the end of the operation, this arrangement is now seen
as strength of the operation (as per the Borrower’s report). Moreover, the Government has indicated that
the procedures piloted under the NRM-DPL have been used to simplify the Public Finance system by
significantly decreasing steps and delays in the public expenditure chain45.
46. Positive impacts of the cancellation of the SNBG monopoly: this was also one of the critical issues
that created tensions between the Bank and the Government prior to Effectiveness. Appreciation of the
relevance of this reform has also drastically changed: SNBG’s management now argues that restructuring
was indeed the most appropriate long-term solution for the organization. The new CEO has also pointed
out the fact that the SNBG would probably not have survived the financial crisis if its previous monopoly
were to still in effect. In fact, under the old arrangements, SNBG would have had the obligation to buy
all the Okoume and Ozigo logs with no option to sell them as the export markets were completely
contracted.

        Not applicable
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

     Rating: Moderate
47. It is highly unlikely that the Government will reverse the reforms supported by the NRM-DPL. In the
Borrower’s report, the Government indicates that it has already started to work on the deepening and the
refinement of the reforms supported under the NRM-DPL, in particular through the elaboration of major
pieces of Laws and regulations (new Mining Law, sector guidelines on environmental management,
regulations on fisheries management, etc.). In addition, it argues that the reforms supported by the
operation have now been embraced by the new “Gabon Emergent? vision and its “Green Gabon? pillar in
particular (see Section 3.1).
48. However, the pace in further implementing and deepening reforms in the NRM sector can be seen as
unpredictable as evidenced by the delays in the publication of the EITI reports46. In addition, while the
“Gabon Emergent? vision implies the implementation large-scale infrastructure with potentially
significant adverse environmental impacts, the still limited Government’s capacity to implement EIA and
enforce environmental legislation is considered as a risk. As such, the proposed rating “Moderate? seems
appropriate.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


45
   As part of the overall reform of its Public Finance reform, the Government has applied the fiduciary rules defined
under the NRM-DPL (cf. Decree 00025/PM dated October 10, 2006) with a simplification of the expenditures chain
and a reduction of the delays of each of the different steps (“Les délais impartis pour le traitement d’un dossier de
l’engagement à la transmission au Trésor pour les dépenses de fonctionnement sont de huit (8) jours en phase
administrative et de 7 jours en phase comptable. Pour les dépenses d’investissement, il faut 17 jours pour boucler
un dossier dans la phase administrative et 7 dans la Phase comptable »).
46
   In December 2005, the Government of Gabon published its first EITI report, which covers information of 2004.
However, this report did not provide information on the Government's share of oil profit, which according to
estimates might be as much as half of total oil revenue. The Government of Gabon published its second EITI report
on its website in April 2007. The third EITI report was published in March 2008. The fourth and fifth reports
covering exercises 2007 and 2008 are still pending.

                                                        24
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
49. The Borrower is appreciative of the relevance and adequacy of the reforms covered by the NRM-DPL
and the substantial role played by the Bank. In addition, the Bank has worked closely with other donors
(especially the GEF and French Agency for Development) to mobilize additional resources and build
synergies and complementarities with assistance from other partners.
50. However, while the decision regarding the choice of Bank lending instrument seems relevant based
on lessons learnt from previous experiences (specifically the PFE operation closed in 2002) as well as the
focus on policy reforms agreed upon during preparation operation, the consequences of the shift from an
Investment to a Development Policy operation were not fully addressed and generated major
implementation delays:
    • Risks associated with some reforms (i.e. SNBG) were not adequately assessed during preparation,
        which generated strong opposition from the Government at the early stage of implementation.
    •   Additional analytical underpinnings (cf. something equivalent to a “political economy in NRM
        sectors?) should have been conducted once the decision to go for a DPL was taken.
    •   Understanding of the reform dynamics within the Government was insufficient and the proposed
        institutional arrangements were inappropriate.
    •   Needs for complementary technical assistance (TA) should have been better assessed and covered
        for all the targeted sectors (as indicated in Section 3.1 Relevance of the Design).
    •   Communication with the Ministry of Finance (which was not involved in the preparation as long
        as it was a SIL) could have been improved to clarify the fiduciary requirements under the DPL.
    •   Refinancing of the preparation grants was overlooked during preparation, which created
        additional delays after effectiveness.

(b) Quality of Supervision

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
51. Two phases should be distinguished during supervision: (i) from Board Approval to Effectiveness
and (ii) from Effectiveness to the closing of the operation. A single change in TTLship occurred during
the course of the implementation (just after Effectiveness). The incoming TTL was well prepared to take
over supervision leadership as she had been involved in a similar DPL operation involving forestry and
environmental issues in Cameroon for a long period preceding her new assignment.

52. Phase 1: from Board Approval to Effectiveness: As presented in Section 2.2, the first supervision
phase was characterized by a tense dialogue between the Bank and the Gabonese Authorities and
diverging positions on specific sector issues.
53. Phase 2: from Effectiveness to closing: From Effectiveness, Bank supervision focused on
strengthening client relations. While based in Washington, the TTL regularly visited Gabon (every
four/five months) and videoconferences were frequently organized to prepare the supervision missions.
The quality of the supervision and the regular interaction and consultation with the Borrower were highly
appreciated. This helped re-build mutual understanding regarding the reform process.
54. The supervision was considered very productive and technically-sound by the different governmental
entities (DPL Coordination as well as line Ministries), combining the appropriate skill mix to adequately
cover the different NRM sectors. Beyond the Task Team, the CMU, which was keen in re-establishing a
good dialogue with the Authorities on NRM, got involved in the supervision of the operation and
provided help when needed.
55. The focus on the Policy Matrix was seen as a positive change: it gradually mitigated the perception
that the Bank could add new conditions at any time. During this period, trust between the Government

                                                   25
and the Bank gradually improved and the Government requested at different occasions the Bank to
provide policy advice on strategic issues related to NRM sectors, such as the impact of the export log ban
or the impact of the financial crisis on timber markets47.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
56. Despite the substantial and important role played by the Bank to identify key reforms in NRM sectors
with transformation potential, significant shortcoming negatively impacted the design of the operation
and generated problems during the early stages of the implementation.
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
57. The Gabonese Government deserves credit for its achievements under the NRM-DPL, particularly
given that it was not familiar with DPLs. The shift to the DPL instrument required changes in the way the
Gabonese administration had usually dealt with public policy and development projects. Consulting with
stakeholders, disclosing information, reviews and studies for the purpose of developing policies were new
features of public policy making in Gabon. Hence, Government had to go the “extra mile? in order to
achieve the outcomes envisioned by the Bank under the NRM-DPL.
58. That high-level engagement proved to be key to sustain reforms in NRM sectors: the strong and
effective involvement from the Prime Minister’s Office was critical to move NRM reforms forward and
sometimes counter-balance the resistance to changes from line Ministries.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

59. DPL Coordination (at the Prime Minister Office level): as already indicated, the revised
Coordination arrangements established immediately after the Effectiveness of the operation has been
instrumental in its successes. (See Section 3.5 (b)). This is considered as a best practice.
        Rating: Highly Satisfactory

60. Ministry in charge of Forestry: The forestry agenda was undoubtedly the most challenging under
the NRM-DPL operation and, not surprisingly, encountered the greatest resistance. Many actions were
substantially delayed by the Ministry of Forestry, which also regularly failed to provide the required
information during the supervision missions. However, despite the resistance, the reforms in the forestry
sector were implemented and there are strong signs that they will be maintained and strengthened under
the “Green Gabon? pillar of the new economic vision in Gabon.
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



47
  The World Bank prepared, upon the Minister of Forests’ request, policy notes: one analyzed the impacts of the
governmental decision on export ban and proposed some accompanying measures based on similar experiences in
other countries. The other one analyzed the impacts of the financial crisis on timber exports from Gabon and
described some fiscal measures (temporary) that the Government could potentially take ot minimize adverse impacts
on operators (since the impacts were less than previously envisaged, no fiscal change was made ). Both policy notes
were highly appreciated; they were also seen as critical background in its discussions with private operators.

                                                        26
61. Ministry in charge of Environment: The Ministry of Environment (and more specifically the DG-
Env) rightly complained about the formulation of one of the triggers48 under its responsibility that referred
to the PSFE while the latter never materialized. That was discussed with the Bank and the situation
improved in November 2008 when a work program was prepared by the Ministry of Environment that
described objectives/outcomes to be met in a more operational manner. This work program was reviewed
by the Bank and deemed satisfactory to meet in substance the reforms targeted by the trigger. The
Ministry of Environment subsequently implemented in a satisfactory manner the work program, achieved
significant results in terms of environmental monitoring of the economic activities, particularly in
biodiversity-rich areas (National parks and buffer zones).
        Rating: Satisfactory

62. Ministry in charge of Mining: The Ministry of Mining was committed to the mining reforms
supported by the NRM-DPL and was the first to meet the requirements for the disbursement of the second
tranche. The recommendations from the socio-economic review of the mining sector have been
satisfactorily used in the process of the revision of Mining Law.
        Rating: Satisfactory

63. Ministry in charge of Fisheries: The NRM-DPL has been a vehicle to engage the Bank in the
fisheries sector in Gabon. The results achieved under this DPL have gone beyond initial expectations
which was a clear sign of the Government’s strong will to build a sustainable and responsible fisheries
sector, and its readiness to embrace a reform agenda similar to the one already underway with respect
forestry and biodiversity.
        Rating: Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
64. Despite the major achievements under the NRM-DP, delays in delivering reforms (30 months later
than the original closing date) are symptomatic of persisting resistances to reforms within the
Government. While the NRM-DPL has proven to be a quite powerful instrument to help remove some of
these barriers and overcome some of the associated resistance, progress still needs to be made to support
fluid reform processes and to entirely eliminate rent seeking behavior within the NRM sectors. This is a
positive signal that the DPL Coordination be maintained even after the closing of the NRM-DPL, to
continuously support NRM reforms.

6. Lessons Learned

65. Understand the political economy. The NRM-DPL design did not adequately reflect the reform
dynamics (as well as the strength of likely resistance to reforms) within the Government. When designing
DPLs, it is thus critically important for the Bank to have an adequate understanding of the local
institutional “political economy? prior to proposing significant sectoral and institutional reforms. The
“political economy? analysis should serve two major objectives:
     (i) better identify, anticipate and, hopefully, mitigate potential resistance of an institutional and/or
         political nature both within the immediately affected ministries and agencies and on the part of


48
  Condition iv-a: “The Government has continuously implemented the PSFE social and environmental management
plan, in consultation and in agreement with the Bank?.

                                                     27
         other government and non-government stakeholders which are likely to be affected by the
         proposed reforms, and
    (ii) establish efficiency and effective project coordination and implementation arrangements,
         especially when the types of resistance mentioned in (i) above are present, which is almost always
         the case when natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable, are involved.

66. Multi-sectoral DPOs need a high-level coordination. The multi-sectoral dimension of the operation
is seen as a strength by the Borrower (as well as the Bank), including sharing of experiences and inter-
ministerial collaboration on key issues. However, this could be achieved only once the coordination of the
overall operation was set up at the Prime Minister’s Office level. Such a high-level coordination should
be a pre-requisite to multi-sectoral DPOs.

67. Be clear on the reforms to support. Governmental reform programs are broad by definition. The
design phase of a development policy operation aims at targeting a set of reforms within the overall
reform program of the Government in a given sector. It is very important that both parties share the same
understanding of the reforms to be implemented under the policy lending as well as the associated prior
actions and triggers: indicators need to be well-specified, agreed up-front with the Borrower, and closely
monitored by both the Borrower and the Bank during implementation (the Policy Matrix proved to be a
useful tool). Any change during implementation needs to be jointly discussed and agreed upon. When
other critical issues emerge during the course of the operation, those should not be included as new prior
actions or triggers (as was the case for the Forest Fund in the NRM-DPL operation) but should rather be
part of the broader policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government.

68. Adequately assess the technical capacities and associated TA needs. Satisfactory implementation
of Policy reforms can sometimes be hampered by insufficient capacities in the targeted Ministries. When
designing DPLs, it is important to assess the technical capacities in place and identify needs for capacity
building. The adequate Technical Assistance (TA) support should be designed to accompany the DPL
reforms (this can be done through a complementary World Bank operation, prepared in parallel to the
DPL operation). Support to policy reforms (through DPL) and Technical Assistance should be prepared
as a package.

69. Re-initiate the quality review of the operation if significant changes in the approach are
adopted: the shift from a SIL to a DPL is seen as relevant, as well as the “hybrid? nature of the DPL.
However, the transition from the SIL to the DPL has been done in an incomplete manner and key features
to ensure a satisfactory implementation of the DPL have not been properly covered and reflected in the
design of the operation (need for complementary TA, institutional arrangements). In addition, the
fiduciary arrangements proposed under the DPL, while now recognized by the Borrower as positive
outcome of the operation, were resisted by the Ministry of Finance (which was not involved when the SIL
was under preparation) at the time of the effectiveness. When drastically shifting the approach in the
course of the preparation, the entire quality review cycle should be re-initiated (from Concept Note to
Decision meeting): in the case of this operation, this would certainly have helped identify the missing
features of the DPL and helped better communicate with the Borrower on key elements of the DPL.

70. Avoid use of “hybrid? instruments. The NRM-DPL operation is one of the few DPLs where SIL-
related elements were maintained (cf. fiduciary arrangements). While in the context of this operation, it
turned out to be a relevant solution -as indicated by the Borrower-, it has generated important delays and
confusions. It is thus not recommended to replicate such “hybrid? instrument in other operations.

71. Programmatic DPOs versus multi-tranche DPOs. As indicated above, while the shift from a SIL to
a DPL is seen as relevant, the choice for a multi-tranche DPL instrument created rigidity that would have
been avoided with the programmatic DPO instrument (with two single tranches rather than a two-tranche

                                                    28
DPO). Since this policy reform approach was new in Gabon and particularly in the NRM sectors, a
program of multiple single DPOs would have been more appropriate to allow for adjustments. This would
have certainly avoided the request for the two waivers at the time of the disbursement of the second
tranche.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
72. In its ICR (see Annex 4), the Borrower has confirmed the relevance of the DPL to the country
priorities in the NRM sectors. It also indicated the follow-up actions that the Government is already
taking, building on the DPL operation (particularly preparation of new Laws and regulations). Overall, it
is very appreciative of the Bank supervision and the quality of the policy advice received all along the
NRM-DPL (both during preparation and implementation). However, the Government also alluded to the
tense period before effectiveness when the Bank was seen as adding new conditionalities to the
disbursement of the first tranche.

(b) Cofinanciers
Not applicable

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

73. Written contribution has not yet been received from the French Agency of Development (AFD).
However, during discussions, it underlined the good partnership with the Bank during the preparation and
implementation of the operation. It highlights the complementarities of the assistance provided by both
parties.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower has prepared an ICR (attached below). The main outcomes of the Borrower’s ICR are
presented below:

Relevance: The Borrower confirms that the proposed NRM-DPL was highly relevant and aligned with
the country priorities in the NRM sectors. The reforms supported were opportune and adapted to the
country needs at that time in the different sectors and they are still highly relevant, particularly in the
context of the new economic vision “Gabon Emergent? launched by the President. The fiduciary
modalities put in place under the DPL were relevant with the “result-oriented budget? the Government is
working towards as part of the reform of the Public Finance.
Achievements: The Borrower’s ICR expresses a high satisfaction in terms of achievement and describes
sector by sector the outcomes of the operation. It also presents the follow up actions already taken some
line Ministries that build on the NRM reforms. It reports a strong commitment of the different
governmental entities to the operation’s objective.
Appreciation of the World Bank’s support: The Borrower’s ICR reports a high satisfaction of the
support provided by the Bank, both during preparation and implementation. It specifically acknowledges
the fruitful contribution of the Bank in the design of the reform program in NRM sectors. It’s appreciative
of the high-level technical expertise in the different targeted sectors mobilized under the operation
(preparation/implementation) as well as the regular interactions between with the Bank (either during
supervision mission or through videoconference).
However, the Borrower indicates as a major weakness the decision of the Bank to include new conditions
for effectiveness (i.e. Forest Fund).
Lessons learnt:
        Ownership: Achievements under the NRM-DPL have been fulfilled because they were entirely
        aligned with the national priorities. As such, the government entities felt that they “owned? the
        operation.
        Institutional arrangement: High-level coordination has proved critical for the success of the
        operation. In addition the inter-ministerial committee has improved ministerial coordination and
        positively.
        Monitoring and Evaluation system: indicators as well as means of verification have to be well
        designed during preparation of the project. While the Government was appreciative of the
        systematic review of the triggers included in the Policy Matrix, it complained that the triggers,
        once met, could not be removed from the Matrix. The World Bank team had to clarify that all
        project triggers had to be entirely satisfied for the second tranche to be released and that,
        therefore, those triggers that were previously fulfilled in advance of the first tranche release
        needed to remain fulfilled.
        Combination with TA and investment: while the Borrower recognizes that the priority should be
        given to policy reforms (thus the appropriateness of the DPL instrument), it suggests that
        Investment/TA operations could have fruitfully complemented the DPL (as this was the case for
        the GEF-financed operation for the Biodiversity protection).
