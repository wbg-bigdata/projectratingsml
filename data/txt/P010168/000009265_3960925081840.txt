FOURTH TELECOMHUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2122-PAZ)
PRZEFACE
1.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) presents a review of the Fourth
Telecomnuications Project for which a Bank Loan 2122-PAZ was provided for
USS4O.O million to the Government of Pakistan for telecom=unications develop-
ment undertaken by its Telegraph and Telephore Department (T&T).
2.        The PCR was prepared by the Pakistan T&T and submitted to the IBRD
in April 1988. It provides a good description of origins, achievements and
problems in project implementation. Being the first time the entity has
attempted to prepare a PCR, the quality of the report is acceptable and is
attached as such. A few aspects noted or absent from T&T's version have been
incorporated in the overvievw section of this report.
3.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED swvff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower and the Executing Agency
for commeiits before finalizing the report; however, none were received.

PAKISTAN
PROTECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN 2122-PAR
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       This is the fourth telecommunications project in Pakistan and the
first loan. The Bank in its involvement with $61.3 million with three
projects has assisted the Pakistan T&T in its expansion of the local and
long distance telecommunications systems. The Bank has also assisted in
institution building primarily aimed at giving T&T fiscal and
administrative autonomy. Progress has been slow in this direction but the
Bank's fourth telecommunications project was aimed at continuing these
efforts which assumed greater .rgency with the increasing demand and
sophistication of the networks and the need to run the enterprise with a
proper orientation as a commercial enterprise. Finally with the follow-up
fifth project while these efforts are continuirg, the government has taken
a firm decision to convert the T&T Department into a statutocy corporation
proviling it with a great measure of fiscal and administrative autonomy.
2.       Project achievemients and highlights include:
(a) The addition of about 260,600 subscribers to the network during
the 1982-87 period;
(b)  The improvement of long distance facilities and network
reliability with the expanded Karachi Lahore Islamabad and
Karachi-Quetta Peshawar microwave systems;
(c) The improvement in international services with the commissioning
of the new satellite station and gateway in Islamabad;
(d) The expansion of rural network with 300 additional long distance
public call offices;
(e) The improvement in the financial and accounting areas such as
introduction of proforma commercial accounting system and
reduction ir. the accounts receivable time from 337 days in 1982 to
180 days in 1987 for Government accounts;
(f) the overall reduction in staff telephone ratio from 91 in 1982 to
63 per 1,000 telephones in 1987.

3. Covenants - Tariff Study
Under the terms of the Loan Agreement T4T was to undertake a study
of its tariff structure and furnish the results to the Bank for its
coments by September 30, 1983. The study was completed in March 1984 and
it focussed on a comparison of tariff rates with other countries and failed
to review comprehensively the structure of T&T's rates. Under the fifth
project financed under Loan 2743-PAR, revised terms of reference have been
agreed and consultants are in the process of carrying out the study to
recommend the optimum tariff structure applicable to T&T which will be
discussed with the Bank for possible implementation.
4. Cofinancing
One of the special characteristics of this project was the
substantial cofinancing supporting it. In addition to the Bank, the ADB,
Germany/KfW, Japan/OECF and suppliers credits were involved in this
project. Initial delays in procurement and project start up occurred due
to time taken in loan processing and effectiveness of the various agencies.
This has set a pattern which has helped in the follow up fifth
telecommunications project (Loan 2743-PAK) where in addition to the above
UNDP was also involved in its cofinancing. Coordination with these
agencies presented also special problems but were successfully overcome
mainly by establishing good liaison between the agencies particularly the
ADB and KfW and mounting joint missions whenever possible.
5. Reallocation of Loan
The reallocation of the loan as proposed by Government in March
1983 was after review accepted by the Bank in August 198-. The subsequent
reallocation proposal made by T&T in February 1987 was accepted in
principle for disbursement. The reallocations werc necessitated by the
reduction agreed to in the introduction of toll ticketing equipment and the
need for expanded cable networks to meet the requirements of the increased
exchange installations undertaken in T&T's investment program.
6. Financial Performance - Accounting
As a part of the 1979 reorganization, T&T was required to prepare
commercial accrual accounts in addition to the cash basis accounts which
continue to be the official form to be presented to G.O.P. T^ date the
commercial accounts are prepared only for the purpose of meeting the
requirements of the Bank and ADB. While substantial improvements have been
made since its introduction, the commercial accounts suffer from several
deficiencies. Some of the basic deficiencies are:
(a) Unclear determination of equity and loans to T&T resulting i'n
periodical adjustments. A tentative adjustment was made in FY85
to increase the amount of equity from PRs 1,093 million to PRs
4,794 due to the additional investments since 1981:
(b) Since amount of loans to T&T has not been decided, no repayment
schedule nor interest payments exists. Some tentative
arrangements and adjustments have however been made for repayments
to G.O.P. by T&T during the 1981-86 period; and



- vi. -
(c) No return on G.O.P.'s equity has been paid. The ratL of return
has not been fixed because equity is not deftined. The disposition
of retained earnings also is not decided.
Most of these are derived from artificial and provisional accounting
practices which should be reconciled and eliminated o5 a retroactive basis
when T&T becoa&es an autonomous corporaticn.
7. Performance of the Borrower
T&T has been sending regular progress reports to the Bank and its
performance has been generally satisfactory.
8. Performance of the Bank
The Bank played a positive role in assistance to T&T in
institution building by pressing on Government to give it greater fiscal
and administrative autonomy. Supervision missions were fairly regular and
the dialogue between the tank, the Borrower (the Government of Pakistan)
nnd the entity (TMT) was smooth, in all matters including procurement.
9. Project's Rate of Return
T&T did not review the rate of return in their report. Based on
the data provided by T&T, staff have carried out a review of the rate of
return in Washington. This review is contained in attachment to this note.
The revised financial internal rate of return is 18.7Z against the
appraisal e timates ef 26.42. The economic rate of return is estimated at
24.32 as against appraisal of 31.3Z.  The lower than appraisal rates of
return is due to higher incremental operating costs and 'ower revenuea
than projected, but still acceptable for telecommunications projects. The
major long distance microwave links in the project are due for
commissioning in FY89 only and the likely increase in revenues has not been
considered in the calculation of rates of return.
10. Conclusions
Although delayed for over two years, the project has been executed
reasonably within estimated costs. The project has made a positive impact
on international services and is expected to contribute to greater
reliability in the domestic long distance services as well. By and large
the performance of the Borrower has been satisfactory. Institution
building with a view to give T&T more fiscal and administrative autonomy
has been slow but recently Government  has introduced in Pakistan's
Parliament a draft Bill to convert the prwent T&T Department into a
statutory corporation. The financial per.ormance of T&T has been qiite
satisfactory. Overall the project was successful. The experience gained
in coordination with a number of agencies which were involved in
cofinancing this project has been very useful in the processing and
implementation of the follow up fifth project which is also supported by
substantial cofinancing.



- vii -
11. Lessons Learned
T&T has coped successfully with the increasing complexities of
financing of the foreign exchange part of telecommunications projects.
However the coordination with the different multilateral and bilateral
agencies and suppliers becoms every year more complex and difficult. The
lessons learned during the Fourth Project, reinforced during the ongoing
Fifth Project was (and is) that the complex financing transactions and the
related procuremnt activities requires added sophistication in the
handling of the foreign financiers and suppliers. Therefore, it would be
beneficial to create inside the DJrectorate General of T&T a small
specialized unit, to be responsible for handling complex financial and
procurement questions such as bidding with price and terms, and
coordination of mu'tilateral and bilateral sources of financing. The unit
should be staffed witti highly qualified staff which should undergo
specialized training in this area.

(LOUN 2122-PAO)
REPORT PRIPAUD bY TIM PAKISTAN TiT DNPAX&M?H
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     All local, long distance and international telecommunications
services in Pakistan are provided and operated by the Pakistan Telegraph
and Telephone Department (TT). T&T is also responsible for comercial and
amateur radio transmitters and for the control of the radio spectrum usage
involving regulations of frequencies in Pakistan and operation of a radio
monitoring service.
1.02     IDA has been involved in three telecommunications projects in
Pakistan. The first project (Credit 145-PAR) was approved in March 1969,
followed by two more (Credits 186-PAK, and 510-PAR) in May 1970 and
September 1974. In all IDA has provided a total of US$61.8 million for
development of the telecommunications sector. In April 1982 the Bank
approved a fourth project with a loan of US$40 million (Loan 2122-PAK)
which is the subject of this report.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     An application for a fourth credit was made by the Government in
November 1980. The project was appraised in February 1981. Initially an
IDA Credit was considered but later due to paucity of IDA funds and the
needs of other sectors of the economy a Bank loan was proposed.
Negotiations took place in Washington in December 1981. The Bank Board of
Directors approved the loan of US$40 million on April 1, 1982. The loan
agreement was signed on April 14, 1982 and the loan become effective on
June 9, 1982.
Proiect Oblectives
2.02     The main objective of the project was to finance T&T's four year
development plan covering the period July 1982 to June 1986. Due to
financial (limitation on available foreign exchange) and technological
(pending adoption of modern electronic technology for telephone switching
systems) constraints, the plan was divided into two phases. Phase I which
constituted the Bank assisted project included high priority works in the
overall four year period. In iddition the Bank assisted project also had
the objective of supporting the institution building in T&T particularly in
relation to commercialization of its accounting system and increasing its
productivity.
Project Description
2.03     The project comprised the following main items:
(a) Provision of local network facilities over the period July 1982 to
June 1984 for an additional 52,000 subscribers lines;
(b) Provision of toll ticketing equ¼,)ment for about 240,000
subscribers lines;

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-Up
3.01     The loan became effective on June 9, 1982 as anticipated as
appraisal. The preparation of bid documents for the cables under the Bank
loan were already in hand.. Procurement for the components cofinanced by
ADB, OECF and KfW had to await finalization and eventual effectiveness
which came subsequently.
Proiect Revision
3.02     The major changes in the project concerned the following two
components.
(a) Local cable network; and
(b) Toll ticketing equipment installation.
In the case of local cable network at appraisal it was envisaged
to provide for additional 52,000 lines. However T&T undertook expansion of
additional electronic lines to be purchased through bilateral agreement for
which financing of local network was required urgently and Increased the
cable network provision to provide for an additional 30,000 lines. IN the
case of toll ticketing, whereas the project provided for the facil'ties
required for 240,000 lines T&T proposed to undertake only 20,000 lines
under the Phase I project in order to test out the actual performance and
thereafter decide on further large scale expansion. These changes to the
project were accepted by the Bank. There was some minor changes in the
exchange and PCO allocations which have been indicated in Annex 2.



-4-
Procurement
3.03     Procurement of the items under the Bank loan which followed Bank
guidelines presented no unusual difficulties. The procurement under
cofinancing from the ADB, KfW and OECF followed their respective guidelines
and was satisfactorily executed.
Proiect Implementation
3.04     The original project implementation schedule covered the period
from July 1982 to July 1986. The commencement of project implementation
was delayed for more than a year (para 3.01). Annex 3 indicates the
schedule for installation and commissioning of major items as at appraisal
and as actually achieved. The project completion date can be determined as
June 30. 1988 from this review. The major components which got delayed
considerably and their current status concern the following:
(a) Addition of 3RF channels on Karachi/Rawalpindi and Peshawar and
Sukkur Quetta microwave system financed by OECF is expected to be
completed by June 30, 1988 as against scheduled December 31, 1984.
The main cause was due to delays in award of contract, survey and
installation; and
(b) Installation of microwave links between Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar
financed by ADB is expected also to be completed by June 30, 1988
as against scheduled December 31, 1986 about two years behind
schedule. The selection and acquisition of sites and civil works
contributed a major element to the delays.
Apart from the above (1) the accepta-ce testing of the 20,000
lines toll ticketing equipment is expected by June 1988 and (2) out of the
proposed replacement 9,000 lines of old Fl switchin- equipment, 3,600 lines
have been installed and the balance is expected to be completed by December
1988.

Annex 4 provides the details of the components of the project costs as
estimated at appraisal and currently revised in US Dollars and Pakistani
Rupees.
3.07     Overall the project cost in equivalent USS is about 19Z less then
estirated cost at appraisal. The foreign cost is less by about 6Z. The
main contributing factor is the cost reduction in the use of the
contingency provision brought about by the less than estimated prices in
procutement of the international facilities and replacement works, The
local cost increased only by about 42 over appraisal estimates. The
overall reduction in project costs in US Dollars equivalent also reflects
the devalued rate of exchange between the USS and PRs which occurred from
PRs 10 to about 17.5 to a US$ during the project period.

Performance of Consultants. SuPpliers and Contractors
3.10     The performance of the consultants approved for netwo_k planning
and computer applications was satisfactory. The performance of the
suppliers and contractors was also satisfactory.
IV. OPERATING PERFORHANCE
4.01     The project has brought into commission the relatively modest
expansion of local networks by about 52,000 lines. Most of this capacity
is expected to be utilized by the completion of project by June 1988. The
execution of TUT's program during 1983-87 has permitted an additional
260.590 subscribers to be connected during this period. In long distance
although somewhat delayed the expected commissioning of the backbone
microwave routes Karachi Quetta-Peshawar and the addition of the 3 PF
channels on the existing backbone route Karachi-Lahore-Rawalpindi and
Sukkur Quetta are expected to improve the domestic long distance facilities
and provide for greater reliability. Substantial additions to the main and
subsidiary trunk routes by increasing the number of channels from 8,741 to
23,879 and NWD centers from 54 to 69 during the 1983-87 period have also
contributed to cope better with increasing long distance traffic.
4.02     A substantial impact was made in the operating performance of the
int3rnational services with the Commissioning in October 1986 of the new
satellite station and gateway in Islamabad, thus providing a second
national gateway. Earlier in September 1985 the Lahore-Amritsar coaxial
cable was commissioned providing the link between Pakistan and India as a
part of the Asia Telecommunication network and improved communications
between the two countries.
4.03     The addition of 300 PCOs in the small towns and rural areas
provided greater access to the rural population to the national telephone
system.  The expanded telegraph network is facilitating faster and
increased traffic to be handled. T&T's Computer provided under the project
has been commissioned in 1987. The computerized system has taken over
telephone billing in the Western, northern, southern and Karachi regions.
The billing in the Central and Lahore regions is expected to be in
operation by June 1988.
4.04     The performance indicators at the end of each year from 1981 to
1987 as at appraisal and actually completed are indicated in Annex S.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     Performance indicators for T&T's operating results and financial
position during the six-year period of FYS82-87 are summarized below;
detailed financial statements are given in Annexes 6 to 8.

5.02     Actuals and forecasts Incore Statements for FYS82-87 are at Annex
6 T&T's operating results have been satisfactory and its financial
situation healthy.  The annual growth rate of operating income was 18?.
However, it was about 892 of appraisal except for the year 1986 when it was
672. Operating income during FY87 was more by 58Z than FY86.
5.03     During FYS82-87, the total operating revenue increased from PRs
2,347.8 million to PRs 5,560.2 million with an average annual growth rate
of 192, while operating expenses increased from PRs 973.0 million to PRs
2,369.6 million, with an annual growth rate of 192. The operating ratio,
however, improved from 412 in 1983 to 37.6Z in 1987. slightly higher than
the appraisal estimates.
5.04     Over the 1983-87 period, tl  total number of DELs installed had
reached 642,315 at the end of FY86 and 692,395 at the end of FY87.
However, the average income per DEL increased from PRs 6,610 (US$543) in
1982 to PRs 8,657 (US$496) in 1987, with an annual growth rate of 6?.
Telex revenue has shown heavy fluctuations against forecasts as well as
actuals of previous years. It is attributed to some erratic booking of
revenue in telephone receipts. Telegraph receipts are showing ire revenue
against forecasts. The yearly operating expenses for DEL (incLuding



-9_
expenses for telegraph and telex) increased from PRs 2,476 in 1982 to PRS
3,516 in 1987. The actuals were less than estimates except for FY82.
5.05     Repayment effect for long term Government loans to T&T has been
given in comercial accounts.  Provisional Government equity has been shown
in the accounts as the exact amount of such equity was not determined. The
FY87 accumulated amount for return on Government equity has been provided
at RS 2,100 million for projection purpose.
5.06     Up to 1979, the value of the renewal reserve fund, a pr vision set
a side on a cash basis out of T&T's revenues, interest bearing and
deposited with the Treasury, was computed at a rate of 3.172 of the gross
assets, irrespective of their nature. At the same time, in the accrual
version of T&T Accounts as prepared by T&T, the deprec4ation was calculated
at a flat rate of 5Z. Government of Pakistan has changed the method of
computation of depreciation from 1-7-1979 which has been based on the
nature of assets and on a life expectation fixed for each category
according to ITU's recommendations and usual practices. The new co-
efficients are considered satisfactory anid adopted in the 1980 accounts and
an average depreciation rate of about 5Z is computed.
5.07     Over the 1982-87 period the rate of return on average unrevalued
plant in operation was lower than forecast and its variations were the
direct consequence of constant tariffs. However, it was satisfactory being
30Z to 40Z.
5.08     T&T's financial position during the period 1983-87 is reflected by
the balance sheets given in Annex 7. A summary of T&T's financial position
as of June 30, 1987 is given below:

As of June 30, 1987 T&T's total net fixed assets, including plant under
construction, were PRs 11,132.1 million or about double those in June 1983
(and at the end of 1987, about as forecast). The plant under construction
has been estimated as half the construction program of ke year. The



- 10 -
assets in 1982 showed a marked variation against forecasts. This was a
result of inclusion in balance sheet of cash balances (TET fund) which
previously formed part of consolidated fund.
5.09     The debt-equity ratio was significantly favorable and the debt
service coverage much higher than the forecasts.
5.10     On June 30, 1987, the receivables for services which are
recoverable amounted to a total of about PRs 1,742.4 million, these fall
in categories: Federal Government, Government boards, public corporations,
local government, autonomous entities, private subscribers and foreign
administrations.
5.11     Since the introduction of cash system of payments for T&T bills in
government departments, the receivables against these departments have
increased partly due to shortage of funds with *hem and partly to their
lengthy procedure of payment. However, due to constant contact by the
Department with the Government of Pakistan, the period has gradually been
reduced to 180 days (of billing) as on June 30, 1987 as against 337 days in
1982 and 213 days in 1986. Efforts need to be made to reduce their period
further.
5.12     Private client accounts receivables which are collectible amount
to PRs 230 million and correspond to the ongoing monthly billing. This
indicates that T&T has no receivables problem in the case of private
consumers who pay their bills promptly in order to keep their telephone
installation, a scarce commodity in Pakistan.
Financing Plan
5.13     The statements of actual and forecast sources and applications of
funds for the period 1982-87 are given in Annex 8. Due to the delay in
commencement of project implementation of about a year (para 3.04) the
actual project period 1983-87 has been compared with the forecast 1982-86
period as appraised in the table below:

5.14     As shon in the table in Section 5.13, the construction program
during the pzoject period had been PRs 9,303.3 million as against forecasts
of PRs 8,716.2 million T&T's internal cash generation has sufficiently
financed its development program. Contribution to expansion ratio was
between 77 to 94 during the period which was very satisfactory.
5.15     With the inception of T&T Fund, the earnings are being retaLned as
equity resulting in improvement in debt/equity ratio from 32 to 4 oaly.
Tartifs
5.16     During the period the tariff had been constant and only the local
calls rates were increased on July 1, 1986 and that of manual calls in
1987. In addition, the rates of telex machines were adjusted and between
Rs 10,000 to 20,000 for different categories of machines w.e.f. March 1,
1984. The details of the tariff as of July 1, 1987 are given in Annex 9.
Accounting and Audit
5.17     Since its creation, T&T operated under a cash-basis accounting
system typical of government departments. Under this system adequate
information was not produced for T&T's financial management. The weakness
of the system was recognized by Government and IDA and under Credit
510-PAR, Government agreed that commercial financial statements would be
produced as from FY75. Such statements have been produced by T&T since
FY75 based on the cash accounts prepared by the Accountant General in
Lahore. However, T&T's cashflow was separated from the Government
Consolidated Fund from 1-7-1980.



- 12 -
5.18     As part of T&T's 1979 reorganization as a largely autonomous
department, TIT was required to prepare its accounts on an accrual basis
and a proforma TIT fund was set up as of July 1, 1980, within the
Government's Consolidated Fund. The responsibility of the accounting
function was effectively transferred from the Accountant General in Lahore
to T&T on January 1, 1981. By January 1981, staff from TIT and the Auditor
General's office had also identified all receivables and current
liabilities previously shown under suspense accounts awaiting
reconciliation. As from FY81 the TLT has been improving its financial
commercial statements. However the items like Government equity,
contribution to Government and debt service are still required to be
decided.
5.19     T&T's cash accounts were, since fiscal year 1975, converted and
consolidated into commercial accounts on an accrual basis by the Chief
Accounts Officer in Islamabad. These accounts of the TIT Department were
audited by the Director Commercial Audit, Karachi up to FY80. From FY81
the accounts are being audited by the Director General, Posts Telegraph and
Telephone Audit, both of them are under the control of Auditor General of
Pakistan. Accounts, can, however, be audited by commercial auditors, if so
ordered by Government of Pakistan.
5.20     The accounts up to 1986 duly audited have been sent to the Bank.
Unaudited accounts for the year 1987 have also been sent. The audited
accounts are, however, still awaited. It is understood that the Auditor
General of Pakistan has not yet certified the authenticity of the accounts.
5.21     In view of T&T's volume of operation, the Department has installed
its own computers at three stations viz. Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi.
T&T has started functioning operations on these computers and has chalked
out a program to take over different types cf work gradually, starting from
telephone billing (a part of which has been taken over).
VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01     The organization of T&T has remained substantially the same as at
appraisal. The current organization of T&T's headquarters and regions with
the names of the Principal executives holding the positions as on June 30,
1987 is given in the annex 10. At Headquarters a new System Engineering
Unit has been created recently with a Chief Engineer in charge. In January
1987, there was a change in the Chief Executive of T&T when Mr. S. A.
Siddiqui took over as Director General from Brigadier Mansoor-ul-Haq Malik.
6.02     As indicated at appraisal by July 1, 1981 the arrangement set
forth in the President's implementing order of May 30, 1379 were in place.
The T&T fund has been in existence since then, the responsibility for the
accounting functions and staff having been transferred with effect from
January I, 1981. Government have also attached a Financial Advisor in the
Directorate General with effect from 11-10-79. The arrangement have been
working fairly satisfactorily, however the need for greater fiscal and
administrative autonomy has been felt by the T&T in order to adequately



- 13 -
meet the demand for expansion and improvement of services. Goverwnment's
Deregulation Commission recommended that the T&T Department be transformed
into a statutory corporation for this purpose and currently a draft bill
has been introduced in Pakistan's Parliament for this purpose. It is
expected that the new T&T Corporation may be created by July 1, 1988.
Staff
6.03     At appraisal in 1981 T&T had a work force of about 35,300 persons
giving a ratio of 98 persons per 1,000 telephones. By the end of 1987 the
total number of staff stood at 42,315 giving a ratio of about 68 per 1,000
telephones which is a substantial improvement.
Training
6.04    TUT's training facilities are provided by the Telecommunication
Staff College, five regional telecommunication training schools and five
District Telecommunication Training Centers. The training schools are not
properly equipped t) give the courses needed in modern digital
telecommunication systems. An ongoing manpower study is expected to
determine and identify the training need for each category of staff. T&T
has made an application for support in training through an ITU/UNDP
Project.

PAKISTAN
TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT (T AND T)
FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.       TT's 1983-87 Investment Program has been taken as more accurately
reflecting the actual program period of execution for comparison with the
appraised 1982-86 period due to the delayed startup of the program of about
a year for purposes of economic revaluation.
2.       All components for the rate of return calculations are expressed
in PRs at FY83 constant purchasing power. For this purpose, a deflator
based on the CPI in Pakistan has been applied to nominal values of
incremental cost and revenue streams from FY83 up to FY87. As from FY88
onwards, incremental cost and revenue streams are assumed to remain
constant in real terms.
3.       The benefit per od extends from FY84 to FY05, when on average the
equipment provided under the program is expected to have substantially
completed its useful life.  No residual values Gf progras ed investments
have been taken into account as the FY83 present value would be
insignificant.
4.       As from FY88, operating costs and revenues related to the program
are assumed to remain constant in real terms. Incremental revenues are
based cn actual revenues up to FY87 and revised projections as from FY88.
Operating costs are based on additional assets and traffic generated under
the program, excluding depreciation and interest.
5.       A summary of cost and revenue streams at FY83 purchasing power is
given below in PRs million:
Incremental Operating               Net
FY      Capital Expenditures         Costs      Revenues             Revenues
83              1,454                    -           -               (1,454)
84              1,566                 132          423               (1,275)
85              1,418                 228          934                 (712)
86              1,553                 323        1,218                 (658)
87              1,620                 433        1,863                 (190)
88                380                 450        1,900                 1,070
89-95               -                 450        l,o00                 1,450
The above cost and revenue steams result in a financial rate of return of
18.7Z against appraisal return of 26.41.  The lower than appraised

financial rate of return is mainly due tu higher incremental operating
costs and lower revenues than projected due to the delayed commissioning of
major microwave links (para 3.04). Once this project equipment is
installed in FY89, long distance revenues are likely to increase. This
likely increase has not been considered in the above rate of return
calculation.
6.       The economic rate of return (excluding 40Z custom duties on
imported goods) is 24.3Z against appraisal return of 31.31. The economic
rate of return is likely to be an underestimate of the real economic rate
of return because:
(a) No increase in consumer surplus has been considered despite a
tariff decrease in real terms of over 152 during the project
period; and
(b) No increase in net revenues after FY88 has been attributed to the
FY83-87 investment program. Some of the equipment is still to be
commissioned (see para 5 above) and other equipment has ample
spare capacity and could handle substantially higher traffic
volume with inexpensive marginal investments. Therefore, the full
benefits of the FY83-87 investment program will not be obtained
before facilities are expanded under subsequent programs; and all
equipment is commissioned.
