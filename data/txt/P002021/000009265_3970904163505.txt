PROJECT PESFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
'1(;ERIA T;1l f: ':MIICATION PROJECT
(LOJAI 929-UNI)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the Third Education Project in
Nigeria for which a loan was signed in February 1974, providing US$54.0 mil-
lion equivalent. The last disbursement was made on April 6, 1984 and the sum
of US$16.8 million cancelled.
The audit report consists of (a) a Project Performance Audit Memo-
randum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and (b)
a Project Completion Report (PCR) dated October 28, 1983 prepared by the
Education Division, Projects Department, West Africa Regional Office.
The PPAM is based on material in the Association's files, including
the Appraisal Report (No. 60a-UNI) of May 25, 1973, the President's Report
(No. P-1174a-UNI) of June 11, 1973, the Loan Agreement dated August 16, 1973,
the summary of Board discussions, and the PCR.  Bank staff associated with
the project have also been interviewed.
The PPAM concurs with the main conclusions of the PCR but is some-
what more critical of the Bank's performance. The PCR is of good quality and
draws attention to major difficulties encountered by this project, most of
which were similar to those which affected the two preceding education proj-
ects (PPARs No. 79-327 dated May 8, 1979 and No. 81-955 dated December 7,
1981). A completion report has also been prepared by the Borrower (BCR); the
main text of that report is attached as an appendix to the PCR. The full BCR
is available in the Regional Office's files.
As is customary in the preparation of audit reports, copies of the
diaft audit report were sent to the representatives of the Borrower for
comment on April 18, 1984. No reply has been received from the Borrower.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
NIGERIA THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 929-UNI)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Third Education Project in Nigeria (Loan 929-UNI) provided a
loan of US$54.0 equivalent in assisting the Government to:  (a) expand and
diversify secondary education; (b) increase the output of primary and
secondary teachers; and (c) expand university education. The total project
cost was estimated at US$107.4 million. At the time the project was identi-
fied, prepared and appraised in the early 1970s, the Northern Region (subse-
quently divided into eight states) lagged considerably behind the rest of the
country in educational development. The project, therefore, was deliberately
aimed at the Northern Region (PCR, para. 2.16).
In 1979, at the request of the Government, the scope of the project
was sharply reduced to about one-third of its original size. The university
and primary teacher training components were deleted while the expansion of
secondary education was reduced-from 59 to 31 schools of which 13 were to be
new. However, the original amount of the loan was retained, in part, because
of high cost overruns.
The major factors which led to these changes in project scope
included:   (a) slow progress in implementation, which contributed to the
cost overruns;l/ (b) weak project management, both at Federal and State
levels; (c) the creation of new states, which delayed the establishment of a
strong project implementation capability at the local level; and (d) as a
consequence of the Government's newly gained oil wealth, Kano State and some
of the project institutions (e.g. Ahmadu Bello University) decided to pull
out from the project and to finance their components with resources obtained
from the Federal Government (PCR, paras. 2.19 - 2.22).  At that time Bank-
Government relationships were somewhat uneasy and in order to simplify imple-
mentation, extensions in Kwara State were eliminated.
The reduction in project scope was expected to expedite project
implementation and minimize  cost overruns.   These  expectations did not
materialize. Shortly after the project was amended in 1979, Nigeria's finan-
cial situation started to deteriorate sharply, thus constraining the avail-
ability of federal funds and seriously delaying school construction (PCR,
para. 3.13).
When the project account was finally closed in April 1984, only
US$32.2 million of the US$54.0 million (or 69Z) of the loan had been dis-
bursed. At the time of the project completion mission (February 1983), only
three of the planned 13 new secondary schools were completed, while the
1/   Inflationary consequences of the oil boom and a construction boom, not
foreseeable at appraisal, drove costs sharply upwards.



- vi -
others were still at various stages of construction (PCR, Table 3.1). Of the
18 school extensions financed under the project, eight were fully completed,
four others were 75% or more completed, while three schools were less than
50% completed (PCR, para. 3.11).   The extension to the Advanced Teachers
Training College in Sokoto was completed, but the institution is not training
technical subject teachers as originally planned (PCR, paras. 3.12 and 3.24).
This large project repeated several shortcomings of its two
predecessors:2/  (i) preparation and appraisal were telescoped in one phase
leading to deficiencies in project design, (ii) monitoring and supervision
were insufficient, (iii) local counter art training was inadequate, and (iv)
equipment and furniture were droppedT/ from the project.   There was very
little  institution  building  and  one  of  the  weakest  points  during
implementation was project management (PPAM, paras. 9-18).
As a result, the project has had very limited success. The drastic
reduction in scope substantially undermined the original project objectives
while the inadequate implementation further weakened the project's outcome
and impact.   The substantial progress in Nigeria's educational development
made during that period was largely unrelated to the project which in itself
contributed little to these achievements.
The major lessons emerging from this project, as well as from the
two previous ones, are the following:
--   In a complex federal structure and with an evolving relationship
between central and state authorities, such as was the case in Nigeria,
project design and preparation should be carried out very carefully and the
Bank needs to establish a proper balance in its relationships with federal
and state government levels.  The implementation capability of the Borrower
should be thoroughly explored, and important policy and social issues
clarified before the project is finalized (PCR, paras. 2.14, 2.15 and 6.08;
PPAM, para. 10).
--   It is important for the success of a project to (i) insure full
commitment and involvement of all parties concerned, whether at Federal,
State or local level (PCR, paras. 3.07, 3.08); (ii) carefully supervise
project implementation, arranging for appropriate staffing and timing of
missions commensurate with project size, complexity, and logistics of the
country (PCR, para. 1.21 and PPAM, para. 11); and (iii) retain furniture and
equipment among the items funded by the project when the latter is modified
(PPAM, para. 4 and PCR, paras. 3.17 and 3.27).
2/   It is fair to say that since all three education projects started de
facto nearly at the same time, there was little opportunity for the
lessons of the first and second projects to be reflected in the design
of the third.
31 Equipment and furniture procurement remained in the first education
project but were fraught with problems.

Other points of interest are the need to:  (i) focus on realistic
targets/assumptions at appraisal, in particular, as they relate to school
location,boarding and staff houses; (ii) train local project staff thoroughly
in Bank rules and procedures; (iii) give attention to the prequalification of
contractors (PCR, para. 3.21); (iv) carefully determine and monitor consul-
tant fees for architectural services; (v) insist on regular progress reports;
and (vi) specifically in the Nigerian context, encourage the States to use
the design handbooks as well as the procedure and management guides as devel-
oped by the consultant architects (PCR, para. 6.11).



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
NIGERIA THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 929-UNI)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
1.        At the time of project generation,  the authorities in Nigeria
strongly felt the need to develop the country's human resources especially in
the northern states where education facilities lagged behind those in the
south. Even with a relatively weak sector data base and without a long-term
strategy for educational development, some priority areas for external
support emerged during the dialogue between the Government and Bank staff
(PCR, paras. 2.05-2.08).
2.        Apart from the need to focus on the north, it was agreed that
quality improvement was a major objective and also that a limited expansion
of  the  secondary  and  university  levels  would  be  desirable.    More
specifically, the project had the following four basic objectives:
(a)  to  improve  access  to  and  enhance  the  quality  of  university
education;
(b)  to increase the annual output of teachers for primary and secondary
levels and for practical subjects;
(c)  to develop a relevant curriculum in primary education, responding
to special needs of the north; and
(d)  to expand and diversify secondary education.
3.        The project content was as follows:
A.   University Education (Ahmadu Bello University)
This project element was to provide (i) physical facilities and
equipment to the School of Basic Studies (which prepares
prospective university entrants), and to the Faculty of Education
(thus increasing output of primary and secondary teachers); and
(ii) eight staff-years of technical assistance and selected
equipment for a pilot program in 66 primary schools, to be provided
to the Institute of Education.
B.   Teachers Training Colleges
(i) Construction and equipping of eight new primary teachers
training colleges;
(ii) Expansion of 16 existing primary teachers training colleges to
incorporate facilities for training in practical subjects; and



-2-
(iii) Construction of two workshops and two staff houses at the
Sokoto Advanced Teachers College in order to Increase the out-
put of technical secondary teachers.
C.   Secondary Education
(1)  Construction and equipping of 19 new multilateral secondary
schools; and
(ii)  Expansion of teaching facilities for 40 existing secondary
schools.
More than half of the places provided in these new facilities were
intended for the teaching of science and other practical subjects.
D.   Project Implementation Assistance
Twenty-six staff-years of technical assistance for (i) supporting
six State Project Units, providing architectural services and
strengthening project management, and (il) planning and operation
of an education research and experimentation program at Ahmadu
Bello University.
E.   Studies
The agreement also required each of the four State Governments
concerned, to carry out, within two years of the loan signing,
detailed studies of their education policy and of certain aspects
of the education system.
4.        In 1979, the scope of the project was reduced to about one-thlrd of
its original size, while the original loan amount remained unchanged. This
was mainly due to (i) large cost overruns, and a slow disbursement rate, (ii)
an increased participation in education development on the part of State and
Federal Governments reflecting fast growing financial resources from oil
revenues. As a result, the university component (3. A above) was deleted
while other project components were sharply curtailed (PCR, paras. 2.19 to
2.22). The AmPnded project consisted of the following:
A.   Teachers Training College
Construction of 100 places for wood and metal workshops.
B.   Secondary Education
Construction of 13 new multilateral secondary schools, and exten-
sion of teaching facilities for 18 existing secondary schools. For



-3-
A and B furniture and equipment were to be financed by the
States._-
C.  Implementation Assistance
The consulting fees were increased while technical assistance was
reduced (i) to 14 staff years for architectural services in the
Federal and State project units and (ii) 4 staff years to prepare a
follow-on project.
D.   Studies
At the same time, the studies to be carried out iur the States and
to be financed from the loan were to be funded by the Government.
5.        Notwithstanding the sharp reductions in scope, the project was only
partly completed at the closing date (September 1983). By that time, only
three of the 13 new secondary schools had been completed, the others being at
various stages of construction.  Extensions to eight secondary schools had
been fully completed, as well as the extension to the Advanced Teachers
Training College. One secondary school extension was deleted and the others
were under construction (PCR, para. 3.10-3.12). While the project was
plagued by a series of physical implenentation problems, the educational com-
ponents have been carried out with a mixed degree of success. The secondary
project schools, although not completed, and lacking equipment in some cases,
are being used and their enrollment is not far from their appraisal targets.
While the expansion of the Advanced Teachers Training College in Sokoto was
carried out, no pre-vocational teachers are trained there, and thus, this
component has not achieved its goal (PCR, paras. 3.25 and 3.27).-
6.        The closing date was postponed twice and finAlly established as
September 26, 1983;1[ only 67% of the loan had been disbursed at that time:
the remaining US$17.8 million were cancelled. The total project cost
estimated by the completion mission is US$192.8 million (by December 1984),
35% over the estimate for the amended project and 79.5% over the estimate for
the initial project.
1/   It is not clear why during the reorganization of the project content the
Bank did not accept the recommendations of supervision staff, to keep
the financing of equipment and furniture within the project.
2/   Because several withdrawal applications sent on time by the Borrower
were not received by the Bank, the project account was reopened and dis-
bursement continued. The project accounts were finally -losed in April
1984.  The amount cancelled is US$16.8 million.

II. SELECTED ISSUES
7.        The Project Completion Report covers the experience with project
implementation exhaustively and analyzes the difficulties encountered with
project management at Federal and State level. It also covers adequately the
educational outcomes and broadly assesses Nigeria's educational achievements
during the project period, comparing them to the educational objectives set
out in the appraisal document.
8.        The audit memorandum therefore concentrates on four selected issues
which eerge from this experience and which offer lessons for future
education projects:  bank performance, evolving responsibilities of Federal
and State Governments, commitment of the Borrower, and shortcomings of
project management and in physical implementation.
A. Bank Performance
9.        The PCR suggests that the main reasons for the unsatisfactory
project results were insufficient commitment on the part of the Borrower and
flaws in the project design. The audit agrees that these two elements were
crucial, but considers factors relating to project generation, monitoring and
supervision of equal importance.  In each instance, the Bank's performance
appears to have been less than adequate.
10.       Insofar as pr'3ject design is concerned, it is noted that in a
country with complex institutional and geographical/logistic problems, the
design could have been simpler and greater care could have been taken to
insure a thorough preparation and appraisal (PCR, para. 6.08). The experi-
ence with this project underscores the risk involved in launching a project
(i) with seven geographically dispersed project units, (ii) without timely
identification and proper training of project managers, (iii) before resolv-
ing policy issues at State levels, and (iv) at a time when responsibilities
between Federal Government and States concerning education and finance were
still evolving. Telescoping preparation and appraisal in one phase contri-
buted to the difficulties encountered later on.
1i.       Despite the foreseeable problems caused by the unsatisfactory proj-
ect preparation and appraisal, subsequent supervision and monitoring were
weak, which compounded these problems. The PCR highlights the irregular and
unsystematic supervision (PCR, para. 1.21) of what became a project with
eight different project units dispersed in the northern part of the country
and a Federal project unit in the capital. The missions made a commendable
effort to visit State capitals but could not make sufficient visits to proj-
ect sites.   This raises once more the budgetary and staffing constraints
faced by Regional Offices in mounting adequate supervision missions.   The
size and complexity of this particular project would have required above
normal supervisory resources. The missions concentrated heavily on the hard-
ware side, with architects and engineers, during a period of spectacular
changes in national education policies: during nearly four years (early 1977
to the end of 1980) 11 consecutive supervision missions went to Nigeria with-
out an educator. When the project was amended, equipment and furniture were



- 5 -
dropped from the loan, despite experience gained by the Bank which demon-
strated the risk of concentrating on civil works only.  Project monitoring
was also less than adequate as reflected in (i) the lack of thorough training
in Bank procedures of project managers (PCR, para. 3.06),3/ and (ii) a lack
of initiative on behalf of the Bank to help the Borrower overcome its
problems in financial management of the project.4! The availability of a
special account (revolving fund) might have eased financial management
problems. The monitoring function could have been strengthened if the Bank
had more firmly, and from the start insisted on timely progress reports.
Changes in the Bank's operational management and discontinuity in staff
assigned to the project added to the disappointing performance.
B. Evolving Responsibilities of Federal and State Governments
L2.       The changing and sometimes unclear institutional responsibility of
State and Federal Government for educational and financial matters created
serious  problems  for  the  implementation  of  the project.    The  complex
relationship inherent in a federal structure was exacerbated because during
the period of the project the relationship between the Federal and State
Governments was being redefined (PCR, para. 6.08):   (i) On the one hand,
there  was  a  shift  towards  greater  autonomy  for  local  administration
especially in the field of primary education (which became the responsibility
of newly created local Governments).  This was reflected in the absence of
federal grants for primary education in the Fourth Education elan and there
was a rapid quantitative expansion of this level of education;/ (PCR, para.
5.07), but the primary teacher training component was dropped from the
project.6/ Hovever, the transfer of effective authority for implementation,
from Federal to State Government was not always accompanied by a readiness of
the State administrations to assume this new role; (ii) on the other hand,
the Federal Government strengthened its role in shaping educational policy
and in the allocation of financial resources to the sector. This is illus-
trated by the promulgation of new national education policies in 1977 and in
1981 and by the spectacular growth in Federal recurrent expenditures for
education7/ (PCR, para. 5.06).  Despite some efforts during implementation
3/   Some efforts were made by the Bank but frequent staff changes negated
these.
4/   The  Borrower's  completion  report  -   foreword  and  paras.  6.4-6.8
emphasizes the difficulties encountered by lack of sound financial
management and control.
5/   Which was called for by the change to UPE.
6/   Government,  however,  began an expanded  crash  program  for training
primary teachers needed for the UPE and did away with the need for the
proposed study on alternatives to formal primary schooling, included in
the project.
7/   In fact, Nigeria committed a very high lOZ of its GDP to education
(Federal - State - Local) during the period of project implementation.



- 6 -
the Baak did not succeed in striking the proper balance in its relationships
with the Federal and State Governments.
C. Commitment of Borrower
13.       Lack of commitment from the states (and to a lesser extent from the
Federal Government) was a major obstacle for implementing the project.8/
The State Governments remained ambivalent towards the project objectives,
having been largely bypassed at appraisal (PCR, paras. 1.04 and 2.15) and not
having been adequately consulted by federal authorities on important aspects
of project implementation.   In addition, the strong federal drive towards
educational development tad a temporary but substantial increase in state
revenues (mainly from petroleum exports) induced some of the State agencies
participating in the project to avoid what was perceived as cumbersome World
Bank procedures and use their own resources instead.
14.       This lack of commitment clearly contributed to the shortcomings of
the project. For example, (i) state project units and their managers were
weak, and difficulties arose in staffing them properly and on time, which had
repercussions for procurement and disbursements; (ii) later on, when the oil
boom subsided and public revenue became more scarce, the states did not make
adequate budgetary provisions for the project; even the block grants made by
the Federal Government were amalgamated with the states' general revenues and
not made available for the project. This resulted in contractors not being
paid and consequent delays in construction; and (iii) most states failed to
produce topographic surveys and soil tests (PCR, para. 3.17).   Inadequate
commitment at the federal level was illustrated by the failure to strength-
en the federal project office by hiring an architect/engineer and an
accountant.
D.   Shortcomings of Project Management and in Physical Implementation
15.       The PCR stresses that the federal project office and most of the
state project units have been weak, mainly at the technical level but also in
terms of their administrative status. This weakness has been another major
constraint to project implementation and resulted in inadequate supervision
of construction. Moreover, no progress reports were sent to the Bank by the
project units.
16.       The PCI analyzes the various aspects of physical implementation and
suggest a variety of reasons for shortcomings and delays. The Audit would
like to emphasize several aspects in the implementation process which deserve
special attention.
17.       In the first place, in reorganizing the content of the project,
equipment and furniture were dropped from the disbursement process (PCR,
para. 2.23), obviously to reduce project costs but probably also for reasons
8/   The project spanned a period of four different national governments and
successive governments cannot be expected to be as committed as its
predecessor to a project which it had no hand in formulating.



of administrative convenience, as it became evident that the detailed moni-
toring by the Bank of procurement would become too formidable a task. The
decision to drop equipment and furniture is difficult to justify especially
in light of the supervision mission's observation that 'too often buildings
and extensions are left idle, sometimes for years, because of an inability to
carry through with the additional inputs necessary to put facilities into
usen.9 J   Similar difficulties were experienced in the first two Nigerian
education projects but because the three projects were implemented almost
simultaneously, there was little opportunity for feedback.
18.       Furthermore, the award of civil works contracts has been less than
satisfactory:   about half of the contracts had problems or showed poor
performance. It also seems that, because of the construction boom following
Nigeria's rapid growth of oil revenues, the project could only attract
marginal contractors, without the required experience, capital and technical
competence (PCR, para. 3.21).
19.       On balance, the audit concluies that the project has not been suc-
cessful.    The drastic  reduction in  scope substantially undermined the
original project objectives while the inadequate implementation further
weakened the project's outcome and impact.   The fact,  that substantial
progress was made in Nigeria' s educational development during the project
period was largely unrelated to the project itself which contributed little
to these achievements.

I. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Background
1.01     The Third Education Project in Nigeria (Loan 929-UNI) provided a loan
of $54.0 million equivalent to the Government to expand and improve education
in the former Northern Region. Specifically, the projeet aimed at: (a)
expanding and improving primary and secondary teacher output; (b) expanding
and diversifying secondary education; and (c) expanding university education
at Abmadu Bello University. The project was approved by the Bank's Board of
Executive Directors in June 1973, and became effective in January 1975.
1.02     The scope of the project was reduced drastically in 1979 in response
to large cost overruns and protracted implementation delays. Even in its
reduced form, the project was not implemented fully. The Project account was
closed in September 1983, 57 months after the original closing date, with only
$36.2 million of the $54.0 loan amount disbursed. The remaining $17.8 million
was cancelled. The principal features of the project are summarized belaw
under the headings project generation, project implementation, and project
outcome. The principal lessons which can be derived from the project are
Lighlighted under Lessons Learned and Conclusions (Chapter VI).
Project Generation
1.03     Project generation began in September, 1971, with a Unesco
identification mission. The mission was unable to formxlate a design of a
possible project. However, the mission produced a lengthy list of possible
project components which served as a basis for the Bank's continued dialogue
vith the Government. Subsequently, the Bank sent a reconnaissance mission in
February 1972 to -ore precisely identify project components (para. 2.13).
Throughout project generation, the Bank and the Government were in agreement
that the project should concentrate on the north, where education was less
developed than in the south. Further, there was a consensus that the project
should address quality improvement (through better preparation of teachers)
and that limited efforts would be made for expanding enrollments at the
secondary and university levels.
1.04     On the basis of these agreements, the Bank fielded a combined
preparation and appraisal mission in Nay 1972, three months after the return
of the reconnaissance mission. The appraisal mission operated under severe
time constraints: it was unable to visit most of the project sites, or to
discuss in detail project implementation arrangements with state officials and
resolve policy differences between the Dank and some of the state Governments
(such as those pertaining to boarding facilities and staff housing). Perhaps,
because of these limitations, the project received insufficient attention and
commitment from state Governments (para. 2.15).
1.05     The project that was eventually appraised had the following
components:
(a)  Teacher Trining.  Construction and equipment of eight new primary
teacher training colleges (4,000 places) and expansion of 16 existing
colleges (8,000 places); expansion of one advanced teachers college



- 12 -
to train annually 100 practical subject teachers;
(b) University Education. Expansion and improvement at Ahmadu Bello
University;
(c) Secondary Education. Construction and equipment of 19 new secondary
schools (13,000 places) and expansion of 40 existing secondary
schools (25,000 places);
(d)  Policy Studies.  Agreement with each State to undertake four policy-
oriented studies;
(e) Project Implementation. 18 manyears of technical assistance for 6
state project unLits and for architectural services for the federal
project unit. (+ 8 manyears for ABU)
Project Implementation
1.06     From the beginning, the project was beset by a host of problems.
First, it took over 15 months after loan signing to become effective, as the
Government was unable to meet the principal condition for loan effectiveness
(i.e., appointment of architects). Once the loan became effective, a nuaber
of factors made it difficult for the Project Office to carry out its
responsibilities. (These included inadequate resources, a shortage of full-
time project staff, insufficient authority and a high turnover of Project
Directors). At the state level, these difficulties were further exacerbated
with the creation of new states which delayed further the establishment of
Project Units and the appointment of project staff.
1.07     Amendments to the Project.  In 1979, at the request of the
Government, the scope of the project was sharply reduced to about one-third of
its original size, while maintaining the original amount of the loan. The
following factors contributed to the decision to amend the project: (a) slow
progress in project implementation, resulting in potentially high cost
overruns; (b) weak project management, which led to an extremely slow rate of
disbursements; (c) the Government's improved financial capacity which tempted
some of the project entities (e.g., Abmadu Bello University) to withdraw from
the project in favor of direct Government financing of their components; and
(d) an overextended construction industry, and overextended managerial and
administrative capacities during the "oil boom."
1.08     The revised project concentrated on secondary school expansion, but
on a reduced scale (with construction of 13 new schools and the expansion of
18 secondary schools and one advanced Teachers Training College). The
university and primary teacher training components were dropped. The
technical assistance component was reduced and the policy studies were no
longer financed from the loan, as the Government undertook to finance these
with its own resources.
1.09     The revised project, though greatly reduced in scope, was estimated
to cost more that the original project, as prices had risen sharply throughout
Nigeria during the oil boom period. The estimated total cost was US$142.2
million (compared to US$107 million), of which half was foreign exchange
cost. As the loan amount was kept at the same level (US$54 million), this



- 13 -
resulted in reducing the Bank's share from appro-imately 50% to only 37%.
1.10.    It was anticipated that the reduction in project cost would speed up
implementation and contain cost overruns. This expectation did not
materialize. Shortly after the project was amended in 1979, Nigeria's
financial situation started to deteriorate sharply. The federal and state
Governments found it increasingly difficult to finance local costs, and to pay
contractors on time. Construction was often interrupted when contractors were
not paid for long stretches of time; so e were forced to abandon construction
sites.
1.11.    The project account was closed in September 1983, almost 10 years
after original loan effectiveness, and 42 months after the loan was amended.
At the time of Project Closing, only US$36.2 million of the US$ 54.0 million
(67%) of the loan was disbursed. The remaining US$17.8 million loan amount
was cancelled.
1.12.    At the date of Project Closing, only three of the 13 new secondary
schools that were included in the revised project were completed (Toro, Donga
and Illela). The rest were at various stages of completion -- ranging from
37% (Udei) to (83%) Ikara (Annex 1-1). Eight of the 18 secondary schools aud
the advanced Teachers Training College that were extended were fully
completed, and another four were 75% or more completed. On the other hand,
three schools were less than 50% completed (para. 3.11), and one school was
deleted because of misprocurement.
1.13.    Architectural Services.  The consultants' task of preparing
architectural designs was complicated by difficulties in obtaining Government
and Bank clearances (particularly after the creation of new states), by the
failure of most states to furnish topographic surveys and soil tests, and by
cost reductions after designs had been completed. On the whole, the designs
developed by the consultants were straightforward and functional and the
construction drawings, specifications and bills of quantities were of good
professional quality. Teaching accommodations generally adhered to the agreed
recommendations (paras. 3.15 and 3.16).
1.14.    Consultant Fees.  In accordance with local practice, the consultants'
contract provided for three phases of fees to be determined as percentages of
total construction costs, with an allowance made for repetitive work.
However, in retrospect the agreed percentages seem to be generous and not to
have taken into account the large number of identical or similar accommodation
components. Fees for supervisory services were 'open ended' in that they were
to be adjusted to the costs of contracts to be awarded, even if construction
was not completed. Greater care should have been taken in determining and
monitoring consultant fees.
Implementation of Educational Components
1.15.    Secondary School Expansion was the most important element left after
the project was amended. As many of the project-assisted schools are not yet
complete, it would be unrealistic to expect that they are attaining appraisal
enrollment targets in all instances. Yet many of the partially completed
schools are already being used, even those (such as Udei) which are less than
50% completed. Of the 13 new schools constructed under the project, the most
recent enrollment shows that those schools have reached 84% of appraisal
targets (Table 3.1). Enrollment rates for the 18 secondary schools expanded



- 14 -
under the project are not available, but Judging from the expansion of
secondary education in the northern states as a whole, appraisal targets have
probably been attained, if not exceeded (paras. 3.25-3.26).
1.16.   Diversification.  The project assisted the extension of the Advanced
Teachers Training College, Sokoto, for the purpose of training technical
teachers. Even though physical facilities are completed, the component has
not achieved its goal, as the state (Sokoto) does not as yet have a clear-cut
policy on which institution to use for training technical teachers (para.
3.27).
1.17.   Poliey Studies. The states were required to undertake four policy-
oriented studies. After considerable discussion with the Bank, it was agreed
that three of the studies (review of primary teacher training, financing plans
for educational expansion and demand for technical teachers) had been met by
studies that were conducted by the stat3s to meet specifically other
objectives. The fourth study (the need for boarding facilities) was
undertaken by one state (Kano) and the Bank considered that study applicable
for all states (paras. 3.28 and 3.29).
Educational Outcome
1.18.   In view of the tremendous social, political and economic changes that
took place in Nigeria during the long implementation period of this project
(1973-1982), it is virtually impossible to single out educational outcome
directly attributable to this project. Even though the physical components of
the project were only partially implemented, and only 67% of the loan amount
was disbursed, it should be noted that the enrollment objectives stated in the
original project and later taken over by the borroaer have been substantially
achieved across the country, and more specifically in the northern states. In
certain respects, such as expansion of secondary education, teacher training
and university education, the progress achieved through the Government's own
resources has been well beyond what had been projected at appraisal. For
instance, at appraisal secondary school enrollment for the northern states was
projected at 179,000 for 1982. The actual 1982 figure was in excess of
320,000. The comparable figures for primary teacher training are 28,000 and
144,000, and for university education, 17,000 and 24,000 (Table 5.2).
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
1.19     Three significant lessons emerge from implementation of the
project. These pertain to: (a) the Government's commitment; (b) the Bank's
performance; and (c) flaws in project design.
1.20     Government Commitment. The anomaly in performance between the
project institutions, and what the (federal, state and local) Governments were
able to achieve with their own resources raises a major question regarding
commitment to the project. At a time when federal and state Governments were
substantially increasing their investments in education, the project was beset
by financial difficulties. Further, the federal and state governments did
appoint project managers (after long delays), but did not provide them with
sufficient staff, resources and authority to manage the project (paras. 2.18
and 6.04).



15 -
The Bank's Performance
1.21     Bank supervision missions were irregular and unsystematic, in
particular in the early stages of project implementation. At times,
differences of opinion between the Bank and project management made it
difficult to organize missions.  Mission composition was heavily biased in
favor of architects and engineers. (The latter accounted for 65% of
supervision time). In contrast, educators accounted for less than 15% of
supervision time. While serious procurement and hardware or physical
implementation problems were the cause, the result was that educational issues
received only marginal attention in a period when Nigeria passed through an
extraordinary educational upsurge.
Flaws in Project Design
1.22     The project was dispersed over a large area and was under the
jurisdiction of six 1 / state Governments, with the federal Government as a
coordinator. Inevitably, such a large geographical and institutional
dispersion and the complex relationships inherent in a federal Government
structure contributed to difficulties in project implementation and
supervision.
1/   Later on there were eight states involved.

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socioeconomic Setting
2.01     Countrywide.  The project was appraised in May 1972, and was designed
to support the federal Government's goal of bringing national unity and
strengthening coherence among the federated states. It focused on six
northern states. 21 The specific purpose was the redressing of imbalances of
educational opportunities for most of the disadvantaged states, an important
element of national education policy.
2.02     In 1972, with a population estimated at 70 million, 2/ and a land
area almost four times that of Great Britain, Nigeria has been a country
marked with large regional differences. The three dominant ethnic groupe, the
Yorubas, Ibos, and Hausas, inhabited the western, eastern, and northern
regions respectively, and spoke different languages. The per capita income,
increasing at a rate of 8% per annum, was still under US$100 in 1972, while
the population was also growing at 2.5% per annum.
2.03     The Government was federally structured with strong administrative
control over the states on policies, revenues, and external relations.
Moreover, the states were expected to implement policy decisions taken at
federal level.
2.04     The economy was based on a slowly developing agricultural sector
accounting for 50% of GDP and employing 70% of the labor force. However,
there was an upsurge in the growth of the nonagricultural sectors, (about 10%
a year during the 1960s), due to continuing industrial progress and growth in
the petroleum sector. Yet Nigeria will remain, for many years, a poor country
-- its per capita income at best doubled to US$200 by 1980 -- and will
continue to be plagued with the problems of inequitable distribution of growth
between sectors, regions, and rural and urban areas.
2.05     Northern States.  At appraisal, the northern states were the most
disadvantaged. Programs for economic, social, and cultural development
evolved only very slowly. Subsistence agriculture, together with some
1/   The six northern states are:  Benue Plateau, Kano, Kwara, North-
Central, North-Eastern, and North-Western. Subsequently, the six states
were further broken down to create three more states. Only two states
remained substantially intact: Kwara and Kano. Of them, Kano
subsequently withdrew from the project (paras. 2.20 and 2.22).
Consequently, the data for determining the comparative progress achieved
within the demarcated states during implementation period has been
difficult to gather.
2/   Although other estimates at that time had placed the population to
11 million lower (UN) and 13 million lower (NigerLan Institute of Social
and Economic Research).

commercial agriculture, contributed to about 70% of GDP and employed 80% of
the labor force, compared to the national average of 50% and 70%
respectively. Programs for development were hampered by inadequate
coordinattion among states, a poor t#nr uport Infrastructure, a paucity of
trained local manpower, andc a meager tax base. The average per capita income
was about 40% less than that of the south. Moreover, despite the federal
subsidy for 80% of the northern states' revenue, the public per capita
expenditure in the northern states was only half that of the south.
2.06     Education Sector. During the time the project -was being identified
and appraised, (!970-72), one of the most pressing problems facing NigerLa was
the development of its hnman resources. The national enrollment ratios of
education were very low; for example, the ratio was 34% for the primary
school-aged group, and 4% for the secondary school-aged group. Less than 21
pupils per 100,000 population entered institutions for higher education.
Because of an insufficient supply of secondary school leavers, many of the
univeraity student places remaLned unfilled.
2.07     With the exception of the five-year plan, the country did not have a
long-term strategy for educational development. The curriculum emphasIzed
academic subjects excessively, impeded modern methods of teaching, and
prepared students mainly for .he civil service and other white-collar jobs.
There was almost unanimity among po)icymakers on the desirable structure of
primary education, type and length of teacher training, and on language of
instruction. Public resources available for education were about 3.5% of the
GNP.
2.08     The educational status of the northern states was even worse (see
table below). It was about one-third the national average. Moreover, there
was greater inequity and higher imbalances in quality between tne southern and
northern states.

2.09     The access of girls, compared to boys, was less than one-half for
primary education, and less than one-third for secondary education. Among the
primnry teachers, only 14% were women. More than one million students
continued their studies in unrecognized Koranic schools, compared to about
770,000 who were enrolled at the primary level. There were too few secondary
graduates to fill the places available at universities or other postsecondary
institutions.  Still, only about 30% of the primary school leavers were able
to proceed to secondary education. About 2% of the adult population was
literate.
2.10     The poor development of human resources had an acute impact on the
northern states.  About 20% of the positions in thv northern state Governments
remained vacant due to the lack of qualified candidates. The state Government
employed, at huge costs, about 4,500 expatriates to meet its manpower
shortages. Enrollments at the primary and secondary levels could not be
expanded, due to the lack of qualified teachers. The secondary education
depended heavily on expatriate teachers, vho accounted for about 40% of the
total teaching force. Instead of entering into teaching, graduating teachers
choose to proceed to the university, where the various faculties were
competing wilth each other to fill their places. The Abmadu Bello University
(ABU), the only institution of higher learning in the northern states, had an
enrollment of about 4,000. Yet each faculty at ABU had surplus places. In
contrast, the south had five universities.
2.11     Resources were also minimal.  The per pupil expenditure was extremely
low, about US$2.00, derpite the fact that education in northern states claimed
about 36% of t-he recurrent public expenditure, and its share of the
development plan (1971-76) was as high as 13%. This was primarily due to the
extremely low revenue base of the northern states.  fPrthermore, higher levels
of boarding and expatriates drained out the limited reources.
Project Identification
2.12     The first education credit to Nigeria (Cr. 72-UNI) for US$20 million
was appraised in 1966.  Fully disbursed, the project assisted in improving the
quality of secondary education by providing science laboratories, workshops
for technical training, and expanded teacher training throughout Nigeria. The
second education loan (Ln. 814-UIlI) for US$17.3 million was appraised in
1971. It focused on the same areas and grew out of the need for
reconstructing those schools included in the first project, but had been
damaged by the Civil War (1969-70) in eastern Nigeria. Nei'ther project had
concentrated on the needs of the educationally disadvantaged northern states.
2.13     Generation of the Third Education Project began with a Unesco
identification mission. The mission was neither able to recommend a rational
educational development strategy nor formulate a design of a possible



- 19 -
project.  Nevertheless, the Unesco mission produced lengthy lists of possible
project components.1/ The Bank decided to proceed with a dialogue with the
Government on the basis of this list, and mounted a reconnaissance mission in
February 1972 to identify more precisely the project components.
2.14     This mission agreed with the Government on three criterLa for the
definition of the project content.  First, it should concentrate on northern
states. Second, the educational standards would be raised, mainly through
better preparation of teachers and development of relevant curriculum. Third,
limited efforts would be made for expanding enrollment, especially for
secondary and higher levels of education.  On the basis of this agreement, the
Bank decided to field a combined preparation-appraisal team. To respond to
the apparent political urgency for immediately meeting the educational needs
of the north, the mission was also sent fairly early (May 1972), within three
mcnths of the return of the reconnaissance mission. The duration was also
limited, only four weeks in the field, leavLng less than a week to spend in
each of the six states.
2.15     As a result, the appraisal mission operated under severe
constraints.  First, there was little time to properly analyze the
reconnaissance documents and prepare the identification components. Second,
discussions with the state officials were hurried and on general terms, mainly
because the mission members were unable to complete some of the basic
appraisal requirements. For example, in the limited time left for visits to
the states, it was impossible for the members to visit all of the proposed
sites, or to reach agreements with state officials for establishing new state
project units. Third, the mission realized that there were many policy issueb
that still needed resolution, both by the federal and state governments. For
example, there was considerable disagreement within the states, and between
the Bank and federal government, on the necessity for, and the size of,
boarding facilities and staff housing. Rather than delaying or extending the
appraisal, the mission decided that those related policy issues be resolved in
the future by the conduct of several studies by the states (para. 2.18).
Perhaps because of these limitations, the project received very little
commitment from the states and was often viewed as a project imposed upon them
by the Federal Government and the Bank.
1/   It was later discovered by a Bank reconnaissance team that some of
the project components proposed by Unesco were not thoroughly discussed
with the Government and some of the items did not represent their
request. For example, one of the components related to upgrading of the
Koranic schocls in the north, a concept which the Federal Ministry of
Education rejected, since it felt integrating these schools into the
formal system was not a viable proposition. The Federal Ministry of
Agriculture considered Unesco's proposal to expand and upgrade the
Farmer Training Institutions as premature, since it was still assessing
its own training needs and preparing its own training plan. The Federal
Ministry of Finance did not support a proposed plan to expand the
Faculty of Engineering at the University of Lagos.

Project Objective
2.16     The strategy of the Second National Development Plan for 1970-74 for
education was directed mainly toward:
-    development of diversified curricula for primary and secondary
education;
-    accelerated expansion in enrollment for secondary education;
-    an expanded program for the training of teachers; and
-    continued development of university education.
The Third Project, as appraised, supported the above strategy but directed it
entirely toward the northern states.
2.17     Project Content. Four basic objectives were considered priorities
for educational development in the northern states and th6 project was
designed at appraisal to address thea. These were: (a) to improve access and
quality of university education; (b) to increase the annual output of teachers
for primary and secondary levels and for technical subjects; (c) to develop a
relevant curriculun in primary education, responding to special needs of the
north; and (d) to expand and diversify secondary education. The total project
cost, including contingencies, was estimated at US$107.4 million. The Bank
loan was for US$54.0 million.  The base cost of the project, excluding
contingencies, was US$84.1 million. The components included those which
follow.
University Education (US$5.32 million)
The project focused on three areas:
(a) School of Basic Studies. The project made provisions for
physical facilities. The goal was to better prepare prospective
university entrants as well as increase their number. The output was
expected to be doubled from 750 to 1500 students.
(b) Faculty of Education. Facilities and equipment were to be
provided to increase the enrollment by 280 (from 200 to 480). This was
designed to meet the demand for more primary and secondary school
teachers.
(c) Institute of Education. Provisions were made for eight
staffyears of technical assistance and selected equipment required for an
experimental practical work program in the upper grades of 66 primary
schools. The pilot study would help in adapting the primary school
curriculum to the needs of Northern Nigeria.
Teacher Training (US$17.63 million)
Programs were designed to increase output of teachers for both primary and
secondary levels.



- 21 -
(a)  Primary.  Provision was made for construction and equipment for
eight new primary teacher colleges to provide a total of 4,000 places, and
the expansion of 16 existing colleges to incorporate facilities for
training another 8,000 students in technical subjects.
(b) Secondary. To expand technical teacher training, provisions
were made at the Sokoto Advanced Teachers' Colleges for two workshops and
two staff houses. It was expected that the faculty would be able to train
100 additional teachers in wood and metal work.
Secondary Education (US$58.87 million).
Expansion and qualitative improvement of secondary education was the major
t'hrust of this component.  Provisions were made to build 19 new
multilateral secondary schools to provide a total of 13,000 places and
broaden the educational opportunities of another 25,000 students by
expanding enrollment and teaching facilities for another 40 existing
schools. Of the 38,000 student places, more than half were intended for
the teaching of science and other diversified subjects.
Project Implementation (US$2.23 m&111ion).
To facilitate the implementation of the project, provisions were made
for: (a) 18 staffyears of technical assistance for six state project
units; and (b) architectural services and federal project administration.
Policy Studies
2.18     The appraised project also included agreement by each state
Governments for the conduct of four policy studies.  They were concerned
with:  (a) review of teacher training policies, especially for primary levels;
(b) current practices on student boarding and staff housing, and consideration
for alternative policies; (c) an analysis of the long-term demand for
technical teachers; and (d) a plan for quantitative expansion of education in
Nigeria.  Each of the six states agreed to complete the studies within two
years of the loan signing. Moreover, 'the study on student boarding and staff
ho-asing (item (b)) was made a condition for disbursements for these
expenditures.
Amendments to the Project
2.19     In 1979, at the request of the Government, the scope of the project
was sharply reduced to about one-third of its original size, while the
original amount of the Bank loan was maintained. This was done to expedite
the implementation of the project and to take account of the changed sectoral
policy environment. Three issues were critical. First, slow progress in the
implementation of the project raised the serious prospect of high cost
overruns; second, weak project management led to an extremely slow rate of
disbursements; and third, some project components were absorbed in the
national UPE program.
2.20     Further complications arose during implementation when new states
were created and added to the project, while others withdrew. In February
1976, the number of states in the federation increased from 12 to 19. Of the



- 22 -
original six states participating in the project, two remained substantially
intact, and the remaining four were broken into six states. It took some time
to reallocate schools and other facilities to the newly created states.
Moreover, the new states also needed time to establish a viable administrative
structure and new project units to take over the responsibility of
implementation from previous units which had already started some phases of
implementation. Only by early 1979, were the new project units able to
appoint project officers and proceed with implementation of the project.
2.21     Furthermore, in the light of increased availability of fiscal and
foreign exchange resources, the federal Government gave higher priority to
educational development. In 1976 it launched an ambitious educational program
with the objective of establishing universal primary education throughout
Nigeria by 1980. The new program totally absorbed the project components
concerned with the training of primary teachers and was financed from local
resources. Given the federal push, some of the implementation agencies
considered that, with their substantial increase in revenues, mainly from
petroleum exports, they could proceed with the implementation of the project
components more rapidly and without following the usual Bank procedures. With
this in mind, Ahmadu Bello University and Kano State withdrew from the
project.
2.22     And finally, the delay in effectiveness overtook some of the events
planned. Por example, by the time the loan became effective in January 1975,
the Government had already begun implementing some parts of the components
with its own resources. The Institute of Education had already started the
primary school improvement study. The results of the pilot study were also in
the process of being adopted in the primary school curricula in each state in
conjunction with the federal JPE program.

college to train 600 technical subject teachers, and (d) technical assistance
for project implementation and for preparation of a new project.
2.25     The total cost of the revised project was estimated at $142.2
million, of which about half was foreign exchange costs. Originally, the
project was estimated to cost $107.4 million with a foreign exchange cost
estimated at about $54.0 million (para. 2.17).

III. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND I14PLEMEJTATIO1
Project Management
3.01     Federal Project Office.  The Federal Project Office was respcisible
for: (a) handling all matters involving other Federal Ministries; (b)
preparing progress reports for the Bank; (c) keeping financial and other
records on the execution of the project; (d) supervising the state project
units and coordinating the bidding process for civil works, furniture and
equipment. A number of factors made it difficult for the Project Office to
effectively carry out its responsibilities.
3.02     First, inadequate resources were allocated to project management,
and, therefore, staffing problems plagued the Project Office. The Loan
Agreement stipulated that there should be a full-time Project Director, a
full-time accountant and adequate support staff. In fact, the Project Offlce
was understaffed during much of the implementation. Not only was the Project
Director also responsible for the First Education rroject (until 1977) and the
Second Education Project (until 1980), but from 1980, he spent part of his
time on study leave. The accountant, who was not hired until the summer of
1979, was shifted to other tasks in 1980. In addition, the Project Office had
to share its support staff with other offices.
3.03     Second, the performance of the Project Director was hampered by
insufficient authority and inadequate access to the decision-making levels of
Government. The Loan Agreement stipulated that the Project Direct"r would
report directly to the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of
Education. However, to gain access to the Permanent Secretary, the Project
Director had to go through the Secretary of the Bureau of External Aid for
Education, the Assistant Director of Education for Student Affairs and Foreign
Aid, and the Director of Education.
3.04     Third, there was a high turnover of Project Directors, with four
directors over the life of the project. Fourth, it was difficult to supervise
the state project units because communications, poor in Nigeria to begin with,
were made even more difficult by gas shortages, air strikes and inadequate
travel funds.
3.05     At appraisal, it was decided that consulting architects were needed
to provide the Project Office with architectural expertise and to coordinate
the services of executive architects. However, this expertise was not
available to the Project Office because a decision was made to combine the
functions of the consulting architects with those of the "executive
architects," who were to be hired by the state Governments. Realizing that it
needed independent architectural advice, two architects were assigned to the
Project Office but they stayed little more than a year. Even while they were
in the Project Office, these two architects were prevented from visiting the
states because of a lack of travel funds. Thus, the Project Office had little
capacity to evaluate the services of the consulting and "executive" architects
throughout the project.
3.06     The state Project Units were responsible for site supervision,
preparation of reports and procurement of civil works, furniture and
equipient. The establisbment of the state Project Units was difficult and



- 26 -
time-consuming. As the state Ministries of Education in the northern states
had never implemented a Bank project, new Project Units had to be created and
the staff trained. Project Managers were not identified during appraisal, and
most of them were not appointed until the end of the first year of
implementation. Project Managers were hired although they had no experience
with Bank procedures. Their lack of experience resulted in significant
implementation delays. For example, the Project Managers had difficulty in
filling out and submitting withdrawal applications despite repeated assistance
by supervision missions and a visit from the Bank's Controller's Department.
While implementation delays occurred everywhere, some states performed better
than others. The better-performing states were distinguished by the fact that
they had greater commitment, as reflected in the cooperation of state
officials at all levels.
3.07     Staffing of the state Project Units caused delays, as it did in the
Federal Project Office. One of the conditions of effectiveness was that each
state Project Unit would have a full-time Project Manager and adequate support
staff. However, not one of these managers was able to work full-time on the
project, and none sought involvement of school principals in the extension,
furnishing and equipping of their schools. Thus, valuable feedback on project
implementation was lost. Often, school principals did not know how facilities
were to be used or what furniture and equipment to expect. Project
implementation at the state level was further delayed in 1976 when the six
northern states were divided into nine states. The creation of these
additional states meant that new Project Units had to be established. Project
Managers had to be identified, hired and trained.
3.08     Initially, the relationship between the consulting architects and the
state Project Units was strained because the Project Agreements stipulated
that each state Project Unit would select its own "executive" architects. The
decision to combine the functions of the consulting architects and the
"executive architects" was made at the federal level without adequate
consultation with the states. This decision weakened the commitment of the
states to the project and contributed to their belief that the project was
being imposed on them by the federal Government and by the Bank.
Project Implementation
3.09     The project account was closed in September 1983, about eight and a
half years after loan effectiveness, and 50 months after the project was
revised. Even after the scope of the project was reduced drastically, only
67% of the $54 million loan amount was disbursed. The status of implement-
ation with respect to the various components of the revised project is
discussed below, and summarized in Annexes 1-1, 2-1, 2-2 and 3-1. Annex 3-2
is a comparison of the planned implementation schedule with the actual dates.
Implementation of Civil Works
3.10     New Secondary S-:hools.  The revised project provided for the
construction of 13 new secondary schools. At the time of Project Completion,
only three schools were completed or virtually completed (i.e., over 90
percent completed).  These were:  Toro Government Secondary School in Bauchi
State; Donga Government Secondary School in Gongola State; and Illela
Government Secondary School in Sokot3 State. The other schools were only



- 27 -
partially completed (Annex 1-1).
3.11     Extensions to Secondary Schools.  The revised project provided for
the extension of 18 secondary schools. Of these only eight were fully
completed and another 4 were 75% or more completed. On the other hand, three
schools were less than 50% completed, 1/ and one school was deleted from the
amended project following misprocurement.
3.12     Extension to an Advanced Teachers Training College (ATC).  The
extension to the ATC at Sokoto has been completed and is in full use (para.
3.24). However, the facilities are not being utilized to train practical
subject teachers as had been intended at appraisal.
Cause of Construction Delays
3.13     When the project was revised in 1979 and drastically reduced in
scope, the country was experiencing an unprecented economic boom as a result
of a sharp increase in foreign exchange earnings from petroleum exports. The
consequent push for development projects overstretched the construction
industry to its limits and gave rise to a sharp escalation in construction
costs. The reduction of the project's scope was expected to expedite project
implementation and contain the anticipated cost overrun. However, these
expectation did not materialize, when shortly after the project was amended,
Nigeria's financial situation started to deteriorate sharply, and the federal
and state governments found it increasingly difficult to finance local
costs. As a result construction was often interrupted when contractors were
not paid for long stretches of time, thereby forcing some of them to abandon
construction sites. (See paras. 2.19 - 2.22.)
3.14     Other factors which contributed to the delay could perhaps have been
foreseen at appraisal. First, the loan was awarded when project preparation
was in its early stages, as was the practice at that time. Architects, for
example, were not selected prior to appraisal and their selection was made a
condition of effectiveness (which took 15 months to meet). Second,
implementation time was estimated at 5 1/2 years, which was the average time
for education projects appraised during this period. This proved to be
inadequate in view of the geographical dispersion of the project, the
implementation capacity of the borrower and Nigeria's communications and
transportation problems.  Third, the unusually complex conditions and
agreements -- which included the subsidiary lending arrangements between the
federal and the state Governments -- inevitably consumed valuable time which
was not provided for in the implementation schedule.
Consultants - Architectural Services Agreement
3.15     For each of the first two Bank-assisted education projects in
1/   These are: Ayangba Government Secondary School in Benue State;
Fandan-Kaje Government Secondary School in Kaduna State; and Kontangora
Government Secondary School in Niger State.

Nigeria, the architectural tasks of designing buildings and organizing and
supervising construction were divided and the component services supplied
separately by a number of consultants. In the First Education Project, an
expatriate firm was engaged as "consulting architects" to prepare a Design
Guide and local architectural firms were engaged as "executive architects" to
prepare detailed designs and bidding documents. In the Second Project, the
same expatriate firm was again retained as "consulting architects" but the
firm was commissioned not only to revise and expand the Design Guide prepared
for the first project, but also to prepare full construction drawings and
bills of quantities for all 'above ground" elements of all "standard'
buildings. The "executive architects" engaged by the states were commissioned
to prepare site plans, foundation designs, and for construction supervision
and the design of "nonstandard" buildings.
3.16     While an arrangement of divided architectural functions similar to
that above was initially proposed for the Third Project, jj it was
subsequently decided to conbine all necessary architectural services. Two
firms in joint venture, one Nigerian and the other Swedish, were selected in
October 1973. Because the deliberations on whether to combine all
architectural functions and the drafting of terms of reference were
protracted, the consultants were not appointed until January 1975. Since
their appointment was a condition of loan effectiveness, effectiveness was
delayed by 15 months.
Scope of Professional Services
3.17     Professional services included preparation of revised design
handbooks, procedures and management guides, as well as full construction
drawings and bidding and contract documents. The consultants were also
expected to assist in the preparation of furniture and equipment lists and to
assist in equipment deliveries and installation, and preparation of periodic
progress reports. Of these services, most of those relating to delivery of
furniture and equipment are still outstanding (Para. 4.03) and substantial
quantitites of furniture and equipment still have to be delivered, and some
still need to be ordered. The consultant's preparation of architectural
designs was complicated by difficulties in obtaining Government and Bank
clearances for submissions because of the reorganization of the states,
because of the failure of most states to furnish topographic surveys and soil
tests, and because of a cost reduction exercise embarked upon after designs
had been completed.
3.18     The designs developed by the consultants are straightforward and
functional and the construction drawings, specifications and bills of
quantities prepared are comprehensive and of good professional qua)lity. Apart
from the increased numbers of classrooms provided to satisfy state
requirements, teaching accommodations generally conform to the architectural
worksheets, whicn formed the basis of appraisal cost estimates (Annex 2-1). -
1/   Staff Appraisal Report, para. 5.03.
2/  The state P1D designs used for the construction of the two new
schools (Ikara and Jibya) in Kaduna State are considerably more
functional. Since they do not appear to be any more economical than the
consultants' designs in terms of space or construction standards, the
state Government's rationale in deciding to use them is obscure.



- 29 -
3.19     The consultants' contract provided for three phases of fees to be
determined as percentages of total project construction costs in accordance
with the existing regulations of the Nigerian Institute of Architects,
Engineers and Surveyors. The fees were to reflect reductions for repetitive
work. In view of the number of institutions with identical or similar
accommodation components (i.e., 60 secondary schools and 24 primary teacher
training colleges), the percentages of estimated costs agreed to as fees for
design seem, in retrospect, to have been generous. Fees for the supervisory
services were "open-ended" in that they were to be adjusted to the costs of
the contracts to be awarded, even though construction may not have been
completed. The fees actually paid to the consultants amounted to about
US$24.0 million and included, in addition to the services described in the
agreement, US$0.8 million for reimbursement of expenses, US$0.4 million for
resident site supervisors' salaries, and about US$5.0 million for additional
supervision services needed because the consultant's agreement had a time
limit and had to be extended. The total fees paid was 33% of construction
costs certified by the extended closing date and/or 23% of the estimated final
cost of the project at December 1982. Greater care should have been given to
project preparation and to monitoring consulting fees.
3.20     Contract Awards.  In line with the 1968 Companies Decree No. 51, (the
Indigenization Decree), only contractors or companies registered in Nigeria
were prequalified. To register, a company had to be incorporated in Nigeria
with a no less than 60% of its shares held by Nigerians. There is no evidence
that the Bank was requested to limit civil works procurement to local
contractors only, or evidence that the Bank accepted such a request. As a
result, procurement was not in accordance with ICB guidelines, as stipulated
in the Project Agreement. In 1979, the Bank and the Nigerian Government
reached a compromise on procurement guidelines for future Bank-assisted
projects.
3.21     Prequalification of contractors was performed by the consulting
architects. Although the consultants tried to prequalify only competent
contractors, many of the contractors finally invited to tender did not have
the experience, capital and technical ability to handle civil works
contracts. Out of 39 contracts, 12 were terminated and reawarded, three
showed misprocurement and six were abandoned.  Performance on the remaining 18
sites ranged from poor to satisfactory. In some cases, artisans and
businessmen were awarded contracts, thereby seriously jeopardizing the
objectives of the project. In future, more attention should be given to the
prequalification of contractors, and only those contractors who have
successfully completed similar contracts both in size and complexity should be
invited to tender. Performance bonds and Bank guarantees have little value in
Nigeria; penalties for delays are rarely enforced while contracts are
regularly adjusted for inflation.
3.22     Procurement of Equipment and Furniture.  The consultants monitored
the procurement of equipment and furniture and contracts awarded by the States
Tender Board. The Bank did not review the award of contracts, nor did the



- 30 -
Bank reimburse for equipment and furniture as these were not eligible for
reimbursement under the amended project.
Implementation of Educational Components
3.23     The project as originally appraised had four basic objectives:  (a)
to improve access and quality of university education in the north; (b) to
increase primary and secondary school teacher output; and (c) to expedite the
move toward diversification of the secondary school curriculum by expanding
the output of technical teachers (para. 2.17). The project also included
agreement by the state Governments to conduct four policy studies (para.
2.18).
3.24     When the project was amended in 1979, the university and prinary
teacher training components were dropped from the project and financed with
Government and university funds (para. 2.21). Enrollment in teacher training
institutions and at the university in 1982 far exceeded appraisal projections
for that year (paras. 5.13 and 5.15). Thus, the enrollment objectives set
forth at appraisal with respect to those components have been achieved.
Expansion of Secondary Education
3.25     Expansion of secondary education was the most important element left
after the project was amended. The revised project was to assist in the
construction of 13 secondary schools (for 8,000 new places) and expansion of
18 existing schools (for 10,800 new places). Although most of the new schools
are not completed, they are being used. This is a clear indication that the
demand for secondary places identified at appraisal still exists. In fact the
demand may be greater today than in 1972 because the massive expansion of
primary education through the UPE campaign is at present felt acutely at the
secondary level. Of the 13 new schools, the most recent enrollment data
available (1982) show that those schools have reached -aout 84% of their
appraisal targets even though only three of the schools are fully completed
(para. 3.10, and Table 3.1, overleaf).

3.26     Enrollment data for the 18 secondary schools that were expanded under
the project (para. 3.11) is not available. But judging from the expansion of
secondary education in the northern states as a whole, there is every reason
to believe that the appraisal targets have been achieved, if not exceeded
(Table 5.2).
3.27     Diversification. The project assisted in the expansion and equipping
of the Advanced Teachers Training College (ATC) in Sokoto to train technical
teachers for secondary schools. This component has not achieved its goal,
even though the physical facilities are completeA. No pre-vocational subject
teachers are being trained.  Several factors caused this to happen.  First,
Sokoto state, which was responsible for providing the equipuent for the
1/   School building less than 50% completed.
2/   Enrollment in dilapidated secondary schools that would be replaced
by the new facilities.



- 32 -
workshops, was unable to do so. As a consequence, the completed workshops
continue to be used as classrooms. Second, in 1980, Sokoto state relegated to
the Institutes of Tecbnology the task of training technical teachers.  The ATC
now concentrates exclusively on the training of science and art teachers.
Third, because of considerable debates on which institutions are better
equipped to train technical teachers in the state, only a few of the qualified
teachers sought employment in the ATC, and none were hired.
Policy Studies
3.28     Four studies were required for each state under the project. By
1979, the Bank had decided that the requirement for three of them had been met
by studies that were conducted by the states to meet other objectives:
(a) the study to review primary teacher training policies was waived
because the studies being conducted by the states in conjunction with
their preparation for universal primary education were considered
suffcient to satisfy the informational requirements of the Baik;
(b) the requirement for a detailed study of the financial plan for each
State's educational expansion plans was considered to have been
deemed satisfied by the atates' contribution to the Second
Develoument Plan (1975-W8); and
(c) the study of the demand for tec.hnical teachers was waived because the
Second Development Plan proposed the building of four new technical
colleges in the north. It was thought that the outputs of these
institutions would be sufficient to meet demand.
3.29.    The fourth study area was to have been an analysis by each state of
its boarding and staff housing policies for secondary schools and primary
teacher training colleges as a condition of disbursement of project funds.
The states maintained that the need for these facilities in the northern
states, where many school districts covered large and remote areas, was
obvious and did not require a study.  In fact, North Central State 1/ informed
a supervision mission that they would withdraw from the project rather than
build schools without these facilities. 1?nally, one state, Kano, did conduct
a study which justified these facilities. lt was considered applicable to all
states, thus satisfying the condition of disbursement.
1/   This state was subsequently renamed to "Kaduna".

IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
4.01     At appraisal, total project costs were estimated at US$107.4
million. The foreign exchange component was estimated between US$50.9 million
and US$54.0 million "depending on the outcome of international bidding" (SAR,
para. 4.19). The loan, amounting to US$54.0 million, was expected to cover
all foreign exchange costs. Table 4.1 below shows appraisal estimates of
project costs by component. The cost for civil works was based on the
contract awarded under the Bank's First Education Project; it was US$150 per
square meter in June 1972, plus 10% for physical contingencies and about 19%
for price contingencies.  (See also Annex 1-1 for "Civil Works Costs by
Institutions".)

Cost of Amended Project
4.03     In 1979, for reasons discussed earlier (paras. 2.19-2.22), the scope
of the project was reduced substantially, without, however, reducing the loan
amount. The Government agreed to finance procurement of furniture and
equipment so that the loan would concentrate largely on financing of civil
works and professional fees.

4.04     Even after the project was closed, construction was stili incomplete
on a number of project sites (paras.3.09-3.11). The Completion Mission
estimated that if the amended project had been about fully implemented by
Closing Date, 'the cost of the project would have been as estimated in 1979
i.e. US$142.8 million.  According to the Completion Mission it would require
an additional US$50 million to complete the amended project (December 1984).
A comparison of actual disbursements or certified Government costs, and
estimated project cost to complete the amended project is shown in Table 4.4,

Financing
4-05     At appraisal the Bank loan of US$54.0 million constituted 50% of the
total project cost of US$107.4 million. When the project was revised, the
Bank loan for US$54.0 million covered 36% of the estimated US$142.2 million
total project cost. The 1979 revision left some elements of the financing
plan the same and changed others. The revised loan continued to cover 44% of
the civil works expenditures, and 48% of the expenditures for architectural
fees and project administration.  The percentaga of technical assistance
financed by the loan was increased from 80% to 100%. Financing for furnlture
and equipment, which was 100% in the original Loan Agreement, was eliminated
when this responsibility was assumed by the Government.
4.06     Disbursements.  The first disbursement took place nearly six years
after negotiations, in the same quarter as the original closing date. Tbhe
rate of disbursement was less than half the projected rate. As September
1/   The costs by category were derived by prorating the mission's
estimate of additional costs needed to complete the project (i.e., $50.0
million).



- 37 -
1983, when the project account was closed, only US$36.2 million (or about 67
percent) of the US$54.0 million loan was disbursed, largely because
construction had been delayed (paras..312-3.13). Disbursements for civil
works were US$31.1 million, or about 44% of total certified expenditures for
civil works. Disbursements of US$5.1 million for architectural fees and
project administration were about 24 percent of total certified expenditures
for this category.
4.07     State commitment to the project was weak because the states were not
adequately involved in early stages and because they viewed it as the Bank's
project, not as their own (para. 2.15). As a result, state Project Managers
found it difficult to ensure that funds for the project were available in
budget estimates. Delays were then encountered because funds were not
available to pay contractors. The situation became so serious that in 1976
the federal Government stepped in and made a grant to the states to enable
them to complete the project. However, these funds were not distinguished
from general state revenues and, in most cases, were not used for the project.

V. EDUCAIONIAL OUTCOME
5.01     The implementation of the project spanned about ten years (1973.-
1982). During this period, substantial changes took place in Nigeria with
respect to: (a) framework of government-a shift from military rule to
civilian rule; (b) greater autonomy for local adnuinistration; and (c) a higher
inflow of economic and financial resources, mainly due to the export of
petroleum. Public commitment for education also gained momentum. Given such
substantial changes in social, economic, and political structure, it would be
difficult to identify educational outcomes arising directly from the
project. Hovever, it is possible to make a tentative assessment of Nigeria's
educational achievements duriAg this period, and compare-them to the broad
educational objectives stated by the appraisal mission.
5.02     Thls chapter has two sections.  The first reviews the countrywide
progress in education; the second reviews the progress achieved by the
northern states for those components which were modified or excluded from the
project in 1979. The progress of the components retained in the amended
project was discussed in Chapter III.
Countrywide Progress
5.03     A most notable feature in Nigerian education is the phenomenal rise
in enrollment for all levels. During 1970-82, the total enrollment in the
country grew annually at 12.3%, 18.3%, and 10.5% for primary, secondary, and
university education respectively (Table 5.1). Very few countries in Africa
have been able to demonstrate such impressive quantitative growth. But more
striking, the progress of the northern states for primary and university
education, about 19.5% and 16.2% respectively, exceeded the national average
and helped in bridging the gap between the southern and northern states.

5.04     The achievements reflect both the national consensus and official
policy that education is the most important element of Nigeria's development
strategy. Besiden the consensus, four factors have contributed to the growth
of education. They are:
(a) higher availability and commitment of resources;
(b) stronger role by the federal government in educational policy and
decision making;
(c) higher involvement of local governments for implementing local
education decisions; and
(d) greater capacity for analysis, planning, and research to develop
policies conducive to local needs.
5.05     Resources.  Nigeria committed on the average about 10% of its GDP 1/
to education, compared with 3.5% in the 1960s.  The 10% figure is probably
more than for any other country without a centrally planned economy. During
the third Aive-Year Plan (1976-80), education accounted for about US$4.9
billion, or about 12% of the planned public sector program. The allocation
for the fourth development plan (1981-85), US$13.3 billion, represents about
10.6% of the planned public expenditure program.
5.06     Federal Role.  The federal Government has played a stronger role,
brought in new policy initiatives, and has used its control over finances to
bring in substantive reforms. A national educational policy developed in 1977
by the Federal Government has been further reviewed in new educational
policies issued in 1981. The new policies have taken into account both the
anticipated needs for education and Nigeria's realistic prospects of meeting
its needs. Within the framework of the national policy, the Federal
Government launched, with heavy subsidies, programs for universal primary
education and related teacher training, expanded programs for technical and
vocational education, and assumed all costs of university education. The
proportion of federal recurrent expenditures on education grew from about 2%
in the early 1970s to about 40% by the early 1980s, an indication of the
significant role that the federal Government plays in educational decision
making.
5.07     Local Government.  Concurrent with the federal push for UPE, the
responsibility for the administration and maintenance of primary education was
delegated to the newly created local governments. In fact, a notable feature
of the Fourth Plan is the complete absence of federal grants for primary
education. Though local control has fueled rapid quantitative expansion, the
experience suggests that it has, however, limited its ability to maintain the
quality of primary schooling and prevent deterioration.
5.08     Analytical capacity.  Nigeria has been well endowed during this

period with a large number of educational research and policy institutes.
Besides the establishments of the Nigeria Education Research Council, a
network of researchers and academics across the country, there are institutes
of education in each of the seven universities. Moreover, specialized
institutes have been set up on educational technology, on school broadcasting,
and on curriculum research and development. Innovative institutions like the
Kano Educational Research Council, for example, have combined inspection of
schools with the development of educational materials. Their activities have
contributed both in absolute and in relative terms to the development of
relevant educational policies.
Progress in Northern States
5.09     During the ten years from 1972-82, much progress took place in the
northern states. In certain areas, such as expansion of secondary education,
teacher training and university education, the progress achieved through the
Government's own resources has been well beyond what had been projected at
appraisal (Table 5.2). This section will discuss briefly some of the
achievements made in the expansion of primary education, teacher training,
university education and policy studies. (See Annexes 5-1, 5-2 and 5-3.)

Expansion of Primary Education
5.10     During appraisal in 1972, enrollment at the primary level for the
northern states was extremely low, (about 770,000), accounting for about one-
fourth of the national enrollment. The appraisal mission observed that the
immediate priority for primary education was the development of curricula

relevant to needs of the northern region: increased equity in educational
opportunities between the states, rural and urban regions, sexes, and higher
rates of transition to secondary education. The project provided funds for
the Institute of Education to undertake an experimental work program for
primary schools (para. 2.17).
5.11     In 1976, the federal Government launched a program of free primary
education with the objective of making it universal throughout Nigeria by
1980. Although the program fell short of achieving its objectives, it had
significant impact in the northern states. Annual enrollment grew at an
average rate of 27%, with rates ranging from 41% to 23% among the eight
states. Compared to the projected enrollment of about 2.3 million for 1982 in
the SAR, actual enrollment in northern states in 1982 stood at about 6.5
million, accounting for about 44% of the national enrollment.
5.12     Two policy measures have contributed to the goal of achieving greater
relevance. First, the medium of instruction would now be either the mother
tongue of the child or the language of the immediate community. Second,
Ahmadu Bello University, with the assistance of the Federal Ministry of
Education and UNICEF, implemented a program for quality improvement. Largely
following the steps proposed in the Bank project, it included inter-linked
activities for review and adoption of curriculum, in-service training of
teachers, and distribution of learning materials in selected states from 1973-
78. As a result, better materials were developed for religious education,
social and creative arts, and Nigerian languages. Subsequently, the Nigeria
Educational Research Council received a grant to test the applicability of the
primary education quality-improvement program nation-wide.
Teacher Training
5.13     Simultaneously with the federal push for UPE, an expanded program was
mounted for the training of primary teachers.  The component related with
primary teacher training in the Third project was absorbed in the Government's
new program and was financed from local resources.  In 1979, a Bank document
discussing an amendment to the project stated that the project goals relating
to primary teacher training had been substantially achieved. 1/ The annual
enrollment of the teacher training institutions grew between 1976-80 at an
average rate 17.2%. In 1982, total enrollment in teacher training
institutions stood at more than five times that was projected at appraisal
(Table 5.2). This was due to the expansion of existing institutions as well
as the setting up of new institutions. The total number of colleges increased
from 98 to 125.
5.14     Rationalization of Policies.  Three measures were taken during the
last ten years. First, during the review of the national policy on education
in 1977, policies on teacher training were fully reviewed. The new policy
clearly defines several types of teachers needed for Nigerian education and
l/   Nigeria - Proposed Amendment of the Third Education Project (Loan
929-UNI), dated August 23, 1979.

their required qualLfications. Moreover, for each of the five types of
teacher training institutions, functions have been assigned and the length of
their training determined. Second, greater emphasis has been placed on
upgrading of existing teachers, as opposed to preservice training. The ABU
has taken a lead to implement these policies (para. 5.15). Third, the
teaching of science has been emphasized for colleges preparing Grade 2
teachers, mainly to increase their supply for elementary science teaching.
Overall, the ratio of qualified teachers has improved. Moreover, although
complete data is unavailable, there is adequate evidence in the states visited
by the Completion Mission that the dependence on expatriate teachers for
secondary schools has been substantially reduced, probably to about 10% of the
teaching force from about 40% in 1972.
University Education
5.15     Opportunities for higher education in northern states have also been
vastly improved. During appraisal, the ABU, the only institution for higher
learning for the region, drew an enrollment of 4000, accounting for about one-
fifth of the national enrollment. In 1982, the ABU was one of eight
institutions of higher learning serving the needs of the northern states. Two
more universities are expected to start at Gongola and Niger from September
1983. Collectively, in 1982, the northern universities drew about 38% of the
national enrollment, compared to 20% in 1972. Still the prime institution in
the north, ABU's growth is also impressive. Enrollment has almost tripled to
9,000, the number of departments increased form 49 to 74, and the teaching
staff has doubled to 2,000. About 75% of the teaching staff are Nigerians,
compared to about 40% in 1973. The ABU now draws about 15% of the national
enrollment.
5.16     The succeeding paragraphs outline developments which have taken place
in three University-related components of the original project, which were
subsequently withdrawn from the project by the University.
5-17     School of Basic Studies.  The School of Basic Studies (S3S) provides
a one-year tutorial program to improve the quality of entrants to university
education. The original project provided for physical facilities to enable
the university to double its output from 750 to 1500 students by 1978.
Subsequently, though the University withdrew from this Bank project, it
decided to proceed with the proposed project components from its own
resources.
5.18     By 1982-83, the SBS exceeded its enrollment target (Annex 5-3).
Moreover, the SBS has introduced several qualitative changes that were not
stipulated in the SAR. First, to meet the increasing demands on science and
mathematics teachers in secondary education, a new stream was introduced in
1976 for better preparation of entrants in science and mathematics. Moreover,
since 1979, an increasingly higher proportion of entrants has been channeled
to the science stream. Second, the criteria for choosing entrants from an
increasingly large pool of applicants have been modified. In 1982, about
20,000 students applied for about 1,600 student places at SBS. Three criteria
were chosen to encourage entry of girls, to draw students with high academic
achievement, and to attract pupils from poor regions of the northern states.
About 85% of SBS enrollment is selected from northern states. Third, the
faculty has been strengthened, and nov comprises 102 teachers, of whom 70% are



- 43
Nigerian.
5.19     Moreover, the SBS is well endowed with physical facilities.  The
school occupies two large administrative blocks. It has four laboratories,
each accommodating 150 students in physics, chemistry, biology, and geography,
and two lecture theaters. Because of the qualified staff and better physical
facilities, the University is now considering a proposal either to delegate to
the SBS exclusively the task of preparing entrants in science and mathematics
from FY84, or to convert the school into a two-year junior college.
5.20     Institute of Education.  During appraisal, the Institute of Education
(IE) was perceived as a vehicle to improve the upgrading of teachers and to
experiment, develop, and adapt a primary school curriculum relevant to the
needs of northern Nigeria. The Completion Mission has concluded that the
Institute has exceeded these expectations.
5.21     In 1973, the Institute, with the assistance of Unesco/ UNICEF and the
Federal Ministry of Education, instituted an experimental primary education
improvement program (PEIP), which was completed and evaluated in 1978. The
program helped in developing new learning materials. Where possible, it
adapted the existing teaching materials, tested them systematically in about
66 experimental schools, modified them as a result of feedback, and trained
teachers to use the new materials. Textbooks or curriculum were developed in
English, mathematics, science, physical and health education, social studies,
and creative activities. In each subject, opportunities were provided for
pupils to gain practical experience. An evaluation conducted by the
University confirmed that the revised learning materials and the concept of
intensive training of teachers has been well received. 1/ Moreover, a study
conducted by Kano State in 1978 demonstrated that students participating in
the PEIP program did better in national entrance examinations. Encouraged by
these results, the Federal Ministry of Education has now given a grant to the
Nigeria Educational Research Council to test national applicability.
5.22     Moreover, the Institute has become a leader for innovations on in-
service training of trainers. It is the principal institution for upgrading
existing teachers and closely monitors its training program to relate to the
needs of state ministries of education. The institute currently offers five
types of courses: first, a postgraduate diploma, comprising one year of full-
time study; second, a full-time NCE program comprising three academic years;
third, a part-time NCE program comprising five summer courses of ten weeks
each; fourth, an intensive course for the supervision of primary schools; and
finally, a mobile teacher-education program to upgrade practicing teachers
with no training experience. The institute upgraded, in conjunction with
three associated institutes, about 3,000 teachers each year between 1978-80.
5.23     Faculty of Education.  The faculty of education prepares teachers for

entry to teaching at primary and secondary levels. The Bank project
stipulated that enrollment in faculties would be increased from 200 to 480.
5.24     During the three years from 1979 to 1982, the enrollment at the
faculty exceeded 1200 students. At least one-third came from the School of
Basic Studies, one-half were teachers upgraded by the Institute of Education,
and the remaining students were admitted directly from secondary schools.
5.25     Currently, the Faculty comprises four departments, one each for
general education, technical and vocational education, physical and health
education and library sciences. The Faculty offers both degree and diploma
courses. It has 77 staff members, of whom only 20 are expatriates.

VI. LESSONS LEARXED AND CONCLUSIONS
Attainment of Project Objectives
6.01     The objectives of the amended project have not been fully achieved.
As implemented, the project has assisted the establisbment or expansion of
only 32 1/ of the 83 2/ educationat institutions provided for when, the loan
was signed. Only 64% of the loan (or about US$34.8 million of US$54 mllion)
has been disbursed. Contrary to original intentions, the loan has not
financed the provision of any equipment or furniture requirements and only
about seven manyears of the 26 manyears of technical assistance services
orginually allowed for.
6.02    Even so reduced, the project is still incomplete, although the
implementation time had been extended by four years from the original Closing
Date. Substantial quantities of the instructional equipment and furniture
required for project institutions -- and now being financed entirely by the
Government -- still have to be received, and some still need to be ordered.
Of the equipment actually received, many of the larger workshop items are not
in use because of faulty installation.
6.03     On the other hand, the enrollment targets projected in the original
project and later taken over by the Borrower have been substantially achieved
both in the northern states and across the nation. This anomoly in
performance, in the context of the same project, raises questions regarding
commitment of the Borrower to the project, limitations of the Bank's procedure
on the project as well as possible impact of unresolved policy issues on
project implementation. These issues are reviewed in the following
paragraphs.
6.04    Commitment.  The commitment of the Borrower to the project was less
than expected, mainly at state levels, and is evident in several ways. First,
there was low availability of resources for the project. At a time when both
the federal and state governments were substantially increasing their
allocation to education, and were incurring heavy expenditures on construction
of educational institutions all over the country, the project itself was beset
with financial difficulties. Even the block grants of the federal government,
sufficient to finance state and local costs, were not earmarked for the
project. In fact, during the entire period of implementation, the project
suffered from a lack of local financing. Second, the project was managed by
staff who were low in the administrative hierarchy. The project managers were
new both at the federal and state levels, and -were placed two to three tiers
below the top management level. As a consequence, they had very little policy
and decision-making authority. Their tasks involved mere coordination, rather

than implementation of projects. Moreover, there was a lack of *;ontinuity.
The federal project office had four project directors; each of them was
transferred within a short time, leaving little time to gain experience with
the Bank-assisted project. In some states (e.g., Sokoto and Kwara), the
Completion Mission had difficulty identifying professionals who were
associated with the project during the earlier period. Third, some of the
project managers were not fully aware of Rank procedures. It is not evident
from the records whether the state project managers had any course or
orientation with respect to Bank procedures.  In some states, the consultant-
architect representatives were perceived by the state project office as staff
and agents of the Bank, instead of consultants hired by and for the federal
and/or state governments. This perception persisted despite efforts on the
part of Bank supervision missions to correct it. Many of the positions in the
project office remained vacant and in some states, it took a long time to fill
these positions.  And finally, there was progressive shifting of effective
authority for implementation from the fede-al to state governments, even when
some states were not prepared to assume that authority.
Bank Group Performance.
6.05     Several limitations in Bank procedures also restricted the
implementation process. First, the project was not closely supervised.
Supervision took 84.1 staffweeks. This may appear prima facie to be a large
figure. In reality, the allocated time was not sufficient for supervising a
project which was very large, and geographically dispersed over eight
states. In fact, in some respects the task could be comparable to supervising
of eight. separate projects.
6.06     Second, supervision missions were irregular and unsystematic.
Eighteen missions, exclusive of the completion mission, supervised the
project. The average interval between the missions was 8.5 months; the
average duration was 17 days. Five of the missions were large, with three to
five members, while seven of the missions had one staff member. On five
occasions, the supervision mission stayed in the country for more than three
weeks. But during these long stays, the mission was required, in addition to
supervision, to identify and prepare future education projects.  In other
cases, it included joint supervision of the First and Second Education
Projects.  It should also be noted that between January 1981 and September
1982, a lapse of about 20 months, the project was not supervised at all.
6.07     Third, mission composition was not properly balanced. Architects and
engineers accounted for about 65% of the supervision time.  In contrast,
educators accounted for less than 15%. None of the eleven supervision
missions mounted betwpen March 1977 and July 1032 included an educator. This
is all the more surprising as it was during this period that Nigeria was
passing through its extraordinary educational upsurge and introducing
significant policy changes and reforms.  (However, educators did visit NigerLa
during this period to update the Bank's knowledge of the sector.) The
complexity of the project, and its educational ramifications would have
necessitated visits by experienced educators. EFen with 18 missions, Bank
staff did not visit all of the project sites and left much of the supervision
to the consulting architects.



- 47 -
Flavs in Project Design
6.08     The implementation of the project also suffered from flaws in project
design. First, the project was designed to be sufficiently large to make an
impact on meeting the essential needs of the northern region. The objective,
however laudable, failed to take into account important considerations. The
project was dispersed over a large geographical area and was to be
administered by six different state project units. This was also the period
when Nigeria emerged from a protracted Civil Yar (1967-70) and was in the
process of redefining the relationship and authority between the federal and.
state governments. The states were still unclear on many of the social
policies the federal government was initiating at that time and their
respective roles for those policies. Moreover, transportation was weak. In
fact, it was easier to travel between the countries in West Africa than to
travel between states within the northern region. These constraints strained
the capacity of the Nigerian administrators to manage the project. These
considerations were not given adequate consideration during project design.
6.o9     The project components, especially for secondary education, were
designed with developmental principles in mind. However, they did not
materialize. For example, the SAR recommended that the new project secondary
schools should be located in sparsely populated and less developed towns. Two
inter-related reasons were cited. First, it was reasoned that the towns could
then become poles for development, enabling their schools to draw students
from poorer rural towns and villages. Second, because the students would come
from outlying areas, it was felt that the schools should provide 100% boarding
and staff housing.
6.10     Both expectations were unfulfilled.  The concept of creating poles
for development through new schools in particular did not materialize.  This
was because some of the schools were located in remote and sparsely populated
areas where, even under the best o circumstances, there is not a large enough
catchment area to serve as a catalyst for development. The Secondary School
at Agbaja (which w-as visited by the Completion mission, the first visit by a
Bank mission to that school) and the Secondary School at Kaima fall in this
category.
6.11     Design Guides.  In addition to design and procedure guides that were
prepared for a previous project, the consultant architects were required to
prepare a set of design handbooks and procedure and management guides
specifically for the northern states. However, the consultants themselves
prepared the full construction drawings,and the guides were not used by the
states. The existence of these guides, as well as of complete construction
drawings for comaonly used educational facilities, should be born in mind when
considering the scope end type of architectural services needed for future
projects in the northern states.

covenants.

FOREWORD
I am pleased to have the privilege to present this Project
Completion Report. I have gone through the Report and I feel very
much touched by the so many constralits that beset its full
lmplementation, more so as most of them could easily have been
eliminated.
2.   The most outstanding constraint identified in this Report is
irregular cash flow. This was not because the provision for funds
was inadequate. A comparison of total expenditure in column 12
and total Receipts in column 11 Annex 1D shows clearly that the
problem was not lack of adequate funds for the project. Successive
Federal Governments have made generous grants to the States to
fund the Project. Reimbursements from the loan --ere also directly
received by the States. A total of both the Federal Grants and
the Loan Reimbursements was more than enough to fund the project
to full completion on schedule. The main problem Was therefore
a visible absence of sound financial management and control
leading to diversion of specific project funds to other uses.
3.    My Ministry has taken note of the issues raised and the
problems encountered at implementation. We will ensure that these
mistakes do not re-appear in the implementation of future World
Bank Education Projects.
4.    I wish to commend the staff of the Project Office of the
Bureau of External Aid (BEA) for their objectivity in presenting
the Completion Report. I also wish to commend the World Bank for
their cooperation. It is my fervent hope that this cooperation
will result in more successful implementation of futuire IBRD
Education Projects. I commend those States like Bauchi which
completed their components of the project with a sense of commit-
ment. My Minister will however continue to monitor the progress
of the uncompleted components of the project to ensure that full
completion is achieved within six to twelve months.
5.    Once again, I commend this Report and hope that the lessons
learnt will guide us in the implementation of future projects.
Thank you.

TiIIRD ZER EDUCATION PROJECT
LOAN 929 - UN1 NIGERIA.
Borrower Completion Report -
1. Background:
1.1  At tha end of the Nigerian CivIl War, the Federal
Government requested the World Bank for assistance in building
and equipping Secondary Schools and Primary Teacher Training
Colleges In the then Six Northern States plus ASU Zaria
component.
These weres
Benue-Plateau State
Kano State
Kwara State
North Central State
North Eastern State
North Western State
and ABU Zaria.
It was seen feasible too, to take on an expansion programme
of a large number of Secondary Schools along with completely
new ones.
1.2 The Federal Government had also planned the Universal
Primary Education Programme to take off in September 1975.
More Teachers wer* therefore required for the successful Imple-
mentation of this revolutionary programe. The need for more
Secondary Schools and Primary Teacher Training Colleges In the
Country, and especially in th Northern States, was too evident
for any serious survey to Identify. With the availability of so
much abundant evidence in terms of teaming Student populatlon
without the required Secondary Schools for them, and Teacher
Training Colleges for the production of more PrLmary School
Teachrs for the new Universal Primary Education programe, the
World Bank's appraisal of the project presented a positive
report. A loan of S54a was consequently successfully negotiated.



- 66 -
2.   Prolect Content and Physical Implementation:
2.1 On 16th August, 1973, the Federal Government entered Into
a loan agreement with the world Bank for a loan of S54m for the
Third SBRD Educatton Project. This loan No. 929-UN! was to
assist in funding the building and equipping of an original
project content of 34 new Secondary Schools/Teacher Training
Colleges and Extensions to 51 existinq post primary Institutions
in Six Northern States as identified in 1973. The original
project content estimated to cost N209.4a was revised three
times before a final project content was approved for Implemen-
tation in 1976.
2.2 In 1975, the project content was scaled down to 2S new
Secondary Schools and 51 Extensions to existing post primary
Institutions to cost N145.8 million. In October of the sam
year, it was scaled down again to 21 new Secondary Schools
plus 51 Extensions to cost M131.8 million.
2.3 In order to effect cost reduction In the face of spiral
inflationary trend, and with the withdrawal of AMU Zaria and
Kano State components, the project content was further reduced
to 11 new Secondary Schools plus 3S Extensions.
2.4   Zn 1978, Kwara State decided, after extensive negotiations,
to drop their 15 Extensions in preference for Two new Secondary
Schools at Agbaja and K-lama. Since 1978, the project content
has therefore been stable at Thirteen (13) new Secondary Schools
and 20 Extensions.
2.5   With the Creation of new States in 1975, Eight States
with th, following project components participated.

2.6 Details of physica- implementation of Civil Works in terms
of percentage Completlon ls at Annex II  All disbursement for
Civil Works for  ll the *sites attracted the relevant 44% percent
reimbursement except for Contracts A & 5 of GSS Ikara, and the
re-detesdmined contract for GSS Mussawa, all ln Kaduna State.
The World Bank did not approve thesa contracts awards because of
procurement formalities. In the case of GSS Kuta and GSS
Kontagora re-award contracts, all In Niger State, good sense
prevailed at last, and they were approved by the World Bank
for reimbursement.
2.7 Work on most of the sites was at'completion stages at the
close of the project on 31st December, 1982. Our records show
that only about 50% of the project achieved practical completion,
In respect of Civil Works, Furniture and Equipment.
3.  Cquiment and Furniture  :
3.1 Only about 45% of the Schools had equipment installed.
Some of the extension Schools bad technIcal equipment installed.
I understand the Government and the World Bank agreed to delete
equipment component of the project from Bank financing. In the
August 1980, meeting at F.M.F. between representatives of the
Government and the Bank, the matter was not raised for discus-
Sion.  In any case the idea of increasing the Reimbursable
amount to 61S of total expenditure which was being negotiated at
the time raised hopes that if execution of Civil works was
accelerated, the loan at the close of the oroject on 31/12/82
would be completely disbursed. Unfortunately, circumstances
unforeseen such as economic recession began to set in and cash
flow became very scarce and Irregular.
3.2   Efforts made to reinstate the Equipment component for Bank
financing was rejected as being belated by the Bank. There was
no trace in the records of when the agreement was retached to
delete such an Important component of the project as Equipment
and !jrniture originally meant to attract 100w rei.bursement.
3.3 However, whatever were the reasons for deleting the Equip-
ment and furniture component of the project from Bank financino,
that decision is regrettable. In a situation where virtually
all Technical Equipment for Education were procured overseas,
and at a time when Foreign Exchange was becoming very scarce,
lt Is a set back to delete from Bank financing the one compo-
nent of the project that attracted 100% Reimbursement i.e.
Equipment and Furniture.

4            Statement of Ftnnce
4.1   From January V975, when the project commenced, to
31st December, 1982 when the project closed, a total of
MS.lld.4ZL was disbursed by the participating State
Governments on the project.  A total of 3123854.68 was
exp-cted to have been received as r.imbursemwnt (mainly
on civil works) from the loan of SS4m from the World Bank.
The Federal Government made a grant of NS6.93m to the
8 participating States to enhance the States liquidity,
thus enabilng them to execute the project and generate
reimbursement from the loan. MeanwhSle, Kano State
received N12.89m In V977 and withdrew from the project.
Details of funding, disbursement made and reimbursement
received from the loan are at Annexure  e. Annual
disbursement on Fiscal year basis Is as follows:
Fiscal year      |      DIsbursement         Cummulative
2975 - 77                 745,369               745,369
1977 - 78               1,788,849             2,534,218
1978 - 79               6,511,249             9,045,467
1979 - 80             10,661,943             19,707,410

S.    Retention of Consultancy Services:
5.1   The Federal Government retained the services of
Professional Consultants to design, plan, coordinate and
supervise Implementation of Clvil Works, and Equipment
and Furniture. A total of Xil.5m was paid to the Consul-
tants Messrs Ekwueme AssocLates, (renamed SWACON in
October 1979, for the duration of 8 years, from st
January, 1975 to 31st December, 1982. The Consultants
provided both Principal and Esecutive services with
40 professionals and 40 Support Staff, and a net work of
flld offices in 9 States including a coodinating base
In Lagos. Apart from the Lagos and Kano Offices, all
others were opened at the instance of the Federal Govern-
ment for reasons of logistics due to the wide territorial
spread of project locations.
5.2 The Services of the Consultants included
production of:
1. Preliminary and Structural designs for
72 Institutions in phases I a 11.
2. SupervisLon and Coordination of Implementation
of phase III In 31 Sites of post primary
rnsttitutions.
3. Preparation of withdrawal applications for
World Bank Reimbursement from the loan.
4. Supervision of Supply and Installation of
Equipment and furniture.
S. Provision of Site Supervisors (Clerk of Works)
for 11 now Sites.
6. Production of periodic progress Report on
the project.



- 71 -
5.3   It is regrettable that much of the expenditure on
Consultancy was Incurred on partially executed but abortive
Contracts whose Phases I and II were completed. This lnvolved
41 out of the 72 lnstitutlons in the original project content
but abandoned in Phase III of Implementation.
5.4   It is also regrettable that as a result of constraints of
irregular cash flow, and attendant slow implementation, serious
time overrun accrued as the project's closing date had to be
extended from December 1978 to 31st December, 1982. This
extension attracted cost overrun In terms of
Cl) Spiral inflation, Increasing the cost of the
project as much as 30% to 40% of the
Original Contract Sum.
(ii) Paying Commitment Charges to the World Bank
to retain the undisbursed part of the loan
until 31/12/82 when the project closed.
(iII) About 30% depreciation of the nalra Exchange
rate in recent times reduced the withdrawable
amount from about U.S. S40m to S36m.
Civ) From 1/4/80 to 31/12/82 the Federal Government
retained the services of the Consultants
(SWACON) with h4.9m for 33 months for the
continued supervision and implementation of the
project in keeping with the Federal Government's
Contractual obligation to the World Bank.
This gives an average of f148,485 per month
Instead of N208,000 In previous years. This
fall In fees due to the Consultants was as a
result of stringent negotiation, when It became
obvious that reliance on the provisions of the
FMOW0s Agreement would be more favourable to
the Consultants. It was also due to the fact
that Phases I and U1 of the Consultancy Services
Cost much more than Phase IIX.

6    Issues and Problems of Imolementation:
6.1 The Third ZERO Education Project, Nigeria Loan 929-UN1
closed On December 31st, 1982, after eight (a) years of
ImplementatLon, four (4) of which Constituted time overrun,
beyond the original closing Date of 'Dcember 1978.
A further Six months ending 30/6/83 was allowed to clear
all outstanding withdrawal applications. Thanks to the
spirit of cooperation of the World Bank.
6.2 Given contemporary degree of need and desirability,
this project ought to be favourably disposed to succeed.
But unfortunately a number of factors combined to
frustrate implementation as scheduled. One of these
Constraints is weak feasibillty study. There is abundant
evidence that the appraisal for this project was rather
inconclusive and indecisive. Even several years after
implementation had begin, and the loan had become
effective, project contents were being reviewed over and
over from year to year. (See paragraph 2 under Project
Content and Physical Implementatlen). From 1975 to S978
the Project content continued to be adjusted here and
there. For many of the Project Components, commencement
of Construction work started late In the 1Sf. of the
Project Ce.g. Kwara State). Again, there was a wide
disparity In conmencement period between one State and the
other. The fact that the project closed on the sam date
for all the components Irrespective of When each started
is understandable. Nevertheless, lt became rather
difficult to evaluate project lmplementation for all
the sites with the same parameter.



- 73 -
6.3  The project seemed rather ambitious starting with 72
Institutionsin 1975 when the loan became effective and then
scaled down to 33 sites In 1978. The problem that was over
sighted here was whether there was real appraisal of the
suitability of some of the sites as Project Components and the
appropriateness of the scope of the project. Again, there was
the wide territorial spread of the siting of the many project
components. How effective were the logistics and strategies for
supervision of Implementation? What undertakings were made by
the participating State Governments to carry out their obliga-
tion under the project agreement? The impression as at 1979 was
that tha States were under no obligation whatsoever and therefore
they found It hard to consider according any priority to the
project. This view does not apply to a few States such as
Gongola, Bauchi and lately Kwara.
6.4 Another important prerequisite that was found missing was
arrangement for sound fin.ndclal management and control. There
were no designated Bank Accounts by virtually all the State- as
at 1979. Incomes specifically for the Project from Federal
Government sources and Bank Reimbursements received by the
participating States were enough to meet the revised final cost
of the project if there was prudent financial managemeet and
control.
6.5  If there was  this prerequisite and a sense of commitment
to the Project by the participation State Governments, there
would have been:
Ca) Regular cash flow and sufficient funds for
the Project.
Cb) Completion of the Project on Schedule and
therefore no time overrun.
(c) No Cost overrun beyond manageable limits.
(d) Considerable achievement made in terms of
objectives, goals and targets set.



- 74 -
6.6 Unfortunately, this prerequisite was taken for granted.
Nobody expects a new State in Its early infancy in which
virtually every programme of all the sectors ofthe economy and
Development Is seem as a priority, not to use money pald lnto
the States Capital receipts for other purposes other than the
project for whlch such monies were paid into the Taasury.
6.7 Since there was this lapse at the appraisal Stage, i.e.
absence of guarantee for adequate arrangement for sound
financial Management and control, this problem became critical
and fundamental to successful Project Implementation. The
general effect of this situation was that
1 There was irregular cashflow and lack of
adequate funds for the project.
2. Funds generated were hardly recycled for
the project.
3. Payments were hardly made in tine.
Sometimes it took 12-18 Months to effect
payment of Inter.:A Certificates.
4. Contractors either abandoned their sites
or became non-challant. When some were
eventually paid, they became ruluctant to
reinvest in the project since they were
uncertain as to when the next payment
would be effected. The case of Messrs
Coignet Nlg. Limlted of Niger State was a
case in point.
6.8  In 1979 the Project Office succeeded in getting 4 of the 8
States to open Bank Accounts. Kwara, Benue, Plateau, and Gongola
States opened designated Bank Accounts for the Project. Bauchi
had a Below-the-Line-Account reserved for the Project.
Unfortunately Benue and Plateau did not successfully utilise
this Account as no funds were paid in till very late in the life
of the Project. The phenomenal success achieved by Kwara and
Gongola States were attributable to their opening and operating
a Bank Account Specifically for the project.
6.9 Another related set back was that because the project
passed from one succeeding Government to another, over the years
It was seen by each succeeding Government rather as a liability
then an asset. Therefore the State Government felt reluctant
to invest, since they did not initLat the Project.



- 75 -
6.%1O Nevertheless the project since 2979 recorded appreciable
progress in implementation in response to the sheer resource-
fulness and ingenuity of the new Project Officers at the BEA.
The States were specifically requested to invest in the project
In order that the Federal Government might consider rellevlng
the States of all liabilities for the Loan. Zn actual fact this
promise will be effected as the machinery to implement It has
been set in motion. This promise and affective interest and
comnitment displayed by the Officials of the Project Office SEA,
changed the unwilling posture of some of the States to react
favourably. It Is therefore gratifying to note that at the
close of the Project about 85% of the project Components was at
different stages of completion.MSla out of N65m for Civil Works
had been executed and S36m out of S54m had been withdrawn
from the Loan.
6 t1 The other factor that constituted a rather dispensable
bottleneck was the political factor in Project Implementation.
Preponderance of political influence was brought to bear on the
choice of sites that were later dropped by succeeding State
Governments after phases I & 1I of Implementation had been com-
pleted by the Consultants. This factor also affected siting of
some of the surviving componen_s at rather inaccessible locations
with very difficult terrain_ The result is an unusual lncrease
in cost without any matching results for the Project. There is
no way in which one could maximise project fund utilization for
very positive results in such a situation.
6.12 It is also pertinent to note here that deviacion from Set
procurement guidelines by the state Governments in their award
of contracts constituted a serious set back. It is known that
saMe of such deviations were politically motlvated. Recular
prompting by the Project Office 5EA and the Consultants did not
go down very well. However, in some cases reasons given for
such deviations were found to be reasonable and in the best
interest of the project.



- 76 -
6.13 Another negative political thrust, -as the rather over
defensive posture of soe State Governments by seeing every
reactlon to decisions taken by the as constituting a challenge
to theIr authority and autonomy. The Project Office SEA found
It a hard nut to crack convincing soae of the States that certain
guidelines had to be followed in their decision-making to avold
any conflict or misunderstanding.
g.14 Yet another dispensable cause of conflict was the Insensi-
tivity and over bearing posture of some Bank Officials to the
political realities of the tine.  In a developing country.
complex, and as politically sensitive as Nlgeria, understanding
of local situations and adjusting to lt ls a prerequisite If one
has to react lr A way that could generate positive results rather
than the negative and dispensable conflicts. Some of the set backs
in this project sten from a misrepresentation of facts and insensL-
tivity to local situationsb ordering on a crisis of confidence.
The famous GSS Ikara Contract award Issue is a case in point.
The facts do not deserve a place in this Report.
6.15 The irony of it all is that those, contracts insisted on
by the Bank for awards such as GSS JibLya failed, while others
such as GSS Ikara, that were not approved for Bank Relmbursement
succeeded. Witn a bit of understandIng, such head-on collision and
flexing of muscles would have been unnecessary. No lssue however
Is being made of the examples here. The Project Office had had
occasions to pacify State Governments who felt their authority
was being eroded by the posture oc some Bank Staff.
6.16 It Is therefore necessary to state here that while the
generallty of 3ank Staff had behaved commendably, a few of them
required scme patience and understanding to succeed In their
mission to help achieve the development objective of the project.
O e overriding factor l.e. success of the project, if allowed to
place its preponderant weight on all conslderatlons, there would be
little need for Insistence on the rather Intangible and negative
elements that generate delays, time overrun and unnecessary
conflicts.



- 77 -
6.17 Equally sad was tr.c prevalencu of a negative psychological
factor: the rather apathetic and Indifferent attitude of some of
the participating State Governments to the project. Kano State
Government withdrew its components from the project after
receiving specific grants of about N13m EThirteen Million Naira)
for the project from the Federal Government. The attitude of
Benue State especially in respect of efforts to implement the
GSS (Id*L component amounted to rather culpable negligence.
Pl-t*au State which, with four new Schools, was initially seen as
the anchor of all hopes for successful execution of the project,
and reasonable disbursement from the loan, came ultimately
terribly short of all expectation, mainly because of rapid
turn-over of Project Managers and poorly staffed Project Unit.
Kaduna State presented a contradiction that was inherent In the
turn out of events. GSS Jibiya awarced to a foreign firm with a
Nigerian front, was a disastrous failure In terms of rate and
standard of performance. So was also Messrs Coignet (Nig.) Ltd of
ilger State.  On the other baRd GSS Ikara of Kaduna State whose
re-award was not approved for reimbursement, got completed at a
record time. But for the World Bank's reconsideration of the
re-awards for GSS Kuta and Xontagora, the story would have been
the same as GSS Ikara in Kaduna State.
6.18 Kvara State's late re-entry into the project, (thanks to a
new initiative from the Project Office SEA in 1979 and Bank's
responsiveness) saw- an accelerated and remarkable pace of project
Implementation only halted by inadequate funds and termination of
the loan in December !982. Most of the issues and problems of
project implementation could have been avoided if there was a
proper psychological orientation on the part of the participating
States who ought to have given the project the attention and sense
of commitment It deserved. Apart from Bauchi, Gongolat and lately Sokoto and
Kwara States, a sense of total commitment, in the attitude of most
of the participating State Governments to project implementation
was apparently missing.



- 78 -
7.  Project Administration and Management:
?.-. Xt Is now necessary to reflect 'rom the point of view of
Project Administration and In what way the inadequacls of the
P.X.U. affected Project Implementation and management.
7.2   The Project Offltea BEA had the most unenviable task of
coordinating a Project that was ln terms of appraisal and pre-
paration evaluatlvely defective. Effocts made to use three
personnel from CFTC to set up Project Implementation Units ln
the Eight Participating States especially In Cwara, Benue and
Sokoto States partially succeeded. The success attained was
partial because it was not sustained. The P.X.U. In other
participating States like Plateau was weak and ineffective.
Kwara State had a Project Engineer and Architect assisting the
Project Manager in the execution cf the Project. 9auchl had a
Quantity Surveyor as Project Xanager who did a good job.
7.3 The Federa'. Government provided Consultants who played a
very cemnendable role In not only providing the required Consul-
tancy Services, but also played the role of advising Government
on issues in the Project. Neverth- Less, there was no doubt that
the Project Office BEA was illequLpped and without the relevant
key perzonnel exceot the Project Director.  Efforts to provide a
Project Architect, and a Project Accountant as stipulated by the
loan agreement, did not succeed for long. The extra-ordLnary
Time overrun that the project was subjected to, also frustrated
effocts .nade.
7.4   The Coordinating dock  of the Project Office BEA wouLd have
been more successful lf the Government aLlowed the Project

7.S Two Instances will clearly illustrate this contention.
But for the timely intervention of the Project Director BEA in
Kwara State where a stalemate was Imminent arising from misunder-
standing between the State Government and the Contractors the
situation could have deteriorated and consequently the project
would have been adversely affected. Plateau State would not have
realised when they did, that there was adequate fund in their
designated Bank Account to provide regular cash flow to pay up
arrears and continue implementation. Furthermore, the reinforce-
ment provided by tne visiting Project Officials from BEA and Bank
Staff served the State Project Units as an invigorating tonic for
enhanced performance arising from enhanced attention given to the
project by the State at that point in time. The lack of regular
supervisory visit to Froject StateSand Sites on the other hand
had a stalemating effect on project components for which the
State Government uould have had instant prompting for action.
7.6   Another factor that affected effective Project Supervision
is the problem of Civil Service red tapism. Wnile a trained
Project Manager identifies constraints and requires instant
action to remove them, the time element involved in processing
approval and facilities to effect the required change adversely
affects acnievement of that objective, and damps the morale of
the project officials.
7.7   The economics of Project Management allows a business-like
approach that enables a Project Manager to take measures to pin
down the factors leading to time and cost overrun to bare
peripheral limits. This means that effective Project Management
would require an organistic frame-work, unfettered by the tedious
and slow pace beaurocracy of the Civil Service. This in turn
means that the P.1.U. should be delegated such authority and
facilities to effect its goals and objective, outside the strict
Civil Service Control. Unfortunately the Project Office SBA was
only an integral part of thc Federal Ministry of Education and
therefore was bound to follow normal Civil Services p.ocesses in
decision making and control.

That being so, It was seen normal for the Project Office to be
reminded from tlme to time that It was part and parcel of the
Civil Service whenever actions were taken that tended to be
outs5ie the normal routine, but in the best interest of the
project.
B.   Recommendations:
8.1   The lessons that are learnt during the implementation of
this project are many and call for measures designed to remove
such constraints that have been identified if future projects
ar- expected to succeed in their impleientation and Management.
8.2   The following suggestions if considered favourably and
implemented will help reduce to the barest, the problems
encountered In this project in the implementation of future projactst
(l)  There should be a sound pre-project evaluation
and preparation so that Guestimates' become near
IEstimates' for the proaect. Constraints that
tend to lull the project into time over-run and
consequent cost over-run should be envisaged and
necessary counter measures taken when they
ultimately emerge as intervening variables in
the process of implementation. On no account
should the planning and preparation phase of the
gestation period be underrated and treated with
levity. The attendant effect of this situation
in the implementation phase is usually disappoin-
tLng.
(2)  The P.1.U. should be such that has inherent
project Management Control factors to ensure
smooth implementation; such as delegated authority
for instant decision-making, required Key personnel
for monitoring and Coordinative Services provided,
and some financial control mechanism ensured.

8.3 There has to be a great deal of interpersonal relationship,
between the Bank and Government staff with a depth of understand-
Ing of situational factors and cooperation that should generate
positive results.  Whatever are the differences, the one consider-
able factor that should cement a more healthy relationship Is
"Success of the project, lts objectives, goals and targets."
8.4 There should be a project content that ls manageab.e in size
and scope: not too many, scattered and varied as to make the
logistics of supervision difficult, and not too few as not to make
a reasonable Impact. The project content should be one that should
attract available adequate funds to ensure regular Cash flow for
steady implementation.
8.5 In order to avoid cost over-run, time over-run should be kept
under strict check, the transient nature of price fluctuation not
withstanding.
8.6 -Finally, in all future projects involving State participation
and external financing, the participating States should be made to
give adequate guarantee that will make it mandatory for the States
to carry out their Contractual obligations with a sense of
commitment.
8.7 The implementation of the Third I8RD Education Project
Loan 929-UN! was not as smooth as expected. Nevertheless, the
experiences acquired in the process are invaluable. The problems
encountered not withstanding, we are happy to report that a greet
deal of the project's educational development objective was
achleved. dhere this has not been fully realised, the necessary
foundation for its attainment has been laid. Our experiences will
however help us to execute future projects successfully.
8.8 The success attained so far, would not have been possible
without the cooperation of the World Sank's Education Project
Supervision Staff, the Chief of Project Division for West Africa
in Washington, the Resident Mission of the 'Jorld Bank in Lagos, the
Staff of the External Finance Division of the Federal Ministry of
Finance, the Representatives of the Federal Ministries of Works
and Justlce on the Xnterministerial Committee for the project.
