FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
1.01      Cameroon covers a roughly triangular area of 475,000 km  with
a coastline of about 280 km. It borders on six countries--Nigeria, Chad,
Central African Empire (C.A.E.), Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea--and
occupies a strategic position for transit traffic of landlocked Chad and
C.A.E.
1.02      Cameroon has mountains in the west and in the center, dry savannah
plains in the north and extensive forest areas in the south and southeast.
Along the coast, the rainy season latsts 220 days with an annual rainfall of
5,000-6,000 mm. In the central mountainous areas, the annual rainfall is
about 1,500 mm during a rainy seasorL of about 135 days. By contrast, the
rainy season in the north lasts 50-75 days, with an average annual rainfall of
only 850 mm. The variety of topography, climate and soil types creates
different technical problems for road construction and maintenance from region
to region.
1.03      Cameroon's population is currently 8.0 million inhabitants, growing
at2an estimated 2.3% per year. While the average density is 17 persons per
km , the distribution is uneven. The hiPhest concentration is found in the
western highlandf  with 75 persons per km  and the lowest in the east with only
4 persons per km . About 18 major ethnic groups inhabit distinct regions. The
transport system is of paramount importance in promoting a sense of national
unity among them. Urban areas are growing rapidly: the commercial center and
port of Douala has more than 550,000 inhabitants compared to 190,000 in 1965.
Nearly 400,000 persons live in the capital of Yaounde, a threefold increase
in ten years. Urbanization creates a strong demand for passenger transport,
since urban dwellers tend to keep their ties with families in rural villages.
1.04      Gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices was estimated at
CFAF 618 billion or US$2.8 billion in 1976. Between 1971 and 1976, although
GDP in real terms grew about 2.5% per year, GDP per capita remained practi-
cally unchanged at US$330. GDP per capita was estimated at US$340 in 1977.
The Fourth Development Plan (FYs 1977-81) has set a target growth rate of 7.1%
per annum. Agriculture is the most important sector and provides the liveli-
hood for about 75% of the population. Growth is expected in agro-industries
and agricultural production spurred by relatively favorable prices predicted
for the main export crops, cocoa and coffee. In addition, forestry exploit-
ation should increase with the opening of new areas at Deng Deng near Belabo.
An oil refinery and tanker terminal are being planned at Port Limboh, close to
Victoria, while off-shore oil exploration has begun nearby.

B.   The Transport System
1.05       The transport infrastructure in Cameroon comprises 59,000 km of
roads, of which about 42,000 km are feeder roads and tracks; 1,153 km of
railways; and one principal port at Douala, two minor ports at Victoria and
Kribi and one seasonal river port at Garoua. There is an international
airport at Douala and 13 smaller airports. The transport system is export-
import oriented and focused on Douala. Foreign trade through the port of
Douala flows principally along the Douala-Bafoussam corridor and the Trans-
cameroon route, Douala-Yaounde-Ngaoundere-Maroua-Chad border.
1.06       Cotton bales from north Cameroon are transported more than 1,500 km
by road and rail for export through the port of Douala. Cocoa and coffee from
the western highlands and the central mountain areas are carried by trucks or
by railway about 200-300 km to Douala. Palm oil, rubber and tropical fruits
are produced in the coastal area and require only a short transport haul to
be exported. In 1977, log exports amounted to 497,000 tons of which 67% went
through Douala and 33% through Kribi. The average rail distance for log
exports through Douala is 375 km. Further expansion of log exports depends
on road improvements in the main forest belt which stretches from the Atlantic
coast to the eastern frontier and covers 37% of Cameroon's area.
Roads
1.07       Details of the road sub-sector are given in Chapter II.
Railways
1.08       The railways, whose principal lines are the Transcameroon line
(Douala-Ngaoundere, 913 km) and the western line (Douala-Nkongsamba, 160 km),
are operated by Regie Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Cameroon (REGIFERCAM),
an autonomous state agency. In 1976 traffic totalled 1.9 million passengers
or 228 million pass.-km and 1.3 million tons of freight or 437 million ton-km.
Principal commodities carried were timber, petroleum products, manufactured
imports, cotton and cocoa. Freight traffic grew at an annual rate of 4%
between 1969 and 1976.
1.09       REGIFERCAM has a small operational deficit.  Its financial situa-
tion is slowly improving as tariffs were increased in 1977 and 1978 and their
structure modified to discourage hauls of less than 100 km. REGIFERCAM is
taking steps to upgrade railway infrastructure and solve operational and
managerial problems. Many external donors are involved in the partial re-
alignment of the rail track between Douala and Yaounde, the oldest and most
heavily used section. External aid is also financing purchase of locomotives
and rolling stock. The proposed Fourth Railway Project, scheduled for FY
1979, would provide substantial training and technical assistance, construc-
tion of a marshalling yard in Douala and expansion of locomotive and rolling
stock maintenance facilities.

Ports, Waterways and Shipping
1.10      Douala is the principal port, handling about 90% of Cameroon's
foreign and transit trade. The port operated at full capacity in 1977 with
a total throughput of 2.5 million tons. Imports totalled 1.7 million tons,
including 0.5 million tons of petroleum products. Exports amounted to 0.8
million tons: timber accounted for about 0.4 million tons; and agricultural
products for 0.3 million tons, mainly coffee, bananas, cocoa and cotton.
Since 1969 traffic has grown 6% per year, with imports increasing at 8% p.a.
and exports at 1% p.a. The port's capacity will be expanded to about 4.0
million tons by the ongoing Second Douala Port Project (Loan 1321/Credit 657
CM, US$250 million, 1976) due to be completed in 1981. The port of Victoria
has been losing traffic to Douala; in 1977, it handled 23,000 tons of exports
and no imports. The same year, the lighterage port of Kribi handled 179,000
tons of exports, mainly logs from nearby areas, and 9,800 tons of imports. A
small river port is located at Garoua on the Benoue river, navigable below
Garoua from mid-July to mid-October. In 1977, Garoua handled 9,000 tons of
exports, mainly cotton, and 5,000 tons of imports, mainly fertilizers.
1.11      The Cameroon National Port Authority, an autonomous public corpora-
tion, is in charge of all port operations in Cameroon. The Port Authority
is financially self supporting: in FY 1977 its cash flow (capacity for self-
financing) was CFAF 1.2 billion (US$5.5 million).
Air Transport
1.12      Cameroon Airlines (CAMAIR) provides domestic services between
Douala, Yaounde and 12 other domestic airports, and international services
between Douala, West and East Africa, and Europe. The fleet consists of one
Boeing 707, three Boeing 737's, and one de Havilland Twin-Otter. On domestic
services CAMAIR carries about 75,000 passengers annually with traffic concen-
trated between Douala and Yaounde.
Modal Distribution of Traffic
1.13      On a country-wide basis road transport is the dominant transport
mode, linking Yaounde with provincial centers and serving regional and local
trade. While in the Douala-Bafoussam corridor road transport predominates,
in the Douala-Yaounde corridor the railway carries about three-fourths of the
through traffic of goods. Road transport takes over where the railway ends to
serve northern Cameroon and Chad along the Transcameroon route, which consists
of 913 km of railway and 800 km of road.
1.14      The distribution of traffic between modes in the Yaounde-Douala
corridor reflects the poor state of the road as well as tariff competition
between the railroad and trucks. During the rainy season, the unpaved road
section from Edea to Yaounde is frequently closed to traffic; even in the dry
season this road is in poor condition and can be used only by light vehicles
and medium-sized trucks. At about CFAF 25/ton-km railroad rates for general
merchandise are at a level where truck rates are competitive. An increased
volume of general merchandise is likely to be transported by road after



- 4 -
construction of a paved road between Douala and Yaounde. For transport of
low-value commodities such as salt, sugar and fertilizers, rail tariffs range
from CFAF 12.5 to 14.8/ton-km. Trucking rates are not competitive at this
level and these cargoes are likely to continue to be transported by rail.
With regard to passenger traffic, third class railroad fares are below bus
fares of CFAF 6.0/pass.-km. However, bus services are more frequent on
intermediate distances in the corridor and serve more villages. With the
projected paved road between Douala and Yaounde more passengers are likely to
travel by bus because of time saving and improved comfort.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.15      The Ministry of Transport (MOT), created in 1970, is responsible
for transport sector management, including (a) reviewing, coordinating and
screening transport investment proposals prepared by other ministries and
public agencies, (b) formulating transport policies, and (c) approving the
tariffs of REGIFERCAM, the National Port Authority and CAMAIR. However, the
Ministry has neither the qualified staff nor the authority to perform its
functions adequately. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning (MINEP)
has carried out some transport planning in the framework of overall develop-
ment planning, but its limited resources, sufficient when investment decisions
consisted mainly of ranking high-priority projects on the principal transport
routes, are inadequate for the more sophisticated investment choices between
competing corridors and between road/rail in the same corridor. The Ministry
of Equipment and Housing (MINEH) is responsible for road planning and has just
started to direct its attention to this task (para. 2.23).
1.16      The Bank has had a continuing dialogue with the Government on the
need for strengthening transport sector management. At first, attempts to
reinforce the organization and machinery for transport planning and policy-
making met with limited success. Recent developments imply a change in the
Government's attitude. A Transport Planning and Coordination Unit (TPCU) has
been created within MOT and two economists are being recruited for three years
each under the Technical Assistance Project (Credit 673 CM, US$4.5 million,
June 1977). One economist will be seconded to MINEP to help ensure coordina-
tion and integration of investment decisions in transport with closely related
sectors such as agriculture and forestry. The other economist has been sec-
onded to MOT to stimulate and coordinate the work of the TPCU. The Third
Highway Project (para. 2.39) provides TPCU with another economist/statisti-
cian for three years and four fellowships. Furthermore, the Government has
requested advice from the Bank on carrying out an overall transport sector
study. The study would be undertaken by Cameroonian professionals and ex-
patriate experts financed under ongoing transport projects, with Bank staff
providing technical assistance during field missions.
1.17      So far, however, the Government has been unable to develop a system-
atic, long-term strategy for transport development and has taken a project-by-
project approach to investment. The result is an ambitious road program to
the detriment of road maintenance, and a lack of clear strategy for railway



- 5 -
investments. This has also sometimes led to a tendency to favor high-cost
investments as in the Douala-Yaounde corridor. In late 1976, a study of
feasible transport improvements in the corridor, carried out under the
Second and Third Railway Projects, denonstrated that both partial realign-
ment of the railway and construction of a two-lane paved road were economi-
cally justified. However, for a time the Government envisaged the immediate
construction of an expressway instead of a two-lane road. The Bank had
repeated discussions with the Government on the matter, and the Government
has now agreed to reduce to a two-lane road its first-stage plans for
highway investment in the corridor. The proposed project includes the
completion of the ongoing study being carried out under Government financing
for the economic feasibility and detailed engineering of a two-lane paved
road between Douala and Yaounde.
1.18      In addition to agriculture, the Government is giving priority to
transportation under the Fourth Development Plan in order to promote interna-
tional and regional trade, expand access to agricultural areas and facilitate
food marketing. This policy is basically sound as large areas are still
isolated and others are served only by rudimentary infrastructure. The plan
aims at a transport infrastructure investment of CFAF 175 billion in 1976
constant prices or about one-fourth of the public investment target. Compared
to the CFAF 99 billion actually invested in the transport sector during the
Third Development Plan (FYs 1972-76), the current investment target for the
transport sector is overly ambitious. Achievement of this investment target
will, in the end, depend on the availability of foreign financing, which is
projected to cover 62% of total costs. (Under the Third Development Plan
foreign participation in transport investment was about 60%). Another con-
straint is the generally slower work progress than anticipated at the planning
stage. Many transport projects included in the Fourth Plan have been carried
forward from the Third Plan because cost escalation, particularly during the
1974-75 period, created financial difficulties and because lead time for
project preparation was longer than expected.
2. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The road network totals about 59,000 km, of which about 2,300 km
are paved and 7,000 km are gravel or laterite roads. The remainder are
earth roads (about 7,400 km) and feeder roads (42,000 km).  About 29,000 km
of roads are classified into paved roads and five classes (A to E) of unpaved
roads mainly according to traffic levels for maintenance budgeting purposes.
The developnent of the road network is given below.

I/   Part of class D roads, class E roads and earth tracks constitute the
feeder roads network.
The Government is studying a more functional classification which would take
into account geographic and socio-economic criteria in addition to traffic
levels. This new classification would comprise national (6,400 km), pro-
vincial (5,100 km), district (5,400 km) and local (11,800 km) roads.
2.02      While the density of the road network averages 0.12 km per km 2
which is similar to that of Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, it varies con-
siderably within the country. It is greatest in densely populated areas
of high economic activity: the coastal/southwestern region along the Douala-
Bafoussam corridor, the central region around Yaounde, and the northern region
around Maroua. The most important trunk roads -- the Douala-Bafoussam-Foumban
road and the northern section of the Transcameroon route -- have recently been
paved.
2.03      Although there has been a great effort to build and rehabilitate
paved roads, in recent years the overall condition of the road network has
deteriorated somewhat due to low initial construction standards, insufficient
maintenance and increasing traffic. Gravel and earth roads, which account
for 92% of the classified road network, are frequently impassable during the
rainy season. In the dry season, corrugated and stony road surfaces and deep
potholes cause excessive wear to vehicles. Consequently, the Government is
now giving a higher priority to improving road maintenance than in the past.

B. Road Transport Characteristics
Vehicle Fleet
2.04      The Ministry of Transport registers new vehicles but does not
record retirement of vehicles from service. The fleet is estimated at about
63,000 vehicles, of which about 55% are cars, 35% trucks and vans, 6% buses
and 4% specialized vehicles. From 1971 to 1975, new vehicle registrations
increased at an average of about 6% p.a. The table below lists new vehicle
registrations (1971-75) and the estimated vehicle fleet (1971-77).

Traffic
2.06      The Department of Highways (DH) is responsible for collecting
traffic data. Since 1966, DH's field subdivisions have carried out manual
traffic counts on the major roads one week every quarter, giving a good
indication of the traffic's magnitude, composition and growth. In 1969
consultants BCEOM (France) carried out an overall survey of road traffic,
and consultants carry out detailed traffic counts and origin/destination
surveys on specific road sections as part of feasibility studies.
2.07      Traffic has increased at approximately the same rate as fuel con-
sumption, about 6% p.a. (about 7-8% p.a. on paved roads and 4-5% p.a. on
unpaved roads). On paved roads daily traffic averages about 450 vehicles;
on gravel and laterite roads (A, B and major C roads) it averages 90-140
vehicles. Average daily traffic decreases to about 15-30 vehicles on other
classified earth roads and to less than 10 vehicles on the unclassified
earth tracks. Although paved roads represent less than 4% of the network,
they carry about 43% of the non-urban road traffic, while the unclassified
roads, representing more than half of the total network, carry only about
11% of traffic, as shown in the table below. Total non-urban road traffic
is estimated at about 0.8 billion vehicle-km in 1977.

C. Road Tr;ansport Industry
2.08      Cameroon's road transport industry comprises many small, local firms,
owning only one or a few trucks. Para-statal enterprises such as SODECOTON
and CAMDEV operate their own fleets of trucks. A large segment of truck
transport is carried out by trading companies as part of their business. A
number of firms, both local and foreign, specialize in international freight
transport, one third to one half of which is allocated to Cameroon by inter-
national agreements. There are three truckers' unions, one each for the
southern, center and northern regions. Only the northern one is active
and its main purpose is to allocate to its members its quasi-monopoly over
Cameroon's share of international freight transshipped at the end of the rail
line at Ngaoundere. Small domestic transporters carry passengers in station
wagons and minibuses. Passenger carriers belong to a well-organized and
efficient union which has offices in the main cities and sets transport
schedules, issues tickets and runs several bus stations.



2.09      There are no restrictions on imports of vehicles, but they are
subject to duties averaging 60% ad valorem. Although entry into the public
transport industry is unrestricted, MOT issues licenses for public transport
and sets tariffs. As tariffs per kilometer are nearly uniform and do not
take into account the quality of the roads, there tends to be overcapacity on
the better roads and undercapacity on the poorer roads. Also, a large number
of traders undertake public transport in their own trucks without the required
license, and undercut official internal freight tariffs. These practices
have resulted in keen competition and a few bankruptcies among transporters.
Official passenger tariffs are generally enforced. A tariff convention
establishes rates for road transport to Chad and C.A.E. The rates can only
be changed with the agreement of these two countries.
D. Administration
2.10      The Department of Transport (DOT) in the Ministry of Transport
oversees road transport. This covers a variety of tasks ranging from regis-
tering vehicles, issuing driving licenses, inspecting vehicles, and delivering
transport licenses, to preparing road transport legislation and studying road
transport costs. DOT is understaffed and therefore not able to carry out all
its tasks. The major shortcomings are the lack of statistical data regarding
vehicles and the road transport industry because records are poorly kept, and
the absence of a clear policy for the development of public transport through
appropriate road transport legislation and tariffs. Since January 1976,
an expert from the United Nations Development Programme has been assisting
DOT in improving road transport legislation. This expert has prepared a
law regulating the occupation of transporters and regulations covering road
traffic. The expatriate economist/statistician provided to TPCU under the
Third Highway Project will also help DOT collect the road transport informa-
tion necessary to define new tariffs and improve transport planning. The
following step would be to strengthen the data base for road transport.
2.11      The maximum authorized gross vehicle weight was 35 tons, with a
maximum single axle load of 13 tons. In May 1978 the Government issued new
legislation which, while keeping the maximum authorized gross vehicle weight
at 35 tons, reduced the maximum single axle load to 10 tons. This applies
only to new imports of vehicles. Vehicle weight limits have not generally
been enforced, although covenants under the First and Second Highway Projects
required it, and overloading appears widespread on paved roads. The Govern-
ment has decided to enforce vehicle weight legislation through the use of
permanent weighing stations at strategic locations along main roads where
they will be able to control most of the long-distance traffic.
2.12      Within MINEH, the Department of Highways has overall responsibility
for planning, constructing and maintaining the road network. The Division
of New Works plans and builds roads, and the Division of Highway Maintenance
(DHM) maintains them. In practice, DH has restricted its activities to
paved, gravel and major earth roads. Other earth roads and tracks are built
and maintained by local authorities, Government agencies, autonomous coopera-
tives and private companies. One purpose of the Feeder Roads Project (para.
2.38) is to coordinate the road activities of these different groups by
setting up within DHM a Central Feeder Roads Unit. The organization of MINEH
is shown below.

2.13      DH rents its heavy, road maintenance equipment from the National
Civil Engineering Equipment Pool (NCEEP), an autonomous Government agency.
There has been a poor working relationship between DH and NCEEP, mainly
because NCEEP is underequipped and cannot supply all the equipment DH needs.
2.14      The Government has been reviewing the organization of the agencies
dealing with road construction and maintenance. It hopes to (a) increase the
efficiency of road maintenance operations and (b) simplify cumbersome procure-
ment and disbursement procedures. MINEH has studied the alternative of either
creating a highway authority responsible for trunk roads with DH and NCEEP in
charge of the remaining roads, or merging DH and NCEEP into a new agency
responsible for the entire network. The first proposal may duplicate existing
institutions and create an imbalance in fund allocation between trunk and
other roads, to the benefit of the former, while the second proposal would
reinforce the necessary coordination between DH and NCEEP and increase road
maintenance efficiency. Minor organizational changes could also increase the
efficiency and coordination of both agencies. The proposed project provides
for a covenant requiring that the Government should discuss with the Bank any
major reorganization of agencies dealing with road maintenance.

E. Staffing and Training
2.15      DH has about 2,050 permanent employees, comprising about 24 engineers
graduated from foreign colleges and universities, 46 technicians educated
locally, 124 foremen, 240 mechanics, 140 operators and 200 drivers. The rest
are mostly clerks and laborers. Due to low Government salaries, DH is unable
to attract qualified staff and is, therefore, short of professionals. This
situation is ameliorated by expatriates financed by foreign technical assist-
ance programs. Six technical assistance experts assist DH's headquarters
staff: three engineers provided by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC,
France), and two engineers and one economist provided under the Second Highway
Project. The shortage of Cameroonian professionals is likely to continue for
several years unless MINEH educates its own engineers, which it is considering.
The number of its technicians is increasing rapidly because of internal
training programs.
2.16      NCEEP has about 530 permanent employees, including 8 professionals,
18 chief mechanics, 180 mechanics, 80 assistant mechanics, 60 operators,
40 drivers, 60 clerks, 20 storekeepers and 60 laborers. Six expatriates
provided by FAC still assist NCEEP in its workshop operations. As NCEEP's
salaries are up to twice as high as those of DH, it has less difficulty
hiring qualified professionals and technicians.
2.17      Cameroon is developing facilities to train professionals, techni-
cians and workmen. At the upper level, each year about 20 civil works engi-
neers graduate from the National Superior Polytechnical College. They all
join private or para-statal firms. About 120 high- and medium-grade techni-
cians also graduate annually in civil works, building construction, surveying
or rural works from the National College of Technology (ENAT) and the Survey
School at Buea. These technicians have a contract to work for the Government
for a minimum of ten.years. MINEH's Training Division is developing courses
to allow promotion of senior employees to positions of greater responsibility.
At the lower level, NCEEP operates two training centers. The Training Center
for Mechanics in Douala each ye4r trains or retrains about 10 maintenance
and 8 workshop mechanics, and about 12 mechanics in the repair of particular
types of equipment (graders, loaders, bulldozers, compactors). In Yaounde,
the Training Center for Operators trains about 40 operators a year. There
is still a lack of intermediate level staff and of facilities to train over-
seers and foremen for road construction and maintenance, chief mechanics to
supervise workshops, and administrative and accounting personnel.

F. Financing
2.18      The Government finances road construction through the investment
budget supplemented by transfers from special accounts (funds from coffee
and cocoa export taxes), domestic borrowing and foreign aid. Under the Third
Development Plan (FYs 1972-76), road construction amounted to about CFAF 42
billion (US$190 million) in 1976 prices. Although they fluctuated widely,
annual outlays increased substantially to about CFAF 12 billion (US$54 million)
in FYs 1975-76. Foreign aid accounted for about 52% of the total, as shown
below.

2.19      The Fourth Development Plan (FYs 1977-81) sets a road investment
target of CFAF 78 billion (US$350 million) expressed in 1976 prices, or 42%
of the overall transport investments. This target is about 90% above road
investment during the Third Plan. The plan assumes that foreign aid will
cover 52% of the total, as before. The first two years of the Fourth Plan
have been a period of considerable road construction activity, but road
investments are now likely to decrease because of budget constraints and lack
of foreign aid.
2.20       Road maintenance, financed by the recurrent budget, remained
constant at about CFAF 3.0 billion (US$13 million) p.a. in 1976 prices for
FYs 1972-76 (preceding table). During that period, the classified network



- 14 -
maintained by the Government increased substantially (para. 2.01), and kilo-
metric allowances for road maintenance actually decreased by about 30% in
real terms. The percentage of total road expenditures allocated to road
maintenance also decreased from about 40% to 20% between FY 1972 and FY 1976.
2.21      Road user taxes include customs duties and taxes on new vehicles,
spare parts, tires and fuel, and an annual tax on vehicles. As shown below,
between FY 1972 and FY 1976 road revenues increased in real terms by about
3% p.a., or half the growth of the vehicle fleet and the traffic, since some
taxes did not increase as rapidly as inflation. In FYs 1975-76, road revenues
about equaled all road expenditures and were about five times the level of
the road maintenance budget. The Government is studying the possibility of
creating a Road Fund to earmark part of road user taxes for road construction
and maintenance. Should the Government do so, the proposed project provides
for a covenant requiring that the fund's main features be discussed with the
Bank prior to its creation.

G. Planning
2.22      Planning of road construction and maintenance is the responsibility
of the Department of Highways, but due to lack of technical staff, it carries
out little planning. The planning it does carry out consists mainly of annual
work programs developed for budgeting purposes and is largely based, for road
maintenance, on proposals made by the provincial and subdivision heads. Invest-
ment decisions are made on the basis of traffic, road condition, construction
costs and political considerations. In the past, this approach was acceptable
as the priority was clearly to establish the basic infrastructure network, and
choices were easy to make except for the respective roles of investment and
maintenance which led to inadequate attention to maintenance needs. However,



as the trunk road system is now improved and serves most of the major economic
centers in the country, assigning an order of priority to projects is becoming
more complicated and there is a tendency to give more and more weight to
political considerations. Therefore planning of future road investments must
become more elaborate and systematically use economic analysis to provide
justifications and priorities for project alternatives, including maintenance.
2.23      In the framework of the continuing dialogue between the Bank and the
Government on the need to improve transport planning, an expatriate transport
economist, provided for two years under the Second Highway Project, has
started to assist DH in establishing basic principles of road planning.
However, no Cameroonian counterparts have yet been appointed. As the next
step, the Government will set up a Road Planning Unit within DH. In addition
to planning major road investments under the Fourth Development Plan, the unit
will participate in the selection of roads to be rehabilitated under the
proposed project (para. 3.36). A covenant in the proposed Loan/Credit Agree-
ments requires that the Government set up and staff the Road Planning Unit by
December 31, 1979 as detailed in the Plan of Action (Annex 1).
H. Engineering
2.24      The Division of New Works within DH is responsible for the engineer-
ing and construction of roads. The division carries out only the design and
supervision of small projects, relying heavily on French design standards.
Foreign consultants and, to a lesser extent, the state-owned consulting firm
Societe d'Etude pour le Developpement de l'Afrique (SEDA) prepare preinvest-
ment studies of, and supervise, large projects. There is only one small
private consulting firm, operating mainly in western Cameroon. The Centre de
Recherche et d'Experimentation des Travaux Publics (CRETP) undertakes practi-
cally all geotechnical surveys and materials testing for DH's projects. It
is well equipped and staffed by 35 engineers and technicians; the number of
expatriate staff is gradually decreasing.
I. Construction
2.25      Contracts for highway projects financed by international or bilateral
assistance are let on the basis of competitive bidding following procurement
guidelines of the agencies involved. Most of the major contractors are local
subsidiaries of European firms; only one is Cameroonian. About 350 domestic
small- and medium-sized contractors work primarily in building construction
and participate only marginally in civil works due to insufficient equipment,
lack of experienced staff, insufficient management capability and limited
Government support.



- 16 -
2.26      In coming years, there will be a large amount of road and urban
street rehabilitation, water supply extension, and sewerage construction
which domestic contractors could carry out. Recently, domestic contractors
have shown growing interest in participating in civil works. Several firms
have purchased heavy earth-moving equipment and have started bidding for
small, urban civil works. However, development of the domestic contract-
ing industry is impeded by the major deficiencies mentioned in the preceding
paragraph.
2.27      During preparation of the proposed project, a Bank consultant
reviewed the situation and recommended measures to promote domestic contrac-
tors. Among the things the Government can do are:
(i) improve its classification of contractors;
(ii)  divide road projects into lots which domestic contractors
have the capacity to execute;
(iii) determine incentives that permit domestic contractors or
joint ventures which include them to participate more
in civil works;
(iv)  speed up disbursements to improve contractors'
cash flows;
(v) accord domestic contractors more favorable credit terms for
the purchase of equipment;
(vi) increase the number of Cameroonian technicians trained for
the private sector; and
(vii) provide technical assistance to domestic contractors.
The Government has indicated its readiness to act on these recommendations
and will take concrete steps to begin implementing the recommendations (paras.
3.17 and 3.24). Domestic contractors can apply for loans for the purchase
of road construction equipment to the Cameroonian Development Bank under a
line of credit provided by the Small- and Medium- Scale Enterprise Project
(Cr. 575 CM, US$3.0 million, July 1975) with a proposed follow-up project
scheduled for FY 1980.
J. Maintenance
2.28      DH is responsible for maintaining all paved and class A, B and C
roads, totalling about 14,500 km. The road maintenance organization dates
from 1968 when, under auspices of FAC, NCEEP was created by taking over all



-- 17 -
DH road equipment and repair facilit:ies, and received a substantial amount
of new road maintenance equipment. At the time, DH and NCEEP staff was
reinforced by a number of FAC technical assistance experts. The Government
adequately funded road maintenance operations and productivity was high.
However, the situation later steadily deteriorated as the length of the road
network increased, FAC phased out technical assistance, kilometric budget
allocations for road maintenance decreased in real terms and, as a consequence,
NCEEP had no funds to increase or even renew its road maintenance equipment.
District Authorities ("Prefectures") scarcely maintain the rest of the classi-
fied network, consisting of about 14,200 km of D and E roads. Local authori-
ties and various public and private corporations maintain the unclassified
network of about 30,000 km with varying means and success.
2.29      The Government has decided to take the necessary measures to improve
road maintenance. DH has proposed four new categories for the classified net-
work (para. 2.01), and would be in charge of national, provincial and district
roads. The network under DH's direct responsibility would thus increase from
about 14,500 km to about 16,900 km. Local roads (11,800 km) and unclassified
roads (30,000 km), which constitute the feeder roads network, would remain the
responsibility of various Government agencies and local authorities; DH's
Central Feeder Roads Unit would coordinate their activities. As a step in the
new maintenance effort, the Federal Republic of Germany has started a project
to assist in maintaining and repairing the paved Mora-Maltam road (200 km).
But the bulk of the effort to improve DH and NCEEP operations will come under
the proposed project which will address major shortcomings.
2.30      DH's Division of Highway Haintenance plans and executes road main-
tenance. The field organization comprises 9 Provincial Offices supervising
40 subdivisions of which about 30 area operational (see map). While field
subdivisions carry out most routine and periodic maintenance, Provincial
Offices sometimes carry out specific maintenance operations. DH's methods
need improvement and its control over operations should be strengthened. The
main shortcomings are lack of (a) a detailed, yearly work program with quanti-
fied objectives for each subdivision; (b) regular reports on the work carried
out by each subdivision; and (c) a s:Lmplified performance accounting system to
determine the cost of each maintenance operation.
2.31      DH rents its heavy road maintenance equipment from NCEEP (para.
2.13). Only since 1976 has NCEEP operated as an administrative agency and
had financial autonomy with a performance accounting system. NCEEP' s organi-
zation is satisfactory, although its Spare Parts Procurement and Stockpiling
Service is inefficient. DH is the major client of NCEEP, renting about 80% of
NCEEP's total fleet but generally providing its own operators and drivers.
Some difficulties have arisen between DH and NCEEP over (a) the distribution
of responsibilities for equipment management, and (b) which agency would be
charged for equipment breakdowns. These difficulties have increased with
aging and unavailability of equipment. It has been agreed with the Government
that, under the proposed project, these difficulties will be alleviated, and
coordination between DH and NCEEP simplified, by permanently assigning equip-
ment to DH (para. 3.37), which is already responsible for its maintenance.
NCEEP will remain in charge of equipment repair (para. 2.32) and renewal
(para. 2.33).



- 18 -
2.32      DH carries out daily and preventive maintenance and small repairs of
road equipment in its subdivision workshops. NCEEP undertakes large repairs
in its workshops in Bafoussam, Bertoua and Ngaoundere, and large repairs and
overhauls in its main workshops in Bamenda, Douala, Garoua and Yaounde. Both
DH and NCEEP workshops lack proper equipment.
2.33      NCEEP's rental rates, which are approved by MINEH, originally in-
cluded equipment amortization in addition to maintenance and repair costs.
As road maintenance allocations per km have remained practically constant
since 1969, MINEH has not been able to accept a significant increase in
rental rates, which are now about 40% below levels necessary to provide ade-
quate amortization of equipment. In addition, repair costs have increased
as equipment has become older. Technical assistance provided under the
proposed project will review NCEEP's rental rates and determine, on the basis
of the equipment replacement cost and average economic life, what amortization
must be included. The Government has agreed to ensure regular renewal of road
maintenance equipment. NCEEP will open a special account for this exclusive
purpose, which will be funded out of the revenues from the lease of its
equipment.
K. Use of Appropriate Technology
2.34      The Government traditionally uses highly capital-intensive
methods for road construction and maintenance. The training given in devel-
oped countries to MINEH's senior staff reinforces this tendency. A first
attempt to use a different mix of capital and labor for the construction of
low volume roads is being undertaken in West Cameroon where the Department
of Community Development (DCD), with the help of the Swiss Agency for Tech-
nical Assistance, is experimenting with feeder road improvement using labor-
intensive and intermediate technology. The Bank has had discussions with
the Government on the possibility of departing from current capital-intensive
technology. As a result, the Feeder Roads Project includes 300 km of feeder
roads which DCD will construct with a relatively light brigade. The Govern-
ment wants to review carefully the achievements of the experiment before it
is generalized. Under the proposed project, the Government will introduce
different mixes of labor and equipment for road maintenance operations based
on recommendations made by consultants in the road maintenance study (para.
3.01). It will set up a large number of manual units to maintain shoulders,
slopes, ditches and drainage structures, and to eliminate potholes on unpaved
roads. It will also create minor repairs units using light equipment for the
repair of drainage structures, and limited earth-moving and pavement works.
L. Past Bank Group Assistance
2.35      Bank assistance to Cameroon's road subsector had concentrated
on the construction of trunk roads, but is diversifying into feeder roads
construction and, with the proposed project, road maintenance. Six projects



- 19 -
have been or are being implemented. In June 1964, the Bank provided a
US$200,000 Technical Assistance Grant for a feasibility study of possible
improvements of the Ngaoundere-Garoua road (246 km).  In January 1968, the
Association financed a US$600,000 Engineering Credit (S3 CM) for the detailed
engineering of this road and of the Tiko-Victoria road (22 km).
2.36      The First Highway Project (Loan 663/Credit 180 CM, US$19.9 million,
March 1970) included construction of the above two roads to paved standards
and preinvestment studies for the improvement of the Garoua-Mora (258 km)
and Douala-Pont du Nkam (161 km) roads. The Tiko-Victoria road was satisfac-
torily completed in April 1973. Construction of the Ngaoundere-GGaroua road
encountered technical difficulties when, during the 1973 rainy season, about
60 km of completed sections started to break up because of poor drainage.
The drainage design was modified, failing sections were repaired and the road
was completed without a significant increase in the expected volume of works
in June 1975 two years later than expected. The road is in good condition.
Because of inflation, the delayed completion of the works increased construc-
tion costs. The Government bore the entire overrun, but the Bank agreed to
finance an additional US$2.0 million to compensate for the devaluation of the
US dollar during project execution. The Project Performance Audit Report (No.
1574, April 29, 1977) for the First Highway Project concluded that, in addi-
tion to reducing delays in project implementation, the Government should
better coordinate transport activities. This is being partially done under
the Technical Assistance Project and the Third Highway Project and will be
continued under the proposed project. The proposed overall transport sector
study (para. 1.16) will also be designed to achieve this objective.
2.37      The Second Highway Project (Loan 935/Credit 429 CM, US$48.0 million,
September 1973) comprised construction of three roads to paved standards, a
road maintenance study, and technicaL assistance. Construction of the Pont
du Noun-Foumban road (50 km) was satisfactorily completed in December 1976,
of the Figuil-Mora section (163 km) of the Garoua-Mora road in July 1977, and
of the Douala-Pont du Nkam road in July 1978. The road maintenance study was
completed in May 1978 and served partly as the basis for preparing the pro-
posed project. Technical assistance has been provided to DH since April 1977.
The reconnaissance study of forestry evacuation roads was completed in December
1978. The project suffered from the 1973-74 world-wide inflation, which nearly
doubled its total cost. Consequently, the Government agreed to postpone con-
struction of the Garoua-Figuil road section (95 km). A supplementary Credit
of US$15.0 million was approved in March 1976 to help alleviate the burden
imposed on the Government by the project's cost overrun.
2.38      Implementation of the Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1494/Credit 749 CM,
US$11.1 million, December 1977) started in 1978. The project includes creation
of a Central Feeder Roads Unit within DH and a four-year construction program
for 2,200 km of feeder roads.
2.39      The Third Highway Project (Loan 1515 CM, US$16.5 million, April
1978) includes construction of the Garoua-Figuil road section deleted from
the Second Highway Project, and technical assistance to streangthen transport
planning and coordination within the Hinistry of Transport. Construction is
nearly completed, and technical assistance has started.

3. THE PROJECT
3.01      The need to improve road maintenance was identified in the early
1970s, during preparation of the Second Highway Project. That project
included an overall study to define a five-year road maintenance program
which was expected to constitute the basis of the maintenance component
of the following project. However, execution of the study by consultants
was very slow, since collecting the necessary data in the field proved more
difficult than expected and in fact was only partly achieved. There was
also a difference of views between the Government and the Bank as to the
adequacy of the size of the program recommended by the consultants. Although
there were conflicting opinions within the Government, it generally believed
it had the technical and financial capacity to implement a much larger program
than the Bank considered feasible. At the request of the Government, which
was experiencing increasing difficulties in carrying out road maintenance, the
proposed project was appraised in April 1978, using the consultants' technical
inputs but without the benefit of their report, the final draft of which was
not submitted until May 1978. The road maintenance and rehabilitation compo-
nents of the proposed project appear to be the maximum that the Government
can carrv out by force account. Should additional financial resources become
available for road maintenance during project execution, the Government has
agreed to review, in consultation with the Bank, its overall road maintenance
program in order to determine how these additional funds may best be used in
combination with the existing administrative and manpower resources.
3.02      The major goal of the proposed project is to improve the Govern-
ment's capacity to maintain roads by strengthening the Department of High-
ways and the National Civil Engineering Equipment Pool's operations. The
proposed project constitutes a first step in recovering the Government's
capacity to maintain roads as was the case a decade ago when budgetary alloca-
tions and equipment were sufficient (para. 2.28). The proposed project will
also train staff and ensure sufficient budgetary allocations for road main-
tenance. Other objectives are to promote the domestic contracting industry,
control vehicle loads and improve road planning.
3.03      Periodic maintenance of paved roads has first priority since it
postpones the need for premature reconstruction. Periodic maintenance of
paved roads is to be carried out to a large extent by contractors under
Government financing and the proposed project only covers maintenance works
carried out by force account. To ensure that periodic maintenance receives
the priority it deserves, the Government has agreed that it must provide funds
and award contracts for the periodic maintenance of a minimum of 300 km of
paved roads annually.
3.04      To provide a balanced repartition of benefits to all regions,
the Government insisted that project coverage be distributed throughout
the country. Thus the network selected is quite large -- 16,900 km -- and
includes all national, provincial and district roads which are DH's direct
responsibility. Implementing operations on such a scale requires phasing
and close monitoring. Consequently, the proposed project will be implemented
in three phases and includes built-in flexibility and safeguards. Should



- 21 -
any difficulty arise in the implementation of one phase, a project covenant
requires that the later phases be delayed until the previous phase has been
satisfactorily executed. Thus some delays may occur in the overall imple-
mentation of the proposed project in order to ensure that its major objectives
of institution building and training are carried out.
3.05      The Government is reviewing a reorganization of agencies dealing
with road maintenance. But evaluating the administrative and financial con-
sequences of possible changes will require a long time and no decision is
likely to be made in the near future. The proposed project, therefore, will
build on the existing administrative structure, which is adequate provided
some minor organizational changes, included in the project, are made in DH
and NCEEP.  In order to prevent the project from being affected by changes
in the agencies involved in road maintenance, a covenant in the proposed
Loan/Credit Agreements requires that any major reorganization of such agencies
be discussed with the Bank (para. 2.14).
A. Project Description
3.06      With these objectives in inind, the proposed project will consist of:
(a)  a three-year training program (FYs 1981-83) for DH and NCEEP
staff engaged in road maintenance;
(b)  a four-year road maintenance and rehabilitation program
(FYs 1982-85) for execution of routine maintenance of about
16,900 km of roads and rehabilitation. of about 1,350 km
of major unpaved roads by force account;
(c)  rehabilitation of about 340 km of unpaved roads by,
and technical aid to, domestic contractors;
(d)  installation of two weighing stations;
(e)  establishment of a Road Planning Unit within the Department
of Highways; and
(f)  preinvestment studies for the Douala-Yaounde road and about
500 km of forestry evacuation roads to be defined.
3.07      To carry out these elements, the proposed Loan/Credit will assist in
the financing of:
(a)  training facilities, training equipment and fellowships for
Cameroonian professionals and instructors;
(b)  road maintenance and workshop equipment, and operating costs
for road rehabilitation by force account;
(c)  civil works for road rehabilitation by domestic contractors;



- 22 -
(d) civil works, building construction and weighing equipment
for weighing stations;
(e) consultants' services for preinvestment studies; and
(f) technical assistance for:
(i)  the training program,
(ii) the road maintenance and rehabilitation program,
(iii)  promotion of the domestic contracting industry, and
(iv)  the Road Planning Unit.
Training Program
3.08      Carrying out the proposed road maintenance and rehabilitation
program will require about 600 skilled staff (foremen, gang leaders, operators,
drivers, mechanics and accountants), corresponding to DH's permanent skilled
staff. Many DH staff have never benefited from systematic training and need
to be retrained; additional staff to be hired to compensate for drop-outs and
turnover of staff will also need training. This will mostly be done in the
field by setting up a Training Production Brigade (TPB) supported by a small
DH Training Center to be created. Both will be financed under the project.
The proposed project will also strengthen NCEEP's Training Centers for
Mechanics and Operators by providing equipment and ten fellowships to train
Cameroonian instructors abroad for these centers. All training activities
will be coordinated by an expatriate training advisor (para. 3.22). To be
effective, this training effort will need to be accompanied by improvements in
DH's personnel management policies as regards salaries, incentives and career
development. The training advisor will advise the Government on this matter.
The Government has agreed to discuss with the Bank the recommendations of the
training advisor and a schedule for their implementation.
3.09      The TPB will be one of the nine rehabiliation brigades provided
under the proposed project (para. 3.14) except for the first year when it will
rent existing NCEEP equipment. However, training would be the primary func-
tion of the TPB. It will be headed by three expatriate experts (para. 3.22),
assisted by three Cameroonian counterparts (a road engineer, a chief operator
and a chief mechanic), plus two road foremen and a senior mechanic. TPB will
have about 20 regular staff and up to 60 trainees at all levels. Each trainee
will receive one to four months' training depending on the skills required.
Gang leaders for the manual maintenance units will receive special courses on
manual maintenance operations, overseeing work, personnel administration and
basic accounting. TPB will operate three years under the proposed project
with a total possible throughput of about 600 trainees. After completion
of the three-year training program, TPB will provide advanced training to
selected personnel. DH's Training Center will be staffed with a head, two
road supervisors and an administrative/accounting technician who will be
trained abroad during construction of the center, plus a chief operator and
a chief mechanic.



- 23 -
3.10     Detailed cost estimates for training facilities and for fellowships
are given in Annex II, pages 2 and 3. The Government has agree to make
satisfactory arrangements for staffing and financing operating costs of
training facilities, and for training of staff and instructors as detailed
in the Plan of Action.
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program
3.11      The proposed road maintenance and rehabilitationa program, to be
carried out by force account, has two objectives. The short-term objective
is to keep DH's road network passable through routine maintenance and minor
repairs. The long-term objective is to rehabilitate most of the unpaved
network, starting by equipping nine rehabilitation brigades to get the work
underway.
3.12      There is no record of the volume of road maintenance work carried
out annually by DH. Each year, DH attempts to provide 1 clry grading or
grading/compacting unit to each of the 30 subdivisions in operation, and 1
regravelling brigade to each of the 9 Provincial Offices, but, increasingly,
the assigned equipment is not in working order. The proposed project includes
11 dry grading and 9 grading/compacting units, and 9 rehabilitation brigades,
which DH can manage.  It also includes a large increase irn the number of
manual units (172) as the Government will develop more labor-intensive main-
tenance methods for some maintenance operations. The only innovation lies
in setting up 9 minor repairs units which exist in only a few subdivisions
and with different equipment; these units will require close monitoring and
supervision. The maintenance and rehabilitation program will be implemented
in three phases under the proposed project with the assistance of consultants
(para. 3.23). Its size is adapted to DH's absorptive capacity.
Routine Maintenance and Minor Repairs
3.13      Routine maintenance will be carried olut as follows:
(a)  paved roads:  33 manual units to clear ditches and culverts
and maintain shoulders and road signs; and 7 patching units
to fill potholes and perform sealing and patching operations;
(b)  unpaved roads:  139 manual units to fill potholes, clear
ditches and culverts, and maintain shoulders, slopes and road
signs; 11 dry grading units in the south, where gravel and
laterite soils prevail; and 9 grading/compacting units in the
north where sandclay soils prevail.
In addition, nine minor repairs units will carry out urgent- repairs, improve
drainage, and carry out spot regravelling on the worst sections of unpaved
roads. The equipment composition and cost, personnel, operating costs and
expected output of these units are given in Annex III, pages 1-5.  The Govern-
ment has agreed to the maintenance stFrategy selected for each category of road
as shown below. While this will be a major improvement in road maintenance,
it is below the optimum justified by traffic. The already substantial size of
the proposed project and the necessary large increase in the Government's road
maintenance budget (para. 3.32) preclude a greater effort.

District Roads (5,400 km)
Manual work: 1 unit for 150 km
Dry grading: 1 grading/year
Rehabilitation
3.14      The project will provide nine rehabilitation brigades to start
operating in three phases. Each of the brigades will rehabilitate about 50 km
of unpaved roads per year. The work consists of constructing culverts and
small bridges, executing minor earthworks, widening ditches and spreading a
15-20 cm thick, 8 m wide surface layer. Only in exceptional cases will the
works include realignment or widening of the road formation. The composition
and cost of equipment, personnel and operating costs of the brigades are given
in Annex III, page 6. Rehabilitation by force account will start at the
beginning of the second year of the program (October 1981). Annual output
will grow from 150 km during the second project year to 300 km during the
third, and 450 km during the fourth and fifth years, for a total of about
1,350 km.
Road Equipment
3.15      NCEEP purchased most of its equipment with FAC financing between
1968 and 1971 or with Government financing before 1968. It acquired additional
equipment with foreign financing in 1975. However, this additional equipment
has proved ill-suited for the road maintenance works it has to carry out and,



- 25 -
having been inadequately maintained, experiences an unusually high rate of
breakdowns. NCEEP will not be in a position to renew equipment on its own
resources until the proposed project sets up a financial mechanism to that end
(para. 2.33). The average age of NCEEP's equipment is 8.5 years. At the end
of 1981, when the first project units and brigades will start operating,
NCEEP's newest pieces of equipment will be over five years old, which, exper-
ience shows, is the write-off age for equipment in Cameroon. If assigned to
the project, the existing worn-out equipment would impede progress of oper-
ations, and therefore the project must provide new equipment to all proposed
units and brigades, including TPB, except for a few pieces recently ordered by
the Government. Annex II, page 4, gives a list of the equipment required and
its estimated cost.
Workshop Equipment
3.16      The proposed project will provide additional equipment to increase
the efficiency of the seven NCEEP workshops. Annex II, page 5, lists the
equipment, its destination and estimated cost. Tools and small pieces of
workshop equipment will also be provided to the DH subdivisions in operation.
Promotion of the Domestic Contracting Industry
3.17      The proposed project will constitute a first step toward promoting
domestic contractors who will rehabilitate about 340 km of unpaved roads. The
works are similar to those to be carried out by DH's rehabilitation brigades
(para. 3.14), but with more earth moving and a 20-25 cm thick gravel surface.
The works will be divided into lots which domestic contractors would be able
to execute over a period of two years. The table below shows the list of
roads agreed to by the Government and the Bank. These road works will consti-
tute a component of a larger program which the Goverrment intends to design
for the years to come in order to create a steady market for domestic con-
tractors, if this first step is promising. The proposed project will also
provide technical assistance to domestic contractors and to DH for (a) the
definition of measures capable of promoting the domestic contracting industry
and (b) the preparation of bidding dLocuments and supervision of the works
(para. 3.24).

Control of Vehicle Loads
3.18      The extension and improvement of the paved network have led to a
widespread increase in the overloading of trucks. Under the proposed project,
two weighing stations will be set up to control axle loads. One will be
located on the outskirts of Douala on the Douala-Bafoussam road to control
traffic on this major axis; the other will be at the exit of the railhead at
Ngaoundere to control northern Cameroon traffic and Chadian transit traffic.
Each station will comprise fixed scales with automatic recording of vehicle
weights, offices and an unloading and storage area. This will constitute a
first tranche of a larger Government scheme to control vehicles loads on all
major paved roads and will be used to define detailed operational practices.
Road Planning
3.19      DH will set up a Road Planning Unit which will:  (a)  collect and
analyze basic traffic and cost data; (b) carry out prefeasibility studies
and supervise economic studies undertaken by consultants; (c) prepare road
investment programs and follow their execution; and (d) carry out special
studies as necessary. In particular, the unit will assist in the preparation
of annual work programs for the rehabilitation of unpaved roads by force
account (para. 3.36). The unit will be staffed by an economist or statis-
tician in charge of the unit and two senior technicians, and the proposed
project will provide it with technical assistance (para. 3.25). The Govern-
ment has agreed to outline terms of reference for the unit (Annex IV), as
well as to set up and staff the unit not later than December 31, 1979.
Preinvestment Studies
3.20      This item includes the completion of the ongoing study currently
being carried out under Government financing for construction of the Douala-
Yaounde road (para. 1.17) and preinvestment studies for forestry evacuation
roads. In 1978, a reconnaissance of forestry roads was carried out by consul-
tants under the Second Highway Project. After selection by agreement between
the Government and the Bank of about 500 km of roads, the Road Planning
Unit will prepare a feasibility study for their improvement. About 250 km
of roads with the highest return will then be selected. Consultants will
carry out detailed engineering on these roads under terms of reference
approved by the Bank.
Technical Assistance
3.21      The proposed project will comprise a total of 477 man-months of
technical assistance divided as follows:
-    147 man-months for the training program;
-    216 man-months for the road maintenance and rehabilitation
program;
-    78 man-months for the promotion of domestic contractors; and
-    36 man-months for road planning.



- 27 -
3.22      All training activities wiLl be coordinated by an expatriate train-
ing advisor who will design a detailed program for staff training, supervise
the carrying out of this program during its full implementation period, and
advise the Government on personnel management policies.  Three other expatri-
ates (a road engineer, a chief operator and a chief mechanic) will manage TPB
operations assisted by Cameroonian counterparts. Technical assistance will be
phased out at the end of the three-year training program, and TPB will continue
operating under the management of Cameroonian staff with the expatriate road
engineer acting as advisor for another year. The Government has agreed to
outline terms of reference for the technical assistance (Annex V) and to
provide counterpart staff to TPB, as detailed in the Plan of Action.
3.23      Qualified Cameroonian professionals fill all management positions
within the Division of Highway Maintenance and NCEEP. No appointment of
senior staff is necessary. However, implementing the proposed maintenance
and rehabilitation program will require a major effort which will only be
made possible with the assistance of consultants. Technical assistance will
be totally phased out after four years, when new equipment and working methods
will be used on a regular basis. The expatriate team will consist of:
(a)  a road engineer and mission leader to help DH and NCEEP
implement the proposed program, liaise with the training
advisor and the Road Planning Unit, determine rental
rates for NCEEP equipment and prepare a follow-up main-
tenance program;
(b) an organization/accounting expert to assist DH in
setting up an adequate mechanism for preparing detailed
annual work programs for each Subdivision, and in im-
plementing a simplified performance accounting system
and quarterly reports on the volume of maintenance
works actually carried out;
(c) a procurement advisor to assist NCEEP in preparing
bidding documents for road and workshop equipment,
evaluating the proposals, and accepting and forward-
ing deliveries;
(d) a mechanical engineer to assist NCEEP's workshop heads
in setting up the new equipment financed under the pro-
posed project and training mechanics on-the-job to use it;
(e) an equipment specialist to assist NCEEP in setting up
mobile repair units, and to ensure that adequate equipment
maintenance is provided by DH units and brigades; and
(d) a spare parts management specialist to reorganize NCEEP's
Spare Parts Procurement and Stockpiling Service and train
its staff.
The Government has agreed to outline terms of reference for these experts
(Annex VI).

3.24      Expatriates will also assist in the promotion of the domestic
contracting industry. For three years an advisor to contractors will be
assigned to the National Center for Assistance to Small- and Medium-Sized
Enterprises. He will assess which contractors are capable of engaging in
civil works construction; help domestic contractors to prepare bids, select
equipment and organize works; advise domestic contractors on administrative
and financial management, and on requests for equipment loans; advise the
Government on how to promote domestic contractors; and train a counterpart.
A condition of the proposed project is that the Government appoint a coun-
terpart to the advisor to contractors not later than one year after the
provision of this expatriate.   For six months, an administrative expert will
help DH define and implement a Government policy to assist domestic contrac-
tors in their development. For three years, an expatriate road engineer will
assist DH with road rehabilitation to be carried out by domesic contractors.
He will help prepare the detailed engineering and bidding documents of the
various lots, prequalify contractors, evaluate bids, prepare draft contracts
and supervise works. The Government has agreed to outline terms of reference
for these three experts (Annex VII).
3.25      The Department of Highways will set up and staff a Road Planning
Unit. The proposed project will provide an expatriate transport economist
for three years to assist the unit. Outline terms of reference for the eco-
nomist are included in those for the unit (Annex IV). In order to guarantee
maximum benefit from this technical assistance, it has been agreed with the
Government that provision of the expatriate will be contingent upon the full
staffing of the unit.
B. Project Costs and Financing
Capital Cost
3.26      The total capital cost of the project, net of taxes and duties,
is estimated at US$65.0 million, with foreign costs of US$48.0 million (74%);
local costs are estimated at US$17.0 million; taxes and duties add about
US$18.0 million. Project capital costs are summarized below. Annex II gives
details of the project capital costs and cost breakdown for training facilities,
technical assistance and fellowships, and road and workshop equipment. The
Bank will finance the foreign exchange cost of the project (US$48.0 million),
and the Government will finance all local costs (US$35.0 million including
US$18.0 million of taxes).
3.27      Cost estimates of road and workshop equipment are based on recent
suppliers' quotations. Cost estimates for road equipment include an addi-
tional 15% for spare parts to allow NCEEP to service the equipment adequately.
Operating costs of the road rehabilitation brigades are based on 160 working
days per year and actual fuel and materials consumption observed in other
African countries. The average rehabilitation cost, net of taxes, of unpaved
roads is US$13,200 per km when works are carried out by force account. This
cost includes equipment depreciation and 15% overhead, but excludes technical



- 29 -
assistance. The cost is estimated at US$15,400 per km when works are carried
out by contractors, as more earth moving and a thicker pavement are generally
assumed. Cost estimates for building construction and infrastructure works
for the weighing stations are based on bids recently received in Cameroon for
similar works. Cost estimates for training and weighing equipment are based
on dealers' quotations.

3.28               Costs for technical assistance were estimated on the basis of current
costs for consulting services in West Africa.  The average billing rate, net of
taxes, is estimated at about US$5,900 per man-month, including social security,
bonuses, expatriate allowance, overhead and the firm's fees. Reimbursable
expenses, including air trips, air freight, subsistence and local allowance,
field supervision, and vehicle purchase and operations, average US$2,200 per
man-month. Fellowships are estimated at US$1,800 per month, including travel
and accommodation. Cost estimates for the study of the Douala-Yaounde road
are based on the current contract between the Government and the consultant.
Cost estimates for forestry road studies, averaging US$5,900 per km, are based
on similar services carried out in Cameroon.



3.29      Physical contingencies amounting to 10% of the road equipment base
cost have been added to allow for possible changes in the list of equipment
for the second and third phases of delivery. There are no separate physical
contingencies for other project components, as costs are fixed over a set
period of time and not related to the amount of work to be carried out. Price
contingencies for foreign costs have been estimated at 10% per year and take
into account the expected impact of future international prices on goods
imported in Cameroon. Price contingencies for local costs have also been
estimated at 10% per year based on Cameroon's economic prospects. Price
contingencies amount to 27% of the base rost.
Recurrent Cost
3.30      The Government's annual budgets finance all recurrent expenditures
for maintenance of the classified road network, consisting of periodic and
routine maintenance. The proposed road maintenance program only comprises
routine maintenance and minor repairs for the roads under direct DH respon-
sibility, i.e. excluding local roads. However, the Government must allocate
enough funds for the full maintenance of the classified network during project
execution.
3.31      Periodic maintenance of paved roads, consisting of a double surface
treatment every seven years, is estimated to cost about US$26,000 per km in-
cluding taxes (or an average of US$3,700 annually). Periodic maintenance of
unpaved roads, consisting of regravelling every 5-7 years, cannot adequately
be carried out until the roads are rehabilitated. No budget allocation is
necessary for this operation for the next few years. To allow adequate
maintenance of the classified road network, the road maintenance budget should
finance the average costs per km indicated below for each category of roads,
which must be compared to current budget allocations. The total cost of
adequate routine maintenance amounts to US$14.6 million p.a. including taxes.
Minor repairs amount to US$1.8 million. Periodic maintenance of paved road is
estimated at US$8.5 million. Budget allocations for FY 1978 were US$13.0
million. If used efficiently, they would hardly have covered expenditures for
adequate routine maintenance leaving no funds for minor repairs and periodic
maintenance. For FY 1979, the Government has substantially increased the road
maintenance budget to US$15.6 million, including US$1.0 million which will be
used for periodic maintenance of paved roads, plus US$2.5 million specifically
earmarked for periodic maintenance of paved roads.

3.32      The road maintenance budget, taking into account the start of
operations of project units in three phases at the beginning of FYs 1982,
1983, and 1984, should continue to increase as follows:

Road maintenance allocations should approximately increase by 28% in real
terms between FYs 1979 and 1981. In FY 1977, the road maintenance budget
amounted to 2.8% of the current budget, about one-fifth of road user charges
and one-third of total Government financing for roads. A projection of the
current budgets shows that in FY 1984, the above requirement would represent
3.8% of the national budget, a target already exceeded by similar countries
like Ivory Coast and Niger. These estimates do not include overhead for DH,
which is paid out of different items of the budget. The Government has
agreed to finance the above road maintenance allocations for FYs 1980-85 and
to finance the full operating costs of the nine rehabilitation brigades after
project completion. The Government has also agreed to submit to the Bank,
for review and comment, not later than April 30 of each year until project
completion, the draft maintenance budget for the following fiscal year.
C. Implementation
3.33      The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning will have overall
responsibility for project implementation. Physical implementation will be
carried out by the MINEH through its Department of Highways, except for the
purchase of major road and workshop equipment, major repair of road equipment,
and advanced training for mechanics and operators, which will be carried out
by the National Civil Engineering Equipment Pool, and for technical assistance
to domestic contractors, which will be carried out by the National Center for
Assistance to Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises.
3.34      The implementation schedule is shown on the chart.  The proposed
project will take five years to complete. The project will start with the
training program for road maintenance staff, which will last three years and
be in three phases. Staff trained during the first year will start road
maintenance operations with new equipment at the beginning of the second year;
this will be repeated with staff trained during the second and third years.
Road equipment will be delivered at the end of the first, second and third
years. The road maintenance and rehabilitation program will be executed in
four years (July 1981 to June 1985). During the last season (July 1984 to



- 33 -
June 1985), the units and brigades will operate on a regu:Lar basis without any
technical assistance. Rehabilitation of unpaved roads by domestic contractors
will be carried out during two dry seasons: October 1981-June 1982 and
October 1982-June 1983. The two weighing stations will be set up during
the dry season of October 1981-June 1982. Technical assistance for the Road
Planning Unit will be provided between October 1979 and September 1982. The
study of the Douala-Yaounde road will be completed by March 1980. Forestry
road studies will be carried out from October 1979 to December 1981, with a
review of feasibility studies by the Government and the Bank in mid-1980.
3.35      The road maintenance and rehabilitation program fits into DH's
current organization, in which subdivisions carry out operations under the
close supervision of Provincial Offices, with the Division of Highway Main-
tenance responsible for the allocation of resources and control of execution.
Each subdivision establishes an annual work program which is reviewed by the
provincial engineer and then sent to DHM, which makes final changes in the
program taking into account overall equipment and budgetary constraints.
This process ensures the direct participation in the decision making of all
management staff involved in road maintenance and provides the staff with the
necessary motivation. The process will be strengthened during project execu-
tion by implementing more detailed annual work programs and quarterly reports
on work output, and the attention will shift from the assignment of scarce
equipment resources to the execution of the agreed volume of works.
3.36      However, defining the road rehabilitation program to be carried
out by force account under the proposed project (para. 3.14) requires more
elaborate programming. DHM, with the assistance of provincial engineers and
the new Road Planning Unit, will prepare the yearly work programs. The works
will comprise rehabilitation of the worst stretches of the unpaved network,
and of complete sections of major unpaved roads. Roads to be rehabilitated
will be selected on a priority basis from among those having an average daily
traffic of more than 100 vehicles or serving specific development projects.
The criteria for selecting the roads for each year's program will include:
(a)  a minimum economic rate of return (ERR) of 15% for each road;
benefits will be principally road-user savings on vehicle
operating costs (VOC); however, for those roads serving
specific development projects, part of the incremental value
added generated by the development project may be included
instead of VOC savings on the generated traffic;
(b)  factors such as size and characteristics of the population,
and the social and administrative centers served by the
road; and
(c)  geographical distribution to facilitate logistics for the
rehabilitation units.
Not later than three months before the beginning of the works, the Government
will submit the proposed annual work program to the Bank for review and
approval.



-3 4
3.37      NCEEP equipment purchased under the project will be permanently
assigned to specific DH units and brigades and will keep the same DH operator
or driver, who will be responsible for the daily maintenance of his piece of
equipment. To provide more incentives for road foremen and gang leaders,
MINEH will institute an allowance for field work. DH will also carry out
works on overtime when required to meet output targets. It will discontinue
its practice of using part-time staff for qualified positions (operators,
drivers, road workmen) and will employ full-time staff for these positions in
the project units and brigades. A simplified cost accounting system will be
set up for each unit and brigade. To speed up disbursements, a Government-
financed revolving fund will be created in each Provincial Office to be used
for some operating expenditures of the rehabilitation brigade.
3.38      DH will closely monitor implementation of the proposed project,
particularly the road maintenance and rehabilitation program. The volume of
works actually carried out by each subdivision will be compared every quarter
with the expected output defined in the yearly work program, and the perfor-
mance accounting system will assist in identifying causes of insufficient
productivity. The development of road maintenance and rehabilitation oper-
ations in three phases provides built-in flexibility. To ensure a smooth
implementation of the project, ordering the second and third tranches of road
equipment will be contingent upon satisfactory implementation of the previous
phases of the program and upon adequate road maintenance funding by the Gov-
ernment. The Government has agreed to designate a qualified and experienced
project coordinator who will inform the Bank on the implementation of the
project, and prepare quarterly progress reports and a project completion
report.
D. Procurement
3.39      The road maintenance and rehabilitation and the workshop, training
and weighing equipment, amounting to about US$41 million including taxes and
contingencies, will be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Contracts for items costing
less than US$50,000 and not exceeding a cumulative total of US$1.0 million can
be procured following local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Domestically manufactured goods will be allowed a preference of 15%
or the level of applicable duty, whichever is less, when comparing domestic
bids with those of foreign manufacturers. Bidders will compete on the basis
of cost, delivery time and reliability of after-sales service. As road
maintenance and rehabilitation equipment will be delivered in three phases,
bidding documents will include one firm phase, and two additional phases
contingent upon a formal order to proceed by the Government. Materials
(US$3.2 million), fuel and lubricants (US$4.1 million), and spare parts
(US$4.9 million) for operating the road rehabilitation brigades will be
procured on the basis of local competitive bidding following procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Road rehabilitation by contractors (US$8.2 million),
infrastructure works for the weighing stations (US$1.7 million) and building



35 -
construction (US$0.3 million), which are small, scattered works and would not
be attractive to foreign contractors, will be procured following local com-
petitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. Bidding documents will
include an appropriate price adjustment clause.  Prospective bidders will have
to be prequalified except for building construction. Technical assistance and
forestry road studies will be carried out by qualified, experienced consul-
tants in accordance with Bank Guide-Lines for the use of consultants. The
study of the Douala-Yaounde road wi:ll be carried out by consultants Gauff
(Germany) according to terms of reference and under conditions satisfactory
to the Bank. The Government has agreed to these arrangements.
E. Disbursements
3.40      Disbursements of the Loan/Credit would be made for:
(a) 100% of the foreign cost of imported road maintenance and
rehabilitation, workshop, training and weighing equipment
and 63% of the local cost of these items if procured locally:
US$24.0 million;
(b) 63% of operating costs of the rehabilitation brigades for
materials, fuel and lubricants, and spare parts (representing
the estimated foreign exchange component): US$6.8 million;
(c)  55% of the total cost of road rehabilitation by contractors,
infrastructure works for the weighing stations, and
building construction (representing the estimated foreign
exchange component): US$5.1 million; and
(d) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of technical assistance,
fellowships and preinvestment studies: US$6.7 million.
An amount of US$5.4 million will remain unallocated. Disbursements will be
fully documented, except for operating costs under (b), where disbursements
will be made against certified statements of expenditures for which the
documentation will be retained by DH. The Government has agreed that these
operating costs will be reflected in separate accounts which will be audited
by the Government Auditing Service (IGERA) or other independent auditors
acceptable to the Government and the Bank. The auditors' report will be
submitted to the Bank semi-annually within six months of the end of each
semi-annual period. Based on these participation rates, and the project
implementation schedule, a projected schedule of disbursements is given below.
Retroactive financing by the Bank to a maximum of US$0.3 million is provided
in order to ensure continuity of the ongoing study of the D)ouala-Yaounde road
after March 31, 1979.

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The proposed project will expand the technical and managerial cap-
abilities of the Department of Highways to maintain and improve the road net-
work. The project will provide cost effective methods and will improve main-
tenance operations, building a solid base which will extend far beyond the
five-year period covered by the project.
4.02      Efficient maintenance of a road network of nearly 17,000 km implies
tangible and intangible economic benefits to all parts of Cameroon. Substan-
tial benefits will accrue to road users in the form of lower transport costs
which would subsequently be passed on to producers and consumers as avoided
tariff increases in view of the keen competition between transporters.
Improvement of particularly difficult road sections will expand the areas
where trucker-traders operate. Many farming areas are beyond the current
circuits of these traders because truckers find it unprofitable to risk the
extra delays and wear on vehicles caused by the deteriorated state of the
roads. The project will therefore be of particular benefit to small towns
and villages.
4.03      The most important non-quantified benefit of the maintenance program
is the deferred need for road reconstruction, thus assuring the economic life
of the considerable road investment during recent years. On a local level,
improved road surface conditions translate into better transit time. This
implies less spoilage of perishable goods. For the increasing number of
people travelling by minibuses, bush taxis or pick-up trucks, trips will be
faster and more comfortable.
4.04      While the benefits of the road rehabilitation program are similar to
the benefits of the maintenance program, the geographic impact is directed to
areas of particular current and potential economic importance. The access
roads to be rehabilitated will complement feeder roads to be constructed under
the Feeder Roads Project and integrated with agricultural development projects
(e.g. Western Highlands, Zapi East). The road rehabilitation program thus
reinforces ongoing projects aimed at increasing agricultural production.
4.05      The proposed project will make a start in promoting domestic con-
tractors to carry out public works. As domestic contractors gain experience
in public works, they might form joint ventures with expatriate contractors
to bid for major public works contracts.
4.06      Installing weighing stations on trunk roads will enable the Govern-
ment to enforce load limitations, arLd start preventing the common practice
of truck overloading. The benefits from this investment will accrue to
taxpayers as well as the Government in the form of avoidance of premature
expenditures for rehabilitation of main roads.



- 38 -
4.07      The creation of a Road Planning Unit within the DH is a major step
in establishing a balanced program of road maintenance, rehabilitation and
construction in accordance with the requirements of the transport sector and
overall development needs. This unit will be established at a critical time
when major investments in roads are to be evaluated, e.g. the Douala-Yaounde
and Yaounde-Bafoussam roads.
B. Economic Analysis
Road Maintenance
4.08      The economic justification of the road maintenance program is based
on an assessment of economic costs and benefits with and without the proposed
project. Economic costs and benefits are expressed in CFA francs at January
1979 prices. The analysis incorporates the three-phase implementation of the
program. The estimated average economic life of maintenance equipment for
paved roads is seven years and for unpaved roads, five years.
4.09      Capital costs include equipment, spare parts, workshop equipment
and technical assistance. Annual recurrent costs include labor, fuel, road
material, equipment repair and overhead through the economic life of the
equipment. The "without project" costs, estimated on the basis of the net-of-
taxes kilometric allowances for road maintenance and reduced to allow for
interruptions of maintenance works because of non-availability of equipment
and material, are CFAE 129,000/km for paved roads, CFAF 74,000/km for national
roads, CFAF 62,000/km for provincial roads, and CFAF 38,000/km for district
roads.
4.10      Quantified benefits consist of estimated savings in vehicle operating
costs at projected levels of traffic. Vehicle operating costs by class of
vehicle are estimated for four road surface conditions (good, fair, poor and
bad) and two types of roads (paved and unpaved) as indicated below.
Vehicle Operating Costs (Net of Taxes)
(CFAF per vehicle-km, January 1979 prices)
Paved Road                          Unpaved Road
Type of                  Road Condition                       Road Condition
Vehicle           Good    Fair    Poor    Bad         Good    Fair    Poor       Bad
Passenger Car      18      20       22       26        20       24      28        33
Mini-Bus and
light Truck       34      36       46      58         38       50      64        78
Medium Truck       90       95     119      151        98      130      166      203
Heavy Truck       330     349      443      569       362      491     634       779



- 39 -
4.11      DH traffic counts for 1975 and 1976, reduced to allow for tapering
off of traffic between counting stations, were the base for projecting
traffic levels. Data on vehicle fuel consumption for 1971-76 as well as
traffic counts for 1974-76 were analyzed to forecast traffic growth rates,
which are estimated at 7% for paved roads, 5% for unpaved national and
provincial roads and 4% for district roads. Average daily traffic in 1982,
the first year of project benefits, is estimated at 590 vehicles for paved
roads, 122 for national unpaved roads, 61 for provincial roads and 29 for
district roads. For paved roads the average traffic mix is estimated at
light vehicles, 85%; medium trucks, 12%; and heavy trucks, 3%. For unpaved
roads light vehicles are estimated at 77% of total traffic, medium trucks at
20%, and heavy trucks at 3%. The light vehicle category is broken down as
follows: passenger cars (30%) and minibuses and small trucks (70%). Traffic
composition was estimated according to traffic mix indicated by DH traffic
counts.
4.12      In evaluating the benefits from routine patching of paved roads,
the assumption is made that the Government will finance the reseal of paved
roads by contractors every seventh year. The routine maintenance program
under the project is designed so as tco prevent further deterioration of roads
whatever their initial condition until the next reseal and to preserve a road
segment in good condition between each asphalt reseal. Average weighted VOC
on a paved road in good condition is estimated at about CFAF 46/vehicle-km.
Avoided increases in VOC are estimated at 2% p.a. from the second through the
sixth year implying VOC savings increasing from CFAF 1.0 - 4.6/vehicle-km.
This evaluation resulted in a benefit/cost ratio of 5.0:1 at a 12% discount
rate, which is the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Cameroon.
4.13      On unpaved roads, VOC are estimated to iaverage CFAF 73/vehicle-km
on roads in fair condition, compared to CFAF 93/vehicle-km on roads in poor
condition. In general, the routine maintenance program is expected to improve
unpaved roads from poor to fair condition. Because road condition will
deteriorate between each maintenance operation, quantified savings in VOC are
estimated to average CFAF 10/vehicle-km, or one-half of the difference in
VOC on unpaved roads in poor and fair condition. Some sections of the unpaved
network are however in a very deteriorated condition, frequently due to lack
of drainage. The nine minor repairs units are expected to upgrade such road
sections from bad to good condition, implying a high unit cost saving in
average VOC of about CFAF 58/vehicle-km. The economic life of these repairs
is estimated at seven years. The evaluation resulted in a benefit/cost ratio
of 4.0:1 for routine maintenance and 2.0:1 for minor repairs.
Road Rehabilitation
4.14      The roads to be rehabilitated by force account will be selected each
year and the list of roads will be agreed to by the Bank on the basis of an
economic justification. For the current economic analysis, an initial traffic
level of 100 vehicles per day (VPD) is assumed, since this traffic level is a
basic selection criterion (para. 3.36). Domestic contractors will also rehab-
ilitate five unpaved roads totalling 339 km (para. 3.17). Four of these roads



- 40 -
have an estimated traffic of 125 to 350 VPD in 1981. The fifth road, Maroua-
Bogo-Guirvidig (59 km) is vital to the marketing of rice from the Second SEMRY
Rice Project. Traffic on this road has been estimated in accordance with the
annual production of rice and on the transport needs of the project area. In
addition to VOC savings, benefits include the avoided financial charges and
storage costs for part of the rice production during the rainy season. The
average traffic growth rate on the roads to be rehabilitated except Maroua-
Guirvidig is estimated at 6%. The economic life of rehabilitation is esti-
mated at 11 years with one intermediate regravelling.
4.15      The cost of rehabilitation includes capital and recurrent costs.
After rehabilitation the cost of regravelling during the 6th year is included
in the cost stream. After project completion, recurrent costs for the rehabili-
tation brigades are assumed to be covered by the Government for the remaining
economic life of the equipment. Benefits from road rehabilitation are quanti-
fied as weighted average savings in VOC at CFAF 25/vehicle-km resulting from
upgrading roads in less than fair to good condition. In addition, annual
savings in road maintenance are estimated at CFAF 38,000 per km. The benefit/
cost ratio is estimated at 2.5:1 for works carried out both by force account
and contractors.
Economic Rates of Return for Major Project Components
4.16      The estimated economic rates of return of the routine maintenance
program are 105% for paved roads and 185% for unpaved roads. Such high rates
of return are not uncommon for maintenance projects and reflect that the
initial investment in road construction is treated as a sunk cost. It also
reflects high traffic levels and the initially poor state of the roads. The
minor repairs program would yield an estimated rate of return of 35%.  The
rehabilitation works of unpaved roads by force account and by contractor were
estimated to result in a rate of return of 40% and 46% respectively. The
somewhat higher return for the rehabilitation than for the minor repairs
reflects the four year additional economic life of the rehabilitation works as
well as the high traffic volume on the roads selected for rehabilitation. A
summary of economic costs and benefits is given in table 4.01. A note on the
economic methodology and detailed evaluation for each project component may be
found in the project file (Annex IX).
Economic Rate of Return of the Overall Project
4.17      The entire road works of the proposed project, routine maintenance,
minor repairs and rehabilitation are estimated to result in a benefit/cost
ratio of 3.0:1 discounted at 12%, corresponding to an economic rate of return
of 82%.
Sensivity Analysis
4.18      A sensitivity analysis was carried out, testing the scenario of a
reduction in the output of all maintenance and rehabilitation units of 20%
simultaneously with a cost overrun of 20%. This resulted in an overall rate



- 41 -
of return of 48%. Because the main emphasis of the project is on routine main-
tenance and because this part of the project has the highest rates of return,
the probability of a reduction of the overall rate of return of this project
to the 12% level of the opportunity cost of captial is indeed very small.
C. Project Risks
4.19      A road maintenance and rehabilitation program of the size and
complexity of the proposed program inevitably involves certain risks, some
of which may be readily identified and some of which may result from unfavor-
able developments outside the control of the Government. Bank audit reports
of completed highway maintenance projects in West Africa have pointed out
several problem areas which may impede the execution of maintenance projects.
In particular, shortfalls in local funding have severely reduced the effec-
tiveness of well-designed road maintenance projects.
4.20      For the proposed project the risk of a budget shortfall should be
analyzed separately for routine maintenance including minor repairs and
periodic maintenance of paved road. The budget level for routine maintenance
set for FY 1979 of US$14.6 million need only to be raised to US$16.4 million
by 1984 in order to cover the cost of the project units for routine maintenance
and minor repairs (at 1979 prices). The risk that funding may be inadequate
for routine maintenance and minor repairs thus seems rather small. For
periodic maintenance of paved roads, a regular schedule of asphalt reseal
every seven years is assumed. This implies a step up in the annual budget
level from US$3.5 million in FY 1979 to US$8.5 million in FY 1981. The
Government would carry out the asphalt resealing by contractor outside the
project itself, but failure to do so would result in deterioration of the
paved network in spite of the routine maintenance efforts of the project
itself. To safeguard against this project related risk, the Government will
send the draft road maintenance budgeted for FYs 1981-85 to the Bank for
review and comment.
4.21      Another typical problem of maintenance projects is a shortfall in
maintenance output. To avoid this risk the proposed project includes a major
training effort. Project implementation is phased in three stages in step
with the training program. While some of the trained personnel might transfer
to the private sector for better pay, staff incentives and the security of
governmental employment should counteract the lure of higher wages.
4.22      A special project risk is the balance between the governmental effort
in implementing the proposed project and other projects in the highway sector.
The particular problem of trying to do too much too soon may well arise if the
Government decides to carry out a large road maintenance effort outside of the
proposed project under bilateral assistance. In this case there is a risk of
underutilization of equipment because of the limitation of trained personnel
and equipment servicing facilities. Should additional funds for road mainte-
nance become available, the Government has agreed to review, in consultation
with the Bank, its overall maintenance program and means to carry it out.



- 42 -
4.23      An administrative problem of road maintenance under the current
division of responsibilities between DH and NCEEP is the lack of coordination
at a central level. To minimize this risk, all equipment procured under the
project will be assigned to specific units and brigades. NCEEP's role will be
limited to repairing this equipment. The acquisition of sufficient equipment
and the improvement in NCEEP's workshop operations should eliminate the
friction caused by unavailability of equipment for road works.
4.24      While recognizing the inherent difficulties of road maintenance
and rehabilitation on a country-wide scale, the proposed project does not
present unacceptable risks, and the anticipated benefits are high.

(i)  The RPU will establish priorities for road investment within
the Fourth Development Plan (FYs 1977-81) and will rank
projects in accordance with the following economic criteria:
- level of traffic,
- current and potential economic activities in area of road
influence,
- importance of road as a link in the overall road network,
- current condition of the road, and
-  population served by the road.
(ii)  The RPU will prepare a 5-year road investment program for the
Fifth Development Plan (FYs 1982-86) with priority ranking of
projects.

and Planning and the Ministry of Transport. At the request of the RPU these
ministries will furnish information on development projects and any govern-
mental regulation (existing or planned) influencing coordination or competi-
tion of road transport with other transport modes and the choice of transport
mode.
III.      Timing and Staffing
The RPU will be established not later than December 31, 1979.
The senior staff of the RPU will consist of:

UNITED REPUBLI]C OF CAMEROON
FOURTH HIGHIWAY PROJECT
Procedure for Disbursements Against Statements of Expenditures
1.        The proposed project provides for nine rehabilitation brigades,
one in each of the nine Provincial Offices. The foreign component of the
brigades' operating costs (materials, fuel and lubricants, and spare parts)
will be financed by the Loan/Credit during the lifespan of the project.
Disbursements for some of these operating costs will be made against state-
ments of expenditures, for which the documentation will be retained by the
Department of Highways. Current accounting and control procedures in Cameroon,
as described below, are adequate to ensure the appropriate use of the Loan/
Credit proceeds without specific amendments. To provide additional safety,
the operating costs will be reflected in separate accounts which will be
audited every six months by the State Control Department (IGERA) or other
independent auditors acceptable to the Government and the Bank.
2.        For the procurement of each item, a serially numbered purchase
order, signed by the chief of brigade and countersigned by the Provincial
Engineer acting as vote controller, is sent to the supplier, who provides
the item together with an invoice. The brigade storekeeper certifies on
the invoice that the item has been delivered and records the item in the
in-column of the storebook. Then the provincial accountant prepares a
payment voucher to which the invoice is attached. The Provincial Engineer
signs the voucher and the supplier is paid from the revolving fund opened
for the brigade. The storekeeper delivers the item to the employee who will
use it against a written order specifying the destination of the item and
records the move in the out-column of the storebook.
3.        All documentation is sent for control to the Provincial Controller
of the Ministry of Finance, who checks the correctness of the procurement
and disbursement. The revolving fund is periodically refunded after a
certificate of the Provincial Controller specifying the amount spent during
the previous period. The Budget Control Section of the Ministry of Finance
carries out yearly field checking of accounting books and votes. When irre-
gularities are discovered, the State Control Department, within the Presidency,
carries out a detailed inquiry.
