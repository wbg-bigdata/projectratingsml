SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The proposed project is the second Bank financed urban development
project in Indonesia. It is designed to provide assistance to the Government
in its Kampung Improvement Programs (KIP) which are aimed at raising the living
conditions of the urban poor by improving their access to basic services. In
a three year period, the project would expand the on-going KIP program in
Jakarta and extend coverage to Surabaya the second largest city in Indonesia.
Bank assistance provided for this project would help Government in initiating
a national KIP program based on the experience of the first urban project.
ii.       Indonesia, with a 1976 population of approximately 135 million, is
the fifth most populous country in the world. Some 19% of the population
resides in urban areas. The population of Indonesia as a whole continues to
grow at a rate of 2.5% per year, while the urban population is increasing at
a rate of 4% per year, and growth in three of the large cities--Jakarta,
Surabaya and Pontianak--has been even faster. With a rapidly increasing
population, thousands of peasants are migrating into urban centers seeking
employment and social opportunities, but none of the cities is prepared to
cope with the influx. The new migrants tend to settle in already crowded
areas of the cities or form new squatter settlements which lack adequate
housing or public services. Prior to the establishment of the KIP program,
little was done to improve the living conditions of the people in these areas
because the programs proposed (e.g., Government sponsored housing projects)
were often designed to standards which were beyond the means of the population
they intended to serve.
iii.      During Repelita I, the First Five-Year Development Plan (1969-74),
the Provincial Government of Jakarta (DKI) inaugurated a program to improve
the physical infrastructure in some of the worst kampungs in Jakarta. The
program attempts to deal with the minimum infrastructure needs of large
numbers of urban poor at a reasonable cost. The KIP represents the lowest
level of investment in this direction as it upgrades community infrastructure
in low-income areas thereby encouraging the residents themselves to upgrade
their dwellings as improvements are made in their environment. The size and
scope of the program has been enlarged substantially during Repelita II, the
Second Five-Year Development Plan (1974-79). The program in Jakarta for the
first two years of Repelita II was partially financed with Bank assistance.
The Municipal Government of Surabaya has also been carrying out a somewhat
similar program financed primarily from transfers to the city from the Central
Government, but on a very small scale and of a limited scope. The proposed
project would provide technical and financial support for an additional three
years (1976-79) in Jakarta and would support the development of a more compre-
hensive program in Surabaya that is expected to serve as the basis of a
National Kampung Improvement Program.



- ii -
iv.       The project would help finance upgrading over three years of 3,000
hectares of densely populated low-income areas in Jakarta and an estimated
374 ha in Surabaya. The project in both Jakarta and Surabaya includes:
(a) civil works for provision of paved footpaths, roads, drainage, water
supply, sanitation, primary schools and small health clinics; (b) a pilot
program to train community health workers in preventive medicine and basic
nutrition; and (c) technical assistance in project design, supervision,
monitoring and evaluation. The actual improvements in a kampung are deter-
mined on the basis of an overall budget allocation, the level of existing
infrastructure in the kampung, and the relative priority in a given area
among the different items of infrastructure.
v.        The total project would cost an estimated $101 million, includ-
ing contingencies and is comprised of $89.7 million for the Jakarta KIP,
$7.5 million for the Surabaya KIP and $4.1 million for technical assist-
ance. The project costs include $5.5 million for land acquisition. The
direct and indirect foreign exchange costs are estimated at about 27% of
total cost. Cost estimates for KIP in Jakarta are based on detailed surveys
and preliminary engineering designs for the first year of the program, and
on bids from the first project. Cost estimates for the Surabaya KIP are
based on preliminary designs of the first year of the program.
vi.       The physical infrastructure works of the Jakarta KIP will continue
to be designed and executed by the KIP Project Unit in the DKI. A similar
project unit will be set up by the Municipal Government of Surabaya for the
execution of the works in Surabaya. The health training programs will be the
responsibility of the respective City Health Offices. Technical assistance
in project design, supervision, monitoring and evaluation will be provided
through Cipta Karya (the Directorate General of Housing, Building and Plan-
ning), which is responsible for developing the overall national policy for
kampung improvement.
vii.      Contracts for civil works will be awarded after local competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Foreign con-
tractors are not likely to be interested in bidding on KIP works because of
the difficulty of working in densely inhabited kampungs, the labor-intensive
nature of the works and the large number of small contracts of short duration.
Furniture and equipment for schools and clinics will be procured by local com-
petitive bidding. Contracts acceptable to the Bank for certain civil works
and consultants' services amounting to a total of US$20 million are expected
to be placed prior to Loan signing, and retroactive financing is estimated
to amount to about $3.5 million.
viii.     The project would result in improved living conditions for over
20% of Jakarta's current population, or about 1.2 million people, and about
9.5% of Surabaya's population or about 200,000 people. It would provide
better health standards for kampung residents in Jakarta and Surabaya by
investments in sanitation and community health services. The economic rate



- iii -
of return for the Jakarta component is estimated at 54% and for the Surabaya
component at over 100%.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of $52.5 million for a term
of 20 years including a grace period of four and one half years.

INDONESIA
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is seeking a second Bank loan
for urban development to help finance a project consisting of a three-year
Kampung Improvement Program 1/ (KIP) in Jakarta, a similar but much smaller
program of kampung improvement in the city of Surabaya, and technical assist-
ance. The project was prepared by the Government with assistance from Bank
missions.
1.02      The Jakarta component of the proposed project follows the Jakarta
Urban Development Project in Indonesia (Loan 1040-IND) under which two years
(FY1974-75 and FY1975-76) of an on-going Kampung Improvement Program in that
city were financed. Under the first project, the area of land improved
annually through the program was approximately doubled from previous years to
1,000 ha per year. The proposed project maintains this rate of improvement.
The Surabaya component will be the first KIP project outside the Jakarta area,
and is expected to form the basis of a National KIP program being established
by the Government.
Experience Under the First Urban Project
1.03      The Jakarta Urban Development Project was the first slum upgrading
project financed by the Bank and it has served as the model for developing the
other slum upgrading projects which have been presented to the Executive Direc-
tors to date. Apart from being the first such project, the distinguishing
feature of the Jakarta KIP program remains its scale. With a level of effort
that now provides improvements to 1,000 ha per year benefiting approximately
450,000 persons annually, Jakarta is the first major city which, with Bank
assistance, has been able to mount a long term program at a level sufficient
to catch up with need within a reasonable period of time.
1.04      The first project laid out a strategy for dealing with the shelter
needs of the urban poor that involved not only KIP, but also sites and ser-
vices development on vacant land to reduce the pressure for squatting. It
also provided support for the newly established National Urban Development
Corporation (NUDC) and the National Mortgage Bank (NMB).
1.05      Execution of the KIP component of the first project has been very
satisfactory in all respects except for difficulties in land acquisition (a
function under the responsibility of the five sub-mayors in Jakarta) which
1/   Kampung in this context refers to a low income urban community.



has delayed construction of school-; a.Lid clinics. Except for the schools and
clinics of which roughly half were comDleted by January 1976, the KIP works
were completed on time and witn a cOSL a          of 5 percent which has been
re-allocated to expand the number of hectares upgraded.  The remaining schools
and clinics are expected to be comple-ed by Ap:m-.      7
1.06      The sites and services component of the first project was a new
activity for the Government, handled by the newly created National Urban
Development Corporation. This component is approximately a year behind
schedule due to delay in hiring suitable staff and completing detailed
engineering designs. These difficulties now appear to be resolved.
1.07      This report is based on the findings of the appraisal mission con-
sisting of Messrs. A. Stone, A. Pellegrini, I. Sud, S. Basta and N. Hanna
(Bank) and R. Ramani and I. Ifekwunigwe (Consultants) which visted Indonesia
in January/February 1976. Assistance in the economic evaluation was provided
by Mrs. Suzanne Henneman (Urban Assistant).
II. BACKGROUND
A. National Urbanization Trends
2.01      With a population of approximately 135 million (1976), Indonesia
is the fifth most populous country in the world. In terms of land area it
is thirteenth.  Nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's population, however, is
concentrated in the islands of Java, Madura and Bali which represent 7% of
the land area. In these areas, where natural conditions are favorable for
agriculture, population density has reached a level higher than in Bangladesh,
the Mekong Delta or the Central Plain of Thailand. Table 1 in Annex 1 shows
the population distribution by region and province and the average annual
growth rate between the 1961 and the 1971 census. Where density is highest
(7,944 persons/sq km in Jakarta), population annual growth rate is also
highest (4.6% between 1961 and 1971) or more than twice the national average
for those years.
2.02      According to the 1971 census, about 18% of the population resided
in urban areas, i.e., cities with population of more than 5,000 inhabitants.
Jakarta alone accounted for more than 22% of the total urban population; and
the island of Java for 67% of total urban population and 64% of rural popu-
lation. The high density in rural areas of Java has created intense pressures
on available agricultural land and consequently pushed landless farmers and
unskilled labor into the major urban centers faster than the latter have been
capable of absorbing them efficiently. While the population of Indonesia
increased by 22% between the census of 1961 and that of 1971, urban population
increased by 44%. Urban growth in the same period, however, has been most
rapid in the large cities, notably Jakarta (57%) and Surabaya (49%).



2.03      The main characteristics of the Indonesian employment situation
can be derived from available survey data, although no great precision should
be ascribed to the estimates. The overall unemployment rates for the agri-
cultural labor force for the country as a whole indicated that unemployment
was 4.4% in the busy season and 8.8% in the slack period. An Urban Unemploy-
ment Survey of 1972 reported rates of 7.5 to 12% unemployment in the three
major cities of Java. These data do not reveal the widespread extent of
underemployment and marginally productive employment.
2.04      Some idea of the extent of poverty can be obtained by comparing
average per capita expenditure with the cost of a minimum nutritional in-
take (minimum consumption for an adequate diet as recommended by FAO/WHO).
Roughly 55% of the urban population of Indonesia or about 14 million people
have been estimated to be living below this standard. (In Java over 60% of
the urban population fall below this line.)
2.05      Little is known about access to urban services in cities other
than Jakarta. It is estimated, however, that of the total urban population,
about 31% have access to piped water.
2.06      The urban population served by sewerage systems is very small.
Bandung is the only city in the country with a water borne sewerage system.
Human wastes are mainly discharged into septic tanks, latrines, surface
drainage, ditches, or directly into streams and rivers, and constitute a
health hazard especially for water supplies.
2.07      Cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and parasite diseases transmitted
by water are endemic to Indonesia. Many cases of paratyphoid and infectious
hepatitis are reported from Java and Sumatera. In 1974, Indonesia had the
highest number of both reported cases and deaths from cholera in the world.
In addition, infant mortality and malnutrition especially in the semi-urban
areas, is extremely high. The national figure for infant mortality is around
126 deaths per 1,000 live births, but in some of the slums of Jakarta and
Surabaya this rises to nearly 200 deaths per 1,000, and around half of all
children between the ages of 0 to 5 years show signs of growth stunting and
malnutrition.  Population per physician is about 27,000 (1971) compared to
4,800 for India and 2,700 for the Philippines.  In education, the national
average school enrollment rate is about 55% for the primary school age group
and 11% for the secondary school age group.  The adult literacy rate (for
those 10 years of age and over) is about 79% for urban and 55 for rural areas.
B. Urbanization Trends in Jakarta
Historical Background
2.08      Jakarta is the largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Situated
on somewhat marshy land along the northwestern coast of Java, it functions
as the commercial and administrative hub of the Indonesian archipelago, its



- 4 -
role since settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1619. With a
present population of close to 6 mil-lior and annual average per capita GDP
of about $160 (1971), the city is one o° the largest and poorest in the world.
Physically the city spreads over 560 km (Map 10709R2). The urbanized
area of Jakarta was approximately 12,000 ha in 1969 and is estimated to
be about 17,000 ha at present. Since 1964 it has been administered as a
special district with the status of a province. This status gives it an
advantage over other municipalities in its taxing powers and in greater
accessibility to financial and technical resources of the Central Government.
2.09      Jakarta is cut into sections by five roughly parallel rivers which
are subject to frequent flooding. During Dutch rule, a system of canals was
constructed to reduce the problems of flooding and epidemics. An extensive
system of urban railways was also developed. By 1920, inter-city rail lines
connected Jakarta with Tangerang in the West, Serpong and the Sunda straits
in the southwest, Bogor and Bandung in the south, and Bekasi and Cirebon in
the East. These rail lines and the roads paralleling them have been major
axes for urban development.
Population and Employment
2.10      The first great influx of rural migrants into Jakarta occurred
during the transition from Dutch rule between 1949-50, when the population
of the city increased by 70% from 0.82 million to 1.43 million during the two
year period. In 1971, the national census recorded the population as 4.58
million, an increase of 57.8% over a decade. Based on census figures, the
rate of growth for Jakarta was 4.6% per annum between 1961 and 1971, 2.1%
due to natural increase and 2.5% due to migration. The Jakarta City Govern-
ment (DKI) has estimated that the present rate of population growth is even
higher, 5.7% per year. Both figures are significantly higher than the esti-
mate of 4.0% per year that was used in preparing the current city Master
Plan. While the DKI estimate of 5.7% seems high, it tends to confirm the
indication that the rate of growth is at least the same as between 1961 and
1971 despite the adoption of a "closed city" policy 1/ in 1971 to discourage
further migration.
2.11      The economic attractiveness of migrating to Jakarta in search of
employment is evident from the disparity between the average per capita
GDP in the capital city and other provinces: in 1971, it was double that
of other regions, or US$160 compared to US$80. Employment opportunities,
whether real or perceived, coupled with rural population pressures, seem
likely to perpetuate the migration trend toward urban centers. While accel-
eration of the much needed rural development program and the transmigration
program for resettling the rural poor in sparsely populated outer islands
hold some promise, their impact are likely to be marginal and the problems
of urban poverty and growth which already plague Jakarta will remain.
1/ Under this policy new migrants are discouraged from moving to the
city by requiring that they have a job before arrival and that they
deposit with the local head-man sufficient funds to pay for transport
home if they are not employed six months after arrival.



2.12      If current trends continue, by 1986 DKI Jakarta would grow by
3 million persons or by more than 50%. This rate of population increase
calls for a corresponding increase in the number of jobs. In 1971, the rate
of unemployment was estimated at approximately 12% with almost half the total
unemployed below 24 years of age. While specific figures of unemployment
must be used with great caution because of definitional difficulties, the
extent of the employment problem is indicated by reports that almost half of
the population in Jakarta is engaged in informal service sector activities
that include occupations such as becak drivers, hawkers, vendors, and petty
retail traders.
Availability of Urban Services
2.13      The poorest residents of the city generally live in outer kampungs,
away from the surfaced roads and footpaths, along the railway lines of the
inner city, and around the main markets. Many of them are recent migrants
and live in tents and shacks alongside the more permanent homes of earlier
settlers.
2.14      A 1969 survey of Jakarta housing conditions demonstrated the poor
quality of Jakarta's housing: 65% had no private toilet facilities, 80% had
no electricity, and 90% had no piped water connection . Permanent houses
with solid walls, cement floors, and tile roofs constituted 24% of the total
housing stock; temporary houses of bamboo matting walls, earthen floors, and
thatch roofs comprised 44%; and semi-permanent structures having some combi-
nation of temporary and permanent materials accounted for the balance (32%).
2.15      The existing housing and infrastructure is grossly inadequate,
and a massive urban development effort is needed to meet immediate require-
ments and to absorb the large population growth of up to 10 million persons
that may occur in the next two decades. Several sectors require immediate
attention. The water distribution system has deteriorated to the point where
officials contend that an increase in pressure would increase leakage rather
than supply. Some excess capacity is available at the pumping stations but
distribution lines need to be replaced and new lines constructed. More than
50% of the population relies on groundwater wells, which are often contaminated
by fecal material and increasing salinity due to depletion of the fresh water
aquifer. Approximately 30% of the households in Jakarta depend solely on
water vendors for their supply at prices five times greater than the charges
for piped water. Jakarta has no water-borne sewer system. Even houses having
piped water flush sanitary wastes into septic tanks or more frequently into
open ditches along the roadside. Much of the population, however, has no al-
ternative other than to use the drainage canals for bathing, laundering and
defecation. In response to this situation, the Government has initiated a
national "Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study" which is now being com-
pleted under the sponsorship of the WHO/IBRD cooperative program. This study
is developing a list of priority projects in water supply and sanitation
for the next five years. In addition, a UNDP-financed project to develop
an immediate program for sanitation in Jakarta has just been completed which
recommends continued focus on provision of pit latrines and septic tanks
through the Kampung Improvement Program.



- 6 -
2.16      Other badly neglected services include garbage collection and sur-
face water drainage. Most of the city's uncollected garbage (estimated in
a World Health Organization Study as 30% of the daily load) ends up in canals
and rivers and along the roadside where it clogs drainage channels and causes
extensive flooding during the rainy season. Flood waters then sweep the
raw sewage and garbage out of the ditches and canals back into the kampungs.
In the dry season when there is insufficient flow to drain off wastes, they
decay in exposed areas and pose a serious health hazard for the community.
Surface water drainage is inadequate and large sections of the city are
subject to flooding during the wet season.
Kampung Improvement
2.17      During Repelita I, the Government's First Five-Year Development
Plan (1969-74), the Jakarta Provincial Government (DKI) began a program of
upgrading the physical infrastructure in kampungs. This Kampung Improvement
Program (KIP) evolved from the Central Government program (INPRES) that sup-
ports both rural and urban works by distributing funds on a per capita basis
to local government districts for infrastructure improvements. From 1969-74,
DKI upgraded about 2,400 ha or about 20% of its 1969 urbanized area. The
Jakarta Urban Development Project (Loan 1040-IND) was the first urban loan to
Indonesia and assisted with finance for two years of the KIP program--1974-75
and 1975-76. This project increased the standards and scope of the program
and covered 1,980 ha benefiting approximately 890,000 people at a cost of
about $40 per capita or approximately $215 per family. The impact of the KIP
on Jakarta is clearly shown by the following figures:
Urbanized area (1969)             -  12,000 hectares
Area in kampungs (1969)           -   7,200    "         (60%)

C. Urbanization Trends in Surabaya
2.18      Surabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia and the major
port for East Java, Madura and South Kalimantan. During the Dutch period
its port of Tanjung Perak was the foremost port in Indonesia. However, fol-
lowing independence this position has been taken by Tanjung Priok, Jakarta.
2.19      In recent years Surabaya has regained some of its past status as a
port and commercial city and as a consequence its population has grown from
a little over 1,000,000 in 1961 to approximately 1.7 million permanent, and
over 400,000 temporary, residents in 1975. This is a rate of growth of ap-
proximately 4.5% per year. Many of the migrants have clustered in the center
of the city exacerbating the pressure on the already over-strained system of
municipal services, especially water supply.



- 7 -
2.20      Surabaya's population of approximately 2.1 million is concentrated
in the eleven old kecamatans (sub-districts) that formed the city before an ex-
pansion of its boundaries in 1965. This expansion involved the annexation of
five rural kecamatans that effectively tripled the area of the city. The old
area holds 85% of the population although it comprises only 23% of the area
of the present city. Only nine kelurahans (locality) have a population den-
sity of over 400 persons per hectare and six more have densities of over 300
persons per hectare. However, in individual kampungs within the central area,
which serve as the receiving ground for temporary migrants especially from
East Java and Madura, the density is much greater, up to 1,000 persons per
hectare.
2.21      Unlike most other large cities in Indonesia, Surabaya has a strong
industrial base. This is reflected in the increase in its Gross Domestic
Product from Rp 57.6 billion ($0.14 billion) in 1969 to Rp 104.4 billion
($0.25 billion) in 1974. Also during that period household median monthly
income increased from approximately Rp 6,000 per month ($176/year) to about
Rp 17,000 ($498/year).
Availability of Urban Services
2.22      The physical infrastructure of the city is inadequate for its
rapidly expanding population. The piped water system presently serves only
approximately 22% of the population. In the new kecamatans piped water is
rarely available. Approximately 45% of the population is supplied by water
carriers with 33% served by private shallow wells. As in Jakarta, Surabaya
has no municipal sewerage system and only perhaps 50% of the population is
served by public or private septic tanks (though they are legally required)
and almost all of the remainder use rivers or fishponds. Flooding is a major
problem in many parts of the old city especially adjacent to the port and the
Kali Mas river. Electricity is now provided to approximately 50% of the
population.
2.23      At the moment several programs for expansion of municipal services
are underway. A water supply study will be completed in 1976. In addition
the city will increase its present water supply capacity by almost 100% to
10,300 ltr/second by 1981. The Karankates electricity project is scheduled
for completion in 1976 and would increase the city's generating capacity
from 50 MW to 75 MW, although most of this new power would go to an indus-
trial estate situated at Rungkhut to the south of the city.
2.24      The large population and lack of basic sanitary services has meant
continuing health problems despite a very efficient system of vaccinations
for common diseases. Leading causes of death are pneumonia, infancy diseases,
malnutrition in children, bronchitis, rheumatic fever and gastrointestinal
epidemics. The infant mortality rate remains high (130 per 1,000 live births)
and about half of all children in kampungs suffer varying symptoms of mal-
nutrition. A program of school health care is only able to cover 25% of
the schools, mostly due to a lack of personnel, especially school nurses.
Puskesmas (health clinics) are now in every kecamatan, except one, but these



-8
serve a much larger area in Surabaya than in middle-sized cities of Indonesia
or from 100,000 to 200,000 persons on the average compared to 20,000 to 50,000
persons in other cities. The national standard is one health center for 30,000
to 50,000 persons. Mobile health teams are being used and health education,
nutrition, and family planning programs pursued. However, lack of manpower
and funds have meant that such programs have had only a limited success.
2.25      The education level in Surabaya appears to be lower than that of
the other medium-sized cities in Indonesia, a partial consequence of its large
migrant population. Only 73% of the adult population is literate and only
45% of the population has completed primary school.
Kampung Improvement Program
2.26      Surabaya already has an embryonic program for kampung improvement
in the W.R. Supratman Program.  To date, however, this program has been
limited in scope mostly to isolated road or drainage projects within kampungs.
In 1974-75 a total of Rp 166 million ($0.4 million) 1/ was expended under the
program of which 48% was contributed by people in the community. The commun-
ity share is generally one-sixth in manpower, one third in materials, and one
half in money. Other works in kampungs have been financed out cf INPRES
Kotamadya funds, which are allocated to cities (Kotamadya's) cn a per capita
basis, and special central Government (INPRES) programs for Education and
Health.
D. Institutional Development
2.27      The major urban intiative of the Second Five-Year Development
Plan (1974-79) is the formation of the National Urban Development Corporation
(NUDC) established under the first urban project.  The NUDC will buy urban
land throughout the country to develop and resell for specific residential,
commercial, or industrial uses. Establishing a government corporation to
undertake such projects offers the advantage of combining government seed
capital and authorization to borrow from both public and private sources to
develop facilities neglected by the private construction sector. Initially,
the GOI has capitalized NUDC with about $2.5 million.  This amount will
be augmented annually according to requirements of the work program to be
prepared in consultation with technical advisers provided under the proposed
project. It is expected that most of the government funds allocated for
housing development during Repelita II (about $60 million) will be chan-
neled through NUDC. The NUDC is still very much in the formative stages of
development and is in the process of finalizing its five year development
plan with the assistance of consultants financed by the Bank.  While not yet
fully staffed, it has acquired a core of highly qualified senior staff.
Other consultants financed under the first urban loan are preparing
1/   The total includes funds budgeted under both the "W.R. Supratman" and
"Village People Development" programs which are distinct but similar
programs of kampung improvement in Surabaya.



- 9 -
feasibility studies for urban projects in eight secondary cities of Indonesia
which should form the major share of the NUDC development program during the
remainder of Repelita II. These feasibility studies involve comprehensive
kampung improvement and sites and services projects.
2.28      The preparation of the kampung improvement program in Surabaya,
which as the first major kampung improvement program outside Jakarta is ex-
pected to set the stage for a national program, stimulated considerable dis-
cussion and analysis within the Government of the appropriate institutional
responsibilities for KIP (para 5.02). As a result, Cipta Karya (The Direc-
torate General of Housing, Building, Planning and Urban Development) within
the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power has now been given respon-
sibility for developing a national KIP program. This directorate has long
been responsible for assisting cities in preparing physical development plans,
and preparing sector plans for water and sanitation, and has also been acting
as secretariat to the Ministerial level National Housing Authority. Cipta
Karya is also responsible for overall planning and technical coordination
of plans produced by individual cities of the Jabotabek (Jakarta, Bogor,
Tangerang, and Bekasi) metropolitan area. In this capacity Cipta Karya is
assessing alternative physical development plans and infrastructure invest-
ments in the metropolitan area which covers the provinces of DKI Jakarta and
West Java.
2.29      A National Mortage Bank (NMB) was established in 1975 through the
first urban project by restructuring the existing Bank Tebungan Negara as
a mortgage institution. Up to the present, Indonesia has had no mortgage
system, and long term loans have not been available for housing development.
Consequently, the housing construction industry has lacked the financial
resources necessary for growth. The GOI has initially committed about
$7.5 million as equity capital for the NMB, and sources of long term
finance are being investigated. Technical assistance to the mortgage bank
was provided under Loan 1040-IND.
2.30      The NMB has begun the process of staff reorganization necessary
to permit it to function as a mortage bank. The areas of most immediate
concern are (i) developing a realistic package of long term finance, and
(ii) establishing secure mortgage instruments. It is as yet too early to
judge the impact that the NMB will have on housing finance in Indonesia.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed loan would continue Bank support provided under the
Urban Development Project (Loan 1040-IND) to directly improve the well
being of the low-income urban population in Indonesia by improvements in



- 10 -
their physical environment. Based on the experience gained in implementation
of the first urban project, this loan would provide financial and technical
support for the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) in Jakarta for another three
years including an increased emphasis on elements improving sanitation and a
broadening of the coverage of the program to include a pilot health program.
The project would also provide support for a new comprehensive program of
kampung improvements in Surabaya aimed at the poorest kampungs, while also
supporting the present Supratman program. The project would benefit directly
about 1.2 million low-income residents in Jakarta and about 200,000 low-income
residents in Surabaya. Technical assistance provided under the project would
support project design and execution in both Jakarta and Surabaya; kampung
eligibility studies, improvements in the property tax system and metropolitan
planning in Jakarta; strengthening of NUDC's management; preparation of urban
development projects for medium size cities; and monitoring and evaluation.
3.02      The project would support the Government's efforts to deal with the
minimum infrastructure needs of large numbers of urban poor at a reasonable
cost. The KIP represents the lowest level of investment in this direction as
it upgrades services to the existing housing stock in low-income areas and
leaves the residents themselves to upgrade their dwellings as improvements are
made in their environment. The urban strategy adopted by the Government also
involves a parallel effort in sites and services and low-income housing. These
latter programs however, are relatively new efforts for which project prepara-
tion has only recently begun.  The institutional arrangements under this pro-
ject in which the National Government will promote the first comprehensive KIP
program in a city outside Jakarta, will serve as a model for a national KIP
program.  The projecL will also initiate pilot programs for community based
health services -L the kampungs to promote preventive as well as curative
medicine.
B. Main Components
3.03      To achieve the above objectives, the project comprises:
(a)  Kampung Improvement Program:  Jakarta.  Provision of basic
urban infrastructure including water supply, human waste
disposal, drainage, footpaths, and roads to 3,000 ha of
densely settled neighborhoods to benefit directly about
1.2 million low-income residents. Primary schools and
health clinics will be provided in the neighborhoods and
a pilot program of community health and nutrition will be
undertaken;
(b)  Supratman Program:  Surabaya.  Physical improvements in
the items of infrastructure selected by the kampung re-
sidents as the high priority items and for which the
residents contribute voluntarily in cash or in kind
about 50% of the cost of the works;



- 11 -
(c)  Modified Supratman Program:  Surabaya.  Physical infrastruc-
ture improvements similar to those in Jakarta will be made in
at least 374 ha of densely settled very low-income neighbor-
hoods, which require a more comprehensive program of services
than would be available through the existing Supratman Pro-
gram. This component would also provide benefits to the
lowest income neighborhoods that otherwise might not be able
to participate in the Supratman Program. Primary schools and
health clinics will be provided and a pilot program will be
undertaken to train 100 volunteer community health workers
drawn from the kampungs;
(d) Technical Assistance. Assistance will be provided to Cipta
Karya for project preparation and execution of KIP in Jakarta
and Surabaya, for kampung eligibility studies and for programm-
ing of general infrastructure investments in Jakarta and its
surrounding areas. Funds will also be provided to support the
Government property tax improvement program, to provide management
assistance to NUDC, for monitoring and evaluation of the project
in both Jakarta and Surabaya, and for feasibility studies of
urban development projects in medium size Indonesian cities.
C. Detailed Description
Kampung Improvement Program: Jakarta
3.04      The project will continue to support over the next three years
(1976-79) Jakarta's program for upgrading high density kampungs and pro-
viding the population with basic services. Under the first project, im-
provements have been made over a period of two years (1974-76) on 1,980 ha
covering about 16.5% of the urbanized area of Jakarta. The KIP for the next
three years would upgrade an additional 3,000 ha representing roughly 25% of
the 1969 urbanized area. Map 10728R2 identifies kampungs to be upgraded
in 1976-77. The items to be financed by proceeds of the loan include foot-
paths, secondary roads, surface drainage ditches, water supply systems and
public standpipes, individual toilets, mainly pit privies and some community
toilets, garbage collection facilities and trucks, elementary schools, and
community health facilities. Residents of each kampung participate in the
planning process through local representatives and help in determining
priority improvements to be made within a framework of established design
objectives.
3.05      Functional standards for the different items of infrastructure and
the procedures for allocating budgeted funds to the different items have been
defined in agreement with the project authorities (Annex 2). The level of
service for these items is not fixed rigidly for each kampung but is derived
from the functional standards and the allocation procedure. This more flexible
approach will lead to a closer match between the specific needs of each kampung
and the facilities provided. It is based on the favorable experience of the
first project in which the KIP unit demonstrated its ability to handle more



- 12 -
sophisticated design procedures. Assurances were obtained from the Government
during negotiations that the functional standards and the allocation procedure
will not be changed without prior approval of the Bank.
3.06      Experience since 1974 has suggested several desirable modifications
in service level that have been incorporated into the functional standards.
Among these modifications are:
(a)  the use of individual pit privies where feasible in place
of communal facilities, because of difficulties in acquiring
land, and lack of public acceptance of communal facilities
(Annex 3);
(b)  different standards for the sensity of public water taps in
the different parts of Jakarta depending upon the existing
conditions (Annex 2);
(c)  increased provision of footpaths and a corresponding reduction
in vehicular roads to provide sanitary access to a larger number
of houses without increasing costs and to maintain service
levels in keeping with the low incomes of families in
kampungs (Annex 2).
3.07      Design work for the 1,000 ha in the first year program has already
been completed.  Based on these the following estimates have been made of
the various components of the KIP in Jakarta for the entire three-year
program:
(a)  About 575 km of footpaths;
(b)  About 120 km of paved roads;
(c)  An estimated 75 km primary drainage canal;
(d)  Extension of the water supply distribution system and
provision of public standpipes to supply about 60
1/capita/day;
(e)  Materials for individual or small commtnal pit privies to be
constructed by the residents themselves under the general
direction of trained technicians;
(f)  Concrete garbage bins, hand carts and 9 garbage trucks
for collection and disposal of solid waste;
(g)  Construction of 90 primary schools in the kampungs to raise
the school enrollment to the same level as the rest of
Jakarta, and provision of equipment for the schools;
(h)  Construction of 45 health clinics (Puskesmas) in kampungs
not presently served by district clinics, 30 health offices
(Pos Keshatans) for the use of community health workers



- 13 -
in the pilot health/nutrition program, and provision of
the necessary medical and office equipment.
3.08      In addition to the infrastructure improvements in the kampungs
and the provision of schools and clinics, the project would include a
pilot program of community health services. Community health workers would
be trained in such services as maternal and child health, communicable
disease control, nutrition, (child weighing, vitamin A megadose prophylaxis
and nutrition education), some vaccinations, family planning, environmental
health, minor curative services and referrals. After training, the health
workers would be assigned to a few selected kampungs and their performance
and impact on the community would be monitored over 2-3 years. Depending
on the results of the evaluation, the health program could be modified and/or
expanded in its coverage. Details of the health program are given in Annex 4.
Total cost of the KIP program in Jakarta amounts to $59 per capita (1976
prices) or $312 per family.
Kampung Improvement Program: Surabaya
3.09      In Surabaya, the project would support a two-pronged approach to
kampung improvement. It would support an increase in the present Supratman
Program under which the Municipal Government matches the contributions in
cash or kind of the kampung residents for improvements of particular items of
infrastructure scattered throughout the city. The project would increase the
Government's support of the program from the present planned level of $750,000
over the three year project period to $1.25 million, making the total Supratman
Program $2.5 million over three years. In addition, the project would also
support the start of a Modified Supratman Program, which would be a comprehen-
sive program of kampung improvement along the lines of the Jakarta KIP. This
program would cover the lowest income kampungs which the Government feels may
not otherwise be able to participate in the Supratman Program, and also would
include upgrading to minimum standards of the basic items of infrastructure.
3.10      The project involves upgrading infrastructure and basic amenities in
at least 374 ha of densely populated kampungs (which cover about 5% of urban-
ized area) and would directly benefit about 9.5% of the total population of
the city. Map 12209 shows substandard areas and identifies kampungs to be
upgraded in the first year. As in the Jakarta KIP, the program in Surabaya
will provide paved footpaths, vehicular roads, water supply, human waste dis-
posal, drainage and solid waste disposal facilities. In addition, the project
would provide 15 primary schools, 5 health clinics (Puskesmas), 3 health
offices (Pos Kesehatans) and the necessary equipment for these facilities.
The Pos Kesehatans will be used by the community health workers to be trained
as a part of the project (para 3.09).
3.11      Functional design standards for the different infrastructure items
which the program will aim to achieve have been defined (Annex 2). Because
the Surabaya program is only starting, these have been set initially at
approximately the same level as the average for the Jakarta KIP. As expe-
rience is gained and the design process in Surbaya is improved, the standards



- 14 -
will be made more flexible in line with the priority needs of individual
kampungs. The detailed designs for the Surabaya kampungs in the first-year
program have not yet been completed and therefore, a breakdown of the proj-
ect components is not available. However, overall levels of investment per
dwelling have been specified as in the case of Jakarta. Expenditures in
Surabaya would be lower because of the greater existing infrastructure in
kampungs in Surabaya and because of somewhat lower unit costs of civil
works.
3.12      In addition to the infrastructure improvements, the project in
Surabaya includes a pilot program of training 100 volunteer community health
workers to be drawn from the kampungs. These community workers will pro-
vide the residents with basic health, hygiene, family planning and nutri-
tion education, and will provide referrals for immunization, vaccination
and malnutrition to the health clinics. The health program would establish
a core of community workers through which further programs can be developed.
Details of the training program are given in Annex 4. Total costs of the
KIP program in Surabaya amount to approximately $29 per capita or $150 per
family.
Technical Assistance
3.13      The project provides the following technical assistance:
(a) consultants' services for Cipta Karya for (i) assistance
to the KIP project units in Jakarta and Surabaya in the
design of the works; (ii) supervision of project imple-
mentation; (iii) training of the project units in en-
gineering and accounting; and (iv) evaluation of the
kampungs to be included in the program;
(b) consultantsw services from local institutions for pro-
ject monitoring and evaluation;
(c)  two advisers, for a period of two years, to assist
Cipta Karya in its responsibilities for overall plan-
ning in the Jabotabek area, to evaluate alternative
economic and physical growth strategies for the Jakarta
metropolitan area and to assist in investment planning
for the region;
(d) one expert in municipal taxation for a period of one
year to assist in developing procedures for implementing
improvements to the IPEDA tax; one expert in property
valuation to assist in valuing property in Jakarta and
in training valuers; and training in surveying and
valuation;
(e) six man years of management advisory services to the
National Urban Development Corporation (NUDC) to assist
in planning its nationwide sites and services and low



- 15 -
cost housing program, and to provide expertise in finan-
cial planning, engineering management and urban architec-
tural/planning to assist in supervision of project fea-
sibility studies and project implementation; and
(f) consultants' services for conducting feasibility
studies of urban development projects in medium-
size Indonesian cities.
3.14      In order to assist project design work in Surabaya pending approval
of the Bank loan, Cipta Karya has retained the services of engineering and
accounting consultants for a period of 4 months. Retroactive financing is
recommended for these services.
3.15      During negotiations assurances were obtained that the consultants
to be employed would be acceptable to the Bank and would be retained on terms
and conditions satisfactory to it. Terms of reference for the two advisers on
regional planning and the experts in municipal taxation and property valuation
were discussed upon during negotiations. Annex 5 contains details of technical
assistance to be provided under the project.

4.02      Cost estimates for the Kampung Improvement Program in Jakarta are
based on preliminary engineering designs for the 1976-77 program, using
January 1976 price levels. Cost estimates for the Kampung Improvement Program
in Surabaya are based on the experience from Jakarta, although it is possible
that costs in Surabaya would be lower in which case any cost savings would be
applied to expanding the coverage. Price escalation assumed for civil works
is based on an estimated inflation rate of 20% in 1976, 15% in 1977 and 1978
and 12% in 1979. No physical contingencies have been included because the
design of the works is controlled by an overall per dwelling budget limitation.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that any cost overruns for KIP
construction would be borne by the concerned local government. Any savings
realized will be used to expand coverage of the program.
B. Financing
4.03      Of total estimated project costs, about 50% would be financed
with proceeds from the proposed Bank loan of $52.5 million to cover the
foreign exchange component of $28.0 million and some 32% of local currency
costs. The balance, $52.3 million (Rp 21.4 billion) would be financed by:
DKI Rp 18.6 billion ($45.3 million); Kotamadya Surabaya Rp 1.9 billion ($4.7
million); community contributions Rp 0.5 billion ($1.2 million); and GOI Rp
0.5 billion ($1.1 million). The contributions of the DKI and the Kotamadya
Surabaya would flow from their normal budgetary resources; the GOI contribu-
tion would be for technical assistance provided for the project to Cipta Karya
and NUDC. The financing plan is summarized in the table below.

4.04      The Borrower, GOI, will pass all the proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan, except for the technical assistance expenditures, through subsidiary
loan agreements acceptable to the Bank to DKI and Kotamadya Surabaya for
their respective KIP works. The completion of such agreements is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan. The financial arrangements will be as
follows:
(a) DKI. Of the proposed Bank loan of $52.5 million equivalent,
about $44.2 million will be relent to DKI to finance 51.5% of
the civil works construction, and 100% of the CIF cost of
imported or 95% of ex-factory costs of locally procured
furniture and equipment for schools and clinics. The sub-
sidiary loan will bear an interest rate one-fourth of one
percent greater than the interest rate of the Bank loan to
the Government to cover the commitment fee, repayable over
20 years, including a four and one-half years period of
grace for principal and interest. The balance of the funds
required for the KIP ($45.3 million) and the Health Program
($0.4 million) will be provided from DKI's budgetary resources;



- 19 -
(b)  Kotamadya Surabaya.  Of the proposed Bank loan, about US$4.0
million will be relent to Kotamadya Surabaya to finance 43% of
the civil works construction, and 100% of the CIF costs of
imported or 95% of exfactory cost of locally procured furni-
ture and equipment for schools and clinics. The subsidiary
loan will bear an interest rate one-fourth of one percent
greater than the interest rate of the Bank loan to the
Government, repayable over 20 years, including a four and
one half year period of grace for principal and interest.
The balance of the funds required for the KIP ($4.7 million)
and the Health Program ($0.03 million) will be provided from
the Kotamadya's budgetary resources;
(c) Technical Assistance. The proposed loan would provide $3.3
million of the total $5.4 million for technical assistance to
cover 100% of the foreign exchange component and 75% of local
expenditures. These funds would be provided under (i) a
budgetary transfer from the Central Government to Cipta Karya
($4.3 million) and to the national urban property tax (IPEDA)
office ($0.4 million); and (ii) in the form of equity from
the Central Government to NUDC ($0.7 million). The average
man-month cost of technical assistance is estimated to be
approximately $5,800.
Impact on Government
4.05      The DKI and Surabaya Government will face the financial burden of
repaying GOI over a 17-year period an amount equivalent to the on-lent
proceeds of the proposed Loan. In addition, the DKI must repay that portion
of the previous urban loan which financed KIP works in Jakarta. This burden
is substantial because the KIP program generates no direct cash return. The
GOI has considered the possibility of imposing a betterment tax on residents
of the improved kampungs. However, since no such tax is currently levied in
higher income neighborhoods where urban services are provided routinely, the
Government has taken the view that to institute a special tax on KIP benefi-
ciaries would be inequitable.
4.06      The argument for cost recovery from low-income beneficiaries
through such a betterment tax or other means, rests on the desire to
assure efficiency in the use of capital resources i.e., not provide an
incentive to overutilize capital, and also on the need to provide suffi-
cient financial resources to mount a program at a scale sufficient to meet
expanding demand. (On equity grounds, redistribution of income through pro-
vision of minimum services to the poor is easily justified). The concern
with efficient use of capital has been addressed by the Government through
an explicit focus on the standards employed with an aim to keeping these
at a minimum level consistent with achieving the health and productivity
objectives of the project. The ability of the Government to sustain the
program at the desired scale of operation is not in question since the



- 20 -
Jakarta KIP program is the unique example that can be pointed to as having
achieved this goal. It must also be noted that cost recovery from bene-
ficiaries would require a massive effort in cadastral survey and in clarifi-
cation and registration of ownership arrangements for each of the approxi-
mately 75,000 families benefiting annually from the program. Such an effort
is beyond the current administrative capacity of the DKI although it would be
clearly desirable. Finally, collection would have to be spread over time, and
in many instances the cost of collection would exceed the revenues generated.
4.07      One effect of the project is to increase property values.  Past
experience shows that improvements to community infrastructure also en-
courage families to invest in upgrading their own houses thereby further
increasing the value of their property. This would ultimately be reflected
in higher property tax revenues. Thus one answer to the question of how to
generate revenues for repayment appears to be to increase general property tax
revenues. In Jakarta, property tax revenues amount to only approximately 4%
of total city revenues. In Surabaya, property tax revenues have averaged
between 6-10% of total revenues.  Most other cities of the world outside of
Indonesia draw much more heavily of this source, with typical percentages
lying between one fifth and one half of total revenue.
4.08      The Government recognizes that property taxes represent an import-
ant source of revenue and has instituted a program to improve the property
tax (IPEDA) system. A property tax study financed under an IDA technical
assistance credit provided specific recommendations for structural reform
of the IPEDA tax system that involved converting from the existing index
system to a market value system.  The Government generally accepted the re-
commendations of that study, but felt that it would have to proceed at its
own pace with implementation. Since that time the Government has made several
incremental adjustments to the index system which move it in the direction
of having the index values correspond with market values. These include,
periodically reclassifying areas into different "value" zones as physical
conditions in the areas change; making periodic adjustments to the coeffi-
cients used to determine the level of tax; updating the land value map to
provide reference information on property values in different parts of the
city and increasing the collection rate from about 50% in 1970 to 73% in 1975.
4.09      As a result of the Government's efforts to improve the property
tax system, between 1970 and 1975 revenues from the IPEDA tax in both Jakarta
and Surabaya have increased at an average rate of about 50% per year, or over
15% per year in real terms, i.e., after allowing for inflation and population
increases. Because of the importance of maintaining real growth in property
tax revenues, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government
will continue to make improvements in their property tax collections, and would
attempt to maintain the 15% real annual increase in property tax collections
achieved in the past five years. This represents a realistic tax performance
and will also be sufficient for the increase in revenue during the period to
more than cover debt service for KIP loans in both cities (Annex 7). Technical
Assistance provided under the project will assist the Government in implemen-
ting improvements to the TPEDA assessment system and provide training in
surveys and property valuation for IPEDA staff.



- 21 -
4.10      In Surabaya, the traditions of finance associated with KIP works
have developed somewhat differently from those in Jakarta. Under the existing
Project Supratman Program in Surabaya, residents of kampungs provide 50% of
project costs in labor, materials or money. Available budget data indicates
that contributions amounting to approximately 30% of total costs have in fact
been received from residents. As in Jakarta, maintenance of canals and infra-
structure is accomplished through community self-help labor under the direction
of the local headman (Lurah) and consumption charges for water received from
communal taps are paid to an operator stationed at the tap. These existing
procedures for collecting funds from kampung residents in Surabaya will be
continued under the Supratman Program. The Government will monitor the expe-
rience from this approach and compare it with the fully government supported
Modified Supratman Program. It is expected that the experience from Surabaya
will serve as a model for establishing cost recovery procedures in other
Indonesian cities.
C. Project Execution
Kampung Selection: Jakarta
4.11      In 1969 the DKI Government conducted a survey of all kampungs in
Jakarta and developed a master list of kampungs that would be upgraded under
the Kampung Improvement Program through 1979 when the program was to have
come to an end. Between 1969 and 1979, however, population in Jakarta will
have increased by over 2.3 million persons. Assuming that 70% of this incre-
ment occurs in kampung areas, a minimum of 4,000 ha of new kampung area will
have been formed during that period. Also, by 1980, the annual growth in new
kampung formation will be approximately 700 ha per year. The 1969 master
list, therefore is quite out of date.
4.12      The high rate of growth in new kampung area since 1972, argues
strongly for a reconsideration of the list of eligible kampungs. Furthermore,
some kampungs upgraded prior to 1974, which includes many of the poorest and
highest density areas of the city, were upgraded to significantly lower stand-
ards in comparison with the program as it now operates. These kampungs should
be considered for re-upgrading on a case-by-case basis.
4.13      Agreement was reached during negotiations, that:
(a) only kampungs with a density of not less than about 50
dwelling units per ha (270 persons) will be eligible for
Bank financing; and
(b) the list of eligible kampungs will be expanded to include
kampungs upgraded prior to 1974-75 that would be eligible
for "re-upgrading"; and would also include other high
density kampungs in the city that for one reason or another
are not considered eligible under the existing list of
kampungs but which would be eligible if the criteria
adopted in 1969 were reapplied.



- 22 -
4.14      Technical assistance (para 3.12) provided under the project will
assist the DKI in developing and implementing revised criteria for deter-
mination of kampung eligibility.
Kampung Selection: Surabaya
4.15      A ranking procedure acceptable to the Bank for selecting kampungs
based on criteria of income, density, extent of existing service and others
has been established in Surabaya.
Construction
4.16      As in the first project, the KIP Unit in DKI would continue to be
responsible for the execution of the project in Jakarta. It would prepare
and let all civil works contracts for the program based on engineering done
by the DKI Public Works Department. A similar project unit would be estab-
lished in Surabaya for project execution, Establishment in Surabaya of such
a project unit satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of disbursement
for the Surabaya component.  The project implementation schedule is set out
in Chart 16135. An estimated $20 million of civil works contracts covering
all KIP works, except schools and health clinics, for the first year of the
program in Jakarta would have been awarded by September 1976. This is
necessary to carry out the construction before the start of the wet season
in January and in order to maintain continuity of works.
Health Program
4.17      Tkh- City Health Office in Jakarta and Surabaya will be responsible
for the imp amentation of their respective health programs. A special train-
ing team cowp-irg a doctor, a public health nurse, a midwife and headed
by a coordJ-la*C- will be established in the Training Division of Jakarta's
City Health Cft ce to assume direct responsibility for training the community
health workers. Supervision of the work of the various health centers will
be undertaken by a team of six full-time supervisors. In Surabaya, the
existing structure of the City Health Office would be able to handle the pilot
health training program included in the project.
Procurement
4.18      All prospective builders for civil works contracts must be re-
gistered with DKI (for Jakarta) or the Kotamadya (for Surabaya) and classi-
fied according to their experience, financial standing and performance on
similar works. The nature and size of the work determines which classifi-
cation of contractors may bid on a particular contract. This form of pre-
qualification is well established in Indonesia and is satisfactory. Pro-
curement for civil works and vehicles will be done on the following basis:
(a) The civil works contracts will be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding following local advertis-
ing in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Pro-
curement. Foreign contractors are not likely to be



- 23 -
interested in bidding on KIP civil works because
of the difficulty of working in densely inhabited
kampungs, the need for close relationships with the
residents and local officials, the labor-intensive
nature of the works and the large number of small
contracts of short duration. The program has been
in existence for six years, and while the foreign
contracting community has been well represented in
Indonesia and nearby Malaysia, no interest in these
works has been expressed;
(b) Furniture and equipment for schools and clinics
($1.4 million) will be procured by competitive bidding
locally advertized.
Promotion of Local Construction Industry
4.19      The project is expected to make a significant contribution to the
development of small and medium size contractors in Jakarta and Surabaya.
The DKI presently has 129 contractors of various classifications and for
different types of works registered for KIP works. Of these, 35 to 40
contractors would generally be awarded works in any one year. The size of
the contracts typically varies from $25,000 to $600,000. The performance
of the contractors has improved as a result of the past two years of KIP
works financed under the first project, as is evident from the upgrading in
the classification of some 20 contractors in this period, and from the com-
petition in bidding which has led to costs below original estimates. It is
clear that the project itself provides an opportunity for small local con-
tractors to develop their capabilities by participating in the program.
Disbursement
4.20      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be made against the following:
(a) 50% of all civil works expenditures against certificates
of expenditures certified by Cipta Karya and the super-
visory consultants;
(b) 100% of CIF expenditures or 95% of ex factory expenditures
for furniture, and equipment for schools and health clinics;
and
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures and 75% of local expenditures
for consultant services.
Documentation for contracts over $300,000, including contract documents,
analysis of bids by consultants and recommendations for award would be sent
to the Bank prior to submission of applications for disbursement. Documenta-
tion for contracts costing less than $300,000 would be retained by the KIP
unit and available for inspection during supervision missions. Supervisory
consultants would review bids and bidding procedures for all procurement.



- 24 -
4.21      The estimated summary schedule of Bank disbursements is shown in
Annex 8 based on a three-year project implementation period. In order to
permit completion of most construction work prior to onset of the rainy
season, the Government requested approval to begin advance contracting for
kampung work scheduled in FY76-77 1/. Approval of retroacting financing
is recommended for works contracted for after the departure of the appraisal
mission from Indonesia and for which payments to contractors are made prior
to loan signing. This retroactive financing is expected to amount to approx-
imately $3.5 million (6.6% of the total proposed loan of $52.5 million). The
value of works contracted in advance would total approximately $20 million.
4.22      Retroactive financing is also recommended for technical assistance
used for project design in Surabaya from April 1, 1976 up to an amount of
$50,000.
Accounts and Auditing
4.23      Separate project accounts would be maintained for the KIP works
by DKI and Kotamadya Surabaya. DKI has already established satisfactory
procedures for this in the first project which would continue to be used. All
project expenditures, including civil works, health, vehicles, and monitoring
and evaluation, would be made from a single KIP account. The project expendi-
tures would be accounted for separately by category as well as by each fiscal
year. Each project account would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The accountant provided in the technical assistance
to Cipta Karya will work with the Surabaya project unit to assist in the es-
tablishment of acceptable project accounting procedures. Assurances were
obtained from the Government during negotiations that the annually audited
records of project accounts in DKI and the Kotamadya would be submitted
to the Bank no later than four months following the close of the fiscal years.
Assurances were also obtained from the Government during negotiations that
quarterly progress reports will be prepared by the supervising consultants
and submitted to the Bank reporting on, inter alia, the physical, contractual
and financial progress of the project.
Operations and Maintenance
4.24      Maintenance of project infrastructure and vehicles would be the
responsibility of DKI and the Kotamadya. Community residents organized by
local leaders (RWs) would maintain any communal kampung sanitary facilities
and drains. It would be the responsibility of the Lurah (sub-district chief)
to see that garbage is collected and deposited in the neighborhood collection
bins for removal by the Sanitation Department.
1/   The Indonesia fiscal year begins April 1.



- 25 -
D. Supervision
4.25      Supervision of the project on the part of the government will be
the responsibility of Cipta Karya. Consultants will be appointed to advise
and assist Cipta Karya in this task. Supervision by Bank staff will require
approximately 15 man-weeks of field effort per year for three years. For
every man-week in the field approximately two man-weeks of office work in
Washington would be required.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Organization
5.01      The overall responsibility for project implementation, coordination,
and administration will rest with Cipta Karya in the Ministry of Public Works.
Within each city the KIP will be planned and executed by a special unit in
the municipal administration.
5.02      The responsibility for the development and coordination of the
national KIP program in Indonesia was originally to have been NUDC's. NUDC
would have exercised this responsibility in addition to its role in developing
sites and services and conventional low and moderate income housing. Based on
the experience gained in the first year of operation of the NUDC, the Govern-
ment has decided that kampung improvement would be more appropriately adminis-
tered by Cipta Karya in the Ministry of Public Works. The purpose of this
shift in operational responsibility is to consolidate within NUDC those shel-
ter functions which most readily lend themselves to solution under a corporate
institutional structure, and to shift to Cipta Karya those functions which the
Government views as being more appropriately handled by a government agency.
Cost recovery in sites and services and conventional housing for example, can
be directly achieved through sales of lots as is done in the case of private
developers. In kampung improvement programs, which involve extension of urban
services such as roads, footpaths, drainage, and public water taps to already
built up areas, direct cost recovery from beneficiaries is much more difficult
to achieve. These urban services are normally provided through local govern-
ments, and the promotion of KIP programs in the cities of Indonesia was felt
to be more appropriately handled by a government agency.
5.03      Overall national housing policy will continue to be the responsibi-
lity of the National Housing Authority, with Cipta Karya serving as
Secretariat of the Authority. Responsibility for preparing integrated
shelter programs for individual cities will lie with the city, which will
receive technical assistance and guidance from Cipta Karya. Cipta Karya's
new responsibility complements its previous role in assisting cities in
preparing overall physical development plans, and in preparing individual
sector plans for water and sanitation.



- 26 -
5.04      The KIP unit within the DKI administration prepared the three-year
program for that city included in the project. The unit has a staff of
about 40 professionals and is responsible for selecting kampungs to be im-
proved, determining appropriate improvements in accordance with established
standards, awarding civil works contracts, supervising the work of contrac-
tors, and coordinating the inputs from various DKI departments, such as
Education, Health and Sanitation. The KIP unit performed its responsibilities
under the first loan in an efficient and professional manner. In Surabaya,
a KIP unit similar to the one in Jakarta is being established (Annex 6)
with a separate steering committee responsible directly to the Mayor.
B. Monitoring and Surveys
5.05      A series of base line and follow up surveys have been initiated by
the DKI Government. These are to serve as evaluation and monitoring tools
for the project in addition to defining populations and inputs to future
projects. They are essentially divided into two components. The first
deals with the monitoring and definitions of the social, economic and phy-
sical characteristics of populations in both improved and non-improved
kampungs, and the second deals with the monitoring of the health status of
these populations as well as their immediate environment.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      With the city of Jakarta growing by a quarter of a million persons
per year, with the vast majority of the city unserviced, and with the very
low average income levels that exist in the city, the Government realized
that a strategy had to be adopted that was designed to meet the needs of
the largest number of persons at a very low level of cost. It is in this
context that the KIP program involving the extension of minimum services
has evolved. Similar situations exist in every large city of Indonesia and
the Government has now started the process of spreading the program to other
cities. An effort parallel to the kampung improvement program, that involves
development of sites and services has also been adopted by the Government
and will require longer to build up to capacity, but is expected to account
for a major part of national urban development expenditures within a very
short time.
6.02      The project will provide improved living conditions for over 20%
of Jakarta's current population, or about 1.2 million people, and about 9.5%
of Surabaya's population or 200,000 people. In the densely crowded, un-
serviced urban kampungs of Indonesia, open spaces and canals are the chief
places for disposal of human waste. Standing stagnant water, lack of foot-
paths and lack of a safe supply of drinking water are ever present health
hazards contributing to high levels of mortality and debilitating disease.
Productivity, which is directly related to health, is correspondingly low.
Project investments in community and individual human waste disposal facili-
ties, improved storm drainage channels, community health centers, and a less



- 27 -
contaminated water supply will result in better health and living conditions
for Jakarta and Surabaya residents. With this infrastructure and the com-
:;'nementary provision of health/nutrition programs and educational facilities,
_--sic labor productivity is expected to be increased. An indicative analysis
that attempts to directly relate the investments in the health and environ-
mental sanitation components to increased productivity is found in Annex 9,
along with a similar analysis relating education investments to productivity
increases.
6.03      The economic justification of the project has been established
by determining (i) that the proposed development option is the best among
feasible alternatives and (ii) that the rate of return in comparison to
the "without" the project situation is sufficiently high.
Choice Among Alternatives
6.04      In the context of the KIP, the development options that must be
considered primarily involve variations in the levels of standards for ser-
vices. The standards proposed in the project for both Jakarta and Surabaya,
have evolved through experience gained from past kampung improvement works
in Jakarta. Available data does not permit a quantitative comparison of the
costs and benefits of different levels of services, but the experience ob-
tained over the years does point to modifications in past standards. Stand-
ards for both water supply and human waste disposal, for example, are higher
in the proposed project than in the first urban project in line with a more
explicit focus on health and environmental sanitation. Per capita expendi-
tures in water supply and human waste disposal have approximately doubled
from $6.4 and $1.2 respectively to $11.9 and $3.2. While this expenditure is
still relatively low, the additional funds will permit provision of a more
elaborate reticulation system, in addition to public standpipes, which would
permit individual hookups for residents who could afford to pay for such
connections. This level of service will significantly increase the availabil-
ity of water to kampungs residents, and reduce reliance on the worst of the
individual wells many of which are dangerously contaminated. Provision of
individual pit privies where feasible, rather than large communal facilities
should markedly increase the use of sanitary facilities in place of open
canals and drainage ditches.
6.05      The unit costs of other components have not changed significantly
from the first urban project (Annex 2, Table 3) but the emphasis has changed
in some cases. Standards for internal circulation have shifted through greater
provision of footpaths and a corresponding reduction in vehicular roads.
Standards for educational and health facilities are substantially the same
as in previous years. With kampung schools operating four shifts per day
(offering less than 2 hours instruction), the DKI has estimated that in 1976
as many as 100,000 children in Jakarta could not enter schools because of lack
of space. These shortages have led to a drop in school participation rates
over the last decade and have prompted a warning in a recent ILO report about
the future quality of the labor force and the need for immediate measures to
promote school participation at the primary level, as well as encourage non-
formal education. The burden of the shortages in Surabaya as well as Jakarta



- 28 -
falls most heavily in kampung areas, and seriously constrains access to basic
education and training to low-income families. The educational facilities
will provide spaces for over 52,000 school children over three years to bring
enrollment in kampungs up from the current level of about 40% of eligible
children to the citywide average of roughly 75%, and will reduce the number
of shifts in kampung schools that are upgraded from four to two. The health
and nutrition components will complement the water and sanitary facilities
components in addressing the health problems of Jakarta which are among the
most serious in the world. In addition, a pilot scheme will test the
effectiveness of a preventive health care approach that focuses especially
on health and nutrition education. The impact of all investments, i.e., in
both infrastructure and services will be recorded by the monitoring surveys
(para 5.05).
Economic Return
6.06       The calculation of a quantitative estimate of the economic rate
of return is based upon the assumption that benefits can be measured at
least approximately, through changes in the market values of property in
the project areas. While there are certain project benefits, especially
those that are health related, that may be only indirectly reflected in
property values, such values are believed to provide a useful indicator
of the minimum economic value of project outputs.
6.07       The values used as a measure of benefits are based upon differ-
ences in observed market prices between improved and unimproved property
in similar locations. Land value information was obtained by selecting
representative kampungs in the North, South, East, West and central parts
of each city, and by asking the Lurahs and Chamats (the local kampung head-
men who have the responsibility for recording data on sales of property) to
provide such information on lots with different locational characteristics.
While the informal nature of these surveys suggests that precise values must
be treated with some caution, nevertheless, analysis based on the data pro-
vides a valid measure of the general level of the economic return.
6.08      Project cost estimates used in the economic analysis include all
construction, site preparation, infrastructure, and operating and mainte-
nance costs. In addition, physical contingencies, administration and tech-
nical assistance for engineering were included. Costs of schools, clinics
and health programs were omitted from this analysis following normal prac-
tice (Annex 9, para 3). Adjustments were made to project inputs to eliminate
taxes and duties.
6.09      With these assumptions, the economic rate of return for the
Jakarta component is 54% and the Surabaya component is over 100%. A sensi-
tivity analysis for a 20% reduction in benefits results in returns of 26%
and 94% for Jakarta and Surabaya respectively. When labor is shadow priced
at 50% to reflect opportunity costs the returns are 67% for Jakarta, and
over 100% again for Surabaya. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the Jakarta
component at a discount rate of 15% is $21.5 million and the NPV of the
Surabaya component is $5.2 million (Annex 9). An independent analysis focus-
ing on the productivity aspects of the investments in water supply, human



- 29 -
waste disposal, footpaths with drainage ditches, health clinics and health
programs 1/ indicates that a minimum increase in productivity of only 6% in
Jakarta and less than 3% in Surabaya would justify these components of the
project with a rate of return of 15% (Annex 9). A similar analysis of the
education component indicates that an increase in lifetime earnings of 12%
would justify the educational expenditures.
6.10      The high rates of return reflect the relative scarcity of serviced
land in Jakarta and Surabaya and the very high value that residents place on
these services. While the supporting data is not precise, there is no doubt
that property value increases after development are large and dramatic re-
lative to the cost of the services. The KIP works are publicly provided
services, and in the past their expansion has been held back because of
financial constraints. The increase in property value, and the high rate
of return is an indication that demand has risen much faster than the supply
of these services, that there is a great value in their provision and that
further investments in this sector should receive high priority.

INDONESIA
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Jakarta: Urban Background
A. Land Use
1.        The area that is now Jakarta was a small trading port named Sunda
Kalapa at the time of the initial Portuguese contact in the early 16th
century.  In 1619, the Dutch overran the city and established a port at the
mouth of the Ciliwung River. From this area, with two centers at the old
town (Kota) and the port area (Pasar Ikan), the fortress city renamed
Batavia grew inland towards the south along the Cilliwung. The old center
was subject to flooding and recurring epidemics as the harbor silted up in
the 18th and early 19th century. To avoid the flooding, the Dutch built
government buildings on slightly higher land to the South, an area that is
now the center of the city, Merdeka Square and the new port of Tanjung Priok
was constructed to the northeast as a replacement for the badly silted
old port.
2.        A system of canals was constructed to reduce the problems of
flooding and disease epidemics, and an extensive system of urban railways
developed. By 1920, intercity rail lines connected Jakarta with Tanggerang
in the west, Serpong and the Sund straits in the southwest Bogor and Bandung
in the South, and Bekasi and Cirebon in the east. These rail lines and the
roads paralleling them have been major axes for development.
3.        Until che mid-1950s the expansion of the city, with the exception of
Tanjung Priok fort, has been constantly toward the south where the flooding
was less and the climate slightly cooler. Kebayoran Baru, a satellite town
for upper-income residents, was built from 1950 to 1965 and now accommodates
about 175,000 people. To connect Kebayoran with the city, Jalan Thamrin and
Jalan General Sudirman were widened to six-lane highways to form a second
major north-south axis to the traditional route from the Kota to Banteng to
Kramat Raya and Jatinegara. In the late 1950s and early 1960s imposing mon-
uments, government buildings, hotels and the large sports complex were built
to give Jakarta a modern appearance. The employment which these major pro-
jects created attracted many new workers to the city. The population grew
rapidly in the 1950s largely due to the unrest of the Revolution and immed-
iate post-Independence period of the early 1950s and the immigration stimu-
lated by rebellions by Sumatra and Sulawesi in 1958. This increase continued
in the 1960s due to the massive investments pumped into the capital city.
4.        The north to south direction of city growth was modified in the
late 1960s by the construction of a four-lane ring road. This road provides
the only rapid east-west link across the city with the exception of the



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Ancol road in the north. The effect of its construction has been to
provide an opportunity for industrial development in the east, and to
stimulate the development of residential areas in an east-west direction
between the new road and the existing city.
5.        The 1965-1985 Jakarta Master Plan, designed in the early 1960s
with UN aid and enacted by the DKI Jakarta Regional Council in 1967,
emphasized the growth potential to the east and west along with contin-
ued expansion to the south. Most of the new industrial development proposed
is in the east, and much of the new residential area is in the west. A
greenbelt, 4 to 5 km wide, is proposed to circle the city, with extentions
north and south along natural features such as river valleys. There are major
questions regarding the feasibility or desirability of attempting to locate
industrial development on one side of the city and residential areas on the
other which need to be examined before making further decisions about major
sector investments.
B. Demography
Population of Jakarta City
6.        The best sources of data on the demography of Jakarta are the
1961 and the 1971 national census. They indicate a substantial growth during
the decade of 2,906,000 to 4,576,000 persons, an increase of 57.7% over the
decade. The latter figure probably underestimates the total population by
approximately 500,000 because it did not include persons who had lived in the
capital for less than three months 1/. Thus, the population of Jakarta in
1972 was approximately 5,000,000 persons (Table 1).
7.        The rate of growth for Jakarta between 1961 and 1971 was 4.6% per
year, 21% for natural increase and 2.5% due to migration. The corresponding
overall rate for Indonesia as a whole was 2.0%. The growth rates for major
cities of Indonesia is shown in Table 2 and for the regions or the country
in Table 3. The Jakarta city government (DKI) has estimated that the present
rate of growth is even higher than that shown in the tables--5.7% per year,
2.4% for natural growth and 3.3% due to migration 2/. While this rate seems
high, it does help to confirm the indications that this rate of growth is
at least the same as the past decade despite the introduction of a family

(Central Bureau of Statistics).

ANNEX 1
Page 3
planning program and the adoption of a closed city policy in 1971 to dis-
courage further migration by providing a strict registration procedure for
migrants. Actual growth has been much higher than the DKI estimate of 4.0%
per year used in preparing the City Master Plan 1965-1985.
8.        The closed city policy has shown since its introduction little
impact on population figures. Under this policy, migrants show certifi-
cation from an employer that a job is ready for them or from a school that
they have been properly enrolled. In addition, they must report a specific
dwelling in which they will stay. Finally, they must deposit money for a
return ticket with the RT (official in charge of 20 to 30 families). If
they do not have a job after six months they will be returned to their home
village.
9.        With or without a closed city policy the rate of migration to
Jakarta remains substantial due in part to the huge disparity in household
income between Jakarta and its primary sources of migrants, West Java and
Central Java. Using per capita income figures for 1969 and assuming an
average household size of five persons, based on census figures discussed
in more detail later, the annual income for a Jakarta household was
Rp 197,195 while that of a household in Central Java was Rp 92,080 and that
of a household in West Java was Rp 88,100 1/.
10.       A study of migration over the past decade by Professor Nathan Keifetz
of Harvard University for the Department of Manpower and the DKI Jakarta indi-
cates a steady rapid increase of migration at a rate of 89,200 persons per
year 2/. Two-thirds of this total or 57,200 persons per year are between the
ages of 15 and 29. An estimate by the Biro Pusat statistik sets the annual
rate of population increase due to migration at 99,600 persons annually.
These figures indicate that approximately one-third of the total population
increase over the past decade has been due to migration. These are conserva-
tive estimates that are lower than those of the DKI government described
earlier.
11.       The growth of the city has been at a rapid, but rather regular pace
since 1920 except for the depression and war years and two other periods
of extreme dislocation: the revolutionary period of 1948 and 1950 and the
revolts in Sumatra and Sulawesi in 1958 and 1959.  In the-latter period
the population grew by 1,00,000 persons within a one-year period. Thus
it has been estimated on the basis of past growth that the population
of Jakarta will reach at least 7,000,000 in 1981 and 8,850,000 persons in
1986.

12.       The national government is taking steps to reduce migration through
an extensive rural development program, a program of regional government aid
to secondary cities and a program of transmigration from Java to the outer
islands.
Population Projection for Metropolitan Jakarta
13.       A population projection cannot be made with any certainty for the
Jakarta Metropolitan area because its physical boundaries have not been
agreed by various planning units. Therefore, using the 1971 census figures
it is necessary to include all of the three districts bordering Jakarta-
Tanggerang, Bekasi, and Bogor. Except for Bogor, the cities included are
small traditional centers serving surrounding agricultural lands. Bogor,
with a population of over 200,000 has an independent economic base as a
tourist center.
14.       Industrial growth along the new road to Bogor, spurred by the build-
ing of the Indonesian Pentagon, and along the road to Tanggerang will stimu-
late population growth south and west of Jakarta. Given these trends and
taking a median of the rates of growth for these areas over the past decade,
a rate of growth of 3.8% per year until 1986 seems a reasonable estimate.
Thus the population of the metropolitan area outside of Jakarta City would
reach 4,565,000 in 1981 and 5,039,000 in 1986. The population for the entire
Jakarta Metropolitan area would reach 11,740,000 in 1981 and 14,020,800 in
1986 (Table 1).
Household Formation
15.       For the purpose of determining housing demand, this estimate of
total population increase must be translated into an increase in the total
number of new households that will need housing. Using a straight line
projection that reflects current population trends and assuming a household
size of approximately 5.3 persons as in the 1971 National Census figures
for Jakarta, there would be approximately 409,000 new households by 1981 or
an average of 51,000 new households annually. These households will have
to be served by existing municipal and community facilities or an expansion
of those facilities.
Projected Unplanned Expansion of Jakarta's Urban Areas
16.       Good statistics on the micro distribution and movements of popu-
lation within Jakarta are not available. However, the DKI Census Office
compiles returns from the lurahs (district chiefs) on the registration
of incoming and outgoing residents in their kelurahans (districts). These
give a rough guide, but should be treated with caution, due to the under-
registration of new residents. A mapping of these statistics reveals that
the new urban kampungs of the city are the chief recipients of Jakarta's
population growth. They receive not only the incoming migrants, but also
some of the households moving out from the densely populated inner kam-
pungs.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
17.       These new kampungs cover about 35% of the urbanized area of the
city but accept about 70% of the population growth. Moreover, average
households size is smaller than in the areas housing middle- and upper-
income groups.  Thus more households are formed and more area absorbed than
for comparative growth elsewhere in the city. The newly forming kampungs
2
have an average plot size of 170 m , coi2pared with a density of 515 persons
per ha and an average plot size of 87 m in improved kampungs which lie
largely within the inner city. By 1980 kampung areas will be expanding at
the rate of approximately 700 ha per year.
C. Access to Basic Services
Water Supply and Sewage Disposal
18.       City services are badly strained to service existing areas.  Accord-
ing to 1968-1969 Jakarta Household survey, about 11 percent have piped water
inside residential plots while 19 percent depend on bought water from vendors.
Table 4 shows the types of toilet facilities typically found in Jakarta.
Table 4 also gives percentages of households dependent on different types of
drinking water, based on 1971 census data. About 46 percent of households
have private (inside the plot)water supply. Combining both private and
public water supply facilities, piped water is used by 45 percent of Jakarta.
A further 18 percent use common wells.  Available data on the geographical
distribution of water supply facilities in Jakarta by 1973 indicates that
North Jakarta has the highest percentage (98 percent) of households dependent
on water bought from vendors, and that Central Jakarta has the highest
percentage (19 percent) of households who own piped water facilities.
19.       Continued reliance on ground-water in Jakarta appears to be a doubt-
ful long-term policy, given the decreasing yield and increasing pollution
from sea water. The network of water mains was laid down between 40 and
100 years ago. Much of the piping needs to be renewed and the yearly budget
of the municipal water company is split between renewal works and extension
of service. There are areas in the north and east of the city where safe
water near the surface is not obtainable, and water mains are not accessible.
Residents in these areas pay vendors from 5 to 44 times the rate for piped
water 1/. Those who must use the vendors services are among the poorest
residents of the city.
1/ At 1973, the rate for mains water was about Rp 10 per cubic meter compared
to Rp 20 per can of water from hawkers, which amount to Rp 440 per cubic
meter, PCD report, Kampung Improvement Program, 1973, Annex 4, page 7.



ANNEX I
Page 6
20.       At present, the city has no municipal sewerage system.  Table 4
indicates that 32 percent of households rely on private pit privy or septic
tanks of which the majority are substandard. Lowest income households often
defecate in canals, communal pools or in their backyards. Frequently those
with some toilet arrangements have their effluent piped directly into
streams and canals. Forty seven percent of households have no flushing
arrangements for the toilet faciltiies they use.
21.       With the increasing growth of the city, the discharge of untreated
sewage into the ground is producing water pollution problems. As indicated
in Table 4, almost 65 percent of the city water supply is derived from wells.
In many places, shallow wells have high coli counts and in some areas in the
north of the city the deeper level supplies are being affected.
Garbage Collection
22.       The problem of clogging and pollution of the canals by garbage
is serious. Administration and organization, more than financial costs,
appear to be the problem in resolving the garbage collection and disposal
problem in Jakarta. According to an estimate in 1970 by NEDECO, one million
cubic meters of garbage is left for "wild disposal" in canals and ditches 1/;
about one third of the rubbish is left uncollected.
D. Household Income-Expenditure Patterns
23.       The 1968-69 Jakarta Survey of Income Expenditures and Household
Conditions conducted by the GOI Bureau of Census and Statistics is the only
source for income and expenditure distributions. However, it is flawed by
(a) gross understatement of income in kind, especially housing and cars and
other transportation allowances; (b) failure to include income from second
jobs and secondary wage earners; (c) lack of consideration of one person
households; and (d) mathematical errors in compiling raw data. Despite
these problems this survey is the best place to start an analysis.
24.       To update the survey a 4.0% net annual growth rate for net per
capita income in Jakarta has been assumed based upon a 9.0-9.5% annual
growth rate in real income and a 4.5-5.0% annual growth rate in population.
The annual rate of growth of the Gross Domestic Product for Jakarta for the
period 1967-70 is as follows:

Source: Kantor Census Dan Statistik, DKI Jakarta
25.       The median household income in 1969 has been estimated by the
Government as about Rp 10,000 per month. This figure is slightly lower
than the average monthly household expenditures of Rp 10,147.
26.       The survey figures grossly understate household incomes because
of the failure to count transients; secondary wage earners; income in kinds;
and income from second jobs. These omissions were exaggerated by dropping
from the survey persons who earned more than Rp 100,000 per month. Finally,
5-10% of the total households were dropped from the sample because their
expenditures exceeded their monthly income by more than 20%.
Transients
27.       The income distribution may underestimate the number of persons at
the very lowest levels (below Rp 5,000 per month) because it does not take
direct consideration of the large number of migrants (now at least 2% of the
total population of the city annually) many of whom pick up garbage or get
only the most menial jobs. This group should continue to exist in about the
same proportions for the foreseeable future.
Secondary Wage Earners and Second Jobs
28.       The 1968-69 Survey indicates that 24.2 % of all households have
secondary wage earners. However, other indications are that as many as
50% of the households have secondary wage earners, especially in the lower
income categories below Rp 10,000 per month. Many wives and children earn
Rp 2,000-3,000 per month working in the pasar. In addition many primary
wage earners have second and third jobs. The survey did not list the number
of such persons though it attempted to count such income.   However, second-
ary wage information is difficult to obtain in any country and Biro Pusat
Statistik has acknowleged that the survey probably failed to measure a large
portion of household income.
Income In Kind
29.       Income in kind is very difficult to measure unless it is given
as part of an easily translatable monthly equivalent, such as rice or sugar.



ANNEX 1
Page 8
Census Bureau officials have acknowledged that it is extremely difficult
to value and count payments in kind and that it is quite possible that
such payments are understated by 10-15%. Housing expenses and transporta-
tion expenditures were definitely understated but there is no way to check
this easily. If these payments are indeed understated by that amount it
would make a major change in income and expenditure distribution. The In-
dustrial Survey of Jakarta completed in 1970 showed that the value of wages
in kind, although varying greatly as a share of total earnings in different
industrial sectors, was commonly from 20-25% 1/. For lower grade workers
the share would be higher. In some industries it is as high as 50% of total
income. The lowest government worker earning about Rp 6,000-7,000 per month
with a wife and four children receives about 35% of his total income in
kind 2/.
30.       Between 1969 and 1973 the Jakarta Price Index increased approxi-
mately 90%. Assuming conservatively that the median income in 1969 was
Rp 10,000 per month, and assuming that wages in nominal terms increased at
15% per year between 1969 and 1973 the median income in 1973 would be
approximately Rp 17,800. Table 4 shows the estimated income distribution
based upon the 1968-69 survey that corresponds to these assumptions about
income growth. Projections are also made to 1976.

SECOND URBAN DEVEOLOPMENT PROJECT
INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN STANDARDS AND COST ESTIMATES
A. Kampung Improvement Program: Jakarta
1.        In the two-year KIP financed under the first project, standards
for different project components were specified on an areawide basis.
This procedure was satisfactory for kampungs with similar density patterns,
but was not appropriate where the physical characteristics of the kampungs
differed significantly. In addition, while the kampungs upgraded in the
first project included kampungs in the worst physical condition with little
or no existing infrastructure, the kampungs proposed for the next three years
contain some existing infrastructure which needs to be considered in defining
physical standards for the different components. Therefore, an important
change in the project standards proposed in this project is to specify func-
tional standards rather than areawide standards and to specify investments
to cover the shortfall in the provision of the major basic services (access,
water, drainage, human waste, solid waste,) between the existing infrastruc-
ture and the functionally defined standards. A comparison of the standards
used in the first project with those proposed for the second projet is given
in Table 1.
2.        In the first project, uniformity in total investment levels, that is
existing investment plus KIP investment in the different kampungs was achieved
by specification of areawide standards combine with population densities fal-
ling within a narrow range. However, with the worst and the densest kampungs
having been covered in the first project, the kampungs to be included in the
second project are of lower density (although still over 300 persons per hec-
tare), and the density varies considerably. The uniformity in the levels of
total investment will be maintained by specifying a uniform investment per
dwelling, that is, value of existing services plus KIP investments. As a
result, investment per unit of area will be higher in general in the denser
poorer kampungs. Because of the budget limitations, in the first year's
program of the project, it is estimated that 80 percent of the functionally
defined standards will be attainable.
3.        Cost estimates have been prepared by the KIP Project Unit in the
DKI based in the actual experience from the 1975-76 program now being com-
pleted. Details of cost estimates for the different items of the program
are given in Table 2, and a comparison of the allocation among the different
items in the first project and the allocation resulting from the new design
procedures is given in Table 3.

Roads and Footpaths
4.        The functional standards for paved roads would be that no dwelling
is more than 100 m away from a one-way road or more than 300 mi from a two-
way road. Three different road designs will be used depending on the nature
of the traffic to be carried:
Right-of-Way      Paved Surface      Typical Base 1/       Traffic
6 m               4 m            20/20/5 2/           Heavy loads prohibited.
Limited ROW available.
8 m               4 m            20/20/5              Heavy loads prohibited.
Provision for future
pavement widening.
10 m               6 m            15/15/10/5          Heavy loads permitted.
The first two designs are based on the Telford system which is common practice
in Indonesia. The third design for heavy loads will include a 40-cm base of
sand and broken and graded stones. All roads will have a 1 m concrete drain
on either side.
5.        Functional standards for footpaths will be to provide footpath
access to within 20 m of all dwellings not situated on a paved road. The foot-
paths will have a 3 m right-of-way, a 1.5 m wide 6 cm concrete pavement laid
on a 10 cm sand layer and concrete drainages on both sides.
Drainage Canals
6.        Flooding during the rainy season is a serious problem in most
kampungs and particularly in the kampungs located in North Jakarta. Exten-
sive drainage works are therefore an essential part of the improvement pro-
gram. Secondary drainage is included in the road and footpath design by pro-
viding drainways and is included in the roadworks cost. The secondary drains
flow into open primary drains which will be constructed in each kampung.
The primary drains in turn flow into the city's main drainage canals. The
citywide drainage network, however, is totally inadequate for the present
needs of Jakarta having been designed originally for a city of 600,000. A
team of consultants from the Netherlands has prepared a master plan for drain-

age and flood control, but because of budgetary constraints there is little
likelihood of its implementation during Repelita II. Therefore, any improve-
ments in the drainage of the kampungs will be constrained by the capacity of
the main canals for the near future. About 25.5 km of primary open drains
will be constructed in the first year of the project.
Water Supply
7.        Availability of potable water supply is a high priority among re-
sidents in both improved and unimproved kampungs. In the absence of an ade-
quate water supply, residents of many kampungs are forced to buy water from
vendors at prices which are more than four times the price of the city water
supply. The project will provide connection of kampungs to the main city
network, and deep tube-wells will be provided in kampungs where it is cost
effective and technically feasibile to do so.
8.        The water supply distribution system will be enlarged over that in
the first project to provide possibilities of individual connections where
there is sufficient demand for such connections. The first project provided
for a unfirom standard of one public hydrant to serve an area of 4 ha. How-
ever, the existing water supply conditions, and therefore the need for public
water supply in the kampungs vary considerably primarily depending on the
availability of good shallow ground water. Thus, the uniform standards of
water supply provided under the first project resulted in either an under-
provision or an over-provision of public standpipes. In the present project,
standards for public standpipes have been defined for the different parts of
Jakarta (Table 1). In addition, the design engineer will be responsible
ultimately to determine whether any further variation in the standard is
warranted for a particular kampung.
9.        Extension of water supply to the kampungs will mean some reduction
in the service available elsewhere if a commensurate increase in the produc-
tion capacity is not undertaken. The demand from the public hydrants in the
kampungs is estimated as 20 lcd and from private connections as 50 lcd. In
comparison, average consumption for for Jakarta is estimated at about 80 lcd.
Where feasible, deep wells will be constructed to augment the local supply.
In the first year of the project, two deep wells each with a production
capacity of 200 1/sec will be constructed. In addition, a new filtration and
pumping plant along the Sunter river with a capacity of 5,000 1/sec is scheduled
for completion by 1981, with a first phase capacity of 1,000 1/sec to be avail-
able by 1978. Any short-run reduction in service to presently serviced areas
that occurs in favor of the poor residents of the kampungs is considered to be
consistent with the objectives of the project in assisting the urban poor.
Sanitation Facilities
10.       Infrastructure facilities for human waste disposal in the project
will include sanitary pit privies the type of which will be governed by the



ANNEX 2
Page 4
local conditions. MCK units (communal washing and toilet facilities) provided
under the earlier KIP Program are disfavored over the pit privies because of
difficulty in acquiring land and because of difficulties in obtaining social
acceptance of the communal toilet facilties. The proposed pit privy scheme
is aimed at solving the problem at the individual family level rather than at
the community level. Under the scheme, pit privies will be installed one for
each household or multiple households depending on the population density,
land availability and characteristics. The problem areas of the kampungs
where the pit privy installation may pose serious public health problems will
be identified and viable alternatives will be explored including the possi-
bility of providing smaller size community toilets serving a few families.
It is anticipated that except for the Northern region in Jakarta, the pro-
posed pit privy program would be readily applicable to most of the kampungs
in the other regions. Details pertaining to the above scheme are outlined
in Annex 3.
11.       In order to establish guidelines and stipulate realistic standards
regarding the pit privy design, a pilot research program will be initiated
in the Jakarta region for a ten-month to one-year period, beginning March
1976. Major attention will be focused on public health factors relating to
biological as well as chemical pollution orginating from the pits. The in-
vestigation will study in detail the influence of various parameters such as
population density, type of water supply in the area, soil characteristics,
hydrological and topographical features etc. upon the nature of the pit privy
scheme. In the absence of any rational standards governing the design of
pit privies in Indonesia, the above mentioned research program is considered
to be crucial to the success of the proposed waste disposal scheme for the
kampungs. It is anticipated that the results of this research program will
be applied to other Indonesian cities that will have urban development
programs in future.
Garbage Disposal
12.       The system of solid waste disposal in the city is inadequate.  The
City Sanitation Department, which is responsible for garbage collection, does
not have a sufficient number of vehicles to be able to remove all of the
garbage. Moreover, a proper system of garbage collection and disposal does
not exist. It is estimated that as much as 35% of the garbage remains un-
collected. The uncollected garbage is often dumped in the canals where it
contributes to the flooding.
13.       While the solid waste disposal problem is a citywide problem which
requires a major initiative, the project would attempt to alleviate this
problem in the kampungs to be used in the project. A provision will be made
for concrete garbage boxes as in the first project to serve as central garbage
collection points. Hand carts will be provided for transporting the garbage
from individual dwellings to the boxes and 9 garbage trucks will be included
to remove garbage from the collection points to the city dump.

Schools
12.       Primary school attendance in Jakarta is presently estimated to be
75% of the eligible children. However, attendance levels in the unimproved
kampungs are under 40%. Shortage of schools is a critical constraint facing
the education authorities. The project would provide sufficient schools and
the necessary equipment in the kampungs to be upgraded with the aim of rais-
ing primary school attendance level in these areas to the average level for
Jakarta. In addition, the project will help reduce the existing number of
shifts per school from four to two. To this end the project will provide 30
schools per year (90 total) and the necessary equipment. Each school will
be able to accommodate at least 500 students on a double-shift basis. The
siting of the new schools will be generally within walking distance of the
school children, but the exact locations of the schools, as well as their
ultimate class size, cannot be decided until an inventory of land avail-
ability is completed and purchases are made. In many cases, it is antici-
pated that multi-storied schools will be preferred to single story schools
because of the land problem and classroom sizes will conform to existing
Indonesian norms of 40 to 42 children per class, with a 2 shift system in
operation.
15.       Engineers and architects of the KIP units in both Jakarta and
Surabaya have presented for approval of the Bank final plans for the dif-
ferent types of school building! in each kampung based on exisiting cost
estimates of around Rp 50,000/m  for cons ruction costs and equipment.
Buildings sill not occupy more than 690 m  (8 classroors), and the cost of
land per m will range from Rp 8,000/ m to Rp 15,000/mr
Health Clinics
16.       Because of the severe health and malnutrition problems existing
in Jakarta and Surabaya, the shortage of physicians and nurses in Government
service, and the expenses incurred in building and operating large health
clinics which do not function as a preventive tool in reducing malnutrition
and disease, the project will include the construction of small 2 room health
"posts" in various kampungs, and the training of primary health workers
for the kampungs to staff them. The health workers will be responsible
for the collection of health statistics for monitoring purposes, and for
first aid treatment including education in hygiene, nutrition and family
planning (Annex 4). The health costs will be under the supervision of the
larger puskesmas (clinics) present at the su1district level. Each health
post will occupy a total area of around 60 m and will cost around Rp 2.5 mil-
lion to build and equip. Thirty will be built. In addition, it will also
be necessary to build around 15 of the larger clinics in order to meet mini-
mum health coverage standards, and these will cost around Rp 16,000,000 to
build and they will occupy an area of 300 m . They will be composed of six
rooms and will be staffed by one physician and four to six medical workers
including an administrative and statistical assistant.

17.       For Surabaya, three health posts (Pos Keshatans) and five health
clinics (Puskesmas) will be built. The Pos Keshatans will be used for the
use of 100 community health workers which would be trained as a part of the
project (Annex 4).
B. Kampung Improvement Program: Surabaya
18.       The design standards and procedures to be used in the Surabaya
project will be similar to those which have evolved from the Jakarta project.
However, since the Surabaya project is the first Bank investment at a rela-
tively modest scale in kampung improvements works of this nature, in the
first year the emphasis will be to continue the existing design procedures
and focus instead on the organizational aspects. For the second and third
years, as the authority gains some experience, design and implementation
techniques which have been proven to be successful from the Jakarta expe-
rience, will be introduced. In the first year, the design of the project
will be controlled by setting an overall limit on investment per capita. In
addition, as in Jakarta an effort will be made to provide low-cost individual
sanitary facilities rather than community facilities.
18.       The estimated costs of the program in Surabaya over the 3-year
period are summarized in Table 3.

ANNEX 3

INDONESIA
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROVISION OF SANITARY PIT PRIVY
1.        The proposed human waste disposal program is aimed at providing
single family type pit latrines in the kampungs in contrast to the communal
type MCK units (washing, bathing and toilet facilities) installed in the
earlier KIP programs. Put simply the MCKs have not been used. The major
problems with the MCK installations include their inconvenient location,
lack of required land space, lack of sufficient number of units and lack of
proper maintenance.
2.        The proposed pit privy is essentially a pour-flush, water-seal sys-
tem, the contents of which discharge into a soil pit located underneath or
away from the plate. Waste treatment is accomplished via anaerobic and
aerobic bacterial decomposition of the fecal organics which are transformed
into inodorous, stable end products. For a family of six to seven persons,
a pit volume of about 2 cubic meters will be required for a five-year life
period.
3.        Preliminary studies indicate that the pit privy scheme is viable
from the viewpoints of its immediate adaptability in most of the kampungs,
social acceptability and economic feasibility. The scheme can be success-
fully implemented using local materials and local labor (self-help).
Pit Privy Requirements
4.        An in-depth survey will be carried out in the kampungs by the RT's,
RW's and the Lurahs to establish the actual number of pit privies required.
Where land space is a problem, multiple family units combining two to five
families will be considered and their exact number ascertained during the
survey (multiple family units are already in the satisfactory use in densely
populated kampungs). The final list of the pit privy requirements based on
Lurah's estimates as well as technical and financial considerations will be
compiled by the KIP unit of DKI.
5.        A tentative estimate of the total number of pit privies included
in 1976-77 KIP program is about 25,000 for all the Jakarta regions. The
results from an on-going detailed survey will help establish the actual
requirements of single dwelling and multiple dwelling type pit privies.
Design Criteria
6.        Since public health factors related to the pit privy scheme should
be given paramount consideration, a pilot research program spanning a ten-
month to one-year period wil be initiated to study the same. In the absence



ANNEX 3
Page 2
of any existing guidelines governing pit privy design in .ndonesia, major
efforts will be devoted to establish rational design criteria based on the
results of the research study.  Two types of standards, namely, public health
standards (dealing with the location of the pits with respect to the source
of water supply, buildings and other nearby pits) and functional standards
(dealing with the design aspects of the pit itself as a sewage disposal
device) will be stipulated to satisfactorily carry out the pit privy scheme
in the kampungs.
Technical Feasibility
7e        The proposed pit privy scheme is readily adopted to several kampungs
in the east, west , central and south regions of Jakarta. Caution will have
to be exercised in carrying out the scheme in the northern region where the
soil is friable (alluvium type), and high ground water conditions are en-
countered within the top 1 meter of the surface. Alternate disposal methods
(elevated septic tanks discharging effluents to drains, for example) will be
considered under such circumstances, Tlt is recognized that the technical
aspects of the pit privy scheme must incorporate a certain degree of flexi-
bility to suit local conditions.  To this end, the 1976-77 KIP program will
serve as a pilot in establishing a "sound" privy program that can cope with
various problems encountered in the five Jakarta regions. The major types
of pit privy installations suitable to the Jakarta area are schematically
shown in Figure 2.
Imolementation
8.         Community participation is a vital element for the successful imple-
mentation of the pit privy scheme. The self-help movement within each com-
munity will be stressed in organizing voluntary labor.  Sanitarians will be
employed to provide detailed instructions in design, construction and opera-
tion of the pit privies, as well as in the public health aspects of the entire
program. They will be assisted in the field by foremen. It is estimated that
30 sanitarians and 60 foremen will be needed to carry out the privy scheme in
the kampungs included in the 1976-77 KIP program. The Metropolitan Health
Department will play a major role in recruiting and training the sanitarians
and foremen. A routine monitoring and evaluation program will also be under-
taken by the Health Department with the cooperation of the KIP staff.
Figure 2 provides a schematic representation of the various elements involved
in the proposed pit privy scheme.
Cost Estimates
9.         The unit cost of a pit privy will be in the range of Rp 18,000 to
Rp 27,000, as illustrated in Table 2. Utilization of local labor (self-help)
in pit excavation and installation of the Latrine enclosure at the family's



ANNEX 3
Page 3
expense will result in a total savings of Rp 7,500 1/. It is thus estimated
that the actual unit cost to the project unit of the pit privy will vary
between Rp 10,500 and Rp 19,500 depending on the location of pit. Assuming
equal distribution of the pit privy types illustrated in Table 2, the average
unit cost of a pit privy can be estimated to be Rp 15,000 for the Jakarta
region.
10.       The total cost 2/ of the pit privy scheme including the supervisory
personnel is shown below for the three year KIP programs.

1/ A family privy scheme is being carried out on a small scale level by the
Indonesian Government in major cities. According to this scheme which is
financed by INPRES, Jakarta residents receive family type latrines at the
rate of 3,000 installations per year. Floor slabs are provided free to
the families that donate labor to install the latrine.
2/ Includes 30 sanitarians and 60 foremen who will provide technical guidance
and assistance in the privy scheme.
3/ A 10 percent increase in physical infrastructrual costs is assumed.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
HEALTH/NUTRITION PROGRAMS
A. Jakarta
1.        There is a hospital bed for every 870 persons in Jakarta  (accep-
table standards are 1 to 1,000 population) and in 1973, there were 27 health
centers and 30 health subcenters. There is a doctor for every 3,086 inhabi-
tants in the city. However, coverage of the population with health services
is very low due to the people's lack of awareness of health needs and serv-
ices, difficulties in accessibility to health facilities, lack of outreach
services, and lack of emphasis on preventative health. There is a chronic
shortage of essential supplies, for instance, vaccines against diphtheria,
whooping cough, tetanus and poliomyelitis; and the high cost places them
beyond the reach of those people who need them most. Furthermore, some of
the few health centers available are under-utilized partly due to difficult
accessibility, lack of awareness of health needs and services, and socio-
cultural barriers existing in the facilities. There is also too much reliance
on hospital-based health services, and a lack of the infrastructure necessary
for outreach.
2.        As a result of some of the above-mentioned factors, in addition
to the extremely poor environmental sanitation, the patterns of disease are
as follows: a rapid spread of communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis
and cholera (250-300 cases/week reported); common childhood diseases like
measles, often complicated by pneumonia; vector-borne diseases like malaria
and typhus flourish; water and food-borne diseases; typhoid and dysenteries,
are rampant; and parasitic infestations with ascaris, hookworm, and trichuris
abound in about 80% of the inhabitants. The prevalence of malnutrition,
especially in young children and mothers, is extremely high with protein-
caloric malnutrition (PCM) found in 40-45% of children below five years;
evidence of irreversible eye damage due to Vitamin A deficiency in 10% of
the child population in some surveys; and anaemia in as many as 30% of adult
males; 50% of the children and 85-92% of childbearing women. The food in-
take is very low at about 1,200 calories per person per day and 27 gm of
protein per person per day, compared with the respective figures for the
United States of 3,200 calories and 70 gm of protein. All these lead to
high infant mortality rate in the kampungs estimated at 160/1,000 to
200/1,000 live births and crude death rate of 15/1,000 population.



ANNEX 4

Objectives of the Health/Nutrition Programs
3.        The main objectives of the programs are:
(a) to increase the coverage of the population with health and
nutrition services, by actively taking these services out to
the people in their communities and homes;
(b) to involve the community in the planning, operation and
financing of their health program;
(c) to shift the emphasis from curative to preventative and
promotive health activities through health and nutrition
education;
(d) to provide a community-based integrated service whose main
components are maternal and child health, communicable disease
control, nutrition, family planning, envirorLmental health,
minor curative services and referral.
4.        The "Health Pyramid" in Jakarta is relatively top-heavy in that
there are hospitals down to the regional level and there is a main health
center or subcenter in each of the Districts (Kelurahan). Below this level,
there is no organized health activity. There is thus the need for an exten-
sion of services into the community and strengthening of the base of the
pyramid.

ANNEX 4
Page 3
5.        As mentioned previously, one health post (Pos Kesehatan) in each
community (Rukun Warga or RW) of about 3,000 people is planned. These will
serve as satellites for the health subcenters and as a base for health and
nutrition activities in the community. It will be a simple two-room facility,
one room for the health activities in general and the other for a young child
center (Karang Bahta), which will focus on nutrition, disease prevention and
education of pre-school children. It is not feasible to have a health post in
each of over 1,000 RWs in Jakarta. Therefore, a pilot demonstration project
is planned in 30 RWs in such a way that it lends itself to evaluation of the
health and nutrition component, per se:
(a) 10 RWs in the "already improved" kampungs - Pop. about 30,000;
(b) 10 RWs in the "will be improved" kampungs - Pop. about 30,000;
(c)  10 RWs in the " never be improved" kampungs - Pop. about 30,000.
The total population of the pilot project area will be 90-100,000, of whom
about 9-10,000 will be young children. The choice of one health post for
every 3,000 population is consistent with U.N. recommendations.
6.        One of the major activites in the Pos Kesehatan will be running
the Young Child Center. The activities will include:
(a) to improve the nutritional condition of the young children by
bringing them to the center two to three times a week, and
feeding them nutritionally-balanced meals, prepared from locally
available foods. As part of this exercise, mothers will be
involved in meal preparation, so as to give them a lesson in
better nutrition;
(b) to identify children suffering from Grade III PCM and refer
them to hospitals or health centers for treatment;
(c) to prevent blindess due to Vitamin A deficiency by oral
administration of megadoses of the vitamin every six months;
(d) to prevent infectious diseases by an active immunization
program;
(e) to teach the children and their mothers basic environmental
sanitation and personal hygiene.
7.        The absolute shortage of health facilities and trained personnel and
the socio-cultural barriers that lead to under-utilization call for a new
cadre of personnel. These are low-cost multi-purpose community-based health
workers, who will be chosen from the community by the community and trained
in the Local Health Centers to deliver integrated services. They will use
the Health Post as their operational base, but will spend most of their time



ANNEX 4
Page 4
in the community and home visiting. There will be 12 health workers for each
of the 30 Health Posts, making a total of 360 and there will thus be one
health worker to every 500 persons. There will be two shifts of duty from
07.00 - 14.00 hours and 14.00 - 22.00 hours with somebody "on call" for the
rest of the night. They will be paid a token honoraria of Rp 7,500 (US$18)
per month, but it is hoped that at the end of the two year program, the
community will fund their operating costs via a health "insurance" contribu-
tion of Rp 50 to 100 per month per family.
8.        The community health workers will deliver the following services:
(a) Basic Health Services. Counseling on health, minor curative
and first aid and emergency services, immunization, registra-
tion of births and deaths, collection of data on diseases,
referral to the health center;
(b) Maternal and Child Health Services. Counseling on child health
and child rearing, immunizations, prenatal and postnatal
services, midwifery services for complicated cases;
(c) Nutritional Services. Nutrition counseling and education,
curative services for patients with malnutrition, monitoring of
the nutritional status of the "at risk" groups using weight
charts, breast feeding promotion, counseling in infant weaning
using low-cost locally avialable high-protein multi-mixes, and
demonstration low-cost home gardens;
(d) Family Planning Services. Family planning information and
motivation, dispensing, under supervision, of desired con-
traceptive methods possible in the home or health post, referral
to the health center for the more complicated procedures, follow-
up of acceptors, and continuing review of non-acceptors;
(e) Environmental Health Services. Environmental sanitation
information, personal hygiene information; advice and assistance
with latrine construction, and advice on methods of rendering
drinking water safe.
9.        The community health workers will usually have had nine years of
education and will undergo basic training for two months with a refresher
course starting 4 to 6 months after they have been in the field. The training
will be conducted in batches of 12 students at six health subcenters at a time.
The curriculum wil be constructed by the City Health Department, based on
the expected functions outlined above. A training team comprising a doctor,
a nurse and a midwife headed by a training coordinator at the City Health
Department Headquarters will be responsible for the training of the trainers
and the coordination and supervision of the training in each health subcenter.
The community health workers will be given a procedure manual after success-
fully completing the training to act as a guide to actions to be taken in



ANNEX 4
Page 5
any given situation as well as a "certificate" and uniform. There will be
egular weekly supervision by the health subcenter and once every two weeks
by the regional health office and once a month by the City Health Department.
Six full-time supervisors will be appointed for the Project.
10.       Health and Nutrition Surveys are being undertaken in Jakarta to
provide the baseline data for evaluation as well as suggesting sensitive
indicators and realistic targets for evaluation. Subsequent re-surveys
will be undertaken in order to evaluate the impact of the pilot project.
11.       During discussions, assurances were obtained from the Chief of
the City Health Department, Jakarta, that:
(a) the project as outlined was consistent with the national
health policy of the Goverment of Indonesia. This point
was also verified at meetings with the Secretary General
and the different Director Generals of the Department
Kesehatan, Ministry of Health;
(b) the Ministry of Health would give the project its full
support, especially with respect to professional personnel.
This was also verified with the officials of the Ministry of
Health, listed above;
(c) the City Health Department will administer it as a special
project and have full accountability for it;
(d) the City Health Department will provide the facilities and
personnel required for the implementation of the project,
as stipulated in the proposal;
(e) the necessary liaison and cooperation with the local government
and community organizations of the project sites will be
fostered by the City Health Department;
(f) the items on the recurrent expenditure, such as vaccines,
for which external assistance is sought, will effectively
be taken over by the community health fund after two years,
collaborating with the City Health Department.
B. Surabaya
12.       Due to the shortage of sufficient trained health personnel and
facilities in the City Health Office, the nutrition-health component will
focus initially on two main components:
(a) the training of 100 community health workers (volunteers)
to be drawn from the kampungs;



ANNEX 4
Page 6
(b) the construction of three primary health "offices"
(Pos Kesehatans) in three kampungs which will be linked
to existing larger polyclinics (Puskesmas).
13.       The training of the 100 community health workers who will serve a
population of roughly 50,000 is aimed at establishing a base in the kampungs
for the collection of (i) health-nutrition statistics, (ii) the education
and follow-up of vulnerable families, (iii) referrals to polyclinics and hos-
pitals, (iv) weighing of all children, (v) immunization and vaccination
referrals, (vi) training the community in sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition,
(vii) family planning, and (viii) maintaining a profile on the course and
origin of communicable diseases originating in the kampungs. During subse-
quent years, specific targets for the elimination of certain diseases and,
malnutrition will be added to the program. At this stage, however, it is
first essential to establish a "core" of community workers, through which
programs can be built upon. The community health workers (CHWs) will re-
ceive payments only during the training period. Subsequent to that, they
will be paid in "cash or kind" by the population they serve in accordance
with existing Indonesia practices (and experience in other areas).
14.       The training of each CHW will take approximately 25 days at a cost
of 1,666 Rp/CHW/day (approximately US$4), to include transportation, meals,
payment to instructors, honoraria to trainees, and materials. They will be
trained in batches of 20 at the City Health lecture room. The curriculum
will follow the enclosed outline:
- Government policy on health;
-Role of polyclinics and Pos Kesehatans;
- Maternal and child health (including nutrition);
- Family Planning methods and record keeping;
- Family welfare and hygiene;
- Home economics (cooking of nutritious meals);
- Epidemiology of disease;
- Environmental sanitation and health;
- Communication to and from the people;



ANNEX 4
Page 7
15.       The total cost of this training component will come to Rp 4 million
(approximately $10,000) and a further Rp 5.7 million are earmarked for the
provision of materials and mass media communication sessions. The CHWs will
be distributed among the eight kampungs of the KIP project. Their impact
will be compared in the kampungs with the primary health "offices" to the
kampungs without these office-clinics. In addition, "control" data will be
obtained from kampungs without CHWs (improved and non-improved) of the same
socio-economic background. Data will be simple indices, such as infant/child
mortality, hemoglobin, weight for height of children 1-5 years. Laboratory
charges, drugs, publications, and processing expenses will bring this data
collection component to Rp 2.5 million ($6,000 approximately).

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.        Technical assistance provided under the project is intended to
strengthen the capabilities of government agencies in their responsibilities
to develop finance and supervise kampung improvement programs. Assistance
will also be provided to the National Urban Development corporation to
assist it in implementing its program of sites and services and low-cost
housing. The technical assistance provided to Cipta Karya will be directly
related to the design and execution of the KIP works in Jakarta and Surabaya,
and it is expected that the experience from these cities would be valuable
in developing similar programs in other cities in Indonesia. Assistance would
be provided in the following areas:
(man-years)

Project Design and Supervision
2.        Engineering.  Assistance will be provided through Cipta Karya to
the KIP project units in Jakarta and Surabaya in the design of the civil
works, tender preparation and construction supervision. One engineer would
be provided full-time to each unit to assist in the design and detailed
engineering of the infrastructure facilities. One engineer would assist in
.ities in tender preparation, construction scheduling and bid evaluation.
Another engineer would be responsible for contract supervision and certifi-
cation of completed works as required under the loan. A senior engineer
would head the team on a part-time basis for which a total of one man-year
as been allocated. It is expected that the engineers would have had prior
experience in design and construction of low-cost roads, drainage works,
water supply and sanitation facilities. Experience with labor-intensive
methods of construction would be required of at least some members of the
team.
3.        Accounting.  A full-time accounting consultant will be retained
to assist the two KIP units in establishing an accounting system to monitor
and record expenditures on the different project components and from dif-
ferent project sources. The consultant will establish procedures for payment
of contractors' bills and auditing procedures for the project accounts satis-
factory to the Bank. The consultant should be a CPA with experience in
accounting of government or public sector organizations. Provision has
also been made for the services of a senior accounting consultant on a
part-time basis as necessary.
Kampung Selection Criteria, Evaluation and Monitoring
4.        Economic Analysis.  Provision has been made for an economist to
work full-time with the Jakarta KIP Unit to develop methods for evaluating
the feasibility and appropriateness of upgrading different kampungs. Speci-
fically, analysis will focus on the economic feasibility of upgrading new
kampungs that have formed since the start of the KIP program, and other
kampungs which are not currently eligible, but which might be eligible if
the criteria used previously were now applied. An assessment will be made
of the impact of kampung upgrading on demand for other services, especially
transport, water and sanitation. The economist would have had experience
in project evaluation and regional economics. The economist would also have
overall responsiblity for technical aspects of the monitoring and surveys
included in the project.
5.        Evaluation and Monitoring.  One or more local institutions will
be engaged to undertake a socio-economic evaluation of the kampungs improved
under the program in both Jakarta and Surabaya. A sample of improved and
unimproved kampungs would be monitored over 2-3 years to determine the effects
of the program on population, employment, income, health, social welfare and
the attitude of the population towards different types of improvement. De-
tailed surveys will be conducted for this purpose. It is expected that survey
teams from the local universities could be engaged for this purpose. The



ANNEX 5
Page 3
Airlangga University in Surabaya has already been actively involved in the
kampung selection surveys and is particularly well equipped to do this work.
The evaluation teams would include expertise in economics, sociology, public
health and statistics.
Jakarta Regional Planning
6.        As the population and economic activities of Jakarta continue to ex-
pand beyond its present administrative boundaries, it has become apparent that
the development of Jakarta should be closely coordinated with that of its sur-
rounding areas. To this end, Directorate of City and Regional Planning of
Cipta Karya has initiated studies to consider the growth strategies for the
region and the implication for local and central government investments in the
region. Cipta Karya has considerable expertise in the physical planning
aspect of regional planning, but it lacks the necessary economic expertise to
evaluate the economic implications of alternative strategies. The project
provides for two advisers in regional economics for a period of two years to
assist Cipta Karya in its regional planning activities.
7.        The advisers will work with a team of engineers and planners from
Cipta Karya to review current sector plans and investment programs for the
Jakarta region. They will examine the alternative growth strategies and
structure plans for the region for their investment implications. As appro-
priate, implementation mechanisms would be formulated including: infra-
structure placement, incentives and taxes. The advisers would endeavor
to develop counterpart expertise capable of developing similar programs for
other cities.
Property Tax Improvement
8.        The project will provide an expert in municipal taxation for one
man-year to assist the Government in implementing reforms in the national
IPEDA property tax system. A property valuer/instructor will also be re-
tained for a two-year period to train the government staff, through on the
job training and seminars, and to develop systems and procedures for conti-
nuous property valuation in Jakarta.
National Urban Development Corporation (NUDC)
9.        Technical assistance will be provided to the NUDC to cover the
second phase of management advisory services, the first phase of which was
provided for under the first urban loan. The management and technical
advisors would assist, and train the staff of NUDC over a one year period in
areas of program planning, financing and engineering supervision. Six advi-
sors with expertise in low-income housing policy, urban/housing economics,
financial analysis, civil engineering, architecture/planning, and civil works

selected medium-size cities of Indonesia, funds would be provided for retaining
consultants' services for the same. The Government has tentatively identified
seven cities for this purpose to include: Denpasar, Pontianak, Banjirmasin,
Padang, Pelemhang, Malang and Samarinda. The total estimated cost of
consultants' services will be $1.3 million.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
1.        This Annex describes the current government administrative struc-
ture related to the project. The GOI has established a National Urban
Development Corporation (NUDC) and a National Mortgage Bank (NMB) to handle
a national program of sites and services development and other housing and
infrastructure programs. Although ultimate responsibility for national urban
policies rests with the National Economic Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), it is
Cipta Karya 1/ which prepares general urban policy recommendations with
guidance from the National Housing Authority, and subsequently coordinates
the implementation of BAPPENAS approved policies.
A. National Level
National Housing Authority
2.        Broad guidelines pursuant to establishing national housing policy
originate with the National Housing Authority. This body, consisting largely
of Cabinet Ministers, is chaired by the Minister for Economic, Monetary and
Industrial Affairs, one of two super-Ministers who share supervisory responsi-
bility over several ministries and report directy to the President. Members
of the Authority include: the Vice-Chairman of BAPPENAS; the Minister of
Public Works; the Minister of Finance; the Minister of the Interior; the
Minister of Social Affairs; the Minister of Health; the Minister of Indus-
tries, Labor and Transmigration; and the Governor of the Bank of Indonesia.
The executive Secretary of the Authority is the Director-General of Cipta
Karya, and the staff at Cipta Karya constitutes the Secretariat of the
Authority.
Cipta Karya
3.        Cipta Karya is the principal agency at the national level respon-
sible for developing housing programs responsive to guidance from the National
Housing Authority. Within the Directorate-General of Cipta Karya there are
1/ Cipta Karya is the Directorate-General in the Ministry of Public
Works and Electric Power responsible for housing, building, urban
and regional planning, and sanitation, building and materials
research.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
five divisions, each responsible for different aspects of housing and its
related services. The divisions are: People's Housing, Planning; Sanita-
tion; and Building Materials Research. Cipta Karya assists provincial and
muncipal government agencies involved in public works infrastructure, hous-
ing programs, and regional planning by providing technical advice. Of
approximately 2,900 persons employed by Cipta Karya, some 200 have university
degrees in civil engineering or architecture. The present Director-General
is a senior engineer who has successfully organized and executed several
urban programs.  The division of People's Housing will take over from the
NUDC responsibility for planning and coordinating a National program of
'-.mpung improvement.
National Urban Development Corporation (NUDC)
4.        To undertake the acquisition and development of urban land prima-
rily to benefit middle and low-income families on a sound commercial basis,
the Central Government establised in 1974, a National Urban Development
Corporation (NUDC). From time to time the NUDC may establish branch office
operations in cities that do not have real estate development agencies capa-
ble of planning and executing projects. The NUDC has authority to buy land
and hold title with the right of administration, right of building and right
of use. This land will be developed for sale or rental as residential,
commercial or industrial sites.
5.        As its charter indicates, the NUDC will be responsible for executing
urban projects in the fields of housing and physical infrastructure consistent
with Government policy directives. To fulfill its obligations, the NUDC will
prepare project plans, organize project financing, execute or supervise the
implementation of projects, and administer and regulate the sale of leasing
of developed land and housing. The Corporation is structured as a finan-
cially autonomous agency empowered to borrow in the private market, as well
as receive foreign investment capital in order to finance its projects.
During Repelita II, GOI plans to provide Rp 24 billion ($60 million) for
housing, most of which would be channeled through NUDC. The working capital
would be increased with profits from project undertakings, loans and grants
from domestic and foreign sources, and the sale of NUDC bonds. Sources of
income to NUDC will be revenue from the administration, sale and/or rental
of the land, housing, and infrastructure it develops. Net profits of the
NUDC will be utilized largely to expand the general corporation budget.
6.        Because the NUDC is organized as a perum, administration policy
direction for the NUDC will come from the Minister of Public Works through
the Directorate-General of Cipta Karya. On behalf of the Minister, a
Board of Supervisors consisting of three members oversees NUDC operations;
one of these supervisors is the Director-General of Cipta Karya. The NUDC
will be controlled by a Board of Directors headed by a Managing Director
assisted by the Director for Planning and Programming, a Director for



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Finance and Administration, a Director for Construction, and a Director
for Estate Management. Detailed staff functions and operating procedures
are being developed with technical assistance provided to the Managing
Director as part of the Loan (1040-IND) and further support will be pro-
vided under the second project.
B. Provincial Level
7.        The project will be executed in Jakarta and in Surabaya where the
local government will be responsible for the Kampung Improvement Program
(KIP). Operational responsibility will rest with the Manager of the KIP
unit in each city. The KIP Program Manager will be responsible for super-
vising the selection of kampungs, planning contracting, accounting, evaluation
and long-term development of the kampungs based on ultimate land use potential
and desired infrastructure standards. Technical assistance for engineering and
accounting expertise will be provided to the KIP offices from the consultants
attached to Cipta Karya. Program accounts will be kept separately from other
provincial accounts.
Present KIP Operational Procedures
8.        An acceptable procedure has been already established in Jakarta
and in Surabaya for ranking the kampungs after they have been determined to
be eligible, and selecting the specific kampungs to be improved each year.
Proposals for priority working of specific kampungs can be generated from
the community level and proposed by the local Lurah or Camat (district
officers) to the five mayors (Walikota) who pass them to the City Planning
Board. Individual kampungs are then evaluated and improvement programs
initiated. The following sequence which has been established in Jakarta
will serve as a model, with suitable modifications for Surabaya.
9.        In August, the DKI City Planning Department (Tatakota) is instructed
to commence the preparation of a planning inventory of socio-economic and
physical conditions in kampungs which have been selected as suitable for im-
provement. This inventory is prepared from information given by the Lurah
and Camat supplemented by spot checks in the field. The results of the sur-
vey are presented in tabular form and also visually on a 1:2000 Scale Map.
Based on this information the KIP unit, in conjunction with Tatakota, pre-
pares a rough plan for future development of the kampungs, and an outline
plan for immediate improvements to agreed planning and design standards.
This outline plan is discussed in a planning session usually held in October
with the Camat and other leaders under the chairmanship of the Project Manager
of KIP Unit. Agreement is reached on road lines, footpaths, water points,
possible school sites, and also on the number of houses which need to be
cut or removed to make way for roads or schools. Following the successful
conclusion of the planning session, the KIP unit instruct Tatakota to pre-
pare a topographic survey of the kampung which is carried out from existing
plans, aerial photographs and field surveys, whilst the camat makes prelimi-
nary arrangements for release of the land and for housing the people who will



ANNEX 6
Page 4
be dispossessed. The KIP unit consults other Departments of DKI at all
stages of development of the plan, under the general guidance of DKI
Deputy Governor responsible for coordination. The project preparation
work is carried out by KIP unit staff who have been drawn originally from
other DKI departments and are now consolidated into the KIP unit. There
have been considerable advantages in building up the project unit in this
way especially in the reduction of coordination problems with other depart-
ments and the minimization of the management problem of delegation of
responsibility for specific works. Following the preparation of the topo-
graphic survey, the KIP unit prepares the project work including preliminary
costing in each kampung and submits it to another planning session with the
camat where it is approved with or without changes. The locally approved
plans and cost estimates are submitted to the Governor of DKI for approval
by decree in November of each year. After the Governor has issued a decree,
the KIP unit begins the preparation of detailed design and tender documents,
a budget allocation for the next financial year is requested, camat begins
to obtain clearance of rights of way for roads, canals and footpaths, and
the DKI Public Works Department (DPO) survey elevations in the kampungs.
10.       From December onwards, the KIP unit prepares detailed engineering
designs based on the topographic survey prepared by Tatakota and existing
elevations surveyed by DPU. Tender documents are drawn up consisting of
drawings, bills of quantities, specification and outline form of contract
and once DKI budget has been approved (generally at the end of March) con-
tractors from a DKI prequalification list are invited to bid on a competi-
tive basis. The content of a contract generally covers a variety of work
including roads, footpaths, water supply and buildings. Previously, problems
with synchronization of activity had occurred when separate contracts were
let for specific works only. The contracts are awarded by the project
manager of the KIP unit and generally take up to one year to complete in-
cluding the work guarantee period. Supervisor of the works is split between
the Camat who is designated the site manager and is responsible for smoothing
out problems caused by the works and the KIP unit whose staff acts as
technical assistants to the Camat controlling quality and the cost of the
works. Contractors prepare the bills for payment against work done which
is initially checked by camat's staff. The bills are passed then to KIP
unit where further checks are carried out by senior engineers and adminis-
trators who also monitor construction and program expenditures. After final
checking by the project manager, authorization for payment is passed to the
DKI Directorate of Finance which makes the actual payment to the contractor.
On an approximately monthly basis these bills will be passed to Cipta Karya
for reimbursement under the proposed IBRD Loan.
Community Organization
11.       In Indonesia, the traditional (adat) community structure is allied
with the governmental structure and, as such, is potentially the most effec-
tive means of executing and monitoring the project at a local level. Govern-
ment administration in DKI has five mayoral districts: the city is divided



ANNEX 6
Page 5
into 27 Kecamatans, each headed by a Camat (district chief) and 227 Kelurahans,
each headed by a Lurah (sub-district chief). Camats and Lurahs are appointed
to their offices by the Governor. Each Kelurahan has between 50,000 and
45,000 people who are subdivided into two levels of community groups. An RW
contains about 150 families and an RT, the smallest unit, averages about 30
families. Each RT and RW is headed by a man who lives in the group; he is
not a civil servant, but works at some other occupation. The functions of the
RT and RW, as representatives of their communities, are to organize coopera-
tive community efforts to build local roads, footpaths and drainage, to organize
garbage disposal and to organize festivities. As government representatives,
they are charged with registering incoming and outgoing residents and visitors,
reporting to the Lurah on community activities and keeping peace in the area.
The Lurah has a small staff to collect statistical information for the Govern-
ment from the RWs and RTs in his area. He is involved with infrastructre,
community services and Kampung Improvement Programs being built in this area.
The Kampung Committee
12.       Under the present program arrangement in Jakarta, committees at the
kampung level are directly involved in planning, execution and maintenance of
KIP works executed in each kampung. There is an organization at the kampung
level which organizes self-help labor and collects money for kampung main-
tenance work and distributes money to help residents displaced by KIP. The
Kampung Committees are composed of the Lurah's staff, the Vice-Lurah, RWs
and RTs, all of whom live in the kampungs. Their function is to establish
the priorities for improvement reflecting the views of the kampung residents.
They respond to official proposals concerning the balance of social and phys-
ical infrastructure, location of roads, footpaths, communal sanitary facil-
ities, schools and health centers, alternatives on the removal and the reloca-
tion of households and collections and expenditures of compensation monies.
Instructions to kampung residents on the use of the facilities and organiza-
tion of maintenance would be a continuing element of their work. In cases
where the KIP necessitates the removal of more than half a house, the Commit-
tee sees that the displaced families are relocated to one of the sites and
services projects at government expense.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MUNICIPAL BUDGET DATA
A. Jakarta
1.        In Jakarta, municipal revenues from all sources for FY75-76 are
estimated to be Rp 55.7 billion representing an increase of 26% over reven-
ues from the previous year. For the five years between 1970-71 and 1975-76
inclusive, total municipal revenues have increased at an average annual rate
of approximately 40% per year. This represents a significant increase in
real terms as total revenues have increased fivefold while the Jakarta price
index has increased by 150% during the same period. Property tax revenues
(the IPEDA tax) have grown at an even faster rate, with an average annual
rate of growth of 52% since 1970. The smallest increase during the period,
16%, occurred in the last year. The largest sources of local revenues are
taxes and fees on automobiles which account for about 23% and the casino tax
which accounts for aproximately 15% of total revenue. Subsidies and sub-
ventions from the central government are distributed to local goverments on
a formula basis and represent roughly 40% of DKI revenues. Tables I and 2
of this annex show revenues and expenditures of the DKI over a 6-year period,
and Table 3 projects revenues and expenditures over a 10-year period.
B. Surabaya
2.        In Surabaya total municipal revenues have grown at a compound
annual rate of 25%. As in Jakarta, IPEDA revenues which grew at a rate of
55% per year grew at a faster rate than total revenues. The IPEDA accounts
for approximately 7% of total revenues and is about equal in importance to
gambling as a source of revenue. Tables 4 and 5 contain historical budget
data for the years 1972-73 and 1975-76 and Table 6 projects the Surabaya
budget for 10 years.

72   Actually realized.
73- Inflation rate assumed 18 percent for 1976/77, then 15 percent till
1980 and 10 percent till 1985/86.
A    Assuming annual rate of real increase is 10 percent based on 7 percent
real growth rate in national GDP, 2 percent average national population
growth and 5 percent average Surabaya population growth during
1961-1971 period.
/5   Assumed to grow at same rate as annual real growth of national GDP of
7 percent (based on 1969-72 average).
/6 First IBRD loan to Surabaya will be completely disbursed by 1979/80;
however we assume the continuation of KIP program with further loans
with disbursement rate same as first loan.
/7   This recommended gross increase include 18-15 percent inflation rate
till 1980 and 10% after, and 5 percent population increase rate.
Increases in property values, assessment factor and collection rates
are assumed to provide for real growth in per capita about 15% per year.
/8 Assumed to gradually taper down to 5 percent real increase after 1980/81.
E: .Servicing the debt of possible future loans would start around that time,
assumed to be similar to conditions of the first loan (9 percent interest,
20 years including 3 years grace period, with annual disbursement rate
of Rp 1.5 billion for 3 years).
/10 Real increase in expenditure development budget assumed to be more than
that of routine budget. This is expected due to major investments in
water supply, sewerage, transport that are being programmed to occur in
the next decade.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
1.        The economic justification of the proposed upgrading of kampungs
based on an acounting of the principal benefit and cost streams discounted
. r 17 years for each of the two locations, Surabaya and Jakarta. Benefits
are calculated using estimates of increases in property values in the im-
proved kampungs. Costs include construction, engineering and supervision
(technical assistance) and operations and maintenance for roads, paths,
drainage, water supply, waste disposal. Following normal practice, the
schools, clinics and health programs were omitted from this analysis.
2.        In addition, two separate analyses were conducted to establish  a
more direct link between productivity and expenditures on health/environ-
mental sanitation and also on schools. These additional analyses involved
answering the following question: "What minimum percentage increase in
average productivity would have to occur in order to justify the components
at a 15% cut-off rate of return?" The analysis of the health/environmental
sanitation expenditures overlaps for the most part with the standard economic
analysis that employs increased property values as a measure of benefits,
and is provided to offer additional insights into the productivity aspects of
the project. The analysis of the education component is independent of the
other analyses and is offered as an attempt to provide some quantification
that would assist in judging the merits of this component. The two additional
tests, while they do not result in an estimate of a rate of return, do pro-
vide a useful measure of the reasonableness of the project components.
A. Rate of Return in Using Property
Value Increases as a Measure of Benefits
Benefit Valuation
3.        The difference between the rate of increase of property values in
those kampungs that have been upgraded and in others which have not been
upgraded is a measure of the willingness of property owners to pay for the
higher levels of infrastructure and for other improvements in the upgraded
kampungs. This measure includes the direct increase in the value of the
site itself due to the provision of water, sanitation, garbage collection,
and access by vehicle and foot, as well as the induced increase in the value
of the structure on the site due to accelereated home improvement by residents.



ANNEX 9

Probably it does not include other project benefits on which, property owners
may not place a market value because (1) they are imperfectly perceived, such
as increases in an individual's own labor productivity due to improved drain-
age, sanitation and education facilities; (2) they are perceived as external,
such as increases in the productivity of neighboring unimproved kampungs due
to better health, drainage and sanitation facilities in the improved kampungs,
which also relieve poor conditions in the nearby kampungs.
Effect of KIP on Property Values
4.        Information was available in both Surabaya and Jakarta on changes
in sales prices of property in the year immediately following kampung improve-
ment. Before and after data on lot sale prices per square meter was provided
by local officials (Lurahs) for lots on main roads, on footpaths, and without
direct access in a total of 15 improved and 10 unimproved kampungs in East,
North, and South Surabaya, including data on 6 of the 8 unimproved kampungs
included in a priority list for the Surabaya program.
5.        The increase over a year in sale price levels for lots in the same
access category was compared as between improved and unimproved lots and the
difference was taken as a measure of the additional increase in value due to
the infrastructure (improvement of existing paths and roads, addition of
water, drainage, sanitation, garbage collection). For each area of the city,
the average annual increases (1974-75) in prices per square meter of property
in improved and unimproved kampungs were compared and an average net increase
due to KIP improvements for the kampungs to be upgraded was calculated, using
as weights the percent distribution of hectares to be upgraded in each area.  2
The data are shown in the table below.  A single average value of Rp 2,174.8/m
(1975 prices) was obtained as a measure of the average increase in land values
in the kampungs to be improved in Surabaya.
6.        Comparable data on kampungs in Jakarta that have been improved during
the years 1974-76 KIP were available. However, similarly up-to-date data on
unimproved kampungs in Jakarta was not available and it was necessary instead
to use data on changes in property values in unimproved kampujngs observed in
the period 1970-72. This produced an estimate of Rp 1,771/m (1975 prices) as
an estimate of the average increase in land values attributable to the project.

ANNEX 9
Page 5
Calculation of Benefits
7.        The average figures for net average property value changes for
Surabaya and Jakarta were applied to the total net residential area (80%
of total area to be developed) designated for improvement in each of the
3 project years to obtain a value for the projects' benefits. These values
were adjusted to convert 1975 prices into 1976 prices, consistent with cost
estimates.  Benefits are assumed to accrue as a one-time increase in property
values -occurring in the year following completion of improvements.
Cost Estimates
8.        Capital, Operating and Maintenance Costs.  In both Surabaya and
Jakarta, infrastructure costs (except schools and clinics), including con-
struction costs plus design and supervision (technical assistance) have been
used, valued at January 1976 prices. Annual operating and maintenance costs
have been expressed as a percentage of capital costs, and are assumed to
recur over the 17-year life of the project. The annual costs chargeable to
the project are 2% of capital costs for roads and 1% of capital costs for
footpaths. These figures are half of those one might normally assume for
total operation and maintenance; however, it is not correct to assess the
total of these costs to the project but rather just those that otherwise
would not occur. Since no information is available on the maintenance costs
in non-improved kampungs, it is assumed that half are due to the improved
standards.
9.        Induced Private Investment.  One of the effects of the project is
to stimulate further private investment by homeowners in house improvements
following the upgrading of kampungs.
10.       Based on experience in the Philippines, it is estimated that over
a period of about 5 to 20 years, private investment amounting to 20% of infra-
structure investment might be induced. Part of the benefits attributable to
the project arise from this induced private investment. For purposes of the
analysis it was assumed that 15% of the households who would eventually in-
vest privately has already done so during the sampling period, and there-
fore the cost stream was augmented by the resulting expenditures (amounting
to 3% of infrastructure investment) to take this into acount. Additional
private expenditures (and additional benefits) would be expected to occur
during the period beyond one year after construction, but for simplicity
these were ignored.
11.       Other Costs.  The cost for relocating people and compensating them
for their lost property in cash or communal arrangements has been estimated
at 13% of the capital costs.



ANNEX 9
Page 6
12.       The disturbance to the kampung residents during the construction
period is assumed to be equal to one-half year's benefits, with a year's
benefits taken to be 16.% of total benefits as calculated above.
13.       Summary of Calculations.  The costs and benefit streams associated
with the Jakarta and Surabaya KIP programs are shown below with the resulting
internal economic rates of return.

B. Evaluation of Health-Related Components
Increases in Time Worked and Productivity as a Measure of Benefits
14.       Paving footpaths, providing drainage canals, improving water
supply and human and solid waste disposal, providing clinics and initiating
a health program in the kampungs will all directly improve the health levels
of residents. Aside from the resulting improvement in the quality of life,
residents will benefit by being physically able to be more productive at work
and to work more days. Both these work-related impacts of infrastructure
investment will be reflected in higher output per workers and higher wages
earned.
15.       There is no data available from earlier KIP experience on the in-
creases in output of emploved kampung residents due to health-related KIP
improvements. Even if such data were available, using it as a basis for
evaluating the benefits of this project would imply an under-estimation due
to the greater emphasis on health improvement in this project compared to
earlier KIP investment.
16.       Therefore, a very rough indication of the economic viability of
these health-related components may be obtained by calculating the recurrent
increase in annual income (following some lapse of time necessary for health
levels to stabilize) required to assure a 15% rate of return to the health-
related cost components. The health costs haver been compared to imputed
increases in income due both to fewer work days lost for illness and to
increased productivity on the job.
17.       Health-Related Cost Components.  Capital, operating and maintenance
costs and technical assistance as described above (para 16) are included for
all infrastructure except roads and schools, e.g., footpaths, drainage canals,
water supply, human waste disposal, solid waste disposal and health clinics.
The cost of garbage trucks, health programs and land for clinics, has also
been included. These costs account for 60% of total project costs net of
price escalation.
18.       Imputed Income Benefits.  Benefits are assumed to build up in every
year until the project's sixth year (a period chosen to reflect the project's
three year construction period plus an assumed three-year growth in health
benefits) after which these benefits are assumed to stabilize.
19.       The results are arrived at by comparing (1) the minimum recurrent
benefit in years 1-40 sufficient to create a 15% rate of return when paired
with the cost stream defined above. The existing median household income in



ANNEX 9
Page 8
the areas to be upgraded, is about Rp 22,500 per household per month for
Jakarta. Since the existing total annual income in the 3,000 ha to be
upgraded is about Rp 64.8 billion, a 6% increase in time worked, or a
lesser increase in time worked coupled with greater productivity on the
job, would be enough to justify the project's health-related components.
Similarly in Surabaya, where the existing total annual income is about
Rp 10.8 million, a 2.5% increase in output would suffice. This is
equivalent to about 15 days worked in Jakarta and 6 in Surabaya for
persons employed full time (250 days).
20c       These increases are very modest, and in fact, benefits are
expecced to far exceed these levels. For example, analysis conducted for
the appraisal of a proposed Bank financed project in Karachi, Pakistan
based on studies of the impacts of such investments has indicated that in
fact, an increase of up to 25% could be expected from either the improved
productivity or the increased work attendance which follows, health-related
investments.

C. Evaluation of Education Component: Jakarta
21.       A 1974 report of the International Labor Organization (ILO) titled
Urbanization and Employment in Jakarta (Working Paper No. 6, World Employ-
ment Programme Research), argues that the decline in the school participa-
tion rate for children below 15 years of age during the last decade in
Jakarta suggests a need for "immediate measures to promote school participa-
tion at the primary level, as well as to encourage non-formal education
beyond that" (pages 8 & 12).
22.       The 90 new schools to be built as part of this project will each
accommodate 585 students or 52,650 students per year who would not other-
wise have received schooling. If capital (including land costs) and
operation costs over the 17-year lifetime of the buildings are combined
with the cost of income foregone by these primary school attenders and
the cost of fees to their parents, the resulting total cost stream can be
compared with an imputed benefits stream, consisting of additional earnings
over the lifetime of the individuals receiving primary education. This
benefits strteam is calculated as the percentage increase in an estimated
aggregate 40-year income stream for all individuals leaving the school over
its 17-year life, had they not received schooling (e.g., assuming lifelong
employment in the informal sector or in other very low wage occupations), re-
quired to assure a 15% rate of return to the education costs mentioned
above 1/.
23.       Using this very crude approach, with data from the ILO report,
we find that a 12% increase in aggregate lifetime earnings of the students
attending these schools would be sufficient to justify the project's educa-
tion component and other costs incurred by families who send their children
to school.
D. Summary of Economic Analysis
24.       The economic analysis is based on the assumption that benefits to
the site occupants are reflected in increased property values, which may
only partly reflect benefits from improved health. This implies that the
calculated economic rate of return understates the real return. The return
for the Surabaya component is over 100% and for the Jakarta component is 59%.
In the supplementary exercises to relate the health and education components
to productivity, it was found that productivity of present kampung workers
in Jakarta would have to increase by about 6% (about 15 more days worked
per year) to assure a 15% internal rate of return to the Jakarta health
1/ Social internal rates of return to primary schooling in the cities
of seven developing countries range from 16 to 38 percent.

component (2.5% for Surabaya), and that productivity of the primary school
children to be enrolled in the 80 new schools in Jakarta over their
working lives would have to increase by about 12% to justify the cost of
the education component, including childrens' earnings foregone and school
fees paid.
