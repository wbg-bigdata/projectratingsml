                      carry forward the objectives o fthe first operation, helping the
                      RGoB: (a) enhance the delivery o fpublic services by strengthening
                      fiscal management, (b) increase the effectiveness o fpublic spending
                      by improving financial management andprocurementprocesses, (c)
                      create better income earning opportunities by improvingthe
                      investment climate, facilitating greater labor market flexibility, and
                      increasingforeign direct investment, (d) raise educational
                      attainment, particularly inpreviously under served areas, by
                      expanding access to highquality education services, and (e) reduce
                      maternal mortality by increasing the number o fbirths delivered in
                      health facilities.
 Benefits             Project benefitsrelate closely to the above objectives and to the
                      PRSP, supported by the Bank's CAS: reducingpoverty through
                      better service delivery (especially in education and health),
                      promoting private sector-based growth and employment generation,
                      and ensuring good governance. Ina generally well-managed
                      country like Bhutan, which i s already malung good progress in
                      development and reforms, and which i s on-track for achieving most
                      o f the MDGs, the expected benefits o f DPG2 in supporting the
                      government's program and further progress are substantial.
 Risks                The mainrisks that needto be managed relate to: (a) political
                      uncertainty stemmingfrom the transition to democracy -mitigated
                      bythe government's carefulpreparationand consultationon the
                      new governance arrangements; (b) external shocks resulting from
                      the lack o f economic diversification -mitigatedby strengthening
                      public expenditure management as well as efforts to foster private
                      sector development; and (c) capacity constraints due to the small
                      scale o f government -mitigatedby the government's ongoing
                      capacity buildingefforts (inmany areas supported by development
                      Dartners).

                  FORA PROPOSEDSECONDDEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
                                       TO THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN


                                             I. INTRODUCTION


1.    The Royal Government o f Bhutan (RGoB) continues to make good progress on its medium-term
program o f policy and institutional reforms, and i s seelung a Second Development Policy Grant
(DPG2) from the World Bank to support these efforts.' This follows on from the First Development
Policy Grant (DPG1) presented to the World Bank Board inM a y 2006.

2.    The RGoB is on-track for meeting the triggers previously identified as indicative for moving
forward with DPG2, and in several areas, initiatives are moving farther and faster than expected.*
The Bank's agreement to advance processing o f a larger than previously programmed amount for
DPG2 also reflects a desire to support the RGoB's important reform efforts during a time o f major
changes for Bhutan vis-a-vis governance, social development, and the economy. The RGoB has
emphasized that strong donor support i s especially important duringthis period o f transition toward a
system o f democratic governance. The RGoB aims to promote continuity and help provide a good
foundation for the first elected government through the reform program, and the proposed DPG2
seeks to assist the RGoB inmeeting these objectives.

3.     Later than anticipated commissioning o f the large Tala hydropower project, combined with
other factors, means that the resource envelope may not, in the short term, be expanding as much as
previously anticipated. The proposed grant would provide US$12 million in budget support to help
the RGoB sustain the expenditures needed to meet its ambitious development goals.

4.     Consistent with the goals and strategies articulated in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP) and
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the proposed DPG2 selectively supports five components
o f the RGoB's reform program. These are expanded from DPGl to highlight the strengthening of
fiduciary systems, including procurement. The five component areas are:

     a)     Ensuringthe maintenance o f a sound macroeconomic framework and strengthening fiscal
            policy;

     b)     Bolstering fiduciary systems inthe areas o f financial management and procurement;

     c)     Enhancing the investment climate for private sector growth and employment generation;

     d)     Augmenting the quality o f and access to education; and

     e)     Improving healthcare utilization.



  Bhutanis an IDA only country and qualifies for 100percent grants in FY07 because (i) ratio of the present value of
                                                                                               the
external debt to GDP exceeds the threshold value of 50 percent, and (ii)     the ratio o f the present value o f external debt to
exports i s more than the threshold value o f 200 percent. Bhutan's IDA allocation in FY07 and FY08 is about US15.7
million in each year, but as small state with a population o f less than 1.5 million, Bhutancan cumulatively frontload up to
80% of its overall IDA14 indicative allocation. The actual allocation for FY08 and whether Bhutan will again qualify for
grants will depend on a number of factors, including country performance and the findings o f a more complete debt
sustainability analysis.
 DPGl was a grant inthe amount of US$15 million; DPG2was originally programmed for US$5 million inthe 2005 CAS,
but at the request of the RGoBit was increasedto US$12million.
                                                               1

5.     The 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) highlightsthe role o f development policy lending
inhelping the RGoB address capacity constraints and sustain momentum on technically demanding
institutional and policy reforms, which require many years to i m ~ l e m e n t . ~The program i s
commensurate with the existing technical capacity and circumstances inthe country, and i s gathering
pace and depth. The envisaged support would also follow the CAS emphasis on selectivity, focusing
the Bank's limited resources on areas where they can have the greatest impact.

6.     The proposed DPG2 i s the second o f two operations programmed in the 2005 CAS, but with
lessons learned, further operations (as part o f a new series) could be processed ifboth the RGoB and
the Bank continue to find this an effective mode o f supporting development in Bhutan. Finally,
Bhutan i s a high performer, having the second highest IDA Country Performance Rating o f all IDA
countries in 2005.4 The DPG operations also reflect a growing trend among Bhutan's development
partners toward providing budget support. In part, this i s a function o f increasing confidence in
national fiduciary systems. Bhutan's commitment to overall good governance and the advantages
brought to the country by a well-trained and dedicated civil service have fostered sound development
o f country systems.

7.     The next section provides an update on key aspects o f the transition currently underway,
highlighting governance, human development, and the economy. Section Illdiscusses Bhutan's
distinctive development approach, anchored in the 9FYP, which i s coming to a close, and the Tenth
Five-Year Plan (IOFYP), currently under preparation. Section IV reviews the Bank's assistance to
Bhutan, and collaboration with other development partners. Section V describes the medium-tern
program being undertaken by the RGoB and the expected outcomes from the various initiatives.
Section VI discusses the implementation arrangements o f the proposed operation.



                                  11.     BHUTANINTRANSITION

8.     Bhutan i s a small, sparsely populated, landlocked and mountainous kingdom in the eastern
Himalayas (between China and India) that i s in the midst o f a period o f major change. Governance
structures and institutions are being developed and strengthened toward the adoption in 2008 o f a
system o f democratic governance. Despite the geographical dispersion o f the population, estimated
at 672,425 in the country's first full census carried out in 2005, social development indicators are
showing strong gains, with rapid modernization and improvements in public services, particularly in
urban areas. Economically, this period i s also one o f significant dynamism, where a ten-year effort
to construct the Tala hydropower project, at a cost o f over 120 percent o f GDP, culminated in the
commissioning o f the project in July 2006. Tala brings a major impetus to the economy, and
building on an average real GDP growth rate o f around 6 percent over the past two decades, per




  The Bhutan CAS (World Bank: Country Assistance Strategy for the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Period FY06-FY09,
ReportNo. 33704-BT,September 28,2005) was discussedby the BoardonNovember 1,2005.
  The main factor that determines the allocation o f IDA resources among eligible countries i s each country's
performance inimplementing policies that promote economic growth and poverty reduction. This i s assessedby
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). To fully underscore the role o f the CPIA in the IDA
Performance Based Allocations, the overall country score is referred to as the IDA Resource Allocation Index
(IRAI). In addition to the IRAI, portfolio performance and governance also feature in the allocation process.
Together, the IRAI, portfolio performance and governance constitute the IDA Country Performance Rating
(CPR). Inaddition to the CPR, population andper capita income also determine IDA allocations. (Taken from:

capita income i s expected to exceed US$1,500 in 2006/07, well within lower middle-income level^.^
The people of Bhutan appear well positioned to negotiate the challenges and opportunities of these
changes.


GOVERNANCEARRANGEMENTS


9.    After 34 years on the throne, the Fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, stepped down on
December 9,2006 in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the FifthKing o f Bhutan.
An official coronation ceremony will be heldin2008, as originally announced in2005 by the Fourth
King, when the country holds its first democratic elections and anew government i s formed.

10. The FourthKinginitiated a profound change inBhutan's governance arrangements, steering the
country toward a system of `dynamic two-party' democratic governance as of 2008. Nationwide
elections will be held every five years, for which any number o f qualified political parties may
compete in an initial runoff to determine which two with the most popular support will contest a
national election. The role of the kingwill shift to that of a constitutionalmonarch.

11. The final draft of the Constitution has been completed, marlung the end of a process ledby the
Chief Justice and involving widespread public consultations within Bhutan, and with the
international community (Box 1). The June 2007 session of the National Assembly could be the last
under the current structure. Non-partisan elections for the upper house (National Council) are likely
to take place in the autumn of 2007, consisting of one person from each o f the 20 dzongkhags, plus
five eminent persons appointed by the King. Parliamentary elections are likely to be held in early
2008 in order that a government may be in place prior to the coronation of the fifth lung and
celebrations marking the centenary of the monarchy. The registration of new political parties began
inthe first half of 2007. Already, a number of civil servants have resigned from their positions, or
made known their intention to do so, in order to join a political party, as civil servants are barred
fromjoining political parties with a view to avoidingpoliticization of the civil service.

12. The draft Constitution seeks to promote good governance, and in early 2006, three independent
constitutional bodies were established, which are essential for the planned adoption of the
Constitution in 2008. These are the Office o f the Auditor General, the Anti-Corruption Commission,
and the Election Commission. The Heads of these institutions are independent of the executive and
report directly to the National Assembly. The Chief Election Commissioner assumed office in
January 2006.

13. Building upon the `Good Governance' reform process started in 1999, the `Good Governance
Plus' process of additional reform measures was initiated in 2005. The main pillars o f the Good
Governance agenda are: (i)         anti-corruption; (ii)national security and good governance; (iii) role   the
of ICT; (iv) the role of the media; and (v) the role of civil society.




  The move from low income status (per capita income below US$875 by the World Bank's classificationsystem) to low
middle income status (per capita incomebetweenUS$876and US$3,465 is drivenby a strong-rise in GDP due to Tala, but
also due to a revision in the estimatedpopulation. The World Development Indicatorsare inthe process of updating their
figures from a previously estimated population 918,000 in 2005, to reflect the results of the first nationwide census
conductedwith UNassistance in2005, showingthepopulationto be significantly lower at 672,425.

  The preservation o f the hereditary monarchy, with the power to appoint the justices, the
  election commissioner, the heads o f the defense forces, and the head o f the anti-corruption
  commission, among others, all upon the recommendation of the prime minister or other
- government institutions;
  The elaboration o f the circumstances under which the parliament can require the abdication o f
. the rulingmonarch (in favor o f the next heir apparent);
  The affirmation that Buddhismi s the spiritual heritage o f Bhutan to be promoted by religious
. institutions, while ensuring that religion remains separate from politics;
  The conservation and sustainable use o f the environment, including the maintenance o f 60
  percent o f the country's area under forest cover inperpetuity;
  The declaration o f fundamental rights (freedom o f speech, religion, press, and assembly,
  among others);

-.
1 The promotion o f Gross National Happiness by the state (among other endeavors);

  The convening o f a Parliament, consisting o f the Monarch, the National Council, and the
  National Assembly;
  The election o f the National Assembly, comprising 75 members (assembling at least twice a
..year);
  The meeting o frecurrent expenditures from internalresources;
- The maintenance o f internationalreserves equivalent to one year's imports;
  The representation in the National Assembly by two political parties, determined after a
  `primary round' o f voting with the two parties winning the most votes being declared `the' two
  parties;
  The circumstances under which parties may be dissolved by the Supreme Court;

1 The formation o f an anti-comption commission;

1 The amendment o f the Constitution, requiring a majority o f at least three-fourths o f the total
  number of members of Parliament.



The Good Governance Plus agenda places increased emphasis on monitoring and evaluation o f
reforms. Some of the key recommendations to emerge from the process include:


  0   Enacting enabling legislation before 2008, such as an Election Act, a Public Election FundAct,
       a Civil Service Act, a Local Government Act, an Anti-Corruption Act, an Audit Act, an
       Attorney General Act, an NGO Act, a Property Act, a Contract Law, a Public Finance Act, a
       Labor Act, as well as preparing Rules o f Procedure for Parliament (including a Code o f
       Conduct for Parliamentarians).

      Clarifying the functions and mandate o f government institutions, and sharpening accountability
      mechanisms.



                                                    4

      Integrating the preparation o f a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) into the budget
      process, and using the MTFF to underpin the `Alternative Planning Framework' to bolster
      linksbetween goals andprojections o fresource availability.

      Using an open and competitive selection process for the post o f CEO in state-owned
      enterprises.

   0  Establishinga single window system to improve public service delivery.


   0  Fostering an independent media, strong civil society organizations, and greater use o f
      information technologies, in order to increase the transparency and accountability o f the
      government and underpin anti-conuption efforts.

14. Several o f these recommendations have already been implemented, including the passage o f the
Anti-conuption Act, the Audit Act, and the Information Communication and Media Act (a second
newspaper was established in 2006), as well as the use o f a competitive process for selecting the
CEOs o f state-owned enterprises. These acts aim at strengthening the system of checks and balances.

15. Overall, there i s a strong commitment from RGoB leaders to move forward with governance
reforms. Stakeholders are aware o f associated risks, but these are being managed through deliberate
and careful reflection, consultation, and decision-malung for a smooth transition to democracy while
strengthening the basis for accountability, transparency and good governance. It i s also worth noting
that recent and planned governance changes also bring great opportunities. For example, the draft
Constitution guarantees freedom o f expression and freedom o f media. These would enable the media
to play a meaningfulrole not only ingovernance but also inthe broader functioning o f society.


SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

16. Bhutan i s characterized by solid progress in human development and modernization,
particularly in urban areas, and the increasing availability and use o f public services throughout the
country. However, these changes have been slower to reach the more remote, hard-to-reach areas
due to the rugged terrain and limited trained human resources. The challenges posed by the co-
existence o f these two contrasting realities are clearly evident with respect to the country's
epidemiological profile. Longer life expectancy due to improved living conditions, and changing life
styles, particularly inurban areas, has led to an increase innon-communicable and chronic conditions
including cancer and cardiovascular problems. At the same time, communicable diseases and peri-
natal difficulties remain significant in more remote areas. While the RGoB has made good progress
on ensuring the adequate provision o f public services for all Bhutanese, this double burden o f disease
i s a major challenge. In general, social development has been significant, given the difficult terrain
and wide dispersion o f the population.

17. While recent studies show that income poverty i s a reality, Bhutan does not face many o f the
same poverty-related issues prevalent throughout much o f South Asia, such as widespread hunger,
destitution and homelessness. As highlighted in the D P G l program document (Report No. 34713-
BT, March 30, 2006), the pilot Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) o f 2000
constituted an initial effort to quantify poverty in Bhutan at the household level. This was followed
by the Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS) o f 2003, analyzed in the Bhutan Poverty Analysis
Report o f 2004. While statistical issues o f comparability between the HIES and the BLSS limit some
types o f analyses from these two surveys, they nonetheless comprise the best statistics available, and
suggest that poverty i s declining over time.


                                                    5

18. With the overall national poverty line established at Nu.730.36 (US$16.23) per capita monthly,
the 2003 BLSS estimated the poverty headcount rate at about 31.7 percent. On the basis o f the
official population figures from the Population and Housing Census o f 2005, there are an estimated
201,289 poor people inthe country. Poverty i s more widespread and severe inrural areas. Correlated
variables include physical infrastructure, levels o f education and gender o f household heads, and
dependency ratios.

19. The proposed DPG2 operation seeks to strengthen the RGoB's efforts to provide the sound
macroeconomic and fiscal underpinnings for continued steady economic growth. This i s expected to
help improve the quality o f life for all sections o f the population, especially the poor and under-
served. Measures to enhance access to education and health services-with           a special focus on
remote, under-served areas-will       be particularly beneficial for the poor. Efforts to improve the
investment climate for private sector growth and employment generation will create new
opportunities and reduce the dependence o f the poor on agncultural employment.

20. Although data analysis has not been completed, the recent Population and Housing Census o f
Bhutan 2005 provides a basis to assess the status o f several social indicators. The BLSS 2007, which
was fielded in March 2007, will be followed by a consultative workshop in July 2007, and will
provide further indications o fprogress inkey areas o f socio-economic development.

21. The MDGs have been effectively integrated and harmonized into the national development
planning process. The MDG Progress reports o f 2002 and 2005 reflect the RGoB's commitment to
achieving these goals. The lOFYP has poverty reduction as its overall development theme and
objective, and it i s strongly MDG-based.

22. Bhutan i s on track to meet most o f the MDGs. Several targets, such as increasingaccess to safe
drinlung water and safe sanitation, as well as the proportion o f under-weight, under-five children,
have already been achieved (Table 1). Still, there remain significant constraints in terms o f human
and financial resources. A detailed MDGneeds assessment and costing exercise has been initiated to
assess financing, human resources and institutional requirements for the attainment o f the MDGs in
Bhutan.   Preliminary results o f the needs assessment indicate that Bhutan will need to invest
approximately Nu. 122,968 million (US$2.7 billion) between 2005 and 2015 in order to attain its
MDG targets.     Social sector MDG targets collectively comprise 58.6 percent o f the total, while
agnculture and rural development interventions account for 15.9 percent, with gender interventions
comprising 1.2 percent o f the total. The rest o f the non-core MDG interventions collectively
comprise 23.9 percent. Although this implies a need for substantial additional resources, the RGoB
remains committed to ensuring that all Bhutanese benefit from modernized and improved social
services, and that the overall trend toward achieving better outcomes continues.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

23. The economy i s also inthe midst o f a period o f extraordinary dynamism, boosted by the coming
on-stream o f the Tala Hydropower Project. Tala i s expected to be operating at full capacity in June
2007 (when water levels reach their peak during the summer months), after 10 years o f work at an
estimated cost o f Nu. 51 billion (US$1.2 billion          -  including interest during construction).6 This i s
transforming the economic base in Bhutan, and builds on sustained strong economic performance
over the past 25 years, underpinned by sound macroeconomic management, the exploitation o f
hydropower resources, strong donor support, a free trade regime with India, and the ngultrum-rupee
currency peg. As noted above, this combination o f factors i s lifting per capita income into lower-
middle income levels, at about US$1,500 in 2006/07. The macroeconomic framework i s adequate
and the debt burden manageable.

24. After several years o f economic growth o f around 6 percent annually, the tripling o f electricity
production from Tala is expected to propel growth to 17 and 9 percent, respectively, in 2006/07 and
2007/08 (Table 2). Inthe subsequent years, growth i s expected to average 5-8 percent.

25.    Apculture employs about 63 percent o f the workforce but accounts for less than 25 percent o f
GDP. Although some components o f the agnculture sector are doing well (such as horticulture), the
sector overall has been growing slowly in recent years, resulting in a decline in the sector's
contribution to output. Services remain dynamic, ledby tourism. Despite this growth, unemployment
i s an emerging concern. The unemployment rate i s estimated to have increased to 3.1 percent in
2006, compared with 2.5 percent inthe previous year.




  The project was financed by the Government of India, 40 percent loan and 60 percent grant.

26. The current account deficit narrowed from US$211.1 million in 2004/05 to US$20.3 million in
2005/06, due to the strong performance o f exports o f goods and services, and a reduction in imports
from the highlevels associated with the purchase o f aircraft in2004/05. Merchandise exports growth
was robust during 2005/06, increasing by 61.5 percent over the previous year, largely as a result of
the higher electricity tariff being received on sales from Chukha. Tala coming on stream in July
2006 i s raising power exports further, projected to increase by 50 percent in 2006107, and by 120
percent in 2007/08, once Tala i s running at full capacity. India continues to be Bhutan's largest
trading partner, accounting for 88 percent o f merchandise exports and 75 percent o f merchandise
imports in 2005. Bhutan's services account deficit in 2005/06 fell by 91 percent from the previous
year. The export o f travel services grew by 39 percent with convertible currency earnings from
tourism contributing 70 percent to the total services receipts. The import o f services grew at a
marginal rate o f eight percent. Bhutan's capital and financial account has been in surplus for some
time, largely due to official inflows o f grants and loans. However, during 2005/06 with the winding
down o f the Tala project construction, the overall capital account surplus decreased by 33 percent
compared to the previous year. As o f December 2006, international reserves stood at US$537
million (equivalent to 13.7 months o f imports) compared to US$366 million inthe previous year.

27. The stock o f government debt continues to grow, reaching US$710 million in 2005/06,
equivalent to about 80.1 percent o f GDP. The Government o f India i s Bhutan's largest creditor, and
rupee loans account for about 60 percent o f the total (mostly related to hydropower development),
followed by the ADB, the World Bank and the Government o f Austria. An issue o f note i s that
interest during construction (IDC) for Tala has been accumulating for the past decade, and will be
included in Bhutan's debt figures in 2007/08, when the RGoB i s scheduled to start paying debt
service on Tala borrowing. The I D C amounts to about US$171 million, equivalent to 33.1 percent o f
the total Tala project development cost (including IDC), and 18.7 percent o f Bhutan's total external
debt. The inclusion o f IDC starting in 2007/08 raises debt as a share o f GDP in that year to 94.7
percent o f GDP in that year. Further increases in debt will be driven mainly by the development o f
additional hydropower resources, and non-hydropower debt i s likely to remain around 40 percent o f
GDP. Although debt service will rise sharply in2007/08 with Tala, the resources needed to service
hydropower debt are generated directly by the asset created through the borrowing, and the non-
hydropower debt has been contracted on concessional terms with modest debt service requirements.
Overall, debt burdens appear manageable.

28. Inrecent years, the fiscal deficit has been the equivalent o f four to ten percent o f GDP (Table
3). Although the RGoB aims to keep the deficit below five percent o f GDP, volatility remains a
major issue. To illustrate, the overall deficit including grants was 7.1 percent o f GDP in 2004/05,
before narrowing to 0.8 percent in 2005/06, and widening again to deficit around 3.5 percent in
2006/07.

29. Total revenue and grants rose by 28.9 percent in 2005/06, due to a large increase in grants as
well as growing hydropower revenues associated with the rate increase for Chukha electricity sold to
India (Table 4). Budget data for 2005/06 show that about 75 percent of total revenues and grants are
raised from four categories: grants (48 percent), Chukha hydropower (15 percent), the excise duty
refund from the Government o f India (six percent), and the Bhutan sales tax (five percent).
Hydropower revenues are a central part o f the resource envelope. Tala coming on stream in the
second half o f 2006 i s helping raise revenue and grants by a further 23.9 percent in 2006/07,
providing an estimated Nu.1750 million in revenues to the budget (almost 20 percent o f the total).
Runningat full capacity, Tala revenues are projected to be around Nu. 2.6 billion in 2007/08, and
total revenue and grants are projected to grow at 17.2 percent in the same year.         Much o f this
increase i s accounted for by Tala interest receipts (which will need to be used for Tala debt service),
however, and the resource envelope for other spending priorities will rise by much less, about 3.5
percent in2007/08.

30. Total expenditure and net lending o f the central government also shows a high degree o f
volatility, increasing by 30.7 percent in2004/05,6.8 percent in2005/06, and i s risingby 33.0 percent
in2006/07. Current expenditures accounted for around 50 percent ofthe total outlay. Power project
spending i s kept outside the budget, as are the grants financing power projects. However, expenditure
on debt service of power projects, as well as receipts collected for debt service, are included in the
budget. In the upcoming budget (2007/08), Tala debt service i s raising both revenue and
expenditures, but this i s strictly a book transfer.

31. Although the 2006/07 budget generally meets the fiscal objectives o f the RGoB, domestic
financing i s becoming increasingly important in covering the budget deficit, including net
withdrawals from the Ways and Means Account (W&MA) held with the Bank of Bhutan, reducing
the amount o f net liquidity injected into the financial systemby the RGoB.

32. Medium-term Outlook: The hydropower sector continues to dominate the economy. Large gains
from Tala will be shared between 2006/07 and 2007/08. The Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
(MTFF) projects a smaller expansion inthe resource envelope associated with Tala than was widely
expected, and can serve as an important tool to help manage expectations. The MTFF i s also central
to the RGoB's efforts to ensure an appropriate composition o f deficit finance between project-tied
external resources and budget support/domestic borrowing. Over the next four years, the RGoB
plans to start construction on four more hydropower projects: Dagachu, Punachu I,Punachu 11and
Mangdichu. Dagachui s to be financed by the ADB and Austria, while Punachu Ii s to be financed by
India. The remaining two are less certain. Construction o f these projects will have a positive effect
on the construction sector, and there will be sizable associated capital inflows. Supported by sound
policy, further hydropower development, and continued donor support, the prospects for sustained
growth are bright, helping the RGoB follow through on its vision o f development and reduce poverty.



         111.     DEVELOPMENTVISION AND POVERTYREDUCTION STRATEGY

33. As highlighted inthe program document o f DPG1, Bhutan's development has been guidedby its
own distinctive approach, which has attracted strong support from external donors. This approach
rests on the overarching notion o f Gross National Happiness, propoundedby His Majesty the Fourth
Kinginthe early 1970s, emphasizing the importance o f balancing material, spiritual, emotional and
cultural well-being as elements that together bring happiness to the individual and society. More
recently, these aspirations were articulated in the document Bhutan 20/20: A Vision for Peace,
Prosperity and Happiness, prepared in 1999 through a consultative process involvingrepresentatives
from the RGoB, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and communities. It seeks to
translate the notion o f GNH into a series o fnational objectives emphasizing: (a) human development,
(b) cultural heritage, (c) equitable development, (d) good governance, and (e) environmental
conservation.     In the same vein as the MDGs, Bhutan 20/20 establishes long-term objectives,
including providing electricity to 50 percent o f the rural population, and ensuring that 75 percent o f
the ruralpopulationlive withinless than halfa day's walk to the nearestmotorableroadby 2012.

34. The 9FYP (2002/03 to 2006/07), initially planned to end by June 2007, has been extended until
June 2008 in order to achieve the development targets and allow the first government under the
newly-established system o fparliamentary democracy to start the implementation o f the 1OFYP. The
9FYP contains detailed targets and strategies, and was prepared following a consultative process that
pulled together 201 gewog (block) plans, 20 dzongkhag (district) plans, and numerous sectoral plans.
It has five overall goals: (i)improving quality o f life and income, especially for the poor, (ii)
ensuring good governance, (iii)         promoting private sector growth and employment generation, (iv)



                                                          12

preserving and promoting cultural heritage and the environment, and (v) achieving rapid economic
growth and transformation. The strategies for achieving these goals are based on expanding
infrastructure, pursuing sound macroeconomic policy, ensuring good governance, and improving
access to enhanced social services.

35. The lOFYP (2008/09 to 2012-13) will coincide with the above noted transition, focusing on
poverty alleviation. This will require strong investment for the development o f rural infrastructure,
such as feeder and farm roads, power tiller tracks, rural electrification, irrigation schemes, telecom
facilities, mule tracks and bridges. This emphasis i s consistent with the national objective of
improving the quality o f life for all Bhutanese, as well as the commitment to attaining the MDGs and
SAARC goals. The four broad strategies identified to help meet the goals o f the lOFYP entail: (i)
raising the productive capacities o f the poor; (ii)  promoting balanced regional development; (iii)
enhancing private sector development; and (iv) expanding development infrastructure.

36. Bhutan's planning process i s consultative. With the advantages o f its relatively small size,
strong community connections, and regard for the institutions o f government, the planning process
has traditionally drawn on extensive consultations. Development plans tend to have wide-spread buy-
in and support at all levels of society. An example is found inthe transport sector where the RGoB
has accorded high priority to increase the provision o f rural roads, both as a lever for other
development outcomes, but also in response to widespread public demand expressed during
dzongkhag-wide public forums chaired by the Fourth King for the preparation o f the 9FYP.



  IV.      WORLD BANK GROUPASSISTANCEAND COLLABORATIONWITH OTHER
                                        DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS


LINKTO CAS

37. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY06/09 aligns with Bhutan's vision o f
GNH and the priorities and goals o f the 9FYP/PRSP. The CAS emphasizes selectivity, and supports
development based on three pillars: (i)    expanding access to better infrastructure and quality social
services, as well as connecting communities to markets; (ii)      promoting private sector development
and employment; (iii)   strengthening the management o f public resources, as well as the monitoring
and evaluation o f development outcomes. In addition, the Bank will support the RGoB's cross-
cutting efforts relatedto decentralization, good governance and environmental management.

38. The proposed DPG2 would support all three CAS pillars, and would be the second in a series o f
two programmed operations. The first two components on macro/fiscal management and fiduciary
systems are part o f the third CAS pillar, aiming to help the RGoB ensure effective public resource
management. Monitoring and evaluation o f development outcomes i s also helped by the M&E
framework being prepared as a part o f the implementation o f Multi-Year Rolling Budgets (MYRB),
as well as the development o f the Education ManagementInformation System. The DPG2 program's
thirdcomponent onprivate sector development i s a part o f the second CAS pillar on fosteringprivate
sector growth and employment opportunities, highlighting several measures specifically targeting
private sector development and the labor market. The DPG2 program's last two components on
education and health lie within the first CAS pillar, aiming to assist the RGoB's efforts to provide
wider access to quality social services. Hence, the DPGprogram i s closely aligned with the CAS.




                                                    13

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

39. The size o f the portfolio inBhutan has increased substantially inrecent years, and based on the
CAS, the Bank i s poised to continue providing financial support for urban development, rural access,
and HIV/AIDS prevention. Three new projects are in the pipeline, aiming to promote private
sector/IT development, improve procurement systems, and control avian influenza.

40. The DPG2 supports the objectives o f Bank's investment lending program by highlighting key
policy and institutional changes that will contribute importantly to the projects achieving their
expected results.     The   initiatives under the      first two components      of the DPG2,       on
macroeconomic/fiscal management and fiduciary systems, will have a cross-cutting impact enhancing
the effectiveness o f public spending, as well as including more specific elements that will be central
to the implementation o f the procurementtraining project that i s currently under preparation. Several
o f the RGoB's efforts supported by the third component o f the DPG on private sector development
will be important to: (a) the PSD/ICT project under preparation, including the labor law, FDI
regulations, and the cost o f doing business, and (b) the IFC's investment in the tourism sector,
through the DPG2's support o f reforms in tourism policy. The education component o f the DPG2
compliments the objectives o f the Education Development Project, IDA'Sthird support ina series and
currently the largest IDA support to Bhutan. This six-year project supports the expansion o f access,
the improvement in the quality o f teaching-learning, and the enhancement o f monitoring and
evaluation.   Similarly, the fifth component o f the DPG2 on health, which among other things i s
focused on policies for the treatment o f STIs, will be very important to increasing the impact o f the
HIV/Aids project. In addition to these complementarities, this operation also leverages further
benefits, as for example in the education sector, where the DPG2's focus on quality is substantively
linkedto efforts currently underway to bringBhutan into the global Education Fast Track Initiative.


ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

41. The DPG2's support for the various sectors/themes builds on the deepening engagement in
technical assistance and analytical and advisory services. Technical assistance has been provided in
key areas such as: (a) poverty monitoring and statistics and an InstitutionalDevelopment Fund(IDF)
grant and other activities to improve public expenditure management, (b) another IDF and related
work on financial management, (c) a growing program o f activities on procurement, (d) the
development o f legislation for foreign direct investment (FDI), and (e) the promotion o f small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) and capacity buildinginthe Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce and Industry
(BCCI). The substantial analytic content o f the DPG2 engagement builds on the Country Economic
Update, the Hydropower study, the Youth and Employment Study, the Private Sector Survey, the
Doing Business Report, the ROSC, and the State Owned Enterprise Study. Inthe education sector,
analytical work on specific inputs to improve the quality o f teaching and learning (such as resource
centers and reading programs), which have recently been undertaken as part o f the on-going IDA-
financed operation to support education system development, will be used to corroborate findings
and enhance understanding o f the results o f the quality survey.


LESSONSLEARNED

42. As noted above, the DPG engagement is nascent, having been initiated less than two years ago.
Still, important lessons have been learned:




                                                   14

  0   Despite the small size o f Bhutan and the high costs o f operations, it i s important and
      worthwhile to sustain a close engagement, as there are strong impacts. Bhutan looks to the
      Bank as a reliable partner and i s committed to ensuring the proper use o f its resources. The
       experience o f other development partners in Bhutan, such as Canada and Switzerland,
       demonstrate that close partnerships are o f great value inBhutan.

  0    Effort i s well spent in seelung ways to support institution and capacity building, in order to
       consolidate progress made on various reform efforts. For example, the RGoB has received
       considerable support from the Bank in the form o f technical assistance over the past several
       years for strengthening country fiduciary systems.

  0    Providing assistance through cross sectoral programmatic support helps to sustain momentum
       inthe RGoB's efforts to implement its reformprogram. The conveningpower o f the Ministry
       o f Finance as the focal ministry for programmatic support helps to ensure that line ministries
       remain on-track for achieving agreed targets in specific sectors.

43, These lessons informed the design o f the DPG2, with a deepening engagement across several
areas, a strong focus on institutional development and capacity building, and an emphasis on
sustaining reformmomentum.


COLLABORATIONWITH OTHER DONORSAND THE IMF

44. In addition to Bhutan's main development partner, India, other external partners include the
ADB, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, and the UN system. Activities are well-
aligned with the 9FYP/PRSP, and UNagencies have agreed to produce a common strategy starting in
2007, aligned with the 10FYP. The Bank and ADB are discussing the possibility o f preparing ajoint
strategy in the future. The DPG2 team i s in close contact with donors, which i s facilitated by the
relatively small number o f multilateral and bilateral donors in Bhutan. Close collaboration i s evident
inseveral areas.

45. Improving access to public services, especially education and more recently health, i s central to
the Bank's assistance to Bhutan. The ongoing Education Development Project ( E D P F a $31million
IDA credit-supports     Bhutan's education system development through expanding access to primary
and secondary education, and improving education quality at all levels. The RGoB has coordinated
the EDP's inputs with those o f other donors, including Canada's support for curriculum reform for
Englishat all levels o f schooling, UNICEF's assistance for the establishment o fresource centers, and
DANIDA's budget support to the Ministry o f Education (MoE). Inthe education sector, all donors
supporting education system development in Bhutan are collaborating on Bhutan's incorporation in
the global Education Fast Track Initiative. This is expected to lead to greater harmonization o f efforts
to support improved policy formulation, and monitoring and evaluation o f education system
functioning. The HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Prevention and Control
Project (IDA Grant H1030) was approved in June 2004 to help the RGoB make progress inthis vital
area. While the project's main focus i s on prevention, it also provides support for treatment and
activities to strengthen Bhutan's ability to control HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases).
DANIDA,UNICEFandWHO are providing technical support on a number o frelatedactivities.

46. Development partners are also endeavoring to help the RGoB improve the effectiveness o f
public spending. The Bank, IMF and UNDP teams are supporting the RGoB's efforts to develop a
sound multi-year fiscal framework and improve public expenditure management. Development



                                                    15

partners are working together to promote harmonization around the country's national fiduciary and
safeguard systems.      The Bank's ongoing fiduciary work i s seelung to compare national and
international public sector accounting and auditing standards. To strengthen the functioning o f
procurement systems inBhutan, the Bank and DANIDA are collaborating on a series o f procurement
r e f o m measures, and DANIDA recently committed US$lOO,OOO to work with the Bank and RGoB
on the development o f a Procurement Manual, Standard Bidding Documents, and a Policy Note on
Grievance MechanismsinProcurement, among other key initiatives inthis area.

47. The IMF and Bank staff prepared the Joint Staff Advisory Note on Bhutan's PRSP in 2004
(Report No. 30716-BT) and consult regularly on various issues. The IMF's assessment letter i s
attached inAnnex 4.



                  V.      THE PROPOSEDDEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT


OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

48. As noted above, the RGoB i s committed to implementing its policy and institutional reform
program, and i s making good progress. With the exception of the trigger on maternal mortality,
which has been revised to focus more on demand side factors, all o f the triggers listed in DPGl as
indicative for proceeding with DPG2 have been met. Many o f the other reform initiatives (that are
not triggers) are also moving forward. For example, the RGoB had planned to submit the Public
Finance Act to the National Assembly in 2006, but after some further revisions, it i s now to be
considered by the National Assembly inmid-2007. Despite the delay inthe submission o f the Public
Finance Act, however, the RGoB plans to meet some o f the key provisions o f the act sooner,
including the preparation and submissiodpublication o f a Budget Policy and Fiscal Framework
Statement (based on the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, or MTFF). In other areas, reforms are
moving further and faster than anticipated.

49. Fiduciary systems have been added as a separate area to be supported by the DPG program
under the proposed second operation. This reflects the RGoB's continuing efforts to improve
financial management (previously included in the first component o f DPG1 under macroeconomic,
fiscal and financial management), and adding a component on procurement to highlight important
initiatives underway.

50. The four themes o f the DPGl have thus been expanded to five:

          (1)    Ensuringthe maintenance o f a sound macroeconomic framework, and strengthening
                 fiscal policy;

          (2)    Bolstering fiduciary systems inthe areas o f financial management and procurement;

          (3)    Enhancing the investment climate for private sector growth and employment
                 generation;

          (4)    Augmenting the quality o f and access to education; and

          (5)    Improving health care utilization.




                                                   16

5 1. Accelerated reform i s also evident through: (i) piloting of multi-year rolling budgets in two
                                                    the
major ministries instead of one for the 2007/08 budget year; (ii) strengthening o f the internal
                                                                   the
audit functions by drafting a Charter, Code o f Ethics and Standards for internal auditors; (iii) the
passage of the Bhutan Information, Communication & Media Act; (iv) the expansion o f access to
primary schooling and roll-out o f the improved curriculum to raise the quality of teaching-learning,
and (v) the acceleration of the availability of non-resistant STI treatment at the basic health unit
(BHUs) level. Up-front actions for the proposed DPG2, as well as the next steps the RGoBplans to
undertake in order to sustain momentum on their refom program are summarized in Table 5. Key
expected outcomes and indicatorsassociated with these actions are also noted.

52. These steps are essential to the reform program. They are commensurate with country context,
and account for both capacity constraints and political realities during the upcoming transition
period. Given that this i s only the second development policy operation, (the first having been
initiated less than two years ago), these measures are substantively important, represent a logical
continuation o f earlier reformmeasures, and demonstrate sustainedprogress.

53. The following section reviews the progress and challenges o f the reform program under DPG2
(also see Annex 1, `Policy Program Matrix'). Additionally Annex 2 reviews good practice principles
on conditionality.


MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL MANAGEMENT-ENSURINGTHE MAINTENANCE
OF A SOUNDMACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORKAND STRENGTHENINGFISCAL
POLICY


54. Sound macroeconomic management has been one o f the pillars o f Bhutan's robust development
performance over the past 25 years. The RGoB aims to continue on this path through the political
transition to democracy and beyond. The reforms and institutional changes under this component are
central to meeting this objective, and will help facilitate closer macroeconomic monitoring,
strengthen debt management, and improve the budget preparation process, which together will
underpin sound policy formulation for sustained robust growth.

(0 Bolstering theMacroeconomicFramework

55. Much o f the RGoB's efforts inrecent years toward improving macroeconomic and fiscal policy
centers on the work o f the Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Committee (MFCC) and the
preparation o f an MTFF.        The mandate o f the MFCC (and a technical sub-committee, the
Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Technical Committee) i s to play a strong coordination
role, bringingtogether inputs from various parts o f government, and to integrate these into a coherent
framework for a comprehensive picture o f emerging macroeconomic developments. The framework
makes assumptions explicit, and sets a fiscal path consistent with macroeconomic stability. The
revised draft Public Finance Act, which i s to be considered by the National Assembly inthe summer
o f 2007, provides for the presentation o f the BPFFS based on the MTFF with the budget, and the
MFCC will play a centralrole inthe preparationo fthe framework.

56. A key benefit o f this process i s that it helps foster debate and provides a tool to help decision
makers grapple with critical policy issues.       For example, in the context o f high expectations
surrounding the commissioning o f the Tala hydropower project, how much i s the overall resource
envelope expanding? Through the MTFFBPFFS it i s evident that there i s a major impetus from Tala,
with ajump inreal GDP, exports, and domestic revenue (see Table 3). Still, the commencement o f
large debt service payments and a possible reduction in program grants from India in the coming
years are likely to off-set part o f this gain, and there i s a continuing need for fiscal prudence (see
Table 4).

57. Another example o f a key policy issue facing the RGoB concerns the development o f new
hydropower projects. The RGoB wishes to proceedwith further development as swiftly as possible,
and four projects are under discussion, including some as big as or larger than Tala. One project,
Puna I,i s to be financed with Indian support, but the other proposed projects are to be developed
through borrowing and an RGoB equity contribution o f around 20-25 percent. The MTFF indicates




                                                   21

that it may be difficult to devote the needed public resources in equity, as these would amount to a
major share o f the overall budget insome years.

58. The RGoB seeks to institutionalize the activities o f the MFCC. A manual has been prepared to
document the methodologies used, and the MFCC will assist in the preparation o f policy briefs on
key issues using the framework. While the MFCC has been meeting on an ad hoc basis (although
minuted), the expectation i s that there will be two major MTFF preparation rounds: one in
OctoberDJovember ahead o f the budget calls (which are issued in December), and a second one in
AprilMay, as the budget i s being finalized and the BPFFS prepared for presentation with the budget
speech.

(ii) Improving Debt Management Systems

59. As noted above, growing public debt i s emerging as a significant issue inBhutan, largely driven
by the development o f mega hydropower projects, but also stemming from accumulated fiscal
deficits. Indeed, Bhutan's debt indicators exceed thresholds for the category `high risk o f debt
distress,' and are the basis for Bhutan's eligibility for 100 percent grant financing from IDA. It
should be emphasized, however, that the hydropower debt accounts for more than half o f the total
debt stock, and that this i s tied to an asset that generates sufficient income not only to service the
debt, but also to finance a significant part o f other government spending. The non-hydropower debt i s
largely concessional, with comparatively low debt service requirements. Hence, the overall burden
o f public sector debt i s manageable. Still, the highindebtedness calls for effective monitoring efforts
to underpin sound debt management. The RGoB i s in the process o f building capacity for debt
analysis, and operationalizingthe CS-DFWS software acquired for this purpose inthe past year. The
RGoB has produced preliminary debt reports using the system, and plans to generate debt
sustainability analyses over the coming year. The system will also help the RGoB prepare a debt
strategy brief, providing guidelines for overall levels o f indebtedness, as well as the appropriate mix
between external, domestic and hydropower debt.

 (iii) Strengthening the Budget Preparation Process

60. The RGoB has been worlung toward introducing a multi-year perspective into the budgeting
process for several years, and for the first time, the Minister o f Finance plans to include a three-year
fiscal framework in the presentation o f the 2007/08 budget. This important milestone in the budget
process i s expected in June 2007, and reflects a commitment on the part o f the RGoB to implement
key provisions o f the draft Public Finance Act, calling for the presentation o f a BPFFS (based on the
MTFF) together with the budget, before the Public Finance Act is passed. The Public Finance Act
provides, specifically, for the inclusion o f indicative sector ceilings over the medium term,
incorporating overall fiscal constraints and serving decision makers as a tool to assess the multi-year
fiscal implications o f important policy choices facing the RGoB. The preparation o f the BPFFS i s
the first step inthis process, and as noted above, major exercises are envisaged twice a year: once in
OctoberDJovember ahead o f the annual budget calls, and again in Aprilhfay when the draft
statement i s prepared and the budget i s finalized. The RGoB initiated the process during the first
half o f 2007, updating the MTFF, preparing a draft statement, and seelung endorsement from the
C o M for inclusion inthe 2007/08 budget presentation.

61. Based on the resource envelop estimated through the MTFF, the RGoB plans to prepare `top-
down' Multi-Year Rolling Budgets (MYRB), with multi-year ceilings by accountable government
agency and by source of finance (domestic versus external). Templates have already been developed,
and the approach i s being piloted in two key ministries: the Ministry o f Education and the Ministry



                                                     22

o f Works and Human Settlements. This i s a technically demanding initiative, and based on lessons
learned, the RGoB plans gradually to expand the pilot more broadly. The MYRB process involves
extensive consultations with the spending agencies at different levels of government and focuses
more on the linkages between the national development plans and available budget to attain the
medium-term sectoral goals. The line agencies are expected to strategize their plan and make them
accountable for outcomes through the effective utilization o f available resources.

62. These initiatives represent a major step away from needs-based toward availability-based
budgeting, and are expected to help increase predictability and strengthen fiscal discipline for more
effective public spending. Progress indicators include better fiscal marksmanship, while recognizing
and managing the inherent volatility faced by a small, relatively undiversified economy. Setting
benchmarks through this process i s especially important inthe context o fthe transition to democracy,
and the coming o f a new government under significantly changed governance arrangements.

Upfront actionfor DPG2 (1 of 8):

TheMTFF is circulated as apart of the annual budget preparation process starting in 2007/08, and
annual budget numbers (expenditure, revenue, dejkits and debt) are developed in accordance with
MTFF targets. Key steps in theprocess includepreparing drafts of the MTFF through the MFCC,
debating theframework more widely, preparing the draft BPFFS, and seeking CoM endorsementfor
inclusion in the Budget presentation. Status: Completed

FIDUCIARY SYSTEMS-BOLSTERINGFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVING
PROCUREMENTPROCESSES

63. The RGoB places high priority on strengthening fiduciary systems. The authorities are
especially keen to implement policy and institutional reforms to ensure good governance through the
political transition to democracy, and given that a high proportion o f Bhutan's resources are
channeled through government. Several important initiatives are underway in financial management
and procurement, which are highlighted through the DPGprogram.

(0 Financial Management

64. Improving public financial management and accountability i s a central part o f the reform
program inBhutan. Diagnostic studies conducted earlier by the Bank and other donors have indicated
that while the core elements o f an effective financial management system are largely inplace, several
major challenges remain. First, there i s a need to improve the current budgeting and accounting
computer systems to provide for a fully linked system that enables monthly and annual reporting at
the entity and the national levels. Second, external and internal audits are not as effective as they
should be for ensuring that systems o f internal financial controls work well. Third, there i s a need to
improve the reliability and consistency o f reporting by using the format o f the cash-basis
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS). Fourth, adoption o f international
standards for auditing will help provide the basis for assuring competent financial reporting and
transparency. Finally, there i s a need to further strengthen the capacity o f oversight institutions, and
establish the legal underpinnings they require to meet the financial management and transparency
demands arising from the increased revenues and spending expected over the coming years.

65. With these considerations inmind, the RGOBhas been pursuingseveral reforminitiatives inthe
areas o f accounting and audit.    The first DPG operation included many key components o f the



                                                   23

RGoB's ongoing PFMA reform initiatives, including highlighting efforts to: (a) provide legal
underpinnings for the PFMA System by drafting the Public Finance Act; (b) separate the Department
o f Budget and Accounts into two departments to bring efficiency and timeliness to the accounting
and reporting functions; (c) improve the Management Information System by making the e-transfer
o f funds operational in all spending agencies in Thimphu, and piloting the networking o f the B A S
between the DBA and three selected spending agencies in Thimphu; (d) strengthen oversight o f
public finance by bringingthe Royal Audit Authority (RAA) within the legal framework o f an Audit
Act and actively trackmg and monitoring the responses by public spending units to audit observations
until settlement/adjustment.   Many o f the steps taken in the areas of budget execution, monitoring
and cash management have produced visible positive results, and provide a strong trajectory for
further financial management improvement. The RGoB has demonstrated its will to continue
implementing financial management reforms, evidenced by the scale and variety o f actions
underway. Overall, the reform program in this area i s progressing well, although substantial further
effort is needed ifthe RGoB i s to meet its goals in substance as well as in form.

66. The RGoB i s moving forward with PFMA initiatives aimed at: (1) improving the legal
framework, (2) strengthening the institutional underpinnings o f the PFMA system, (3) enhancing
information systems, and (4) sharpening the oversight o f public finances. Several of actions in these
areas are required to consolidate the initiatives taken under the first DPG operation, including the
passage of the Public Finance Act, as well as new initiatives to support the accounting and reporting
discipline provided for by the Public Finance Act.

Legalframework


67. Intandem with the RGoB's efforts to enhance good governance practices, the Public Finance
Act has been drafted to provide the legal underpinnings for financial management. The draft Public
Finance Act underscores the importance o f public financial management and accountability systems
and will help: (a) establish lines o f responsibility for the use o f public funds and provide a legal
framework for the RGoB's financial rules; (b) provide a framework for scrutiny by the National
Assembly for the management o f public assets and liabilities, including expenditure and revenue
proposals; (c) encourage sound fiscal policies by specifying the rules for fiscal sustainability and
transparency; (d) establish incentives to encourage effective and efficient use o f financial resources
by government agencies; (e) specify the minimum financial reporting obligations o f the RGoB's
budgetary agencies and public enterprises; and (f) safeguard public assets by providing statutory
authority and control for raising loans, issuingsecurities and guarantees, operating bank accounts and
investing funds. The draft Act has gone through several consultations and revisions. The passage o f
the Act i s pending primarily to incorporate the changes suggested by the CoM. The RGoB stands
committed to submittingthe act to the National Assembly inthe June 2007 session.

68. Bhutan's Financial Rules and Regulations 2001, specify the current accounting practices,
internal control procedures, reporting requirements, and timetables and responsibilities for financial
management in all agencies. The accounting system i s focused on ensuring due control over and
reporting against budget appropriations, and audited annual accounts are essentially a budget
realization statement. A study conducted by the World Bank for Bhutan, Public Sector Accounting
and Auditing: A Comparison with International Standards, November 2006, concluded that the
IPSAS issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) o f the IFAC
are not adopted or complied with in preparing the annual accounts.            Adoption of international
standards for accounting forms the basis o f competent financial reporting and transparency. The
International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) o f the International Federationo f



                                                   24

Accountants (IFAC) has developed a core set o f accrual based IPSAS, as well as a comprehensive
cash based IPSAS. These establish an authoritative set o f independent international financial
reporting standards for governments and others inpublic sector organizations.

69. Application o f IPSAS will support developments inpublic sector financial reporting directed at
improving decision-making, financial management, and accountability, and it will be an integral
element o f reforms directed at promoting social and economic development.          Inpractical terms,
however, the provisions o f the Financial Rules and Regulations 2001 have facilitated a flexible
reporting environment and allow for compliance with key principles o f the cash-basis IPSAS. Since
much o f the information seems to be available, there i s scope for the Ministry o f Finance to format
annual financial statements using the Cash Basis IPSAS, Part 1. This will be in line with the
proposed Public Finance Act, which provides for the chief accounting officer to prescribe accounting
standards. As a first step, the RGoB will establish a formal board or committee to advise on the
establishment and implementation o f accounting standards for the public sector and for the Ministry
o f Finance (MoF) through the designated Executive Officer (EO) to prescribe the adoption o f
international accounting standards (preferably IPSAS) for the public sector inBhutan. Futurereforms
will entail adjustments in the annual consolidated financial statements to accord with Cash Basis
IPSAS, Part 1. Consolidation o f controlled entities such as public enterprises should be considered
when feasible. Timetables are needed for the consolidation o f controlled entities into the cash basis
statements as per 1.6.5 o f the Cash Basis IPSAS (e.g. public enterprises), and for the longer-term
transition path to the adoption o f accrual-based IPSAS. A longer-term goal will be to move to
accrual-based reporting. Inthe early stages, however, the optional information set out inIPSAS, Part
2, may be reportedon a progressive basis.
Institutionalframework
70. To bring closer attention to accounting and Treasury functions and to enable timely preparation
o f government financial statements, the Department o f Budget and Accounts was separated into two
departments in December 2005, namely (i)the Department o f National Budget and (ii)the
Department o f Public Accounts (DPA). As a result o f this segregation, a new cadre of National
Accounts Service (NAS) has been established and future reforms in this area will entail developing a
Code o f Ethics for Accountants, based on Part A o f the IFAC Code o f Ethics for Professional
Accountants, suitably amended for Bhutan. The Code of Ethics will help maintain good public
financial management inBhutan.

71.   Reforms in the institutional framework have helped bring about improved quality and
timeliness o f financial reporting for decision-making. For the first time, the annual financial
statement for the year 2005/06 was prepared within a period o f six months o f the close o f the
financial year and submitted for audit. Also for the first time, the Department o f Public Accounts has
prepared consolidated RGoB in-year financial statements for the six months ending December 3 1,
2006. Continued timely preparationo f in-year budget reports and annual financial statements will be
an important element o f the public financial management program and will help provide the
information required for policy decision making.

72. Good Governance reforms adopted by the RGoB endorse increased levels o f decentralization,
and improving the DPA's efficiency in transferring block grants to local governments will become a
critical requirement. Inline with the recommendations o f the Good Governance Plus 2005 exercise
to enhance administrative and management capacities at the local government level, the RGoB has
initiated a recruitment drive which aims to provide a trained accountant at each o f the 205 geogs by
September 2008. Upon recruitment, the accountants are required to undergo geog accountants
training at the Royal Institute o f Management (RIM). The RIM has also prepared and published a

Geog Management Manual, which includes a section on financial management. These efforts
continue to be supported by several development partners, including UNDP and DANIDA.

73. The RGoB i s making efforts to strengthen the effectiveness o f internal audits and ensure that
systems o f internal financial controls work well. Capacity inadequacies currently preventreliance on
internal audits. The proposed Public Finance Act provides for a stronger internal audit function.
This will need to be supported by more formal approaches to training and monitoring internal audit
activities. The RGoB i s drafting the Charter, Code o f Conduct and standards for internal auditors,
which are currently under internal review. In addition, the RGoB has prepared a concept document
outlining steps for establishing a separate office within the Ministry o f Finance for internal audit,
augmenting internal audit staff, and engaging in capacity building. These efforts need to be
consolidated and completed in order to develop and implement an institutional framework for
internal audit which meets the needs o f the Public Finance Act and to implement internal audit as a
management tool to support internal control arrangements. Future reforms will include strengthening
internal audit functions by identifying suitable staff training and certification arrangements,
developing internal audit procedures and associated manuals. The procedures should be adequate to
support the International Institute o f Internal Auditors Standards for internal audit. There i s also a
need to review and adopt appropriate reporting arrangements for the internal audit function, and
Audit Committees are considered a common way of supporting internal audit independence and
effectiveness.

Financialmanagementinformationsystem


74. The adoption o f a computerized Budgeting and Accounting System (BAS) in line
ministriedagencies and Central Budgeting and Accounting System (CBAS) in the Department o f
National Budget has brought about significant improvements in the financial management system
over the past several years. Further progress has been hampered by the lack o f adequate networlung
infrastructure. To ensure the speedy release o f funds to government ministries and agencies, the
Department o f Public Accounts has put inplace a mechanism that allows Letters o f Credit (LC) to be
sent electronically to the Bank o f Bhutan, the custodian o f government funds. The Department o f
Public Accounts has initiated a process of internal consultations with key stakeholders to improve
fund release mechanisms. Suspense accounts and advances need to be better monitored and
reconciled at least quarterly within a month from the end o f the period, and with few balances
brought forward. The reduction in carry forward balances in suspense and advance accounts will be
monitored closely, and will serve as an indicator o fprogress.

75. Future areas o f improvement will include strengthening the current budget and accounting
computer systems to provide a fully linked system that enables monthly and annual reporting at the
entity and national levels. Program changes are underway to support the electronic transfer o f
accounting reports on a monthly basis from all accounting offices. Scoping studies are being carried
out on the communications links to ascertain the hardware, communication, and software
requirements. There i s a need for some reassessment o f the system to establish how it will support
the accounting and reporting requirements o f the proposed Public Finance Act. This Act will require
half-yearly and annual ministerial reports on the actual performance against those specified in the
budget. To achieve better budget performance, the accounting system needs to provide managers
with frequent information on progress against budgets at the portfolio level and below. As the
networking facilities expand in Bhutan, and as the Bank o f Bhutan modernizes its own systems, these
accounting and reporting systems are expected to improve significantly.




                                                   26

76. In an effort to enhance transparency and increase the demand for information on the use o f
public funds, the RGoB i s posting annual financial statements o f the government on the Ministry o f
Finance website, starting with the, annual financial statements for three years, 2002/03, 2003104 and
2004/05.

Oversightof publicfinances
77. The Royal Audit Authority (RAA) ascertains and evaluates whether public resources are
handled in accordance with established rules and regulations, and assesses whether public agencies
within its audit jurisdiction achieve the purposes for which they were established and for which
resources have been made available. In order to provide a legal underpinning to the function, an
Audit Act was passedby the National Assembly inJuly 2006. This act determines service conditions
o f the Auditor General and prescribes the duties and powers connected to the audit functions o f the
RAA.

78. The RAA actively tracks and monitors responses by public spending units o f audit observations
until settlement or adjustment. The RAA established a centralized Follow-up Division in July 2005
to ensure continuous and effective follow up o f audit reports through more focused attention. As a
consequence o f the sustained follow-up o f the audit observations, the total amount o f irregularities
reported in financial terms as per audit reports issued during 2005 fell by Nu. 105.1 million,
indicating an overall reduction o f 28.4 percent as compared to the AAR 2004. Inthe report to the
86' session o f the National Assembly, it was further reported that out o f the total amount o f audit
observations o f Nu 264.3 million, cases amounting to Nu 102.9 million have been resolved as o f
September 2006, representing compliance o f 39.0 percent

79. An indication o f the growing levels o f oversight on public finances and the increasing role o f
the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was that the Annual Audit Report 2005 was presented to the
85' session o f the National Assembly by the PAC. The Audit Report generated considerable debate
and discussion during the session. In follow-up to the session, the PAC arranged a number o f
sittings, calling upon senior civil servants to explain the observations contained inthe audit report.

80. The current auditing approach i s based on the General Auditing Rules and Regulations
(GARR), which are in line with the INTOSAI Auditing Standards, but do not incorporate the
IFAC/IAASB International Standards on Auditing. Adoption o f the international standards for
auditing provides the basis for assuring competent financial reporting and transparency if supported
by the enforcement o f a code o f ethics. As a first step, the RAA proposes to set up an Auditing
Standards Advisory Committee, which will be responsible for advice on the implementation o f
international public sector auditing standards. Future areas o f reform include the National Audit Act
specifying arrangements to incorporate IFAC/IAASB issued International Standards o f Auditing. The
INTOSAIAuditing Standards supported by the detailed IFAC/IAASB issued International Standards
on Auditing underpin a modem audit process. The International Audit and Assurance Standards
Board i s progressively rolling out international auditing standards. The INTOSAI i s moving from
maintaining its own auditing standards by seelung to support the IAASB's development o f audit
standards. This i s being done particularly so that the IAASB audit standards appropriately reflect the
interests o f the internationalpublic-sector audit community.

81. A peer review in 2005 by the Supreme Audit Institution o f India recommended that audit
methodology manuals be prepared, introducingmore comprehensive planning requirements based on
the specific objectives o f the audits. DuringJune and July o f 2006, teams were established to prepare
audit guides in various areas o f audit. The RAA plans to review this work and develop it further in



                                                    27

due course. It i s notable that the new manuals are being prepared by RAA staff, with external
consultants providing guidance but not actually writing the manuals, helping ensure ownership and
local relevance. The RAA plans to review the success o f these development activities, and prepare
eight new audit manuals for tasks established by the proposed Audit Act. Future reforms will entail
developing environmental audit and computerized audit capabilities. Changing the audit orientation
also requires moving from transaction to risk-based systems. There i s a need to adopt practices set
out inthe IFAC-issued International Standards on Auditing inthe new auditing manuals.

82. To strengthen the technical and professional competence o f the RAA, improve its operational
capacity to produce and disseminate quality audit reports that meet international standards, and serve
the needs o f the stakeholders, the RAA proposes to institute updated and modernized systems,
methodologies, and facilities to enable efficient and effective audits by staff. Properly designed audit
sampling techniques in the certification audit are difficult to use without computer support. The use
o f sampling techniques and computer-aided auditing techniques, especially for the Budget and
Accounting System, will be developed to increase the efficient use o f audit resources.

83. The R4A has a reasonably satisfactory quality control and quality assurance procedure inplace
for its audit work, and proposes to strengthen the quality assurance system by developing a quality
management system designed to provide reasonable assurance given the likelihood and magnitude o f
potential risks. It i s to conduct audits, both in terms o f regularity and performance, per applicable
legislative requirements, rules and regulations, audit standards, policy manuals, guidelines and
procedures. This will be conducted through consultationwith senior RAA staff and a workshop for a
cross-section o fRAA staff and auditee clients.

 (ii)Procurement

84. As part o f efforts to create a professional, efficient, effective, accountable and transparent
procurement system, the RGoB has decided to focus its attention on the following areas o f reform:
Revisingthe procurement manual
85. With the assistance o f the ADB, Chapter 17 o f the 1988 Finance Manual was revised in 1998 as
a separate procurement manual, which now forms a part o f the Financial Rules and Regulations
2001. Since then, there have been lessons learned in using these rules and regulations, as well as
changes in procurement-related policy. For this reason, an effort was started to revise the existing
manual. To ensure that the new manual would be consistent with the latest internationally accepted
best practices inprocurement, the RGoB sought assistance with these revisions, aiming to prepare a
manual that would meet the needs o f the country, but also be supported by donors. A new draft was
submitted by the workmg group to the Minister o f Finance at the end o f December 2006, and was
issued to government agencies at the end o f March 2007 (an up-front action for DPG2).




                                                    28

Creatinga CentralProcurementPolicy Mechanism(CPPM)
86. An urgent need was identified for a central procurement policy mechanism, carrying
responsibility for all procurement policy inBhutan, and leading the reform agenda. This has become
particularly urgent with the initiation o f the procurement capacity building project (see below) for
which a project implementation unit is needed. While the structure o f the mechanism has not been
confirmed (Le. a division or a unit), nor whether it will be housed in the MoF, the RGoB has
committed to its establishment and i s worhng with the Royal Civil Service Commission (RCSC) to
enable its formation inthe coming months.

Improvingcapacity through procurement training
87. A lack o f procurement capacity among civil servants in Bhutan has been a key impediment to
the implementation o f procurement rules. This is not due to mendacious behavior, but by-and-large
due to the absence o f a substantial professional procurement cadre and lachng infrastructure for
professional skills training in procurement. The RGoB recognizes the need for creating a
procurement profession within the civil service, and also for a domestic institutional infrastructure
for skills training and the granting o f qualifications. Under its new Position Classification system,
RCSC has created various levels o fprocurementprofessionals inits civil service ranks, and the MoF,
together with other institutions, i s seehng to establish a professional procurement training center in
the Royal Institute o f Management. As this project i s implemented, it i s expected that procurement
officials will receive an improved skills set, which will enable the more effective implementation of
the rules and regulations o f the manual, and encourage officials to pursue a professional career in
procurement and receive various levels o f qualification that are internationally recognized.

Establishinga procurementgrievancemechanism


88. Without a proper complaints mechanism under which aggneved bidders can submit cases, no
public official will feel sufficiently accountable to ensure full compliance with the rules o f the
procurement manual. Bhutan has several ad hoc mechanisms to deal with complaints, but these are
not very effective, efficient, independent, or broad enough in scope to cover all procurement types.
The RGoB seeks to establish a sound complaints mechanism that will enhance the enforcement and
efficiency o f national procurement practices, and has commissioned a study to analyze the current
process for complaints, and to offer policy options. The paper i s due to be completed in the first half
o f 2007 and the RGoB i s expected to make a decision soon thereafter.

Assessingreadinessfor electronic governmentprocurement(e-GP)
89. The RGoB i s keen to move forward with the adoption o f electronic procurement, to make
government procurement more efficient and modem, and has commissioned an assessment study to
identify options and recommendations. The RGoB will devise an implementation strategy and action
plan for e-procurement prior to its adoption next fiscal year. This approach i s expected to help the
government establish an effective e-GP system which allows for more efficiency and transparency in
procurement.

PRIVATE SECTORDEVELOPMENT-ENHANCING THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE
FORPRIVATE SECTORGROWTHAND EMPLOYMENT GENERATION

90. Private sector development (PSD) has been accorded highpriority by the RGoB, and forms one
o f four key pillars in the 9FYP. Strengthening the private sector i s recognized as critical for
employment generation and sustainedpoverty reduction inthe country. With increasing globalization
and competition, a dynamic private sector-led growth strategy would help diversify the economic
base beyond the current mainstay o f hydropower, and decrease reliance on a single markevsingle
commodity export.

91. The development o f the private sector has been supported by policies aimed at strengthening
market forces, increasing competition and refocusing the role o f the government. Since the Sixth
Plan, the corporatizationo f government agencies and divestment o f government equity to the private
sector has been undertaken. This strategy resulted inmany o f the profitable state owned enterprises
(SOEs) coming into the private sector. Insubsequent plans, the private sector was designated as the
`engine o f growth,' with the state limiting its role to that o f an `enabler'. To facilitate a more
business friendly environment, the RGoB has initiated a broad range o f cross-cutting and sectoral
reforms, ranging from liberalizing the trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) regimes, to fully
transfemng the transport and tourism sectors to the private sector inthe 1990s.

92. The Bhutanese economy, nonetheless, continues to be dominated by the public sector, with the
majority o f the formal private sector continuing to be small in scale. The World Bank Group's
`Doing Business Report' (2007) and `Investment Climate Assessment' (2002) have identified several
constraints faced by private investors inrealizing opportunities inBhutan, including a small domestic
market, high transport costs and inadequate infrastructure (including roads and electricity),
regulations, labor and slull shortages, and a lack o f sufficient financing and business development
services. Bhutan ranked 138th out o f 175 countries on the ease o f starting a business in 2007. The
nascent nature o f the private sector, combined with the small size of the economy, has contributed to
the underdevelopment o f the financial sector in Bhutan in terms o f the variety o f financial products
and operational efficiency. Bhutan ranks 159th on the ease o f getting credit. Hence, the role o f the
private sector in the economy remains somewhat restricted with limited entrepreneurship. Cognizant
o f this, the RGoB i s following a two-pronged strategy for private sector development: (i)       improving
the investment climate (IC) to reduce the cost o f doing business; and (ii)       facilitating the growth o f
niche or priority sectors as potential sources o f growth and employment generation.'

93. The World Bank Group has been supporting PSD reforms in Bhutan through a program o f
policy dialogue, analytical work, development policy lending and TA. The DPG program, in
particular, supports the RGoB's efforts for improving the functioning o f labor markets through the
development o f flexible labor and employment laws and regulations; creating an enabling
environment for foreign direct investment (FDI); fostering the development of the private sector; and
reducing the cost o f doing business by simplifying the business registration process. The Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) has provided technical assistance in the development o f the
regulatory framework for FDI.The IFC-South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (IFC-SEDF) has
sought to play a catalytic role in the promotion o f small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and in the
buildingo f capacity inthe Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce andIndustry(BCCI) as well as infinancial
sector institutions. Limited capacity and the time needed for institution building constrains the pace
o f reform, but positive results are expected as implementation gathers momentum.

 (i) Improving the Functioning of Labor Markets Through the Development of Flexible Labor
     and Employment Laws


94. Rigidlabor markets constrain private sector growth. Bhutan ranks 116thworldwide on the ease
o f employing workers. Although procedures for dismissingworkers are relatively flexible, the cost o f
firing in terms o f advance notice requirements, severance payments and penalties i s one o f the
highest, at 95 times the weekly wage. The South Asia regional average stands at 72, which is more
than double the OECD average o f 31. Part o f the inflexibility in Bhutan's labor markets can be
explained by its segmentation: it i s estimated that non-nationals represent approximately 50 percent
o f total formal sector employment, and stringent restrictions exist for recruiting foreign workers.
When permitted, recruiting foreigners entails time-consuming procedures. To address these issues,
the RGoB has developed a more flexible labor policy, including laws and regulations to reduce
constraints for young people-who         are affected most by the rigid labor institutions-     infindingjobs.

95. Improving the functioning o f labor markets i s a priority for the government. A critical element
o f reform involved the passage o f the Labor and Employment Act, 2007, which aims to balance the
legitimate needs o f workers with the objective o f promoting private sector activity. Once fully
operational, this Act will: (i) Bhutanese, particularly youths, to be employed in a wider
                                      allow
spectrum o f economic activities; (ii)     permit more flexible workmg hours; (iii) night work in
                                                                                          allow
industries requiring round-the-clock work scheduling; and (iv) help streamline processes and reduce
the time required for recruiting foreign workers. A range o f reforms to streamline the process for
recruiting foreign workers were implementedrecently. Inparticular, an online recruitment system cut
the time needed to obtain permits for foreign workers from three months to three weeks by mid-2006.
Since then, the process has been further reduced to nine days. Inaddition, a one-stop service center
was established, allowing applicants to complete the formalities for foreign worker recruitment in
one place. To help operationalize the law, comprehensive rules and regulations are currently being
formulated.*

(ii) Creating an Enabling Environmentfor Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
96. Creating an enabling environment for FDIis an important element o f the RGoB's private sector
development and employment generation strategy. The overall objectives of encouraging FDIare to
broaden employment and training opportunities, benefit from technology and skills transfer, expand
the revenue base, and raise foreign exchange earnings.

97. Towards achieving these goals, a FDI Policy was approved in 2002. This provides a clear
policy on the regulation o f foreign investment, particularly the entry o f such investment, and on other
matters, including guarantees that pertain only to foreign investors. Accompanying FDI Rules and
Regulations were approved in December 2005, meeting an up-front action for DPG1. The approval
i s considered an important first step inhelping operationalize a transparent FDIregistration system. It
i s expected that this will give comfort and protection to foreign investors within the Bhutanese
regulatory framework. Efforts are also underway to draft an Industrial and Investment Act, which
would provide legal baclung to the FDIPolicy 2002. Once fully effective, the strengthened FDIlaw
and set o f policieshegulations should result in a significant increase in foreign investment. Initial
FDI gains are already apparent in the manufacturing sector and in the tourism sector - with the
establishment o f new high-end and internationally renowned hotels. Progress in attracting FDIcan be
gauged by increases in the number o f FDI inquiries and the amount o f FDI. The number o f FDI


`ADB is supporting this effort throughaTA. The rules andregulationsrelatedto OccupationalHealthand Safety(OHS)
andEmploymentAgencies that were approvedin 2005 shall berevisitedinlight ofthe newly approvedLaw.

proposals approved rose from 2 in 2000, to 4 in 2006. So far in 2007, one proposal has been
approved and 12 are in the pipeline. Intermediate measures also show increasing FDI interest in
Bhutan, and the number o f provisional registration certifications issued for FDI projects have
increased from two in 2005 to nine in 2006.'            The value o f FDI increased from US$3.5 million in
2003104 to US$9.0 million in2004/05.'0


(iii) Fostering theDevelopment of the PrivateSector
98. The RGoB recognizes the importance o f the private sector in sustaining growth and generating
employment opportunities, and has embarked on several cross-cutting initiatives in order to foster
PSD. These include:

Reinvigoratingthe Private Sector Development Committee (PSDC).


99. The PSDC was originally established in 2000 as a public-private consultative forum for
maintaining regular and structured dialogue on cross-cutting and sector-specific policies and
strategies for facilitating private sector development. The committee ceased operation in 2003. The
PSDC has been re-invigorated, chaired at the ministerial level with inter-departmental representation
and private sector participation. Quarterly consultative meetings are being held to maintain regular
and structured dialogue on cross-cutting and sector-specific policies and strategies for facilitating
private sector development. A White Paper, which lays out a comprehensive Private Sector
DeveIopment Strategy, has been prepared. The strategy covers different facets o f private sector
development. For the most part, the PSD reform program is proceeding forward. There has been an
increase in private sector growth, as indicated by an increase in the number o f licenses issued in the
manufacturing sector which are operational from 452 in2004, to 662 in2005, and 674 in2006.

Encouragingtourism development

100. To promote tourism - a key growth industry- a Tourism Development Master Plan has been
finalized and shared with stakeholders. The Plan provides a vision, roadmap and regulatory
framework for encouraging private sector entry and growth in the sector. To provide legal
underpinnings, a Tourism Act has been prepared, and i s expected to be submitted to the National
Assembly in June 2007. The sector has been very dynamic over the past few years, with tourist
arrivals rising from 9249 in 2004 to 13,626 in 2005 (a 47 percent increase), to 17,358 in 2006 (a
further 27 percent increase).

Fosteringinformation and communications technology
101. The RGoB's PSD Strategy aims to encourage the growth o f niche sectors as potential sources o f
growth and employment generation. Information and communications technology (ICT) - along with
other export-oriented industries       - i s one such sector which has been recognized as an "unmatched
developmental tool as well as an area o f new business and employment opportunities for all
Bhutanese people."     ''   ICT plays both to Bhutan's strengths and avoids some major constraints. For


 FDIregistrationcertificationis issuedupon clearanceof an investor's filing ofan FDIapplication. The next step involves
assessingprojectfeasibility. FDIinterest has beenexpressed inthe areas of steel, ferro silicon, and specialty fats, among
others.
loThese are provisionalfigures quoted inSelected Economic Indicators, RoyalMonetaryAuthority of Bhutan(RMA)

recommended in the Bhutan Private Sector Survey, June 2002, The World Bank. The report acknowledges that in central

instance, the provision o f ICT services benefits from the English-speakmg workforce and relatively
developed telecommunications network, while overcoming the mountainous terrain, extreme weather
and geographic isolation. In addition, the development o f this sector would help create jobs for the
increasing numbers o funemployed youth, and would be gender-sensitive inimpact. According to the
RGoB's Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Master Plan, the development and
application o f ICT will be guided by three broad policy objectives: use ICT as an integral tool to
enhance good governance; develop ICT and ICT-enabled industries in the private sector to generate
income and employment; and apply ICT to improve the livelihood o f all Bhutanese."                             The sector
also holds promise for improving productivity and increasing competitiveness in existing public and
private sectors and industries.

102. To guide ICT development, the Bhutan ICT Policy and Strategy (BIPS) calls for balanced and
sustainable development based on five pillars: policy, infrastructure, human capacity, contents and
applications, and enterprises. InJune 2006, the Bhutan Information, Communication & Media (ICM)
Act was approved. The purpose o f the ICMAct includes encouraging local and foreign investment in
the ICT and media industry by providing a modem regulatory framework that fosters a convergence
o f information, computing, media, and communications technologies, as well as facilitating
privatization and competition. Developing a niche market approach to private-sector development,
nonetheless, presumes that the government will also be able to deal with issues related to slulled
workers through government regulations; to promote greater technology transfer into Bhutan; to
address constraints imposed by the financial sector; and to gradually seek alternative methods o f
addressing the restrictions and higher costs imposed by the transport infrastructure. The RGoB is
currently preparing a program that i s to address these issues.

Implementingcorporate sector reforms
 103. Bhutan has sixteen listed companies and has experienced steady growth inmarket capitalization
driven in part by ongoing privatization. Equity markets, however, remain small with l o w turnover,
and the RGoB remains the largest owner o f shares. Planned reforms include revision o f the
Companies Act and a dedicated securities law. While the Companies Act provides a solid legal
foundation for corporate governance, the current framework has a number o f weaknesses; (i)                        there is
no focused securities market regulator and other institutions have limitedresources; (ii)                    shareholders
have little legal protection in the case o f certain major transactions, including changes in corporate
control; (iii)critical information on companies, including ownership information, i s not easily
accessed; (iv) domestic capacity for auditing and accounting i s limited; and (v) there is no code o f
corporate governance and little guidance i s provided for boards on board composition or board
duties, powers, or functions. Improving corporate governance to better protect investors, enhance
company oversight, and increase confidence incapital markets will require broad-based reform.

 104. Reforms under preparation include amendments to the Companies Act, informed by the ROSC
Report, the recently completed SOE study, and the Legal Reference Group formed under the
Registration Simplification project. These are part o f efforts to strengthen existing regulators and



Bhutan,high labor costs as well as higher transport costs make the development of many industries uneconomic. Instead,
these areas should focus on providing services to the heavier industrial belt along the southern border (increasingly
providing accounting services, I C T services, management, and financial services); providing other services such as tourism,
construction and transport;    and developing niche markets in specialized fields (mushrooms, essential oils, Himalayan
medicines, handicrafts, furniture).
`*The ICT Master Plan (June 2001) spells out national programs and initiatives to promote ICT. It identifies seven focus
areas that include: infrastructure, institutional arrangements, human resources and training, information management and
content development, regulations, guidelines and legislation, public access and awareness, and private sector development.

introduce greater auditing oversight, and the RGoB plans to submit the amendments to the National
Assembly by the end o f 2008.

Expanding access to credit and strengthening the financial infrastructure
105. Access to credit has been identified as a significant constraint on private sector development,
especially regarding small- and medium-scale enterprises. Expanding the range o f financial services
being offered particularly through the use o f ICT, and improving the efficiency o f the sector - which
i s dominated by public sector institutions and lacks competition     - i s a key priority. The RGoB i s
endeavoring to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for the supervisory function o f the
Royal Monetary Authority ( M A ) with regard to the expansion o f financial services and the use o f
electronic payment practices in commercial banks. This entails amending the Negotiable Instrument
Act 1997 (NI.4) and the Financial Service Act (FSA), and submittingthese to the National Assembly.
(iv) Reducing the Cost of Doing Business by Simplifling the Business Registration Process
106. As part o f its efforts to foster private sector development and employment creation, the RGoB
seeks to address regulatory constraints to new business creation. In2005, Doing Business found that
starting a business and becoming an incorporated entity required 11 steps and 62 days. This was
reduced to 10 steps and 43 days as o f April 2007, but Bhutan is still well above the regional average
o f eight procedures and 33 days, and the OECD average o f six procedures and 17 days. The
procedures required for an incorporated entity are numerous due, in part, to the involvement o f a
number o f different agencies, each o f which requires information about the individual applicants
and/or the potential enterprise. To reduce the steps, reforms should address the exchange of data
between various parts o f the government and reduce redundancy in requests for information from
new enterprises.

107. To encourage the growth o f small and micro trade businesses (firms with a turnover of less than
Nu. 1million), new simplified regulations havebeenissued as articulated intheBhutanMicro Trade,
Retail trade and FKholesale Trade Regulations 2006. With regard to addressing the entry issues for
medium and large firms (those governed by the Companies Act), a diagnostic study o f the business
registration process was completed in the first half o f 2006 as part o f a technical assistance project
with IFC-SEDF, followed by an implementationplan in October 2006. With the recent endorsement
o f the implementation plan by stakeholders, a comprehensive revision o f the registration process
began in early February 2007, and i s expected to be completed by the end o f December 2007.          As
noted above, the RGoB has inthe interim undertaken a few simplification measures that have led to a
reduction o f days from 62 to 43 days (an up-front action for DPG2). The reduction in registration
time to 43 days was achieved through quicker processing and the elimination o f one step: the
Registrar of Companies no longer requires approval for the company's name from the Intellectual
Property Division o f MTI. The RGoB has also been mindful o f processing time, reducing the time
needed for registration inthe Registrar o f Companies to four days, from 15.

108. The reform program for business registration will consolidate registration and licensing
functions to create a Registrar o f Enterprises (ROE),and create a one-stop window for registrationo f
all types o f business entities (sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and the like). Passage
o f an Enterprise Act will establish the legal framework for the ROEand facilitate various forms o f
business entities. The RGoB i s currently designing reforms to simplify specific sector clearance
processes, assisted by the IFC-SEDF. The current sectoral clearance process i s not transparent and
can be very time consuming.

109. The original DPG2 upfront action established a goal o f reducing registration time to 47 days
(the South Asian average at the time). With full implementation o f reform recommendations and the



                                                    34

creation of the ROE,registration will be completed with only five steps and in less than 20 days. In
response to the simplification and passage o f the Enterprise Act, it i s expected that the number of
registered companies will increase as well. A concerted and coordinated reform effort on the part o f
the RGoB will be needed in order to follow through with these initiatives and further facilitate
businessregistration.

Upfront actionsfor DPG2:
(4 of 8): TheLabor and Employment Act is submitted to the National Assembly by July 2006. Status:
Completed.

(5 of 8): The business registration process is simplified, including the number ofprocedures, time
taken and costs involved, by March 2007. Status: Completed.

EDUCATIONREFORM-AUGMENTING THE QUALITY OFAND ACCESS TO
EDUCATION

110. Improving access to quality education are major objectives o f the RGoB, as described by the
9FYP. Duringthis planningperiod, the RGoB's education sector goals have been to:

          Increaseprimary gross enrollment to 90-95 percent;
     0   Raise the promotion rates from grade 10 to grade 11from 38 to 56 percent;
         Develop tertiary education through the newly-established Royal University o f Bhutan;
          Increase the literacy rate from 54 to 80 percent;
          Establisha program o f inclusive education for children with special needs; and
     0   Develop a more sustainable system through private participationand cost-sharing.


111. Duringthe 9FYP period, and accounting for revisedpopulation figures per the 2005 census, the
RGoB has made impressive gains in the education sector. These include increases in the gross
primary enrollment ratio from 81 to 102 percent, and an increase inthe net primary enrollment ratio
from 62 to 79 percent. With the results o f the 2005 census exercise, it i s now possible to calculate
several education indicators for the first time with increased accuracy. About half o f the population
i s less than 23 years o f age. Overall, Bhutan has about 190,000 students and learners, including
approximately 18,000 monks and nuns. This accounts for approximately 30 percent o f the total
population.

112. At present, under the general education system in Bhutan, there are 245 community primary
schools, 88 primary schools, 16 private primary schools, 84 lower secondary schools, 28 middle
secondary schools, 21 higher secondary schools, and 7 private higher secondary schools. There are
646 non-formal education centers and 5 private day care centers. There are also 2 Sanskrit Pathsalas
as well as the National Institute for the Disabled. Each dzongkhag with the exception o f Gasa (the
only dzongkhag not accessible by road) provides basic education for its children, such that they can
study from lundergarten to grade 10.

113. Bhutan i s on track to achieving the second MDG o f ensuring universal primary education. A
major hurdle is that significant disparities in enrollment and other education indicators continue to
exist between rural and urban areas. Bhutan has undertaken numerous initiatives to realize the
Education for All (EFA) goals and targets which it committed to at Jomtien in 1990 and Dakar in
2000. These have been incorporated into the national education policy and programs. The Ministry



                                                    35

o f Education i s interested in exploring experience elsewhere o f instituting targeted demand-side
interventions in order to encourage increased participation o f girls at the middle and higher
secondary education levels. To date, Bhutan's education system has been largely supply driven. A s
the targets for universalprimary enrollment, for example, are likely to be met soon, the potential role
o f demand-side interventions is being examined more closely.

114. According to Bhutan's 2005 MDG progress report, the country still faces several critical
challenges as it seeks to consolidate its rapid gains ineducation. These include:

     0  Enhancingthe outreach o f primary education to children inrural and remote communities
        and others who are unable to enroll in schools;
        Improving the quality o f education inthe light o f overcrowding inclassrooms, a shortage o f
        qualified teachers, and inadequate learning resources; and
     0  Improving monitoring and evaluation o f the entire system inorder to inform sound policy
        development and planning.
115. These major areas o f system development were the focus o f actions undertaken under the first
DPG operation, and continue as priority areas for improvement and reform under the follow-on
operation, DPG2.

(9 ImprovingAccess toSchooling

 116. The current enrollment for primary education implies that around 20 percent o f children
between ages 6 and 12 are still out o f school, equivalent to approximately 20,000 Bhutanese children.

Indicator                                                                                Ratio (YO)

GERprimary education from kmdergarten to grade 10 (basic education)                         84.8


 117. Over the years, the Ministry o f Education (MoE) has made concerted efforts to provide
education opportunities to population groups living inrural and remote parts o f the country. This has
been possible in large measure through the establishment o f community primary schools (CPSs). A
CPS caters to a specific community (i.e. a village or defined cluster o f villages) wherein all
households in the locality contribute toward the construction and maintenance o f the school. The
RGoB provides support in the form o f building materials and the payments for shlled labor,
teaching-learning materials and teachers. There are currently 245 CPSs in Bhutan. There has also
been a considerable expansion, through IDA-financed and other donor-assisted projects, of schooling
at the primary and secondary levels, as the RGoB continues to focus on expanding access.

 118. Under DPG2, an additional 26 CPSs and one primary school were established to reach
populations o f children inrural and remote areas who are still out o f school, or are only able to attend
schools far from their homes. This builds upon the 23 CPSs established under DPG1, and i s expected
to result in net enrollment increases, particularly in areas where the most remote populations
remained under-served. Future measures to increase access through the establishment o f additional
CPSs will be based on analytical work to review and assess the efficacy o f this strategy, and identify



                                                    36

other potentially effective initiatives aimed at addressing demand-side factors. The outcome o f
analytical work will inform policy-making and planning as Bhutan attempts to reach the enrolment-
related MDGby 2015.


 (ii) Raising the Quality of Schooling
119. There i s general concern over a perceived decline in the standard of education that has
accompanied the expansion o f schooling inrecent years, and the M o E has been challenged by rapid
growth in the number o f students. Duringthe 9FYP period, student numbers at the secondary level
(grades 7-12) have increased from almost 32,000 to over 43,000, or nearly 37 percent. Duringthe
lOFYP period to June 2013, this number is expected to rise another 32 percent to nearly 60,000
secondary students.     Creating adequate space and training teachers to accommodate this large
increase instudent numbers has been a major challenge. Enrollments are expected to level o f f by the
end o f lOFYPperiod.

120. Given the constraints brought on by rapid increases in enrollment, education quality has been at
the top o f the national agenda. The M o E i s working to provide high quality: (i)        teachers; (ii)
infrastructure and facilities; and (iii)curricula. Efforts to enhance the quality o f teachers are being
made through improved pre-service and in-service teacher training, as well as raising entry
requirements and the quality o f instructors at the country's two teacher training institutes. T o
improve the quality o f infrastructure and facilities, the RGoB has increased the number o f schools,
and inexisting schools, added additional classrooms, science laboratories, libraries and multipurpose
halls. Efforts are also underway to improve textbook distribution and supply, as well as the
availability o f computer and library resources.

121. A number o f activities aim at improving the quality and delivery o f curricula. The issue o f
education quality has been raised several times in meetings o f the CoM, and an 88-point directive
was issued in 2006 by the Prime Minister on education quality. A key development has been the
establishment o f a high-level Education Review Commission (ERC) which will assess the overall
state o f the education system inBhutan, with particular emphasis on education quality, and will table
its report and findings inNovember 2007.

122. Concerted effort has been placed on improving the teaching-learning o f the core subjects o f
English, Dzongkha (the national language) and mathematics. IDA i s currently supporting the reform
o f the Mathematics curriculum under the on-going Education Development Project (EDP), and
Canadian donor financing supports Englishcurriculum reform. A significant amount o f training has
been provided inrecent years to curriculum development and subject specialists from the Curriculum
and Professional Support Division (CAPSD) o f the MoE, including under all three IDA-financed
operations in the education sector (the Primary Education Project, Second Education Project and
EducationDevelopment Project) over the past 15 years.

123. D P G l supported the development o f a curriculum framework for Englishfrom kindergarten to
grade 12, as the initial step in the process for the overall curriculum reform at each level o f
schooling. DPG2 will continue to emphasize maintaining momentum for carrying out this multi-
staged process to revise the English curriculum by highlighting the completion o f textbooks and
teacher guides from grade five-12, the training o f teachers inthe use o f these new materials for use at
the start o f the 2007 academic year, and the preparation o f materials for lundergarten to grade four.
DPG2 has also highlighted the role o f the ERC and its work to cany out a survey on education
quality with the financial support o f the Education Program Development Fund (EPDF), a
multilateral global education fundingmechanismmanaged by the World Bank.



                                                    37

124. Follow-on actions include the completion o f textbooks and teacher manuals for Englishat all
levels o f primary and secondary education, and the issuance o f a final report o f the quality survey by
the ERC, as a means o f informing policy-making. The outcomes o f these measures are expected to
improve student competency in English, and support policies more relevant to the quality
improvementneeds o f Bhutan's education system.
(iii) Improving the Education Management Information System (EMIS)
125. The RGoB has undertaken a number o f important measures to improve the EMIS. These
include:

              0  Decentralizationo f the management o f schools to dzongkhags and to schools
                 themselves;
                 Monitoring and support through networks o f cluster schools drawing on lead
                 teachers; and
              0  Training Dzongkhag Education Officers and school heads ineffective leadership and
                 management.
126. The M o E publishes an annual statistical review. In the past, data collection was carried out
centrally. In recent years, data collection has been decentralized to the dzongkhag and school levels.
This is largely inresponse to both the need for more accurate data, as well as the impact on the data
management system o f the rapid expansion o f schooling.

127. The Policy and PlanningDivision (PPD) o f the M o E i s still responsible for the final compilation
o f education statistics and the analysis o f data for the purposes o f informing policy formulation.
Long-term technical assistance i s currently inplace inthe MoE, financed by Denmark, which aims to
improve the management o f education data and generate more accurate budget information.

128. Under DPG1, the development o f a concept paper for reforming the EMIS was highlighted. A
prototype system has been developed, and the EMIS i s being piloted to ascertain its efficacy prior to
national implementation. The piloting o f the new system through workshops for central and
dzongkhag level users, and the availability o f a first version o f the reformed EMIS for use in
producing the annual education statistics for 2008, i s being highlighted by the DPG2.


Upfront actionsfor DPG2:
(6 of 8): Establishment of 20 new CPSs in remote and/or undersewed areas to increase enrollment
at theprimary level toward achievement of the enrollment-related MDG target. Status: Completed.

(7 of 8): The reformed EMIS system is to be developed and implemented by piloting the system
through workshopsfor central and dzongkhag level users by April 2007. Status: Completed.


IMPROVINGHEALTHCARE UTILIZATION


129. The RGoB places a highpriority on providing universal health care to its population, which i s
publicly provided and financed. In2005/06, about nine percent o f the national budget was allocated
to health care. There are no private providers. Health spending has been gradually increasing, and
the RGoB i s beginning to assess options to increase the sustainability o f health financing. Roughly
half o f health expenditures are financed by external donors, mainly the Government o f India,
DANIDAandIDA.



                                                  38

130. The health care system i s primary care oriented. Public health care i s provided through one
National Referral Hospital in Thimphu, two regional referral hospitals (inMongar and Gelephu) and
26 district hospitals (including three from the armed forces), as well as a network o f 176 Basic
Health Units (BKUs) and 485 Outreach Clinics (ORCs) spread throughout the country. Outreach
clinics are served by a network o f 1,400 trained village health workers (VHW) who serve as the
primary link between the health sector and communities. Hospitals provide secondary and some
tertiary care, though most specialized care i s referred to other countries like India and Thailand. The
RGoB sends about 600-700 patients abroad annually (mostly to India) for specialized care not
available in Bhutan.

131. Available information indicates that the health and well-being o f the Bhutanese population has
improved steadily over the past two de~ades.'~Life expectancy increased from 60 years in 1991 to
66 years in 2003. Bhutan's population growth has declined significantly, from 3.1 percent in 1994 to
2.5 percent in 2000, to 1.3 percent in 2005, and its population i s aging. Although it still has a
relatively young population, it is older than estimated prior to the 2005 Census, and considerably
older than its neighbors, India and Bangladesh. The latest information indicates that approximately
33 per cent o f the population i s under the age o f 15 years (rather than the 40 percent estimated in
2004) and 62 per cent are between the ages o f 15 and 64. These changes in age structure have
brought about changes in its epidemiological profile, with Bhutan gradually acquiring a double
burden o f diseases common to countries at similar stages o f the epidemiological transition. This
means that while the main causes o f death continue to include communicable diseases and maternal
and peri-natal causes, there i s a growing incidence of non-communicable and chronic conditions
including cancer, injuries and cardiovascular problems stemming from larger cohorts at older ages
and changing life styles, particularly in urban areas. Alcoholism has also gained prominence among
causes o f death. At present, the health care system i s primarily focused on the former.

132. Although data on health status are scarce, the recent census noted considerable progress with
respect to the achievement o f some MDGs and suggests that Bhutan i s likely to achieve most o f its
health-related MDGs by 2015. Three MDGs have already been attained: reducing the number o f
underweight children under-five years o f age, and raising the proportion o f the population with
access to improved sanitation, and improved access to safe water. The majority o f the other health-
related MDGs (stunted children under five, infant and child mortality rates, and cases o f
tuberculosis) are likely to be achieved, and the final two (cases o f malaria and births attended by
skdled personnel), which seemed less likely to be achieved, have improved more than expected over
the last three years.

133. Crude birthrates declined from 34.1 to 20.0 per 1,000 between 2000 and 2005 (2005 Census),
probably resulting from increased access to family planning. Important gains have also been made
with respect to mortality, with the crude death rate declining from 8.6 to 7.0 per 1,000 during the
same period. The infant mortality rate decreased from 102.8 to 60.5 to 40.1 (per 100,000) between
1984, 2000 and 2005, and the child mortality rate fell from 162.4 to 84.0 to 61.5 (per 100,000) over
the same years. Both o f these rates are considerably lower than in India, Pakistan, Nepal and
Bangladesh. It i s likely that the marked reduction in infant and child mortality i s partly due to an
effective immunization policy and broader access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Bhutan
achieved universal child immunization in 1990. Access to safe drinlung water and sanitation also


l3 Household data are available from the National Household Census o f 2005, the BLSS carried out in 2003, and two
National Health Surveys carried out by RGoB in 1994 and 2000. Data are available on reproductive and child health
including nutrition. On other health conditions, data are available from annual health bulletins, though the numbers are not
as reliable, since they are based on service statistics.



                                                            39

expanded, rising from about 30 percent in 1994 to about 70 percent in 2001, and to 84 percent in
2005. Access to safe water plays an important role in reducing the incidence o f diarrhea related
illness.

134. Maternal mortality, although declining, continues to be high. Further reductions in the MMR
can only be achieved through better access to safer deliveries, carried out by adequately trained
personnel, preferably taking place in facilities offering Essential Obstetric Care (EOC)), improved
access to quality antenatal care (ANC), and improved health promotion and education at the
community level.

135. Success in addressing new and existing diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS and malaria, has been
marked. The HIV/AIDSprevention and treatment program has expanded significantly, having begun
to establish a solid multi-sectoral prevention response, expanding HIV testing to all dzonkhags, and
providing treatment to all who need it. While generally positive, progress with regard to malaria i s
mixed. Caseloads have declined over time, as have the number o f deaths, but the incidence o f
Plasmodium Falciparum, while lower than in 1999, continues to be high. TB, however, remains
among the top ten causes o f death. Case detection rates remain unchanged at 73 percent in2004, with
treatment success rates also showing little change, declining slightly from 87 percent in 2000 to 83
percent in2004.14

136. Some o f the main challenges faced by the health sector in providing universal access to health
care have to do with the difficulty o f access (communication and transport) posed by the rugged
terrain and scattered settlements, and the general shortage o f human resources for health, particularly
o f specialized personnel at the dzongkhag level. Both factors contribute to a fragmentation o f health
care networks. Staffing i s insufficient, and capacity, although improving through ongoing training
programs inside and outside the country, continues to be insufficient. Several district hospitals
continue to have only one physician, and frequent transfers o f personnel to other posts, or to receive
training outside Bhutan, make it more difficult to maintain a cadre o f staff in situ. Inadequate quality
o f care i s also an issue that the M o H i s trying to resolve.

137. While physical access (supply factors) i s an important determinant o f health care utilization,
insufficient demand for services also needs to be addressed. Poor health seelung behavior due to
insufficient knowledge about the benefits o f preventive and curative services constrains demand, as
do local beliefs and practices regarding health and illness that indicate alternative solutions to
existing health conditions. According to available surveys, between 15 and 22 percent of Bhutanese
who are sick or injured do not seek health care.       lS


138. The DPGsupports policy and institutionalreforms beingundertaken by the M o H inthree areas:
(a) reducing maternal mortality and morbidity; (b) reducing sexually transmitted infections to curb
HIVtransmission; and(c) improvingthe quality o fcare.
(i) Increasing the Utilization of InstitutionalDelivery Care to Contribute to a Reduction of
Maternal Mortality andMorbidity (an MDG)
139. Further reductions in maternal deaths will not be achieved unless complications can be treated
swiftly which means both supply factors (adequately trained delivery attendants, Comprehensive
Obstetric Care (COC), functioning referral networks) and demand factors (health education and
promotion, community participation) affecting access to safe delivery need to be addressed. The

goal o f the 9FYP was to expand access to COC, but insufficient human resources have limited the
RGoB's progress. Essential Obstetric Care (EOC), however, i s available in all hospitals. Another
important constraint has been insufficient demand for delivery care in some areas. DPGl sought to
support MoH's efforts toward this goal through the development o f a draft strategy to increase
institutional deliveries by increasing demand for services and introducing improvements in the
organization o f the referral network and links to communities. This would complement the RGoB's
ongoing strategy to increase the number o f facilities providing COC.

140. The Strategy was prepared but was not piloted in 2006 because it became evident that frequent
transfers o f medical personnel made it difficult to establish better functioning referral networks. A
decision was made to focus more on demand-side factors, including healthpromotion and community
mobilization, in order to improve the link between the community and health facilities. Although
some delays were experienced in the revision o f the strategy due to insufficient in-house capacity to
design the communications and community mobilization strategy, it has now been revised and the
pilot has been launched. The M o H carried out a situation analysis in the two sites selected for the
pilot (3 Geogs from Trongsa and another 3 from Mongar) inMarch 2007, to assess both health sector
and community facilities/options for emergency transport, community maternity "waiting homes," as
well as identify local groups and leaders that could carry out health promotion for improved
utilization o f delivery care and conduct interviews to assess why couples opt for home deliveries.
The information obtained through the situation analysis helped to design the pilot. The piloting o f
the strategy will continue until June 2008, and a mid-term assessment will be carried out in early
December 2007. Based on lessons learned from the assessment, guidelines will be developed for the
expansion o f the pilots (by the end o f December 2007) to four additional districts (with all four
functioning by June 2008), and expanded further to the whole country by December 2008. The
expected outcome i s increased utilization o f facility-based delivery care, measured by an increase in
the proportion o f all births that are delivered inhealth facilities fiom 40 percent in2004 to 55 percent
in2008. The current value (2006) is49 percent.


(io ReduceSexually TransmittedInfections (STIs)toPrevent Transmissionof H I V


 141. Bhutan has a very low prevalence o f HIV (about 0.01percent), but the number o f detected cases
i s growing exponentially (due both to improved detection and disease progression), and the presence
o f risk factors i s significant. Factors associated with higher rates o f transmission in other countries
are also present in Bhutan, such as high rates o f sexually transmitted infections (STIs), multiple
sexual partners, commercial sex, and high mobility within and outside the country. The RGoB has
launched a broad multi-sectoral response involving various stakeholders within and outside
government to encourage the population to adopt preventive behaviors. Communications activities
are also ongoing through various media. Activities designed to reach high risk groups are being
designed. The only area in prevention that had not been adequately addressed has been the effective
reduction in the prevalence of STIs, which are associated with increasing susceptibility to HIV
infection. STIs are on the increase in Bhutan and there i s strong evidence that the antibiotics being
used to treat STIs have become ineffective due to the growing resistance o f existing strains to
penicillin, the main drug used to treat STIs. The RGoB conducted a Gonoccocal Susceptibility Study
to determine the level of resistance to penicillin to adjust its policy on STI management, which
confirmed that 93 percent o f all cases were resistant to penicillin with only the last seven percent
indicating intermediate sensitivity. Given the importance o f adopting more effective treatment o f
STIs to prevent further transmission o f HIV,the introduction o f an adjusted STI treatment policy was
included inthe DPGprogram of reformmeasures.




                                                     41

142. The M o H has moved firmly on this reform. Given the clarity o f the results o f the study, the
National Drug Committee approved ceftriaxone as the first line treatment for STIs at BHUs on
January 10, 2006. A new draft o f the National Guidelines for STI Syndromic Management was
prepared by May 2006 and the training o f trainers o f health facility staff began in June 2006.
Training o f all BHU staff (basic health workers) was completed in February, well ahead o f the
expected June 2007 date. The first procurement o f the new drugs has been completed, and the drugs
are expected to be distributed to District Hospitals by the end o f April 2007 and to BHUs by the
beginning o f May. Non-resistant STI treatment i s to be available and prescribed across the country
bymid-2007, a year sooner than previously anticipated.

143. The expected outcome i s reduced overall resistance to treatment, which will be measured as part
o f the continuation o f the Gonoccoccal Susceptibility Study being carried out at clinical labs inorder
to monitor resistance. Resistance to available drugs i s expected to decrease from an average o f 93
percent at present, to 80 percent of cases (by June 2007), and to 40 percent o f cases by June 2008.

 (iii) Improve Overall Quality of Health Care

144. Having significantly expanded the health care infrastructure in recent years, the RGoB has
shifted its focus to improving the quality of services. T o this end, a Quality Assurance and
Standardization Division (QASD) reporting directly to the Secretary, and a Health Technology and
Quality Committee (HTQC) were established (recently renamed the Quality Assurance Group,
(QAG)). The group is to function as a steering committee, and lead efforts to introduce quality
assurance methodologies in the daily management o f healthcare services. Quality assurance (QA)
teams have been set up in all 26 hospitals. These steps were highlighted in DPGl due to their
importance inimproving the quality o f care.

145. Although some progress i s evident in this reform area, it i s less than expected. The adoption o f
new approaches has been slow due to the lack o f a results-based environment, limited understanding
o f the concepts o f quality assurance and the role o f the indicators in tracking quality improvements,
and insufficient attention. Despite these challenges, however, some progress has been made. A
Quality Assurance Manual has been developed, and all but five QA teams have been sensitized on
QA principles and standardization. Although much needed more in-depth training was initiated in
December 2006, to date, only Samtse, Punakha, Bajo and Par0 hospitals have received the training.
A small amount o f funds were released to QA teams to implementtheir actionplans in 17hospitals.

146. A survey questionnaire to assess the quality o f care through interviews with providers and
beneficiaries was carried out in all hospitals inMay-June 2006, inorder to obtain baseline values for
proposed quality assurance indicators. It i s expected that the data collected will be used to select 10
indicators to: (a) form part o f a self-assessment tool to be applied on a semi-annual basis, and (b) be
externally applied (by the MoH) biannually to assess overall progress. At the district level, results o f
the baseline are being used to guide the content o f training and development o f individual QA action
plans to address areas o f weakness identified in the survey. The process for development and
implementation o f action plans, however, has not been systematized as various approaches are being
applied.

147. Inorder to systematize and pilot the application o f the 10 indicators, they were to be piloted first
in Par0 District Hospital (by April 2007) and then in two additional hospitals (in Gelephu and
Trongsa) by June 2007. However, to date, only the data on user satisfaction has been analyzed, and
provider based data are not yet available. The QASD noted that delays in analysis are due to
insufficient knowledge on development and application o f the questionnaires and generating



                                                    42

indicators, and the pilots to apply the 10 indicators have not been launched. At present, the only
indicators available require interviews with patients, limitingthe system's applicability. It i s evident
that the approach to facility-based QA needs to be revised. A proposal as to how QA will be applied,
inlight ofthe problems encountered, will bepreparedbyJune 15,2007.

148. At the district level, it was expected that QA teams would be functioning in three district
hospitals by June 2007, and in seven additional districts by June 2008. A mechanism to identify and
reward well performing unitswithinthe hospital i s to be designed and launchedby June 2008. Three
QA teams were to demonstrate that: (a) they are applying the 5 "s" principles as indicatedby a report
by QASD; and (b) having monthly meetings (including preparing minutes o f the meetings) for the
facility by June 2007. T o date, monthly meetings have not beenheld (Gelephu and Trongsa hospitals
met once since January 2007), and the application o f the 5 'ls" principles has only just begun
(application o f the first 'Is") in two o f the three hospitals (Gelephu and Trongsa). Supervision visits
bythe M o Hhavenot beencarriedout. Thus, this aspect o fthe reformprogram is also delayed.

149. The expected outcome i s improved quality of care at district hospitals and is to be assessed as
the percentage o f hospitals (including five level 1 BHUs) that have at least one doctor present
between 10-12 am on a given day. The baseline (January 2005) is 72 percent. The estimate for June
2007 i s 100 percent. The indicator for June 2008 measures the number o f hospitals where there were
at least two doctors present, and the figure i s expected to be 100 percent.

Upfront actionsfor DPG2:

(8 of 8): Design apilot in 2-3 geogs linked to a BHU in two districts (Trongsa and Mongar) to test
new initiatives to increase community awareness and health promotion interventions regarding
antenatal and deliveiy care, and to strengthen communityparticipation in this area, linking the
community more directly with health services. Thesituation analysis and actionplanfor thepilot
would be submitted on March 15, 2007 and thepilot would begin on April 15, 2007. Status:
Completed.



                               VI.    OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION


POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS

 150. The project i s expected to yield positive social impacts by providing rural communities
opportunities to access schools and quality health care systems. The project will involve the direct
and systematic participation o f beneficiary communities in the selection, implementation and
maintenance o f the community schools and health care services.

 151. The proposed operation seeks to provide sound macroeconomic and fiscal underpinnings for
continued steady economic growth to help improve the quality o f life for all sections o f the
population. Measures to increase incomes, as well as enhance access to basic services, information,
education and health services-with            a special focus on remote, under-served areas-will      be
particularly beneficial to the poor. Efforts to improve the investment climate for private sector
growth and employment generation will create new opportunities and reduce the dependence of the
poor on agricultural employment.




                                                       43

152. Social indicators continue to show improvement and Bhutan i s on track in meeting most o f the
MDGs. The RGoB continues to spend heavily on the provision o f public services like health and
education, especially inremote areas. The proposed DPG2 supports further progress toward meeting
these objectives.


IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGAND EVALUATION


153. The Department of Aid and Debt Management (DADM), Ministry o f Finance will be
responsible for overall implementation o f the DPG2. The RGoB has established an inter-ministerial
group o f officials, headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance to provide overall coordination for
DPG2. This group has been working with the Bank team since the inception o f the proposed
operation.

154. The Bank team will supervise the project by monitoring actions and reviewing implementation
progress o f the proposed operation. The Policy Program Matrix (Annex I)     o f the proposed operation
provides a results fiamework that describes expected outcomes at the end o f the program, as well as
indicatorsby which to gauge progress and monitor interim steps.

155. Monitoring and evaluation remains challenging, as significant data gaps and uncertainties are
still being addressed. The RGoB remains committed to strengthening its systems for monitoring and
evaluation. While considerable gains have been made in strengthening technical capacity in the
sectors directly involved in the DPG, a lack o f capacity i s a major constraint to Bhutan's overall
development (see below the sub-section on risks). This i s often cited as a reason for delayed progress
inproject activitiesacross sectors, andwide-ranging technical assistance inputsare includedas apart
o f most donor-financed operations inBhutan.

156. As the DPG2 operation evolves, country circumstances, including technical capacity may
change. This i s expected to be the case particularly in light o f the pending transition to a system o f
democratic governance. Decision-making on the identification o f feasible options for achieving
development goals will need to be flexible. Hence, while maintaining a clear focus on the desired
impactloutcomes o f the program, the Bank team also recognizes the importance o f linking ongoing
monitoring to decision-making on appropriate adjustments to reflect these realities.


FIDUCIARYASPECTS


157. Financial Management. The Bank team has been deeply engaged in financial management
issues, through an extensive TA program and supervision activities on investment projects, as well as
the DPG2 support to the RGoB's ongoing reform program, as described above. While several major
challenges remain (including the timeliness o f accounting and reporting, the monitoring o f financial
performance, the effectiveness o f internal audits, and the execution o f other control functions), the
core elements of an effective financial management system are largely in place. Progress i s also
being made in strengthening the capacity o f the accountability and oversight institutions, and
establishing the necessary legal underpinnings needed to ensure that the financial management and
transparency demands arising from the increased revenues and spending expected over the coming
years are met.

158. The positive trajectory o f improvements in financial management stems from the RGoB's
commitment to: (a) strengthen the legal framework; (b) bolster the institutional framework; (c)



                                                  44

enhance the financial management information system, and (d) strengthen the oversight o f public
finances. Together, these actions are aimed at increasing accountability and improving the timeliness,
quality, transparency and reliability o f the RGoB's accounting and reporting functions. These
positive steps, as well as the RGoB's demonstrated focus on results and strong commitment for
continuedPFMreforms, provide a satisfactory basis for proceedingwith the proposed budget support
through DPG2.

159. The IMF has not carried out a Safeguards Assessment o f the Royal Monetary Authority,
Bhutan's central bank. As part o f the appraisal for the first DPGoperation, however, the audit report
and published annual financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2005 were reviewed by the
Bank. The audit opinion provided by the auditor, a private firm o f chartered accountants from
Kolkata, India was unqualified. The accounts and audit were compiled and conducted in accordance
with generally accepted audit standards. Based on the audit report and the satisfactory track record
inthe operation of special accounts in several IDA-financedinvestment operations which havebeen
held in the RMA, it may be concluded that the Bank has reasonable assurance that the control
environment for foreign exchange at the RMA is satisfactory for the purposes o f the DPG2.

160. Procurement. External donors have looked favorably on the national procurement system, and
have relied on it to a significant degree. Still, the RGoB recognizes that there are a number of areas
which need to be further improved, and together with the Bank and other development partners,
efforts are underway to harmonize around the use of Bhutan's fiduciary (including procurement) and
safeguards systems. As noted above, there i s a deepening engagement on procurement issues, and the
RGoB i s committed to moving forward on key items o f their reform program, including: (a) revising
the procurement manual (including drafting and issuing standard bidding and request for proposal
documents); (b) creating a central procurement policy mechanism; (d) improving capacity through
procurement training (improving implementation o f rules and facilitating decentralization o f
procurement functions), and (e) establishing a procurement grievance mechanism (strengthening
enforcement). Overall, the procurement risk can be gauged as medium, but inpartnership with other
donor agencies, the Bank team i s working with the RGoB to continue moving forward on fiduciary
reforms. Over time, these steps are expected to enable universalreliance on own-country systems.


DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

161. Once the Grant i s approved by the Board and becomes effective, the RGoB will submit to the
IDA a withdrawal application. IDA will disburse the US dollar proceeds o fthe Grant inone tranche
to the credit of the RGoB's account with the RMA. This account will be part o f Bhutan's official
foreign exchange reserves. An amount equivalent to the grant proceeds will be credited into the
Government Consolidated Account, which i s available to finance budgeted expenditures.
Transactions and balances o f the account will be promptly and fully incorporated into the
Government's accounting records and financial statements. The RGoB will confirm to the Bank
within 30 days o f disbursement, the receipt o f these funds and its credit into the Government
Consolidated Account o f the country (including the date and namehumber o f the government's bank
account in which the funds have been deposited). The administration o f this grant will be the
responsibility o f the Ministryof Finance.

162. Disbursement o f the grant proceeds would not be linked to specific purchases. However, the
RGoB would not use the grant proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank's standard
negative list which includes expenditures on military hardware and environmentally hazardous




                                                    45

goods. If any portion o f the Grant i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the
Development Grant Agreement, IDA shall require the RGoB to refund the amount to IDA.


ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS


163. The DPG2 is a sequel to the first development policy loan and continues to target the four
components previously supported by DPGl, as well as an additional component on procurement.
The reforms supported in DPG2 include: a) ensuring the maintenance o f a sound macroeconomic
framework, and strengthening fiscal policy; b) bolstering fiduciary systems in the areas o f financial
management and procurement; c) enhancing the investment climate for private sector growth and
employment generation; d) augmenting the quality o f and access to education; and e) improving
health care utilization. The environmental screening of the DPGprogram (including the newly added
procurement component), concluded that it will have no adverse environmental impacts. This i s
described inthe environmental screening matrix inAnnex 2.


RISKS AND R I S K MITIGATION

164. Set against the expected benefits o f the program, there are some risks which need to be
mitigated and managed. While broadly similar to those identified inDPGl, their relative ordering has
been revised inthe light o f recent developments.

165. Politicalrisks. The major political changes underway include the recent abdication o f the King
and replacement by his son, the planned formation o f political parties, the expected approval o f the
new Constitution, the upcoming legislative elections, and the formation o f a new government in
2008. To a large extent, mitigation o f political risks lies outside the scope o f this proposed project,
but sustainability is helped by the extensive and careful preparation o f the ongoing changes in
governance, and the strong ownership o f the reform program by the current government (and civil
service). Indeed, the RGoB views the reform program as an important source o f continuity through
the transition.

166. Externalshocks. As a small landlocked country, Bhutan faces several vulnerabilities on this
front, including, most notably, the heavy reliance on hydropower for its budget, balance o f payments,
and growth prospects. The undiversified nature o f the economy poses risks for the country's future
development, despite the continuing growth o f the tourism sector.

167. The scope for the project to mitigate the risk o f external shocks i s limited. However, it should
be noted that the accelerated processing schedule for DPG2 is specifically intended to offset, inpart,
the impact o f the delayed start-up o f the Tala hydropower plant, which was an unexpected "shock".
The project's emphasis on medium-term fiscal programming should help ensure that the multi-year
consequences o f investments and other decisions are forecast and taken into account. The project's
focus on improving the general environment for private sector development should also help the
country realize more o f its potential for economic diversification, thereby reducing the magnitude o f
risks from external shocks.

168. Capacity constraints. DPGl identified risks related to technical capacity constraints and put
forward some mitigation measures, including the provision o f appropriate technical assistance where
essential. In addition to technical capacity, high-level managerial capacity i s also in short supply



                                                   46

and, moreover, may be adversely affected by the political transition. For example, many civil
servants are engaged in special research committees on the initiative o f the new king, and those who
wishto contest inlegislative elections mustpermanently resign from the civil service.

169. As inthe case o f DPGI, DPG2's design accounts for capacity constraints through selectivity o f
focus, a limited number o f up-front actions, and simplicity in policy design. It also continues the
practice o f identifying and encompassing technical assistance (financed from other sources) to
support the reform program. It has taken fully into account the lessons learned from DPG1, both in
terms o f the relevance o f the operation's overall design, and the substantive nature o f policy reform
options which, owing to strong ownership on the part o f RGoB, are for the most part achieving their
intended outcomes. The fast-track nature o f DPG2 reflects the importance the RGoB assigns to
ensuring that necessary reforms are in place as a means o f providing additional support to Bhutan's
first democratically-elected government and enhancing the continuity o f key policies and reforms
duringthe transitionperiod.
