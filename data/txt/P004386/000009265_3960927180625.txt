MIORAMDUR AND RECQTION OF THE PRESIDENT
, .OF THE INTERNATIONAL BAK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEMPMT
TO THX EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED WM
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUInEA
FOR A LAND 4OBTLIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomwendation on a proposed loan to
The Independent State of Papua New Guinea for U$19.6 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for twenty years,
including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standarrd variable
interest rate.  The project would be cofinanced By the Government of
Australia for US$6.4 million equivalent.
2.       Bac          Papua New Guinea has a population of 3.5 million and
a land area of 46 million ha of which 14 million ha (30%) are considered
suitable for agricultural production. About 3.2 millidn ha (7%) are
estimated to be in regular agricultural use and 3.7 million ha (8%) in low
intensity use or rotational fallow.  Forests cover about 78% of the land
area of which half may have potential for timber production (15 million
ha); between 50,000 to 60,000 ha are being logged annually. Land is
crucial for the devalopment of almost all sectors, especially agriculture,
urban services, transport and infrastructure. While land is a relatively
abundant resource, the inability to identify, mobilize and transfer lands.
with productive potential has constrained investments and thereby, economic
development. The land administratiou system in Papua New Guinea has
suffered in comparison with investse4ts in other government services and as
a result it has been unable to cope with the demands placed on it. The
emergence of a modern economy, with rising demands on land aiministrae.ion
threatens to overwhelm the present system.
3.       Land is categorized into two major groups: alienated land owned by
the state and customary land for which ownership is vested in about 700
clans and lesser groups (kinship and family). The Government has leased
out less than half the alienated land and little is known of the potential
or occupancy of the remainder. Complex legal and admimistrative processes
for allocating leases and institutional weaknesses including shortage of
management and professional skills, poorly developed interagency coordi-
nation and the absence of a clear pollcy environment, have created backlogs
and delays in land administration transactions, and delays in the
development of all sectors where land transfer is critical. In addition,
the traditional systems of land distribution by clans is under pressure
from Ai growing and more mobile population. Land disputes exceed the
capacity of the mediation mechanisms. There is a growing concern about the
need for national and provincial institutions and legislation to keep pace
with developments in land ownership. The lack of adequate land and
resource information further delays land mobilization.



4.       Rationale for Bank nvolvernent. The project is an integral part
of the Banik' a strategy to strengthen Papua New Guine.a'a institutional and -
human resource- capabilities and to support the critical sectors of
agiculture, forestry, transport, mining and urban services. As land is
critical to the continued development of all those sectors and weak land
administrationi an impediment to uobtlizing land., Bank support for improving
the management of land administration would assist in addressing land
sector issues vhich are a constraint to investments, and economic growth.
The Governmeat has formulated and begun implementing (on Janudavy 1, 1989) a
long-term (10-15 year) Land Mobilization Program to address thei land sector
issues, which consists of: (a) creating a clear policy and legislative
environment to promote investment in land; (b) enabling customary land
owners to increasingly participate in the development of their own land;
(c),providing effective land ,services to all land.users (surveying, -tLde
registration, valuation, land transfer and disposal, mapping, landI
acquisition, physical planning, dispute settlement); (d) transferring land
administration responsibilities from the national Goverrment to the
provincial governments; and (e) optimizing the use of the stock of
alienated land. The Program would require long-2ta   Am* involvem-nt and
support in addressing institutional and-policy issuetc.-'The proiJect would
support thea first five years of the Program, as part of the Government'sa
Medium Termi Development Strategy.'
5.      The experience of previous Bank agriculture projects have been
evaluated in the Projoct Performance Audit Report-(PPAR) No. 7001, the main
lessons from which were that projects should: (a) have a clear focus and
operate within existing institutions; (b) be limited to realistic estimates
of implementation capacity; (c) beo viwed as one stage in a sustainable
long-term program approach; and (d) carefully monitor and manage technical
assistance. Theie lessons have been Incorporated in the design of this
project, especially in project managemeolt and impltmentation arrangements.
6.       Pro2iect Objectives. Tahe primcty objective of this first Bank
assisted land sector project is to improve the manag(ment of land
administration in Papua New Guinea. Other related objectives include:
(i) imsproving land use planning, policy, management, legislation,
procedures, professional standards, quality of land services and physical
facilities; (ii) imprving the capacity of the Deparvtment of Latrds and
Physical Planning (DLPP) to develop land policy, promote land registration,
deliver land services, generate land-based revenues, and improve the land
dispute settlement capacity; (III) developing an improved and cost-
effective system to expedite identification and allocation of alienated
land; (iv) commencing development of an acceptable and cost effo-tive
method of customary land mobilization; (v) developing a system for the
decentralization of land administration to the provinces; (vi) developing
an up-to-date land and resource information base available to all land
users.
7.       Proi hct Desreitioa.  Project compounents would include:'    n
(1) PXo gmprogram agpro: (a) introducing program budgeting/management.,
accounting and monitoring procedures; (b) establishing a Program Management



U L

Committee; (c) establishing an initerdepartmental National Land Mngmn
Committee; (4) constructing regional and provincial offices And staff
housing in~ the.provinces; (e) coordinating and managing tech Aicol
assistanq~.;, (f) studying the role of the private se-ctor (surveyors) in land
administration; and (g) strengthening professional standards; (2)    ralg]
InstitUti2n Building: strengthening the 2olicy and4 institutional
inrsrute by (a) completing the restructuring of DLPP; (b) reviewing
the systems for setting land rents, land dispute settlement, and land
allocation and transfer; (c) drafting legislative and procedural amendments
for administration of alienateid land; (d) consolidating land legislation;
(e) drafting national framework legislation for the registration of
customary land; (f) improving the land dispute.settlement capacity; and
improving personnel services by recruitment of staff and inten~sive staff
.training; (3) lo_bilizin_g Alienated Land: (a) establishing regional
offices, and provincial,pffices with coordinated work programs;
(b) addressing a backlog of 7,000 incomplete land administration trans-
actions; and (c) stocktaking of about 300,000 ha of Government land -which
has not been in reguilar use; (4) Mobiliging Customar Land: <a) assisting
provincial Land Management Committees in formulating a policy framework for
customary land mobilization and registration; and (b) assisting the
provincees to draft legislation for customary land registration and
developing the necessary administrative procedures and manuals;-
(5) Decentralization of Alienated Land Administration: (a) assisting
provincial Land M(anagemient Committees in developing suitable policies;
(b) establishing consolidated Lands Divisions in the provinices;,and
(c) boordinating the transfer of DLPP staff to tbe provinces; (6) LandAn
Resource Infgrmation: (a) completing the Papua New Guinea Land Information'
Systeau; (b) enhancing the mapping capacity of the National Mapping Bureau;
and (c) establishing a Mapping Advisory Committee.
8.      The project, to be implemented over five years, would provide
funds for technical assistance, civil works, equipment and furniture, and
incre-mental staff salaries. Total project cost is estimated at US$42.8
million, of which US$4.3 million would be in duties and taxes and US$18.3
million in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$19.6 million
would finance ,50.9% of total project cost, including 60.6% 'of foreign cost
and 42.0% of local cost. The Government of Australia would cofinance
(paralell finance) with a grant of US$6.4 million. A breakdown of costa
and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of 
US$1.0million is included under the project for eligible expenditures
after January 1, 1989. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement
are shown ixA,Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the
status of.Bank Group operations in Papua New Guintea are given in Schedule C
and D respectively. Maps are also attached.~ The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7592-PNG dated April 12, 1989 is being distributed separately.
9.      Agreed Actions. The Government has agreed to the-following:
(a) complete the reorganization of DLPP by December 31, 1989; (b) timetable
for filling of key staff positions in the Department; (c) establish the
National Land Management Committee and the Mapping Advisory Committee by
December 31, ,1989; (d) terms of reference for all technical assistance
(consultancy services and studies) along with implementation schedules for
studies, including review of resulting recommendations with the Bank and

- ~    ~~~~~~~~~ r
subsequent Implementation; (e) draft legislative and procedural amendmentst
for improving alienated land administration by June 30, 1990; and (f)
conduct annual review of the Land Nobilization Program between the         -
Government and Bank, with Government of Australia participation.; by April
30 of each year. Prior to loan effectivanese, the Government, would enter
into key consultant contracts and the Australian Gtant Agreement would
become effective.
10.     IAnmfitn . Benefi'  under the project are expected from starting a
process of improving the eiticiency of land management, which has been
recognized as a key systemic constraint on development of the'6conomy. The
main benefits derive from more efficient land administration leading to
lower transaction costs, minijized delays in undertaking investments in
prodsetive sectors, greater revenue collection, and incentives 'for land-
users to invest in land-based activities.  Clarification of clan authority
in land distribution and registration of customary land would ultimately
reduce land disputes.
11.     Risks. The main risks include ineffective management of the Land
Mobilization Program, inability to coordinate and absorb 520 staff-months
ofr tecnical assistance, quality of staff that can be retained or recruited
into key positions, inadequate budget allocations, unwillingness or
inability of national government agencies and provinces to cooperate and
use coordinating mechsnisms, and the failure of'parliament to approve
amendments to land laws. To minimize these risks, the project design
includes: a management component and techbical assistance for management
and information systems; a Memorandum of Understanding on project imple-
mentation between the Department and other key departments and joint
(Government and Bank) annual reviews to facilitate effective management and
implementation; provision of consultancy services to administer the
technical assistance and assigning the responsibility for managing the work
and absorbing the output of technical assistance to individual work-units
of the Department; staff training and development-activities; and ,
establishment of the National Land Management Committee. The advanced
state of project preparation and the Government decision to begin
implementation of the Land Mobilization Program on January 1,'1989
demonstrates Government's commitment to the,project.
12.     Recommendatio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would,
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.'
