SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Foodgrains are dominant in the economy of Bangladesh.  They provide
85% of national caloric intake and 70% of protein and their production covers
about 83% of the total cropped area. Production increases in recent years
have been erratic and domestic production has provided only 75% to 85% of the
total foodgrains requirement of the country. Annual imports, mainly aid wheat,
have ranged from 1.4 M tons to 2.7 M tons. An IDA supported grain storage
project (381-BD) substantially completed by 1971, provided bulk handling and
storage facilities critically needed by Bangladesh to facilitate grain imports
and to ensure adequate grain deliveries through the public distribution system.
ii.       GOB's agriculture and foodgrain development strategy aims at increas-
ing domestic production through: (a) increasing irrigated and multiple cropped
areas; (b) delivering to producers a package of key inputs such as HYV seeds,
fertilizers and pesticides; (c) strengthening the extension, credit services
and other farmer support services; and (d) operating a domestic procurement
and marketing system to ensure incentive and stable prices to producers.
iii.      Almost 55% of total production is comprised by the monsoon (Aman)
crop and small production fluctuations caused by flood, drought or cyclones
create large swings in farmgate and retail prices. Primitive farm to market
transport, inadequate transport between major production and consumption areas,
poor grain storage facilities especially in the private sector, and an in-
hospitable storage environment make primary marketing costly. Private traders
possess a strong bargaining position and the entrenched traditional foodgrain
marketing system creates serious annual, seasonal and geographical variations
in foodgrain prices.
iv.       GOB's domestic procurement operations became significant only
recently, but their impact on maintaining post-harvest farmgate prices remains
minimal because of major operating and resource constraints.  Low farmgate
paddy prices represent a significant disincentive to farmers. An effective
farmgate price support program is a necessary condition for achieving an
accelerated growth of domestic production through investments in yield-
increasing technology.
v.        The Ministry of Food (MF) owns storage facilities nominally rated
at 1.13 M tons, with a maximum loading capacity of about 1.5 M tons. The
major constraints that prevent its effective utilization are: the geographical
separation of procurement and deficit areas, the sharp seasonality of procure-
ment, inadequate farm to market and inter-regional transportation, significant
non-foodgrain storage needs, and most importantly, the uneven distribution of
storage and rice milling facilities. Location of MF storage capacity is
related primarily to the public distribution needs of various areas, and is
inappropriately located for procurement. The MF storage system has a capacity
to hold 1.0 M tons of buffer stocks and procure domestically 400,000 tons of
foodgrains.



- ii -
vi.       Most domestic procurement comes from the six northern districts and
Patuakhali, which have production surpluses, whereas public distribution is
concentrated in the Dacca and Chittagong areas. About 80% of procurement
occurs in the winter season placing a heavy burden on a poor, already strained,
transport system. Major procurement areas and areas under Boro paddy and
wheat, the crops with maximum growth potential, do not have adequate storage
facilities. Thus, MF is forced to use about 100,000 tons of mostly hired,
dilapidated and substandard facilities in which grain losses are conservatively
estimated at about 5% for a six month storage period.
vii.      MF's procurement system is being streamlined to cope with higher
levels of procurement, and to eliminate major constraints preventing farmers
from benefitting from the official purchase prices. These constraints are:
(i) poor access by farmers to purchase points; (ii) inefficient operation of
purchase points leading to long waiting periods; (iii) subjective and multiple
quality discounts; (iv) slow payment; and (v) late start of procurement opera-
tions. In addition, Boro paddy because of the difficulty of post harvest
drying and thus storage, are procured reluctantly.
viii.     The project would assist GOB in improving the capacity and effi-
ciency of its domestic foodgrain procurement program, through provision of
appropriately located storage facilities and essential equipment, necessary
pest control equipment and vehicles, mechanical drying facilities and tech-
nical assistance.
ix.       Whereas the first IDA financed storage project was geared to hand-
ling imported grain, this project would be concentrate in a core project area
comprising the six northern districts, which have the greatest potential for
increased foodgrain production. This area is already the focus of major GOB
development program and projects (many of which IDA supported) and affords
the greatest scope for streamlining the procurement system. Small amounts of
additional storage would be provided in other districts to enable GOB to
provide timely relief supplies to certain emergency prone areas.
x.        Present MF storage capacity of 250,000 tons in the project area
would be increased by 145,000 tons at about 150 strategic locations. About
25,000 tons of dilapidated corrugated iron sheds would also be rehabilitated.
MF would then be able to procure and store under good condition up to 400,000
tons in the project area. Location selection criteria, although based on
present constraints, would be compatible with an improving transportation
system. All godowns would be of a standard design already used extensively
in Bangladesh. Essential ancillaries like electric power and approach roads
would be provided.
xi.       Domestic foodgrain procurement operations would be made more
efficient by improving farmer access to purchase points at new stores and by
opening new temporary purchase points. MF purchases would be opened to all
sellers, procurement would start immediately post harvest with prices announced
well in advance, excessively rigid purchase standards would be relaxed and
objective testing procedures introduced. Supervision of procurement opera-
tions would be strengthened by improved mobility of MF staff. Post procure-
ment mechanical drying of the Boro crop, which is harvested in the rainy
season, would take place at 15 locations.



- iii -
xii.      Pest control operations would be strengthened by fully equipping
25 existing squads. A new zonal foodgrain testing laboratory would be estab-
lished to strengthen stock inspection. Field training of pest control opera-
tors, godown managers and purchase staff would be organized through MF's
existing Training Center, which would be strengthened.
xiii.     A pilot program with 10 selected Thana Central Cooperative Associa-
tions, would be initiated under the project to develop their foodgrain market-
ing potential.
xiv.      The project would provide 10 man years of technical assistance at
an average man/month cost of US$7,000 to assist GOB in carrying out an effec-
tive construction, domestic procurement and paddy drying, and pest control
training programs; studies would be conducted to evaluate project benefits.
A Project Implementation Unit and a monitoring cell would be established
within MF, and an existing planning cell would be strengthened.
xv.       The four year project would have a total cost of US$40 M including
contingencies, taxes and duties. The proposed IDA credit of $25 M would
finance the foreign exchange cost ($11.7 M) and 46% of local costs ($28.3 M)
or about 75% of project costs excluding duties and taxes ($7.2 M). The main
items to be financed would be civil works, vehicles, equipment, technical
assistance and training. Because project civil works would be constructed by
labor intensive methods, scattered at about 200 sites, many in remote areas,
and because each contract would be below $150,000, civil works ($27.0 M) would
be unsuitable for international competitive bidding. And contracts would be
let following local bidding procedures satisfactory to IDA. Project use of
GOB's stock of imported construction materials ($2.5 M) would be spread over
4 years and individual requirements would be too small to justify separate
project tenders. Materials would be replenished from central GOB imports,
using procedures satisfactory to IDA. Vehicles ($1.25 M) and drying, pest
control and weighing equipment ($5.0 M) would be procured after international
competitive bidding. Procurement of off-the-shelf imported items costing less
than $10,000 would be by prudent shopping. Technical assistance and services
($1.1 M) would be recruited in Bangladesh and abroad. The balance of project
costs would consist of local training ($0.5 M), PIU monitoring and planning
cells ($0.1 M), land acquisition ($0.25 M) and engineering ($2.3 M).
xvi.      Responsibility for project implementation would rest with a new MF
Project Implementation Unit (PIU), under the broad guidelines of a Project
Steering Committee (PSC). Design, sub-contracting and supervision of con-
struction work would be carried out by a Project Engineering and Construction
Unit (PECU) within GOB's Public Works Department, which would be responsible
to the PIU. Review of the MF field organization and the payment system for
foodgrain purchases would be undertaken. The new Monitoring Cell would con-
tinuously study and make recommendations to improve the overall operations
of the MF.



- iv -
xvii.     The project would reduce losses in 100,000 tons of marginal facili-
ties used currently by MF. In addition) increased MF procurement of 100,000
tons at full development would be stored in the improved project facilities
and thus reduce storage losses that would otherwise have taken place. About
19,000 tons of foodgrain valued at $5.9 M, would be saved annually. The
economic rate of return is estimated to be about 21Z. Project godowns would
be available for food distribution and buffer stocks, but benefits from these
are not quantified. Similarly, benefits due to the higher level and reduced
risk of a sharp fall of post harvest farmgate prices are difficult to quantify.
xviii.    The major risk facing the project would be that increases in the
supply of grain in the project area would be insufficient to permit economic
use of the facilities provided. However, as about 60% of project construc-
tion would replace existing unsatisfactory and hired facilities, this would
only happen of procurement failed to increase by 35% over the next five
years. The probability of this occurring is considered slight. Recent GOB
efforts to shift the emphasis of MF efforts from distribution to procurement
have shown encouraging results and exposed constraints which the project now
aims to eliminate however there is also a risk that improvement in farmer
access to the MF procurement system may be delayed. A sensitivity analysis
shows that a delay of four years in reaching full development procurement
levels would reduce the rate of return to 17%.
xix.      With assurances discussed in Chapter VIII, the project would be
suitable for an IDA credit of $25 M to GOB on standard terms.



BANGLADESH
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      An IDA credit agreement of $19.2 M to provide storage and transship-
ment facilities for imported foodgrains was signed in February 1966 (83-PAK),
and reactivated at $19.7 M in May 1973 (381-BD). The reactivated project
consisted of financing four grain silos for imported grain with a total
capacity of 232,000 tons with supporting facilities; completion of the Chitta-
gong Jetty serving one of the silos, technical assistance for training of
staff for silo operation, and hiring of consultants to study the future food-
grain storage needs of Bangladesh.
1.02      Apart from some ancillary facilities, silo construction was virtually
complete by 1971 and these facilities played an important role in the foodgrain
emergency of 1971/72. The silos thereafter deteriorated due to weak management
and lack of maintenance. IDA supervision efforts were stepped up and in 1974
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) embarked on an action program designed with IDA
assistance to improve silo operations. Under TA Credit 409-BD, consultants
were recruited to help with management and training. Significant improvements
have occurred and the project was satisfactorily completed on June 30, 1977.
1.03      The study of future storage needs was completed in December 1975.
It brought out a number of policy issues that have influenced design of the
project appraised in the report. These issues were addressed by a pre-appraisal
Mission in November 1976, followed by an IDA Food Price Policy Mission in
February 1977. This report is based on the findings of the above missions, and
of an appraisal mission, comprising of Messrs. A. Seth, I. Harvey, P. Davies
(IDA) and F. Adams, E. Brooks and M. Faulkner (consultants) which visited
Bangladesh in April/May 1977.
II. THE FOODGRAIN SECTOR
A. General
2.01      Bangladesh has a gross area of 35 M ac of which about 22.5 M ac
are under cultivation at a cropping intensity of about 135%. With a popula-
tion estimated at 81 M, it has a population density among the world's highest,
about 1,470 per sq. mile. Ninety five percent of the population lives in rural
areas. Foodgrains play a dominant role in the economy of Bangladesh, making
up roughly 30-35% of GDP in recent years. In 1975/76 about 83% of the total
cropped area was under foodgrain crops, however Bangladesh is not self suf-
ficient in foodgrains and foodgrain imports, 1974 through 1976, represented
about 30-40% of total imports. Foodgrain consumption is the major element in
the national diet with rice and wheat together providing almost 85% of the
calorific intake and 70% of the protein.



-2-
2.02      During the 19Os, agricultural production grew at an annual rate
of about 2.5% and foodgrain production, at a rate of about 2.4%. However,
both lagged behind the estimated population growth rate of 2.8%. A severe
drought combined with the disruptions caused by the 1971 civil strife resulted
in sharply reduced production in 1972/73 -- some 15% below the 1969/70 level.
In 1975/76 however, due to favorable weather conditions, improved availability
of fertilizers and high foodgrain prices in 1974/75, there was a record food-
grain production of 12.8 M tons, which exceeded the 1969/70 level by some 10%.
Nevertheless, per capita production still remains below 1969 levels (Annex 1).
2.03      Rice accounts for 98% of domestically produced foodgrain.  There are
three rice crops in Bangladesh; Aus, Aman and Boro. Aus is both broadcast and
transplanted, the broadcast being sown mid-March through mid-May with trans-
planting taking place March through mid-April. Harvesting is in July and
August. It is predominantly rainfed, and is the crop most vulnerable to
disasters as it relies on the timely arrival of the monsoon and must be har-
vested during the period of most likely flooding. In 1975/76, it accounted for
25% of production and 35% of acreage. Aman, the major crop, is also rainfed
and both broadcast and transplanted. Broadcast aman is a deepwater floating
rice. Broadcast is sown in March and April, transplanting is between July and
September. Harvesting takes place mainly in November and December. Aman,
in 1975/76 utilized 55% of the rice area to produce 55% of the production.
Boro is an irrigated transplanted crop. Transplanting takes place between
November and February and harvesting between April and June during the rains.
In 1975/76 Boro produced 18% of the rice output from 11% of the area. Al-
though now growing in importance wheat has not been a major crop in Bangladesh,
representing only 1.7% of total foodgrain production in 1975/76. Wheat com-
petes with Boro for land availability and is harvested in April, 250,000 tons
were harvested in 1976/77.
2.04      Neither Aman nor Aus have exhibited any significant growth trend
in the last decade although there is some evidence that production of both may
now be turning upwards (Annex 1). However, because of the expansion of the
area under assured irrigation in the dry season, and the associated increase
in the use of HYVs and inputs, the Boro crop has been increasing steadily:
the 1975/76 output of 2.25 M tons was over six times the size of that in
1965/66.
2.05      Roughly 85% of the foodgrain requirements of the country in recent
years has come from domestic production, though in bad crop years this pro-
portion has been as low as 73%. Imports have ranged from 1.4 M tons in 1975/76
to as high as 2.7 M tons in 1972/73, and handling facilities constructed under
the first foodgrain storage project have assisted in maintaining a timely flow
of foodgrains into the country to meet calamities or poor harvests. All im-
ports are by Government, with an increasing proportion being on aid terms;
commercial purchases by Government declined from 42% in 1972/73 to 10% in
1975/76 and 18% in 1976/77. Despite consumer preference for rice, wheat
dominates food imports because of its lower price and greater availability
on concessionary terms.



B. Government Foodgrain Production Strategy
2.06      Bangladesh has large areas of highly fertile deltaic soils, a climate
suitable for year-round cropping, and abundant groundwater potential for dry
season irrigation. In recent years, the development of HYV of rice and wheat,
suitable for cultivation in large areas of Bangladesh both under irrigated and
rainfed conditions, has opened up the prospects of substantial increases in
production which could lead to greater self sufficiency. Thus GOB agricultural
and foodgrain development strategy aims at (i) increasing the area under irri-
gation; (ii) delivering a package of key inputs such as HYV seeds, fertilizers
and pesticides; (iii) strengthening extension credit and other farmer support
services; and (iv) operating a domestic procurement and marketing system for
foodgrain that would ensure incentive prices to producers. Recent IDA agri-
culture sector projects support these objectives.
2.07      An adequate supply of inputs and irrigation, and improved services
such as extension and credit, will have no impact on production unless the
price received by the farmer is an adequate incentive for him to use them.
The project appraised in this report project aims to assist GOB in ensuring
incentive prices by providing storage and other facilities that are essential
for an effective GOB domestic foodgrain procurement program.
C. Foodgrain Marketing
2.08      Private and Cooperative Sector.  The marketing system in Bangladesh
(Annex 4) is largely traditional. Most growers part with significant propor-
tions of their crop before or immediately upon harvest because of: (i) need
for cash; (ii) inability to hold grain in storage; and (iii) obligation to
repay crop production loans. They often have to buy grain later at higher
prices for family consumption. However, only 2-3 M tons of foodgrain, about
20-30% of the production actually enters the commercial market, and private
traders handle about 80% of it. They buy at about 6,500 primary markets and
about 2,000 "haats" (markets held on specific days of the week). The private
traders' storage facilities are inadequate and storage losses high. GOB is
presently conducting a study of the investment needs and the operational
constraints of the private sector marketing system.
2.09      Farmer cooperatives have been officially encouraged to market paddy
and engage in rice milling.  In 1976, however, 16 Thana Central Cooperative
Association (TCCA) marketed only about 50 tons of paddy. For successful large
scale involvement TCCA would need to overcome the problems of lacks of tech-
nical and financial knowhow, and adequate physical facilities.
2.10      Government Procurement and Distribution.  Since the Bengal Famine
of 1943, public marketing has been a major role of Government mainly to
(i) provide low-priced foodgrains to those in need; (ii) supply subsidized
foodgrains to Government employees, in effect, as a form of payment in kind;
and (iii) ensure the supply of foodgrains at reasonable prices to urban areas
especially in times of bad crops and high prices.



-4-
2.11      Government distribution of foodgrain averaged 1.8 M tons during
1972-76, 90% imported. All residents (approximately 4.5 M) of the six major
cities (Dacca, Naryanganj, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangamati), as
well as all employees of Government or large establishments, are entitled to
a weekly ration of foodstuffs at prices fixed by GOB. Needy residents
(generally the lower 50% income group) of other areas are covered during
periods of scarcity. During natural calamities, free rice and wheat are
provided to those affected.
2.12      In the past domestic foodgrain procurement has often been compulsory.
However, compulsory procurement causes widespread bitterness among farmers
especially as procurement prices at such time have been well below the free
market level. Since the last such procurement in 1974/75 GOB policy emphasis
has changed towards:
(a) providing an incentive price to producers to increase
domestic production more rapidly;
(b) managing the supply and distribution to promote food price
stability; 1/ and
(c) reducing food subsidies to free resources for economic
development.
2.13      Government procurement of domestic grain was quite small until
1975/76 when a bumper crop enabled GOB to procure 415,000 tons of rice out
of a crop of 12.8 M tons (Annex 1); GOB procurement resources were fully
strained to handle the volume (Annex 2). For 1976/77, GOB set a procurement
target of 500,000 tons of rice, but because of the late start to Aman pro-
curement, more strict grain moisture requirements for Boro and Aus procure-
ment and high market prices during April to July, total procurement was only
315,000 tons 2/.
2.14      The Aman crop presently provides over 80% of the domestic procure-
ment, Boro 6% and Aus 10%. Although procurement centers operate in every
district, the greatest success has been in areas where there is surplus of
production over consumption in particular the districts of Dinajpur, Rangpur,
Bogra, Rajshahi, Patakhali, Mymensingh and Sylhet.
2.15      Foodgrain Prices.  Farmgate and consumer prices for foodgrains vary
significantly annually, seasonally and geographically. In a "good" year, for
example, when there is a surplus, the relatively thin market provided by
1/   Desirable changes in the public distribution system, involving main-
tenance of buffer stocks and open market sales, are discussed in the
report of the IDA food price policy mission which visited Bangladesh
in February 1976: Report dated December 12, 1977.
2/   Aman procurement however was relatively high at 86% of 1975/76 levels.

non-farm dwellers is quickly saturated and prices fall preciptiously. For
example, the bumper 12.8 M tons crop-of 1975/76 saw prices averaging Tk 154/md.
Consequently in 1974/75, when domestic production was reduced by severe floods
to 11.2 M tons, the average retail price of medium quality rice was Tk 252/md.
2.16      Large margins exist between farm gate and consumer prices.  Private
traders possess a strong bargaining position in the market. Unlike GOB pro-
curement agents they pay cash, and in many cases advance credit to producers
and rent land out to sharecroppers. GOB has operated a farmgate price support
program since 1974, offering to buy paddy at Tk 74/md plus Tk 4/md transport
bonus. Recently GOB increased the procurement price by about 8%, to Tk 80/md.
However, despite competitive prices the program's impact has been limited.
Annual average farmgate prices are estimated to have been about Tk 10/md below
official procurement prices for Aman paddy and up to Tk 15/md below these for
Boro paddy. Regional and seasonal discounts are marked. 1/ Farmgate prices
immediately post harvest in major surplus areas are estimated to range from
Tk 35-50/md. At current input prices, farmgate paddy prices as low as
Tk 50/md offer some incentive to invest in modern technology, but the risks
of crop failure in Bangladesh are high, especially in the main cropping
seasons of Aus and Aman they represent significant deterrents to small
farmers to shift into any large scale adoption of modern yield increasing
technologies.
2.17      Ration prices during 1971-75 were less than one-third of market
prices, but the gap has been considerably reduced and now they are almost 70%
of market prices. Nevertheless domestic procurement involves significant
budgetary support for food subsidies. Estimated cost to GOB of procuring and
distributing is about Tk 1,200/ton and Tk 550/ton for local rice and wheat,
respectively; however, on imports MF "earns" about Tk 65/ton and Tk 400/ton
respectively, because of the large proportion of the imported grain which is
received as grants (para 2.05). Overall, the distribution program is estimated
to have involved a budgetary support of about Tk 110 M in 1975/76 (Annex 1).
GOB is aware that greater domestic procurement would involve greater budgetary
support unless subsidies are reduced and is committed to a program of reducing
such subsidies (para 2.12).
III. PROCUREMENT CONSTRAINTS
.
3.01      The efficiency of GOBs domestic foodgrain procurement program as
well as of its potential capacity to control farmgate prices at incentive
levels is constrained by a number of factors. Important are (i) inadequate,
poorly located storage of limited access to farmers, (ii) poor storage con-
ditions, (iii) slow purchase and payments, and (iv) staffing and organiza-
tional problems.
1/   For example in 1976 the wholesale price for Boro paddy in Dinajpur
was only Tk 50/md compared to official average annual farmgate price
estimate of Tk 58/md for 1976.

A. Storage Facilities
JO2 OL   Ministry of Food (MF) is responsible for GOBs domestic procure-
ment operations. Its storage facilities comprise three categories of depots:
12 "large" depots called Central Storage Depots (CSD), located around major
consumption centers; 320 "small" depots called Local Storage Depots (LSD),
located at smaller towns and; four silo complexes to handle imports (Annex 2).
By June 1978, MF is expected to have a total storage capacity of 1,135,000
tons of rice, 35% at CSDs, 45% at LSDs and 20% in Silos. Most LSDs lack basic
ancillaries such as power, satisfactory approach roads, security walls and
housing for security staff. Most godowns are of a standard design rated at
500 ton nominal 1/ capacity, but these can be loaded up to 850 tons of paddy
(560 tons rice equivalent), for total storage duration of less than 3-4 months
and 650 tons of paddy (435 tons rice equivalent) for longer durations (Annex 2).
3.03      The average capacity utilization of the MF storage system ranges
from 55-70%. Within major procurement areas, the average capacity utilization
is 95% at LSDs with most showing 110-125% loading for four to six months after
the peak procurement season. The theoretical maximum loading capacity of the
MF storage system is 1.5 M tons, but the MF storage system, as of June 1978,
is estimated to be capable of handling 400-500,000 2/ tons of domestically
procured grain and about 1.0 M tons of imported grain held by buffer stock
because of the locational, transport and farmer access constraints discussed
below (Annex 2). Inadequate storage space in the major production areas has
forced MF to use 25,000 tons capacity of dilapidated sheds, unfit for food-
grain storage; and in addition to hire about 75,000 tons of marginal storage
facilities.
3.04      Location and Transport.  Location of MF storage facilities clearly
reflects past GOB emphasis on distribution rather than domestic procurement.
Six major food procurement districts (Bogra, Dinajpur, Mymensingh, Rajshahi,
Rangpur, and Sylhet), which provide almost 65% of the total procurement, have
only 28% of MF storage capacity, while the six other districts (Dacca, Barisal,
Chittagong, Khulna, Comilla, Pabna) which account for only 17% of the procure-
ment (and 59% of distribution) have about 53% of the existing storage capacity.
Except for a few remote and emergency prone areas, storage needs for buffer
stocks and distribution are adequately covered. Even within procurement areas,
storage facilities tend to be concentrated in major urban centers, and areas
growing Boro and wheat, crops with maximum growth potential, have very little
storage. Uneven distribution of milling capacity which is concentrated in
the procurement/production areas (Dinajpur alone has 40%), forces domestically
procured stocks to be held in procurement areas till milling, to avoid multiple
shipping.
1/   Nominal Capacity:  A loading capacity of paddy which provides ideal
storage conditions but which can be safely and economically exceeded
for short periods. See Annex 2 para 4.
2/   The upper limit involves the use of all marginal facilities as well.



3.05      The highly peaked nature of procurement, places a heavy burden on
Bangladesh's already strained transport system (Annex 2). This is further
complicated by unfavorable weather which makes it difficult to keep the grain
dry while in transit. Procurement point to storage transport involves mul-
tiple modes (head-load, bullock-cart and truck) and MF depends on contractors
for movement services, who often have difficulty in moving stocks quickly by
the rural transport system, the basis of which is the 5-20 bullock carts that
can be hired in the average village during the harvest season. Inter-regional
movement is by railways which themselves are weak and relatively inefficient.
Shipping delays of up to several weeks are common during the peak procurement
season. The foregoing indicate that provision of storage in procurement areas
close to primary markets is a pre-requisite for any expansion of the procure-
ment program.
3.06      Farmer Access.  MF procurement operates through all 330 LSD/CSD as
well as 150-200 Temporary Purchase Centers (TPC) which are established during
peak procurement period. Typically, about 200-300 villages are served by an
LSD/TPC, while a primary market serves about 10 villages. Farmers have to
travel about 10-12 miles to reach LSD/TPC and this involves a travel time of
I day at least although expenses (0.50 to 1.0 Tk/md/mile) would be mostly
covered by the transport bonus (para 2.16). Nevertheless, TPCs, by improving
access, have contributed significantly to improving procurement.
B. Storage Conditions
3.07      In Bangladesh, temperature/humidity conditions favorable for rapid
growth of foodgrain insects and fungi exist for 8 months in a year (Annex 5).
This poses a massive storage management problem, which is further aggravated
by the substandard nature of many godowns. The pest control burden has greatly
multiplied during the last three years, since for the first time, domestically
procured paddy is being stored at dispersed locations whereas previously it
was confined to dry imported grain stored at major silos or CSDs. MF operates
62 pest control squads - one for each CSD and six LSDs. An adequate stock of
chemicals is a key requirement and bilateral assistance has recently been
made available for this.
3.08      Lack of squad mobility is a serious constraint on MF ability to
respond adequately to the fumigation needs of LSDs. Equipment and toxic che-
micals cannot be carried by public transportation even when available. Most
pest control equipment needs urgent replacement, and use of various models
makes maintenance and operator training difficult. A central testing laboratory
at Dacca conducts physical and chemical testing for the entire country, but
because it has limited facilities, considerable time elapses between sampling
and actual disposal of any deteriorated stocks causing further damage includ-
ing cross-infestation.
3.09      To assist MF develop staff fully trained in foodgrain quality con-
trol in storage, bilateral assistance for overseas fellowships is presently
available to MF. UNDP is also assisting GOB in establishing a warehouse



training center to serve the public as well as the private sector. UK-ODM
are providing 2-1/2 man years of training expertise during 1977-78 to train
nine chief operators. However, a major effort in field training of MF's 500
operators, inspectors and godown managers is still required.
3.10      Many estimates of storage losses in Bangladesh have been made rang-
ing from 10-25% per year. Losses in good storage facilities, with reasonably
dry (14% moisture) paddy when effective pest control is available, are proba-
bly about 1% for a six month storage period. However, losses in the marginal
and dilapidated facilities, especially during the hot and humid rainy season,
are at least 5% over a similar period (Annex 9, Table 1). The Boro crop,
harvested in the rains with 16%-17Z moisture, suffers at least 10% loss on
account of bad storage conditions alone.
C. Purchase and Payments
3.11      Individual purchases are restricted to a minimum of 1.75 md paddy
(1 standard bag). Officially all can sell to MF. About 50-100 selected traders
in a district are appointed as Authorized Grain Dealers (AGD) by MF.  AGDs are
required by their contract to pay farmers the stipulated procurement price
less a specified commission, and to sell all grain procured to MF. Because
of the limited number of traders who have been granted AGD status, the com-
petition at the primary markets is effectively limited and this limits the
impact of the price support program.
3.12      Typically, TPC capacity is small (100-200 md), while daily arrivals
range from 500-2,000 md.   Purchase operations are frequently interrupted
because of inability to clear stocks quickly. In addition, actual purchase
operations, handled by a lone purchasing officer, are slow and a three day
wait is common for the farmers.
3.13      Boro paddy, which is increasingly of HYV varieties, is harvested in
the rainy period. Sun drying at this time to 15% grain moisture as required
by MF is difficult and subsequent storage poses a serious problem. For this
reason MF procurement of Boro paddy has been low. Mechanical drying which
is the only answer is virtually unknown but considerable experience has been
gained recently from a pilot drying project (Annex 6).
3.14      MF quality standards are complicated and rigid.  They are designed
to reduce losses after purchasing in view of the poor storage and pest control
facilities presently available to MF. Aman procurement starts only in January,
when most arriving paddy meets these rigid standards. However, by then most
growers have sold their surplus to meet immediate cash needs. At least four
price discounts apply but without testing devices, quality assessment is sub-
jective. Payment is made through a four copy certificate changeable for cash
at a designated bank and although bank payment booths have been opened at most
LSD's, ensuring adequate cash at these booths has been a problem, because of
difficulties in providing police escort and guard.



- 9 -
3.15      MF working capital needs for the procurement program are met through
designated commercial banks by the Bangladesh Bank which fixes quarterly limits
on their lending for foodgrain procurement and provides 100% refinance for the
purpose. Commercial banks together have never exceeded the overall limit, but
in January 1976, two banks exceeded them, resulting in a temporary stoppage of
procurement operations. Since then, commercial banks have established limits
on the procurement lending of their individual branches which also sometimes
results in delays in payments.
D. Staffing and Organization
3.16      Although MF activities have begun to show a clear shift towards
internal procurement, MF organizational structure and the relative strength
of various directorates, still reflects its historical role in public distri-
bution. Thus, the Directorate of Distribution and Rationing has the most
extensive staff, while the newly established Directorate of Procurement has
only a quarter of the former's staff strength, mostly recruited on a temporary
basis. Similar anomalies exist in other areas (Annex 7). Field coordination
between various MF directorates and with other ministries has scope for
improvement. This is complicated by the low grading of the post of dis-
trict controller of food in relation to similar staff of other ministries.
Seasonality of MF's distribution and domestic procurement functions offer
scope for more effective use of field manpower.
3.17      The project would assist GOB to improve the effectiveness of its
domestic procurement program through the provision of storage facilities and
testing, pest control and drying equipment, as well as through the streamlin-
ing of its grain procurement operations.
IV. THE PROJECT AREA
4.01      The proposed project would be carried out mainly in the six northern
districts of Bogra, Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh and Sylhet.
They have a combined area of about 14 M ac and a population of 32 M (40%).
4.02      Climate is monsoonal with heavy summer rains interrupted by a dry
winter period of about 4-5 months. Mean annual rainfall varies locally from
50-90 inches with about 90% occuring between May and October. Mean monthly
temperature varies from the mid-sixties to mid-nineties, and relative humidity
is high for the most of the year. Maintenance of foodgrains in storage is
difficult particularly in the rainy months. The project area is generally
free from cyclone or tidal wave activity.
4.03      Production and Marketing Facilities.  The project area produces 45%
of the total domestic foodgrain production, and about I M tons currently are
surplus to area needs and exported to the rest of the country. Of this be-
tween 200-275,000 tons annually has been procured by GOB in recent years.



- 10 -
The four northwestern districts were identified in the IDA Land and Water
Resources sector survey (1972) as having the maximum growth potential. These
have recently become the focus of a major GOB development effort. The IDA
supported tubewells projects (341-BD and 724-BD) and extension and research
project (729-BD) also focus on these districts. The project area has a pro-
duction growth potential much above average for Bangladesh and 1985-86 pro-
curement potential could reach 700,000 tons if current GOB agriculture
development efforts continue and a more efficient procurement system is
introduced (Annex 1).
4.04      Most major towns are accessible by a 850 mile network of all weather
roads. The area is also serviced by 300 miles of broad gauge and 600 miles of
meter gauge railroads. The north-west area is poorly served by waterways, but
Mymensingh and Sylhet rely heavily upon water transport. Most farm to market
transport is by bullock carts on dirt tracks or by country boats. Scale of
movement is small (20 mds) slow (8-15 miles/day) and costly (0.5-1 Tk/md/mile).
4.05       Only 28% of MF storage facilities are located in the project area
although it provides 65% of domestic procurement (para 3.04). Almost 65% of
the country's large scale rice mills capacity (2,700 ton/day) are located in
the project area, which also has almost 6,700 tons/day of smaller facilities.
The number of small-mills with parboiling facilities and sun drying yards
has increased significantly in recent years.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Summary Description
5.01       The objective of the project would be to provide additional safe
grain storage and procurement facilities in the project area and through these
measures to permit improvements, in terms of volume and efficiency, in GOB's
domestic foodgrain procurement program.  The project would be carried over
for years and would comprise:
(a)  construction of 145,000 ton (nominal) new storage capa-
city, including necessary ancillaries, at about 150
existing or new sites chosen for the availability of
suitable Temporary Purchase Centers (TPCs) sites in
their vicinity and rehabilitation of 25,000 tons
of "Twin-Nissen" and similar godowns (para 5.03);
(b)  provision of weighing and testing equipment and mechanical
drying facilities (paras 5.07 and 5.08);
(c)  strengthening of the grain inspection and pest control
operations of MF through provision of equipment and
vehicles including motor launches, and the establishment
of a new foodgrain testing laboratory (paras 5.09-5. 12);



- 11 -
(d) implementation of a pilot project to develop the grain marketing
potential of selected Thana Central Cooperative Associations
(para 5.13);
(e) provision of technical assistance (10 man years) in engi-
neering, pest control training, paddy drying and procurement
systems (para 5.14); and studies for the evaluation of project
benefits (para 6.18); and
(f) establishment of a Project Implementation Unit and a Monitoring
Cell and strengthening of the Planning Cell, within MF (para
5.17).
5.02      Additionally, in selected flood or cyclone prone districts outside
the project area, the project would provide for the construction of 20,000
tons oE storage godowns to facilitate GOB relief response to emergencies.
B. Detailed Features
5.03      Storage Construction and Rehabilitation.  MF nominal storage capa-
city in the project area would be increased by 145,000 tons to 395,000 tons
by construction of new godowns at about 150 sites. In addition, about 25,000
tons cif dilapidated Twin Nissen (TN) and similar storage facilities would be
rehabilitated. Distribution between districts would be:

/a  Other than of the "Dacca" type, the rehabilitation of which is being
financed by UK.
/b See para 6.04.
5.04      With the storage constructed under the project, MF would have the
capacity to procure a total of 400-500,000 tons in the project area, compared
to an estimated procurement potential of 700,000 tons by 1985/86 (para 4.03).
While it seems clear that more storage will be required by the mid 80's
(Annex 2) it is considered prudent to limit new construction to that planned
under the project until improvements in the procurement system are made and



- 12 -
grower response is proven. There is adequate time to build any additional
capacity required for 1985/86 since project construction would be complete
by 1981. Assurances were obtained from GOB that it would inform IDA of any
proposed construction of foodgrain storage in addition to that provided by
the project, in the six project districts and it would undertake such con-
struction only if its does not adversely affect the utilization of project
facilities.
5.05      All project godowns would be of the basic "Dacca" and "Twin Dacca"
design 1/ of proven local suitability. Ancillary facilities such as power,
approach roads, drainage, housing for essential resident staff and sheds for
gunny bag storage would be provided. Minor design modifications would be
made and some cost reducing modifications in construction would be introduced.
Design and construction details, have been finalized with Project Construction
Manager (para 6.03), are given in Annex 3. The engineering consultant (para
5.15) would assist in any further improvements. Details of the location and
silte selection criteria for new godowns are in Annex 2. The most important
criterion for building a new procurement godown would be the prior successful
operation of a TPC at that location. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that storage constructed under the project would conform to designs,
and be sited at locations agreed with IDA.
5.06      About 3 vehicles and 25 motorcycles required for construction site
supervision, and engineering equipment would be financed under the project.
5.07      Weighing Testing and Drying Equipment.  Equipment and facilities
needed by new TPCs and godowns, would consist of weigh scales, moisture meters
and testing sieves (Annex 4). Close supervision of grain procurement opera-
tions would be essential and procurement Chief Inspectors would be given
motorcycles (40) to visit each procurement point fortnightly. Other MF field
officers would spend at least 10 days each month supervising procurement and
other operations, and about 35 vehicles (including about 3 motor launches)
would be provided for their use.
5.08      MF procurement of Boro and Aus paddy, would be facilitated through
the provision of mechanical drying facilities at 15 LSD under a pilot paddy
drying scheme. Forty-one major locations are being considered, and the de-
tailed criteria to be applied in final selection are in Annex 6. Two sites
are expected to handle 5,000 tons per season, the rest between 1,000-3,000
tons. In-bin dryers (4-6 bins) would appear the most appropriate for their
simplicity, throughput range and low drying temperatures. Installation, ini-
tial operator training and preparation of operating instructions would be the
responsibility of the supplier. Operator selection would be by the drying
system consultant (para 5.15) assisted by his local counterpart. Dryer
-ivil works would be executed as part of the godown construction contracts.
5.0,9     Inspection and Quality Control.  Twenty-five pest control squads
wOu:Ld be needed to serve storage facilities in the project area. They would
be fully equipped and provided with vehicles (Annex 5). With increased
mobility, each squad would cover about 30-40 godowns. Inspection squads
1/   Concrete floor, brick walls and concrete roofs.



- 13 -
would be provided with sampling and physical measurement equipment, and go-
down inspection frequency would be-raised to once a month. Assurances were
obtained from GOB that existing usable pest control equipment in the project
core area would be transferred to MF units in other areas once the project
equipment is in operation. This would permit standardization in the core
procurement area which would be essential for effective operator training and
maintenance.
5.10      The project would provide equipment and facilities for the estab-
lishment of a foodgrain testing laboratory in the Project Area, which would
operate under technical supervision of the existing Dacca laboratory.
Appointment of the laboratory's Chemist, who would be responsible for its
establishment, would be a condition of disbursement against expenditures
for the laboratory.
5.11      A field training program would be set up for operators, spraymen,
godown managers and inspectors. The project would provide two man years of
quality control expertise, three equipped training vans and cover the costs
of about 600 man weeks of field training and demonstration sessions to which
private sector and TCCA participants would also be invited. The project
training program would be complementary to an MF training program initiated
recently with UK-ODM assistance (para 3.09), but would focus on field training
in the project area. MF would coordinate both programs.
5.12      Training of pest control operators would emphasize safe handling
of pesticides, and project technical assistance would ensure that pesticide
selection is based on minimizing the environmental effect.
5.13      Cooperative Marketing Pilot Program.  The project would initiate
a pilot program through GOB's Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP)
organization to develop the marketing potential of ten selected Thana Central
Cooperatives Association (TCCA). Selection criteria and data on 18 potential
TCCA are in Annex 4, along with the methods of operation. Since selected TCCA
would already have storage facilities, investment needs would be small con-
sisting of moisture meters, analysis equipment, weigh scales and 10 motor-
cyles for supervising project officers. Assurances would be obtained that
a day of the week would be fixed for purchase from TCCA members participating
in the pilot project and for those subsequently adopting the model developed.
Alternatives to be studied and future phases of the program (Annex 4) would
be monitored by the (drying and) procurement system consultant during the
Aman season.
5.14      Technical Assistance.  The project would provide 10 man years of
technical assistance, costing on average about US$7,000 per man-month.
Specific areas of assistance would include:
(a) an engineering consultant for four years (TOR Appendix 2,
Annex 3) to assist with contractor prequalification, tender
evaluation and work supervision, and offer advice to the
project construction manager on design and construction

(b)  two man-years of pest control expertise (TORs in Appendix
1, Annex 5) to assist with training of field staff;
(c)  four man-years of consultancy in procurement and drying
systems (TORs in Appendix 1, Annex 6) to assist with
streamlining of the MF/TCCA procurement system, operation
and evaluation of mechanical dryers, and training of dryer
operators and procurement officers.
5.15      Consultants would be provided with vehicles and would be assisted
by qualified counterparts. All consultants would have qualifications and
experience, and be employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Recruitment of the recruitment of the engineering specialist and the procure-
ment and drying system specialist would be a condition of disbursement
against expenditures on civil work.
5.16      Studies.  The proposed project evaluation study is discussed in
para 6.18.
5.17      Project Implementation Unit, Planning and Monitoring Cell.  The
project would finance the cost of a Project Implementation Unit, a new
Monitoring Cell and the strenghtening of an existing Planning cell in MF
(para 6.17).
5.18      Outside the project area, 20,000 tons of storage capacity would
be constructed at strategic locations in disaster prone areas (Annex 2).

5.20      Estimates are based on mid-1977 prices for construction and rehabil-
itation and allow for 12% of the godowns that would be located at remote sites.
A physical contingency of 5% has been applied to godown construction and dryer
civil works costs to allow for variations at different sites. Physical
contingencies are not needed for other items. Price contingencies have been
applied to all items as follows: civil works, 9% till 1979 and 8% thereafter;
equipment and vehicles, 7.5% till 1979 and 7% thereafter. Duties and taxes
are estimated at US$7.2 M. Contingencies average 20% of total project costs.
D. Prolect Financing
5.21      The proposed IDA Credit of US$25 M would finance about 75% of
project cost, net of duties and taxes. It would cover all foreign exchange
costs of Tk 180 M (US$11.7 M), and about 46% of local costs of Tk 440 M
(US$28.3 M). GOB would provide the remaining US$15.0 M.
E. Procurement
5.22      The Project Implementation Unit (para 6.02) would be responsible
for procurement of all project items, with the special Project Engineering and
Construction Unit (para 6.03) handling the subcontracting of construction
work.
5.23      Project civil works would be located at about 200 sites.  Designs
would be simple and construction techniques, labor intensive. Civil works
contracts, about 12% in remote areas, would amount to about US$29.5 M, dis-
persed over at least 10 districts, and also spread over 4 years. Each contract
would be small (under US$150,000). Such contracts would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding and would be advertised through local com-
petitive bidding.  Although PWD's contracting procedures are generally
satisfactory, specific changes in performance bonding, warranties and annual
prequalification of contractors would be required (details in Annex 3).
Project requirements of imported construction materials would be too small
to justify a separate tender for the project. Bidders would have the option
to bid based on self-procured materials or materials made available to con-
tractors by PWD from its stocks. Project use of PWD's imported stocks of
construction materials, mainly cement, would be replenished by normal com-
mercial imports, not otherwise financed, using international shopping under
procedures satisfactory to IDA.
5.24      About 70 four wheel drive vehicles, motor launches, and about 80
motorcycles with a total cost of about US$1.25 M, pest control, drying, and
weighing and construction equipment costing about US$5.0 M, would be procured
after international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. A
preference limited to 15% of the CIF price of imported goods, or customs duty,
which ever is less, would be extended to local manufacturers. Procurement
of off-the-shelf imported items costing less than US$10,000 CIF would be by
prudent shopping based on prices from at least three suppliers. Such



- 17 -
purchases would be limited to a total of US$500,000. The balance of project
costs would consist of technical assistance (US$1.1 M), local training
(US$0.5 M), evaluation studies and PIU, monitoring and planning cell expen-
ditures (US$0.1 M), land acquisition (US$0.25 M) and engineering (US$2.3 M).
5.25      To ensure prompt availability of local currency financing, a condi-
tion of effectiveness would be the establishment, and initial funding of two
project funds one for the PIU, (para 6.02) and the other for the PECU (para
6.03) for making local currency payment to suppliers and consultants as well
as local training. Assurances were also obtained that the project funds would
be replenished quarterly to at least Tk 2 M and Tk 5 M respectively, or such
higher level as the PIU and PECU would recommend as necessary. In addition,
approval of the project by the GOB's National Economic Council would be a
condition of effectiveness.
F. Disbursements
5.26      Disbursement under the credit would extend over four years for:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported vehicles, equipment
and spares, 100% of local expenditures ex-factory for locally
manufactured goods or 60% of local expenditures for other
locally procured goods;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported construction
materials used by the project, and 65% of local expenditures
for all civil works, including ancillaries, power and engi-
neering;
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance, studies and
training; and
(d) 80% of the PIU, monitoring cell and planning cell expendi-
tures.
All disbursements would be fully documented, except for contracts below
US$10,000, subject to a maximum of US$500,000, for which details, including
tenders and bid evaluations, would be retained by PIU for inspection by IDA
supervision missions. Claims against civil works would be substantiated by a
copy of the work completion certificate approved by the project construction
managers, co-signed by the engineering consultant. Disbursements against
imported construction materials would require a certificate that the purchases
were not financed from other sources.
G. Accounts and Audit
5.27      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that PIU and PECU
would maintain detailed accounts of expenditures made under the project



- 18 -
and auditors satisfactory to IDA would be appointed. Assurances were also ob-
tained that GOB would obtain IDA approval for any change of auditors, and that
audited accounts would be sent to IDA within 6 months of the close of each
fiscal year.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
6.01      The Ministry of Food (MF) is responsible for grain procurement,
domestic and foreign, and for food distribution programs, except for emer-
gency relief food which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Relief. The
staff of the Ministry is headed by the Secretary of Food and the staff func-
tions are vested with two Joint Secretaries (Administration and Distribution,
Procurement and Development). The Directorate of Food which is headed by
the Director General of Food (DGF) is the operating arm of the Ministry,
responsible for day-to-day operational matters with broad policy and program
determined by the ministry. The DGF would be the de facto project manager
for both (a) physical implementation of the project, and (b) the improvements
in its foodgrain procurement activities that are essential for increased
domestic procurement. He would report to the Secretary of Food, who would
be assisted by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) comprising representatives
of other ministries and agencies whose cooperation and support would be essen-
tial for the successful implementation of the project. The PSC would comprise:
the Joint Secretaries of MF, Agriculture, and Finance; the Director General
of Food; Chief Engineer, Public Works; the Project Construction Manager; a
representative from the Bangladesh Bank; Director of IRDP. Administrative
support to the PSC would be provided by Joint Secretary (procurement), who
would devote one section of his establishment exclusively for this purpose.
The PSC would meet at least quarterly. Establishment of the PSC, whose com-
position and functions were agreed at negotiations, would be a condition of
effectiveness.
B.  Physical Implementation
6.02      Project Implementation Unit.  To carry out the project the DGF
would head a project implementation unit which would be established within
MF. The PIU would be administratively self contained to carry out the
following functions:
(a) Manage the project fund (para 5.25) and prepare annual
construction plans by February of each year;
(b) handle all project financed procurement (except godown
construction - para 6.03);
(c) handle recruitment of pest control and paddy drying/
procurement consultants;



- 19 -
(d) prepare progress reports, including reports from
the project consultants, for PSC discussion.
The st:affing plan and functions of the PIU were agreed at negotiations.
Establishment of the PIU would be a condition of effectiveness.
6.03      Project Engineering and Construction Unit.  Responsibility for
godown construction and rehabilitation would be entrusted to a Project Engi-
neering and Construction Unit (PECU) to be established within the Public Works
Department (PWD). PWD has built almost all the existing MF godowns. PECU
would be headed by a project construction manager of the rank of Additional
or Deputy Chief Engineer, who would work closely with the PIU in establish-
ing annual construction plans for PSC and IDA approval. PECU would have the
necessary complement of engineering and supervisory staff at Headquarters
in Dacca (see staffing plan - Annex 3) while working in the field through
a strengthened PWD field organization. The appointment of the Project
Construction Manager, and the establishment of PECU, would be a condition
of effectiveness. Full staffing of PECU, according to a plan satisfactory
to IDA, the basis for which was agreed during negotiations, would be a con-
dition of disbursement against expenditures for all civil works items.
6.04      Implementation Schedule.  The first year's detailed implementation
plan and a more general long range plan is included in Annex 8. Seventy
locations proposed by GOB which meet the agreed criteria (Annex 2) have been
agreed to enable construction to start without delay. It would be a condition
of effectiveness that for 20 of these suitable sites, land acquisition was
completed. For subsequent construction, annual plans with list of sites and
justification would be submitted to IDA by February each year. Suitable
assurances were obtained. Project engineering and foodgrain procurement
consultants along with Joint Secretary, PIU, MF Director General Food and MF
Director of Procurement would form the location selection committee. PECU
Would inspect and select actual sites.
6.05      Maintenance.  One serious operational deficiency is in the area of
storage maintenance. Most godowns are dilapidated because, although MF retains
the responsibility for maintenance, it has no engineering expertise. MF has
to submit work requests, including very minor ones, on a job-by-job basis to
the Ministry of Works, which prepares bid documents and gets the work done
mainly through private contractors. GOB buildings are maintained by the Public
Works Department (PWD) through annual contractual arrangements. PWD has not
accepted similar responsibility for godowns in need of major repair under this
arrangement, only those that are new or rehabilitated. This situation has led
to the extensive disrepair found at most depots. Assurances were obtained
that project godowns would be transferred to the PWD maintenance roster imme-
diately upon completion or rehabilitation.
6.06      Due to seasonality of use of motorcycles and group use of other
vehicles, private ownership by GOB staff would not be feasible. Consequently
project financed vehicles would be owned by GOB, and maintained by existing
departmental workshops.



- 20 -
C. Grain Procurement
6.07      Field Administration.  The Directorate of Food which is headed by
the Director General of Food, is the operating arm of MF. Its field adminis-
tration can be improved by initiating a closer integration of the various
functions, (rationing, distribution, procurement, movement, pest control),
in the field under one senior MF staff member at the sub-division, district
and regional level. Inspection staff would however, remain independent at
sub-division and district level (Chart 1). In view of the increased respon-
sibilities and greater experience required of individuals filling the key
positions of Regional, District and Sub-division Controller of Food and
also to ensure their ability to deal effectively with field staff of other
Ministries, these positions would need to be reclassified. Assurances were
obtained that GOB would by October 31, 1978, conduct a review of the field
administration focusing on the proposed modifications to the administrative
structure, detailed in Annex 7, and subsequently implement the findings of
such review.
6.08      Effective coordination between MF and other GOB field organizations
would be crucial for the success of the enlarged domestic procurement effort.
The existing district food committee which is headed by the Deputy Commis-
sioner would undertake this role with the addition of representatives from
the PWD, the district managers of commercial banks, the district agriculture
officer and the IRDP project director (in the TCCA pilot project area). The
committee meets at least every quarter, for which the DCF would prepare a
quarterly report and an action plan. A similar sub-division committee would
meet once every month during the peak procurement season of November to Mlarch.
6.09      Methods.  The administrative improvements outlined above would re-
quire improved methods of operation of the procurement program to reap full
benefits of the project's investments. For the 1977/78 procurement MF has
initiated many changes to streamline the system. Further improvements would
be facilitated by additional strategically located storage to be provided
under the project would enable grain procurement to continue uninterrupted by
stock movement difficulties and farmer access to procurement centers would
improve considerably. In addition, new TPCs would be introduced close to
primary markets, as the banking service expands. The fixed-days-of-the-week
banking service which some Commercial banks are presently experimenting with
would also be utilized. Procurement staff would follow the existing pattern
of operating two days a week at purchase centers, dispatching the procured
stock to the nearest LSD by contractor and shifting to another location in
thse same general area along with the bank staff.
1;-o      MF would continue to use transport contractors selected through
zpetitive bidding to move foodgrain stock.  However on routes where the
-,lume of movement justifies only one contractor, a back up contractor
;-!ould also be selected to avoid delays due to rebidding, should the first
contractor fail.



- 21 -
6.11      In order to increase the competition among foodgrain traders pur-
chasing grain at primary markets, the numbers of authorized grain dealers for
procurement would be substantially increased. Grain procurement activities
would start immediately post harvest. Procurement prices would be announced
at least-4 month before planting time.
6.12      The waiting period at points where purchases are heavy often exceeds
one day and this would be reduced by establishing two purchase lines. This
would be possible by reorganization of MF field staff (para 6.07) which would
permit distribution staff to assist in the grain procurement operations.
6.13      Objective determination of quality would be possible using the test-
ing equipment for moisture and foreign matter placed at each LSD/TPC. A set
of standard moisture meters would be maintained at the new Testing Laboratory
for calibration purposes. Detailed sampling and testing guidelines already
included in the MF procurement manual would be revised accordingly. Training
in new methods would be organized by MF assisted by the project consultant.
6.14      Purchase quality standards would be simplified with reduced emphasis
on admixture and immature grain (Annex 4), making it possible to replace the
present system of price discounts for grain below fair average quality by a
system of premia for grain above minimum acceptable quality. At locations
with dryers, the maximum moisture permissible would be relaxed to 20%; higher
moisture would not be accepted to encourage farmers to sun dry when possible.
Discounts required to recover drying costs (Tk 1.2/md per 1% moisture) would
be reasonable and the discounted price for 20% wet paddy would still be
attractive.
6.15      Payment booths would be established at all purchase points and
signatures of two offcials would be authorized for signing payment certifi-
cates, enabling sellers to receive quick payment. GOB would ensure that
adequate security support is available to commercial banks to deliver cash
to and operate the booths.
6.16      In addition to the specific measures above, procurement procedures
would need to be continually reviewed; and assurances were obtained that GOB
would take all necessary measures to (a) minimize congestion at procurement
points; (b) ensure expeditions payment (c) simplify purchase quality standards
(d) provide appropriate alternatives in case of failure of normal transport
arrangements. Assurances were also obtained that procurement prices would
be maintained at levels which ensure adequate incentives for growers to
increase production through use of new seed, fertilizer and irrigation.
6.17      Over the past three years considerable experience has been gained
in the operation of the payment system starting from the issuance of a weigh-
quality- stock- certificate (WQSC) at the purchase point to the MF repayment
out of its budget, for the commercial banks advances for domestic procurement.
In order to learn from this experience and to strengthen the payment system
further to cope with increased procurement, GOB would constitute a suitable
team to review not later than 31 October 1978, the entire payment system.
The terms of reference for this review, which were agreed during negotiations,
would include:



- 22 -
(a) evaluation of the trade off between the increased admini-
strative burden due to a large number of banks involved
in making payments in a sub-division, and the advanatages
of competition between Nationalized banks;
(b) the alternatives to the WQSC system of making payments;
(c) a detailed study of the instances when a bank was not able
to make prompt payment, after a WQSC was issued; investiga-
tion of the reasons for such failure, including bank hours,
security problems, availability of cash, administrative
disbursement limits imposed by commercial banks or the
Bangladesh Bank, and recommendation of suitable remedies;
and
(d) recommendations for suitable mechanisms for timely correction
of problems at the field level between commercial banks and
the Directorate General of Food.
C. Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation
6.18      MF has recently established a Planning Cell, under the Joint
Secretary (Procurement) to focus on the formulation of long term plans and
policy in the food grain sector. The analytical capability of this cell
needs strengthening. A research officer and an economist would be recruited
under the project by 31 October 1978 to focus specifically on the determination
of procurement prices that offer adequate incentive to producers to use yield
increasing technology (para 6.16).
6.19      Monitoring Cell.  MF's operational planning suffers from a lack
of relevant information. In addition, with a significantly greater stock of
paddy at dispersed locations, as a consequence of the project, MF would need
to devote greater attention to developing cost effective alternatives in
movement planning, milling schedules and stock management, as well as to the
monitoring of their implementation (Annex 7). A Monitoring Cell would be
established to assist DGF in continually improving the Directorate of Food's
performance. The cell would:
(a) collect and review all appropriate operating and cost
information;
(b) establish internal reporting and review systems;
(c) analyze data, and make specific recommendations to the
Director General for increasing cost effectiveness; and
(d) prepare the Annual Operating Report of the Directorate of
Food (which would include an Annual Operating Plan for the
country wide operations of the Directorate of Food).



- 23 -
Terms of reference and a staffing plan which would be satisfactory to IDA are
in Annex 7, which also includes on outline of the Annual Report. Assurances
were obtained that the Chief of the cell would report directly to the Director
General and that cell, whose staffing and functions were agreed at negotia-
tions would be established at the latest by October 31, 1978.
6.20      The evaluation of the project would focus on determination of the
impact on (i) farmgate prices; and (ii) MF operating efficiency including
storage utilization and losses. Consultants would be recruited to design
and assist in the implementation of a suitable continuous farmgate price
monitoring system (TORs are in Annex 7). Assurance would be obtained that
a suitable consultant would be recruited before October 31, 1978.  The eva-
luation of the project's impact on MF operating efficiency would involve a
desk review of the work of the Monitoring Cell at the conclusion of the
project.
VII.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The principal economic benefit of the project would be the savings
in foodgrains resulting from: reduced losses in godowns that are rehabili-
tated under the project; the losses that would be prevented by the safe
storage provided by new godowns constructed under the project; and the losses
that would be prevented by improvements in MF storage pest control operations
and by operation of the pilot paddy drying scheme.
7.02      It is estimated that in rehabilitated and new godowns subject to
planned improved MF pest control methods losses would be about 0.2% per month
for a six month storage period, compared with present levels of 0.8% per month
in dilapidated MF owned godowns and the type of marginal facilities now hired
by MF (Annex 9); and about 1% per month in facilities owned and operated by
private traders.
7.03      Details of the calculation of the projects economic rate of return
are in Annex 9. Through implementation of the project, about 19,000 tons of
foodgrains valued at nearly US$6.0 M would be saved annually.  Of this about
11,000 tons would be saved in rehabilitated and new godowns, 7,000 tons in
other storage facilities and 1,000 tons from operation of the paddy drying
scheme. The overall economic rate of return is calculated at 21%, which is
satisfactory, with individual rates of return of 15% for godowns, over 50% for
the pest control program and 24% for the paddy drying scheme. The rate of
return for the component involving improvement of MF pest control operations
is particularly high because of the substantial costs sunk in storage facili-
ties in which the relatively cheap pesticide treatments would be made. Grain
savings are valued at farmgate paddy prices derived from the Bank's estimate
of future rice prices up to full development. In the calculation, all costs
and benefits are based on border prices except unskilled labor which is valued
at 75% of its financial cost on the grounds that this better represents its
economic opportunity cost.

7.04      The major risk to the success of the project is that increases in
the supply of grain in the project area -would be inadequate to permit economic
employment of facilities constructed under the project and which would con-
stitute a net increase in storage space available to MF. However, about 60%
of the project constructed storage would replace marginal facilities currently
hired by MF and which are basically unsuitable for grain storage, such a situa-
tion, would occur only if MF failed to increase its domestic foodgrain procure-
ment in the project area over the next five years by 35% above 1975/76 levels.
The probability of this occurring, either because of inefficiency on the part
of MF or because of poor performance in grain production, is considered slight.
Government has consistently reiterated its intentions of achieving foodgrain
self sufficiency and of ensuring incentive prices to farmers and the project
area enjoys the focus of GOB's agricultural development activities. The latter
are aimed at improving the package of services and inputs such as improved
seeds, irrigation and extension required by producers. IDA is also financing
projects in the project areas with these objectives (para 4.03). In Annex 1
an estimate is made of likely 1985/86 procurement in the project area assuming
GOB continues its incentive pricing policy and strengthens its procurement
administration. Project facilities would increase MF procurement storage
capacity in the project area to only 60% of this estimated potential by 1981.
A sensitivity analysis shows that a delay of four years in reaching target
usage levels (85% full for six months in a year) would reduce the overall
return to 17%, assuming that surplus facilities would remain idle during
this period of delay. An increase of 15% in operating costs would reduce
the overall return to 20%.
7.05      An indirect and unquantifiable benefit stemming from the project
would be that by enabling MF to increase its levels of grain procurement at
guaranteed incentive prices, the project would encourage farmers to increase
production of foodgrains. Other benefits due to the project would be the
experience gained in paddy drying and in the development of cooperative grain
marketing. In addition, improvements in response to disaster relief would be
possible due to the commitments of storage in the flood or cyclone prone areas
of Bangladesh which would benefit about 150,000 households.
VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      At negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) GOB would inform IDA of any proposed construction of food-
grain storage, in addition to that provided by the project,
and it would undertake such construction only if it does
not adversely affect the utilization of project facilities
(para 5.04);
(b) godowns would be built using designs, construction methods,
and contracting procedures satisfactory to IDA and that
construction of a godown at a new location in the core
area would only be undertaken after testing its potential



- 25 -
through the operation of a TPC (para 5.05); annual con-
struction plans with relevant justification data would
be sent to IDA by February of each year (para 6.04);
project godowns would be transferred to the PWD main-
tenance roster as soon as completed or rehabilitated
to be maintained by PWD (para 6.05);
(c) all usable existing pest control equipment in the project
area would be transferred to MF units in the other areas
(para 5.09);
(d) GOB would fix a day of the week in each sub-division
where project TCCA were operating, for purchase from
TCCA (para 5.11);.
(e) auditors satisfactory to IDA would be appointed to audit
the separate project accounts of PIU and PECU, which
would be sent to IDA within 6 months of the close of the
fiscal year (para 5.27);
(f) GOB would take measures to increase competition among
foodgrain traders at the farmgate level (para 6.11);
make such purchase and transport arrangements required
to (a) minimize congestion at procurement points;
(b) ensure expeditions payments; (c) simplify purchase
quality standards; and (d) provide appropriate alterna-
tives in case of failure of normal transport arrangements
(para 6.16); and set procurement prices at levels that
provide sufficient incentive for growers to increase
production through a greater use of new seed varieties,
fertilizer and irrigation (para 6.16);
(g) by October 31, 1978, the proposed reviews of the field
administration of the Directorate of Food, (para 6.07),
and of the current system of payments and financing
used to purchase foodgrains domestically, (para 6.17),
would be completed;
(h) by October 31, 1978, the MF Planning Cell would be
strengthened and Monitoring cell would be established,
with staffing and terms of reference agreed with IDA
(para 6.18 and 6.19); and
(i) by October 31, 1978 consultants to design the farmgate
price monitoring system would be recruited (para 6.21).
8.02      Proposed conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(a) GOB project proformas had been approved by the National
Economic Council (para 5.25);



- 26 -
(b) the PIU and PECU project funds had been established with
an initial GOB contribution of Tk 2 M and Tk 5 M respec-
tively (para 5.25);
(c) GOB had established PSC, PIU, PECU with organization,
functions and responsibilities agreed with IDA (para
6.03); and
(d) for at least 20 sites out of 35 locations inspected by
PECU, suitable land had been acquired (para 6.04).
8.03      Proposed conditions of disbursement would be:
(a) against expenditures for the new testing laboratory,
that the Chemist for the laboratory had been appointed
(para 5.10);
(b) against expenditure for civil works that PECU had been
staffed according to a plan satisfactory to IDA and the
project consultants in engineering and paddy drying and
procurement appointed (paras 5.26 and 6.03).
8.04      Given above assurances and conditions, the project would be suit-
able for an IDA credit of US$25 M to GOB on standard terms.

BANGLADESII
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
The Foodgrain Sector
1.        Foodgrains play a dominant role in the economy of Bangladesh;
foodgrain production accounts for 30-35% of GDP; foodgrain imports account
for 39% and 29% of total imports; and foodgrain consumption provides for
82% of calori intake and 70% of protein.
Production
2.        Rice accounts for 98% of the foodgrain production (Table 1).  There
are 3 rice crops in Bangladesh; Aus, Aman and Boro. Aus is both broadcast and
transplanted, the broadcast being sown mid-March through mid-May with trans-
planting taking place March 1st through mid-April. Harvesting is in July and
August. It is predominantly rainfed, and is the crop most vulnerable to
disasters as it relies on the timely arrival of the monsoon and must be har-
vested during the period of most likely flooding. In 1975/76, it accounted
for 25% of production and 35% of acreage exhibiting the lowest average yield.
Aman, the major crop, is also rainfed and both broadcast and transplanted.
Broadcast aman is a deepwater floating rice which elongates with rising water
levels in the flood season. Broadcast is sown in March and April, transplant-
ing is between July and September. Harvesting takes place mainly in November
and December (dry season). Aman, in 1975/76 utilized 55% of the rice area to
produce 55% of the production. Boro is an irrigated transplanted crop which
has been increasing in importance despite the problems of drying during the
rainy harvest season. Transplanting takes place between November and Februar-:
and harvesting between April and June. In 1975/76 Boro produced 18% of the
rice output from 11% of the area.
W.        Wheat has not been a major crop in Bangladesh although growing in
t1portance it represents only 1.7% of total foodgrain production in 1975/76.
Wheat competes with Boro for land availability and is harvested in April.
4.        Foodgrain production has experienced severe problems.  The war for
independence and its aftermath, drought, floods and an explosion in the
major urea factory have all exacerbated the problem of weak administi:ation,
poor distribution of inputs and inefficiency of the extension service with
the result that the level of production in 1969/70 was not attained until
the bumper crops of 1975/76.
5.        Neither Aus nor Aman have exhibited any significant growth trend
in the last decade although there is some evidence that production of both
is now turning upwards. The Aus crop of 1975/76 was 3.23 M tons, the highest



ANNEX 1
Page 2
ever and the 1976/77 crop was 3.01 M tons, which is 400,000 tons greater than
the average of the previous five years, despite adverse weather conditions.
Similarly the Aman crop was also at a record level in 1975/76, 7.05 M tons and
preliminary estimates for 1976/77 indicate a crop of approximately 7 M tons,
also significantly above previous levels despite normal weather conditions.
TChe Boro crop has been increasing steadily despite a stagnation in early
seventies. 1975/76 output of 2.29 M tons was over six times the crop of
1965/66. The growth has occurred mainly because of an increase in avail-
ability of irrigation (in particular low lift pumps) and by increased utili-
zation of fertilizer and High Yielding Varieties (HYV), inputs which can be
used to maximum advantage on the irrigated Boro crop.
6.        Wheat production had been stagnant between the levels of 90-115,000
tons a year from 300,000 ac between 1969/70 and 1974/75. Then in 1975/76
farmers began to adopt HYVs on a large scale and production and acreage both
increased with a crop of 215,000 tons from 370,000 ac. Since wheat uses much
less water per acre than rice it is a more profitable crop for farmers to grow
especially in the North-West with its more porous soil. Given the recent
dramatic increases in wheat production in West Bengal in India, it is believed
that if the Government provides good seed, extension advice and guarantees a
fair price, wheat production could continue to grow by 80-100,000 tons a year
for at least the next five years.
7.        Yields of paddy in Bangladesh are low in absolute terms, indicating
a potential for increase, but in terms of international comparisons Bangladesh
is at a par with many of her neighbors:
Comparative Average Yields (1975)
(kg/ha)
…--------------Paddy-----------------------    -------Wheat--------
Bangladesh       1,825    Indonesia       2,686    Bangladesh       926
India            1,826    Malaysia        3,009    India         1,338
Burma            1,827    S. Korea        5,324    Burma            745

Source: FAO Production Yearbook (1975).
The cause of these low yields is mainly insufficient use of fertilizers and
HYV's. Indications are that only about 15% of foodgrain acreage (1-1.5 M ac)
is planted with HYVs. Similarly, an average of less than 20 pounds of fertil-
izer was applied per acre in 1975/76, less than one-fifth the recommended
amount for local varieties and one-tenth of HYV's. It is estimated that
6 M acres of land is suitable for rainfed HYV in Aus and another 6.6 M acres
for HYV in Aman. One major factor for the low utilization of fertilizer and
HYV's is that low farmgate prices received immediately post-harvest have
discouraged farmers from such expenditures 1/.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
Imports
8.        Imports have for many years provided a significant proportion of
the foodgrains available for consumption especially in years of crop failure
or other disaster. In 1972/3 the percentage reached a peak of about 25% when
total imports were 2.74 M tons. The lowest post independence level was in
1975/76, the year of the record crop, when only 1.42 M tons (or 11% of total
consumption) were imported (Table 3). Imports have been necessary because
of the low per capita domestic level of production, a position that has hardly
improved since independence as population growth has grown faster than food-
grain production. Per capita consumption is estimated to have declined
continuously since 1969, except for a slight increase in 1975/76.
9.        All imports are by government with an increasing proportion being
on aid terms. It is estimated that Bangladesh purchased 42% of imports in
1972/73, 37% in 1973/74, 30% in 1974/75 and only 10% in 1975/76. As a result
of the greater availability of wheat on concessionary terms the proportion
of wheat in total imports has been increasing despite consumer preference for
rice. In 1971/72 rice made up 40% of total imports, in 1974/75, 12% and in
1975/76, 27%. At present, all imports enter Bangladesh by sea, through Chitta-
gong, where one of the silos built under the First Foodgrain Storage Project
(381-BD) is located, and through Chalna which handles 30-40% of the foodgrain
imports.
Prices
10.       Foodgrain prices in Bangladesh vary significantly both annually,
seasonally and geographically. The annual fluctuations result mainly from the
large production fluctuations that occur in Bangladesh, usually due to climatic
conditions. Thus, the floods of 1974/75 (domestic production 11.2 M tons) led
to an average retail price of medium quality rice of 252 Tk/md while the bumper
crop of 1975/76 (production 12.8 M tons) saw prices averaging 154 Tk/md, despite
beginning the year at a high level as a result of the previous year's disaster.
These fluctuations are magnified as only an estimated 10-33% of the crop is
commercially marketed and relatively minor production swings can cause very
large changes in the amounts marketed.
11.       Despite three rice crops, significant seasonal fluctuations also
occur with the price dropping severely after the Aman harvest. Chart I shows
the seasonal price fluctuations. The lowest prices are found after the har-
vest of the Aman crop, between December and January. Prices then rise stead-
ily, the other harvests making little impact, with the peak arriving in
September/October. GOB has attempted to moderate these fluctuations through
the ration and procurement system (see below) but, to date, has been marginally
successful. These fluctuations tend to harm the small farmer who is forced to
sell immediately post harvest at low prices, often to repay consumption loans,
and later in the year has to purchase foodgrains, often on credit, at high
prices. This cycle leaves the farmer in debt and under such a financial
constraint that expenditures upon extra inputs are impossible.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
12.       Geographical price disparities are also significant.  Due to poor
farm to market, and inter-regional transportation facilities and an imperfect
marketing system post harvest prices tend to be lower in the surplus districts
than in the deficit areas 1/. There is also an excessively large gap between
the wholesale price of paddy and the procurement price 2/ indicating the
limited impact of the Government's price support program with a guaranteed
minimum price. Such average national data, however, conceals the large fall
Ln post harvest prices particularly in surplus areas. For example, the whole-
sale price of Boro paddy in Dinajpur was Tk 51/md in 1976, IRRI paddy was
Tk 46/md, and Aus paddy is estimated to have been Tk 42-44/md. These prices
were Tk 10-20 less than average national wholesale prices and Tk 20-30 less
than the official procurement prices.
C;OB Foodgrain Operations
13.       Since the Bengal Famine of 1943, public marketing has been a major
role of Government, with the following basic objectives:
(i)  to maintain low, stable and uniform foodgrain prices;
(ii) to provide low-priced foodgrains to those in need,
especially at time of emergency;
(iii)  to supply subsidized foodgrains to Government employees
at subsidized prices, in effect, as a form of payment in
kind; and
(iv) to ensure the supply of foodgrains to urban areas
especially in times of bad crops and high prices.
14.       GOB has resorted to two methods of obtaining foodgrains to supply the
ration system: imports, and domestic procurement. Most imports, being on aid
terms were of wheat. Domestic procurement had low priority, being undertaken,
often compulsorily, to reduce smuggling or to fill distribution gaps. During
1/   For example in March 1976 when the country wide average minimum retail
price was Tk 105.9/md, in the surplus districts it was Tk 99.9/md and
in deficit districts Tk 110.1/md. (The surplus districts being defined
by Government as Dinajpur, Bogra, Rajshahi, Khulna, Patuakhali, Barisal,
Mymensingh and Sylhet and the deficit as Pabna, Faridpur, Dacca, Tangail,
Comilla, Noakhali and Chittagong).
2/   In 1976, the procurement price was greater than the average wholesale
price. (Report of Foodgrain Price Policy Review Mission):
Crop      Price (Tk/md)
Aman         7.10
Boro       11.50
Aus         12.28
IRRI       11.24
Wheat        5.21



ANNEX 1
Page 5
the compulsory procurement scheme of 1974/75, which was introduced nationwide,
districts were cordoned, and compulsory assessments were made against farmers
according to their farm and family size. Although 138,000 tons were procured,
it caused great bitterness among many of the farmers especially as the procure-
ment price was well below the then high free market level.
15.       The emphasis of GOB policy has changed towards: 1/
(a) providing an incentive price to producers to increase
domestic production more rapidly;
(b) providing food needs of the most disadvantaged;
(c) managing the supply and distribution to promote food
price stability; and
(d) reducing food subsidies to free up resources for economic
development.
GOB has consequently returned to voluntary procurement stating its willing-
ness to purchase an unlimited quantity at set prices. In a good harvest
very Large quantities will need to be purchased if the price is to be main-
tained. A poor crop will require a running down of stocks and resort to
greater imports. Open market sales by Government will be required to stabilize
prices 2/. The procurement price would be set at what is intended to be an
incentive level (Tk 74/md for paddy in 1976/77 and Tk 80/md has already been
set as the price for the 1977/78 season). Such a price is sufficiently high,
if actually available to farmers (given present input prices) to encourage the
farmer to adopt modern yield increasing technologies required to expand domes-
tic production. However, due to poor procurement facilities (Annex 2), imple-
mentation efforts and other constraints (Annex 3) farmers have received post
harvest prices in surplus areas of only 35-50 Tk/md, or up to 50Z of price
(para 13).
Procurement
'16.       In 1975/76, under voluntary methods, procurements reached 415,000
tons (Table 4). The large volume was due to the bumper harvest in all crops
which led to the extremely low farmgate prices, much below the official pro-
curement price. Wheat was procured for the first time with 6,700 tons being
purchased out of a total crop of 215,000 tons. The return to more normal crops

2/   The Government began open market sales in Dacca area on a small scale
in March 1977 when prices were rising fast. In the following two months
of sales 2,000 tons of rice were sold through private retailers at a
retail price of 100 Tk/md and a permitted quota of 3 seers per head.
The average retail price on the free market in March 1977 was Tk 127/md.

and some other constraints (Annex 3) has seen a lower level of procurement
in 1976/77, a total of approximately 310,000 tons which is nevertheless
nearly 3 times the previous highest procurement total (excluding 1975/76).

17.       The procurement drive has tended to center on Aman.  In 1975/76
82.5% of procurement was from the Aman crop (Table 4), 10.2% from Aus, 5.7%
from Boro and 1.6% was wheat. Apart from the increased cost of purchasing
small amounts of paddy in the Aus and Boro, GOB has run into serious storage
problems with these crops because traditional sun drying is difficult
(Annex 5). Most farmers are unable to meet GOB purchase standards and so
procurement of these crops has remained low although the Boro crop has been
identified as the crop with the maximum growth potential (para 5).
18.       Public distribution has varied from 2.6 M tons in 1972/73 to 1.7 M
ton1s in 1975/76. It would undoubtedly have been higher during the floods and
famine of 1974/75 if distribution had been physically possible. The statutory
ratlion has varied from 16% to 28% of total public distribution and tends to
depend upon the ratio of the ration price to the retail price 1/. The modified
ration is more variable, fluctuating from 1.6 M tons in 1972/73 (61%) to 0.5 M
tolIs in 1975/76 (30%). The amounts depend as much upon availability as need.
The relief category has been increasing in importance due to the expansion of
the Food for Work Program. In 1975/76, it reached 226,000 tons, 13.5% of total
off'take. Similarly, the "other" category has increased as a result of a steady
expansion of the number and categories of people entitled to such a ration.
1/   As the ration is usually poor quality rice, or less desired wheat, con-
sumers will still purchase non-ration rice even when they still have a
ration allowance despite the higher price. As the price ratio of non-
ration to ration rice rises, the demand for ration rice tends to rise.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
19.       The peak levels of distribution occur in September and October
immediately prior to the harvesting of the Aman crop. The trough occurs in
December, post Aman harvest, with amounts distributed then rising consistently
throughout the year with the boro, wheat and aus harvests appearing to have
little impact. There are large annual variations in offtake by district.
Bulk of the distribution occurs in the major urban districts, viz Dacca and
Chittagong, and also Khulna; primarily as a result of the statutory ration.
Given the consumer preference for rice, GOB allocates wheat as evenly as pos-
sible between all districts. Relief rations tend to be predominantly wheat.
The Food Subsid-
20.       Public distribution prices were less than one-third of open market
prices during 1971-75 but are now almost 70% of these. GOB sells rice in the
ration shops at Tk 90/md and wheat at Tk 70/md. Including cost of milling
and handling, these imply a financial subsidy of 57% and 31% for domestically
procured rice and wheat. However, on imported foodgrains, because of the
large element of grants, GOB achieves a net profit margin of 7% and 30% for
rice and wheat, as seen below.
Avg. Price Received   Avg. Cost    Subsidy
Rice Local                  83.6               134.5        57%

Projections for the Foodgrain Sector
22.       There is a substantial potential for an increased foodgrain produc-
tion mainly through investments in fertilizers, improved seeds and irrigation.
Bank estimates 1/ are that present GOB strategy, could lead to annual increases
in foodgrain production of approximately 3.5% about 0.7% more than the present
population growth rate, an increase of roughly 500,000 tons per annum. Govern-
ment policies are emphasizing an expansion of the acreage under irrigation
(mainly tubewells and low lift pumps), the reorganizing and strengthening of
the extension service, an increase in the availability of fertilizers and
improving the availability of agricultural credit.
23.       The greatest potential increases in production are, seen in wheat
and Boro, wheat being expected to grow at an average rate of 16.8% p.a. and
Boro at 5.7% p.a. These high rates reflect the previous low output levels of
both crops. Aman is also projected to increase rapidly, at a rate of 2.4% p.a.,
mainly as a result of the introduction of HYV's. Aus is considered to have
the least potential in both absolute and growth terms with an estimated in-
crease of 2.1% p.a. The major area of expansion is expected to be the North-
West region with Mymensingh, Sylhet and Noakhali also exhibiting growth rates
above the average. Least potential is seen in the Chittagong Hill Tracts,
Tangail and Faridpur (Table 5).
Consumption and Import Requirement
24.       Per capita consumption of foodgrains in 1975/76 was 15.5 oz. per
diem, the average for the complete 1969/70 - 1975/76 period. This figure is
customarily considered to be the lowest acceptable level despite being below
the minimum recommended nutritional intake. A range of production, consump-
tion, and import estimates based on different assumptions regarding per-capita
consumption is shown below.

/c   15.5 oz. per capita per diem.
/d   Starting at base of 15.5 oz. p.c. per diem in 1975/86 (13.05 M tons),
increase in consumption was estimated to equal increase in demand
where:
Increase in demand = Population increase + income elasticity of
demand (0.5) x growth in p.a. income (5% p.a.).
/e   As /d but in addition allowing for a 10% rise in the relative price
of foodgrains, 1/ thus adding a term to above equation of [price elas-
ticity of demand (-0.3) x price change (+10%)].
The import requirement in 1980/1 is projected to be 1.0 - 1.7 M tons and in
1985/86, 0.4 - 1.8 M tons.
Domestic Procurement
25.       These projections were extended to the district level for 1985/86
in order to obtain production surpluses and deficits in a more disaggregated
form (Table 6). Surpluses are expected in Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra, Patuak-
hali, Mymensingh, Sylhet and Noakhali with Rajshahi and Barisal being on
average self sufficient. All other districts are expected to be in deficit.
The project area is expected to provide a net annual surplus of 1.25 M tons by
1985/86, based on the conservative estimates (C).
26.       If various constraints on the procurement system (Annex 4) are
gradually removed, the level of procurement achieved in a normal crop year
should increase rapidly. Estimated procurement potential by district and by
crop in 1985/86 based on past procurement history, district surpluses, the
crop projections and specific physical problems in each area, are shown in
1/   IDA Commodity Price Forecasts of May 1977 project a 43% increase
in the price of wheat and a 44% increase in the price of rice, in
terms of constant 1977 dollars by 1980.



ANNEX 1

Table 12. I/ The major procurement centers are likely to be Dinajpur,
Mymensingh, Rangpur, Sylhet, Rajshahi, and Bogra (725,000 tons) and Patuakhali
(70,000 tons). Aman is expected to remain the major procurement crop although
its share is expected to drop to about 65% in 1985/6 from 82.5% in 1975/6.
Boro and wheat are estimated to rise rapidly in line with the projected pro-
duction increases. Parallel increases in Aus are not foreseen. Table 7
projects the procurement possibilities.
1/   These estimates do not assume that the price support system is neces-
sarily 100% effective in raising the farmgate price to the procurement
price less transportation costs. Rather it is an assessment of what is
feasible in Bangladesh taking into account the physical difficulties of
implementation in the country. It presumes that the Government will
concentrate the bulk of its efforts in areas where it feels it can be
most successful in procuring, that is in grain surplus areas with rea-
sonable communications. The projections assume that the storage con-
straint will not be binding in any normal year.

3/ - 15.5 oz. of rice per capita per diem.
4/ - Net production less consumption 'A'.
5/' - Estimated starting from a base of 15.5 oz. p.c. p.d. in 1975/6 (13.05m tons) and then
estimating increase in demand:
Increase in demand - population growth + income elasticity of demand x growth
in per capita income. Assuming GDP increase of 5% a year and income elasticity
of demand of 0.5.  Assuming an infinite elasticity of supply, demand
comsumption. This is an upper estimate for consumption.
- Net production less consumptioni 'C'.

BANGLADESH
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Foodgrain Storage Resources and Requirements
A. General
1.        The location and capacity of storage facilities in Bangladesh are
determined by the objective to be served. These are:
(a) procurement related storage, aimed at increasing the
presence of government grain purchases in the market
place to stimulate farmgate prices;
(b) trans-shipment storage to facilitate intermodal transfer
and to even out demand for transport and milling services;
(c) distribution storage, to have ample stocks to feed normal
and extraordinary demands from major consumption points,
partly to regulate consumer price behavior; and
(d)  emergency or relief storage, geared to ensuring safe captive
stocks adequate to meet emergency needs of areas prone to
total transport disruption.
All foodgrain storage space in Bangladesh does not contribute equally to each
separate element of the GOB foodgrain sector policies, i.e. procurement,
distribution, buffer stock and relief. Because of distinct demarcation of
surplus and deficit areas, the difficulties of inter-regional transportation,
the fact that most "surplus" areas are only surplus during a part of the year,
and the skewed distribution of rice milling capacity between production and
distribution areas, storage space is effectively dedicated to a specific
purpose; viz procurement, distribution, or relief; although nominally avail-
able for all.
B. Storage Capacity and Condition
2.        GOB's Ministry of Food (MF) owns and operates a vast network of grain
storage facilities scattered across the country (see Map). They comprise three
categories of depots: 12 "large" depots called Central Storage Depots (CSD),
318 "small" depots called Local Storage Depots (LSD), and 4 silo complexes.
In addition it utilizes 125,000 tons of space leased from private sources.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
3.        The sack grain storage is made up of two broad categories of
godowns: "pucca" type denoting all godowns with concerete floors and brick
or concrete walls, and "non-pucca" type representing the godowns made mainly
of iron sheet which are generally considered to be not suitable for foodgrain
storage. The Dacca type godown, which is the most common, and its variants,
Twin Dacca and Calcutta type, belong to the pucca category, and the Lahore
Shed, the Twin Nissen and the Shell type belong to the "non-pucca" or "Tin
huts" category. About 85% of all godowns are pucca, and over 95% of pucca
godowns are Dacca type godowns.
Loading Capacity
4.        Actual storage capacity of a godown is a function of size, com-
modity being stored, its condition going into storage, duration, and climatic
condition during storage. The standard 100' x 40' Dacca godown, 18' high is
rated at a nominal capacity of 500 tons, based on 14 layer stacks. Stacks as
high as 18 have been built successfully in Bangladesh and ample room exists
above the stack for pest control operations. For short term storage, especially
during the dry season, when demand for pest control operations is low, aisles
between and around the stacks can also be used for temporary storage, awaiting
shipment. Rice and wheat have greater bulk densities, and well built floors of
these pucca godowns could carry the extra weight without any damage.
5.        However, with increased loading over extended periods losses tend
to increase because of impaired ability to inspect and undertake pest control
treatment due to lack of space between and above stacks. Additional handling
costs are also incurred. It is estimated that 14% moisture paddy in a standard
Dacca godown overloaded to 850 tons will have an increased loss of 2 percent
over a 12 month period. On the other hand, savings in capital cost can be
achieved from overloading. Based on cost savings, the recommended loading
capacity for a standard Dacca type godown would be:
Short-Term           Medium-Term
3-4 months            6 months
---------- Tons -------------
Paddy                   750 /a                 650
Rice/Wheat              950                    850
/a   In procurement areas, it is recommended that
godowns be loaded to 850 tons while awaiting
transhipment.
It should be noted that the loading capacity of 750 tons of paddy corresponds
to a rice equivalent capacity of about 500 tons, which is almost identical to
the GOB nominal rating for the standard godown.

MF Storage Facilities
6.        As of June 30, 1978, MF is expected to have the following storage
facilities (Table 1):

Depots            Depots         Depots     Total
Number of Depots                  12                318             4          334
Number of Storage Units          452                956             4        1,412
-- tons…- …
Nominal Capacity (tons)    396,000              514,000       225,000   1,135,000 /a
a/   Recently, GOB has agreed with Danida for assistance to finance the con-
struction of 50 prefabricated godowns (about 25,000 tons) and with Go-
vernment of Japan for 15 godowns at 4 major CSD.  These are not included.
The theoretically maximum loading capacity, assuming a paddy to rice/wheat
ratio of 1:1 (rice equivalent weight), is estimated to be 1.5 M tons, no
allowance being made for non-foodgrains, transit storage or underutilization
of capacity, which together reduce the MF storage system potential to much
lower levels (para 20).
Conditions
7.        Many godowns are dilapidated and require substantial repair. Some
have outlived their useful life and warrant demolition. MF estimates that 64%
of its godowns are dilapidated (730 pucca and 165 non-pucca godowns), and most
of these (45 in the project area and 77 units at the Khulna CSD, 18 at Tejgaon
CSD) should be demolished at once. Countrywide rehabilitation of Dacca type
godowns in being financed by a recently agreed UK-ODM program. Once rehabili-
fated most of the pucca godowns would be useful for safe foodgrain storage for
& number of years. The dilapidated non-pucca godowns are only considered
suitable for short term foodgrain storage, but after rehabiliation, most of
them would be usable for medium-term "peak-chopping" storage needs or for
non-foodgrains storage (salt, sugar edible oil etc), which currently take up
almost 10% of the available storage space.
C. Transport, Location and Capacity Utilization
Transport
8.        The transport system in Bangladesh is extremely strained, which
makes it impossible to move large volumes from procurement areas to distri-
bution areas at the peak of the harvest season. There is a general shortage



ANNEX 2
Page 4
of roads, trucks, rail equipment and river barges in Bangladesh. All of this
is further complicated by the highly peaked nature of procurement operations
and by inclement weather which makes it difficult to keep the grain dry while
in transit. Over 50% of the country is less than 25 feet above mean sea level
and up to two thirds of the country is subject to severe flooding. This makes
the transport system quite ineffective at the local level for prolonged
periods, particularly during the monsoon season.
9.        Inventory of broad gauge locomotives in 1976 was about 250, and meter
gauge, about 100 to service about 1,800 miles of track. Further, 55% of the
meter gauge and 50% of the broad gauge locomotives were out of service. Wagons
are scarce, and there is a high percentage of bad order cars. At a CSD visited
by the mission, 17 out of 22 cars had been (rightly) rejected as being totally
unsuitable for hauling grain. Shipping delays of several weeks undoubtedly
occur in the outlying areas because of lack of motive power and wagons. Rail
movement is considerably slowed and wagon/locomotive turn around is extremely
poor, because of absence of railway bridges, and dependence on ferrys for
crossing the major rivers, as well as change of gauge requirements. In the
peak procurement period which coincides with the major harvest, the problem of
large scale foodgrain movement is much more severe, because the system is
already over burdened. GOB is undertaking a major Railway Rehabilitation
Program with assistance of ADB, but the unsatisfied demand for transportation,
the future increased needs and the investment requirements are such that major
improvement in transportation available to move increased domestically procured
foodgrain stocks without major shipping delays, is not expected in the near
future.
10.       Roadways situation is not much better either, though in recent years
Bangladesh has embarked on a major road building program. Bangladesh has a
total of only 2,600 miles of paved roads, 70% of which are less than 12 feet
wide. In addition, there are 1,450 miles of fair weather roads. There are
few bridges and crossing of the extensive river network is delayed because of
the need to depend on river ferrys. The entire vehicles fleet of Bangladesh
consists of 8,250 trucks with an average carrying capacity of less than 5 tons.
It-is concentrated around Dacca and Chittagong. MF owned fleet of about 500
trucks, many extremely old, is 60% inoperative; and often contractors, who are
used extensively by MF, have difficulties in fulfilling contractual obligations
because of the run-down condition of the national trucking fleet.
11.       The inland water transport system consists of approximately 1,000
powered craft of which 60% are passenger vessels operating on 3,000 miles
waterways which expands to 4,000 miles in the monsoon season. In the inland
areas, country boats (approximately 65,000) provide the bulk of the trans-
port service, most carrying less than 5 tons, and the aggregate capacity is
only around 180,000 tons. Given slow movement, total movement capacity is
low.
Milling Capacity Location
12.       Paddy has to be milled into rice before consumption.  Most milling
is done in small lots by the farmers household, mostly by women in wooden



ANNEX 2
Page 5
manual hLuskers. The larger farmers use small husking machines - either elec-
trical or diesel driven - of which there are about 7,500 in Bangladesh (total
capacity 16,000 tons/8 hr day). Milling for government is done by 100 major
rice mills (total capacity 2,700 ton/8 hr day). Nearly 65% of this capacity is
situated in the six districts comprising the project core area (Table 2) the
balance in Dacca (14%) and Chittagong (17%). Thus, procured stocks need to be
held in procurement areas till milled to avoid having to bring them back for
milling. Only Dacca and Chittagong CSD are usable for storage of procured
paddy stocks, and in fact, only CSDs in Chittagong district, show any signifi-
cant stocks of paddy in the January-April procurement period.
13.       However, even after conversion to rice, it would not be desirable
to send all procured stocks to major distribution CSD's because even the
so-called "surplus" areas have significant ration distribution needs in the
lean season - July - October. This is partly because of the nature of the
distribution program, but also because of Boro and Aus crops together con-
stitute only 45% of production.
Storage Location
14.       Location of MF storage facilities clearly reflects past GOB emphasis
on distribution (Table 1). Six major food procurement districts (Bogra,
Dinajpur, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet), which provide almost 65%
of the total procurement (and 25% of the distribution) have only 28% of MF
storage capacity, while the six other districts (Dacca, Barisal, Chittagong,
Khulna, Comilla, Pabna) which account for only 17% of the procurement (and
59% of distribution) have about 53% of the existing storage capacity.
15.       Within the major procurement districts, MF storage facilities tend
to be concentrated in major urban centers but areas growing Boro, and wheat
the two crops with the maximum growth potential, are seriously neglected.
The major difficulty remains one of adequate storage space to continue pro-
curement operations uninterrupted, as well as one of inadequate access to
growers (Annex 4).
16.       Thus, lack of storage capacity in the major production areas
results in:
(a) difficulties in procurement and farmgate price support
operations (Annex 4);
(b) excessive losses because of storage in marginal
facilities or in the open air (Annex 9); and
(c) excessive burden on the transport system due to
considerable double shipping to bring paddy back for
milling or local consumption in the lean season.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
Capacity Utilization
17.       As a result of these factors, capacity utilization of the entire
MF storage system averaged 55% in 1976, but was 68% in 1975 mainly because of
the much higher level of imported stocks on hand (Table 4). Disparities
between capacity utilization at CSDs and LSDs also exist because of the highly
peaked demand for local transport. For example, in Mymensingh district (Table
4) LSDs were loaded to 110-125% nominal capacity during February-July 1976,
but the large CSD (25,000 tons) had only 45-50% of its capacity utilized.
Only, at the peak of the distribution season in October did the CSD show a
more reasonable 79% utilization. However, procurement area godowns showed
an average utilization of 95% at LSD.
18.       Throughput or turnover at individual CSDs and LSDs, is on the other
hand remarkably high. CSDs average a turnover of stocks of about 2.5 and
LSDs range from 1.5 in the procurement points to possibly 15 at some major
urban centers. However, the total storage system achieves a turnover of only
slightly above 1.25, reflecting the extent of multiple handling and inter
godown movement involved in the system. Turnover of procurement area godowns
is bound to be low because of peaked procurement arrivals and the even dis-
tribution load. As Boro procurement builds up, turnover should improve.
D. System Potential
Procurement
19.       The maximum procurement potential of the MF storage system is much
below its theoretical loading capacity, given location, transport constraints,
need to store paddy in procurement areas till milling capacity is available and
avoidance of multiple shipping. Allowing for recent additions and increased
proportion of Boro and Aus in the future, the estimated procurement capacity of
the system is:
Procurement Capacity
('000 tons)
National                           Project Area
1977/78         450-550 /a                             225-325
1981/82 /b      700-800                                450-550
/a   Maximum of the range implies the use of all marginal and
hired facilities for short-term use during bumper crops.
Lb   By 1985/86, improvements in the transport system could add
about 50-100,000 tons to procurement capacity.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
Buffer Stocks
20.       To cover unforseen events like crop damage from floods, cyclones
or below normal production, GOB maintains buffer stocks. Buffer stock capa-
city is affected by:
(a) space to be left free to enable procurement to be
undertaken unconstrained;
(b) rice milling capacity, which forces stocks to be
held as paddy, taking up greater storage space; and
(c) need to keep the silos part empty to meet import
unloading requirements, non-foodgrain storage
needs, and overall capacity utilization level.
21.       Mission estimates (Table 5) show that in October 1978, about 750,000
tons of buffer stocks could be held; while in July 1978, since space reserved
for procurement would be lower, and commodity mix would have changed in favor
of rice/wheat, about 1.0 M tons can be held with the additional godowns under
the project, this would increase to 1.3 M tons by (July) 1982.
E. Project Proposals
22.       Mission estimates of likely procurement levels in various districts
are discussed in Annex 1. A grain flow model for Dinajpur in 1985/86 when a
normal year procurement level of 185,000 tons is likely to be reached is pre-
sented in Table 5. Assumptions are that:
(a)  ration offtake would remain at 1976 levels,
with population growth offset by reduced
distribution;
(b) ration would consist of 50% wheat and 50% rice;
(c) a 90 day shipping lag would continue to apply between
procurement centers and shipment out of the region; and
(d) procurement seasonality would be as in footnote 1.
23.       Warehouse space required in Dinajpur is highly seasonal varying from
126,000 tons in January to as little as 7,000 tons in April. Only during 3
months of the year does the space requirement exceed 55% of the peak. Thus the
marginal economic cost of providing extra capacity increases rapidly. Between
normal and good crop year, peak capacity requirement increases by about 25%,



ANNEX 2
Page 8
but since only 1 in 2 or 3 years is likely to be a good procurement year,
building new pucca storage capacity for peak good year requirement would not
be justified, without first utilizing the full short term overloading potential
of the standard godown.
24.       Under the project, additional storage capacity would be provided
in the six major foodgrain production and procurement districts of Bogra,
Dinajpur, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet. Peak storage demand for 1/
the mid 80's would be provided for in the following way:
(a) 60% of the good year peak storage requirement would be
met by "good practice" storage capacity (standard Dacca
godown loaded to 650 tons of paddy);
(b) 15Z would be met by overloading to 750 tons of paddy
of the standard Dacca godown for up to 4 months;
(c) 15% would be met by further overloading to 850 tons of
paddy for upto 3 months during the peak procurement
season in the good year;
(d) about 10% would be obtained from improved transport system
which would enable CSDs to improve capacity-utilization
during December-April period by 10% to receive procurement
spillover during the peak season; and
(e) till the transport system improves, the gap (d) would be met
by hired facilities.
25.       Table 6 summarizes the estimation of procurement warehouse
space needed and relates the project proposals to these. The project area's
peak procurement storage requirement for mid 80's is estimated to be for
470,000 tons and 690,000 tons (rice equivalent) respectively in the normal
and the good year. Allowing for major part of the peak needs to be met by
short-term overloading (para 5), the estimated shortage is about 350,000 tons
nationally, of which 285,000 ton (nominal) is in the project core area. Under
the project, 145,000 nominal tons of capacity 1/ would be distributed between
the 6 core districts as follows:
1/   This would meet 50% of the estimated storage gap for mid 80's and re-
presents the entire additional storage that is prudent to build now,
until improvements in the procurement system, and actual grower response
are actually tested. Should this be good, there would be adequate time
to build additional capacity required.

26.       The project construction program would be completed by 1980/81.
It is estimated that further investments in storage in the core area would
not be required at least till 1981. It is likely, especially at LSDs having
more than 1 godown, that storage space is underutilized during the lean season -
May to October. However, demand for storage space by other sectors would be
year-rcund. GOB could offer to hire out at reasonable rates to any user all
godowns that are expected to be idle for at least 2 months for storage of
non-corrosive commodities like jute, oils, and sugar.
27.       Most of the districts in the non-core areas are oversupplied as far
as procurement needs are concerned. However, distribution, transhipment and
relief needs are also important and GOB has requested that about 77 non-pucca
sheds at Khulna CSD and 17 at Tejgaon CSD, be replaced by Dacca type facilities.
CSDs serve as primary distribution points and also store of non-grain food
items like salt, sugar and edible oil. The types of storage required for these
commodities differ, with edible oil in drums not even needing shelter, except
for security purposes. The replacement decision would thus depend upon the
future role of Khulna CSD and the likely amount of non-foodgrain storage.
28.       Currently, consumers are required to collect rations from the nearest
LSD in the local markets, but when LSDs are 20-40 miles away ration distribu-
tion Ls done from small hired facilities and depends critically on regular
shipments which are not always possible. In addition, many parts of the
non-core area are regularly hit by cyclones, where loss of life, property
and all but the most securely stored grain, occurs. Flash floods often wipe
out entire food stocks, and areas may be cut off for anywhere from 2 to 30
days. During these periods, non availability of relief supplies can lead to
extreme hardship, sometimes even death. Strategically located storage, even
of 100-300 ton capacity, could offer substantive relief, and provide GOB with
just enough leadtime to react effectively. The project would provide 20,000
tons (nominal) storage in the non-core areas to meet these urgent needs at
carefully selected locations.
Location Selection
29.       Tentative locations have been agreed for about 70,000 tons of addi-
tional storage capacity in the core areas. These would be sufficient for
the first two seasons construction program. These are listed in Table 9,
along with relevant information on their justification for their inclusion.
These sites, except for a few, are aimed to improve the access to growers

of the MF procurement operations. Invariably, TPC operation has already
demonstrated the procurement potential of the location, and the serious
storage space constraints that are faced. Some locations, notably Ishwargunj
and Bharab Bazar in Mymensingh have been selected as transhipment points to
other districts, or for storage prior to milling. Most locations have bank
branches, but special arrangements would be required at some. It would be
necessary that suitable sites for at least 35 of these agreed locations
should be identified for PECU to inspect; and for at least 20 location sites
to have been acquired after approval of the site by PECU, to allow timely
start of project construction.
30.       Selection of the remainder of the locations would be done by a
special location selection committee (Annex 7). The transport situation in
the specific area, and in the region as a whole would be a critical input.
Detailed justification for the sites selected for the year's construction
program (starting in November) should be available to IDA by February of each
year, and IDA agreement should be required before construction. However,
godowns would not be built at a new site in the core area without a prior
trial using a TPC at that location. Justification would involve considera-
tion of the following criteria:
(a) Distances from road/rail/waterways, other LSDs, and transport
lags faced in the procurement (distribution) season, including
development plans for the transport system;
(b) TPC demonstrated procurement potential (or actual monthly
distribution need) indicating condition, capacity, and
cost of alternatives now being used;
(c) Nearest point of assured shipping (in or out) and storage/
shipment capacity available there;
(d) Production/consumption/population/distribution statistics
of the thana;
(e) For transhipment points, availability of rice milling capa-
city quick intermodal transfer facilities, throughput and
turnover history.
31.       For distribution related storage an annual turnover of at least 4
would be essential 1/ to justify a new godown at a new location. Travel of
up to 5-10 miles to obtain ration distribution would not be considered ex-
cessive. For proposed replacement of the sheds at Khulna & Tejgaon, it should
be noted that while these sheds are undoubtedly unfit for foodgrain storage,
they may with marginal improvements be usable for non-foodgrain storage. Future
1/   For procurement related godowns 1.2-1.4 would be reasonable.

role of Kiulna CSD to handle imports or incoming supplies would need to be
examined (especially in relation to the proposal to put up silo facilities at
Khulna/ Chalna) before any specific construction program can be undertaken at
these CSDs.
32.       For relief related storage construction, specific factors to be
considered are:
(a) historical demand for relief stocks in the area including
frequency, peak daily demand, experienced people served, etc.
(b) duration and extent of transport disruptions and alternatives
available;
(c) distance in time from the nearest point of assured transport
during emergencies;
(d) availability of high ground adjacent to transportation; and
(e) possibility of rotation through normal procurement and dis-
tribution, since separate warehouses only for relief stocks
would not be awarded.
Selection of godown location in the non-core areas would also be done by the
location selection committee, after coopting a representative of Ministry
of Relief for relief related storage.

5/  For July 1978, reserved procurement space would be much lower
(at 50,000 ton maximum) but the procurement areas would have greater
paddy. The buffer stock potential for July 1978 would be about 1.0
million tons. With the project godowns this would be about 1.3 M tons,

BANGLADESH
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Project Engineering and Construction
1.        Project construction would involve about 320 godowns at geographic-
ally scattered sites, with an average of one 1,000 ton or two 500 ton godowns
per site and rehabilitation of about 25,000 tons of Twin Nissen (TN) type
godowns in the core area. The expertise necessary to construct the storage
facilities exists in the GOB's Public Works Department (PWD) and is suitably
geographically dispersed. The Project Construction Program would be imple-
mented by a Project Engineering and Construction Unit (PECU) wholly within
the PubLic Works Department (PWD). PECU would be headed by a full time Proj-
ect Construction Manager (PCM), with the rank of Additional or Deputy Chief
Engineer. PECU would provide godown designs, sub-contract construction to
local contractors, supervise construction and act as consulting engineers to
MF. PECU would be responsible to the Project Implementation Unit (Annex 7).
Godown Design and Construction
2.        The basic design of the standard Dacca type godown of proven suit-
ability would be used. Improvements should be made in minor details to rodent-
proof doors, to improve drainage, to improve ventilator and canopy design, to
eliminate the loading dock. Godowns should be built using improved labor in-
tensive techniques to reduce both cost and construction time where supervision
enables new techniques to be properly developed. Simple mild steel shutter-
ing would replace the present single use wooden shuttering. Roof planks could
be cast on the godown floor and hand hoisted into place. PECU should produce
detailed designs, site plans and vicinity maps for all project sites. Con-
struction should start only upon approval of the package by the project engi-
neering consultant (para 7). Details are in Appendix 1. At all sites, the
project would provide for drainage, essential accommodation, power and light-
ing, driveways, bank payment booths, safes and boundary walls. Rehabilitation
of existing Dacca Type godowns, being financed by UK-ODM, would be excluded
from the project. Cost estimates are in Table 1 and 2.
Rehabilitation of Twin Nissen Godowns
3.        Rehabilitation of Twin-Nissen (TN) type godowns in could be done at
about 25% of the cost of a new Dacca godown (Table 1). Their cladding and
floors which are in poor condition, should be removed and the floor recast to
the same specifications as for the Dacca godowns. The structural frames are
generally sound and should be cleaned and repainted. Doors, ventilators and
guttering should be replaced and the godown reclad in new galvanized corrugated
iron sheeting. A levee should be built around the godowns where the site is
susceptible to flooding.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Sub Contracting
4.        All civil works at a site should be bulked; but when more than 2
godown are being built at one site, all works related to 1 godown should be
bulked. Contracts should be let through local competitive bidding with bid-
ding conducted simultaneously for all godowns in a sub-division, but bidders
having the option to bid for each site individually. Construction completion
periods should be specified with penalties for delays. Prequalification of
contractors should be required (Appendix II). Bid evaluation would be done
by PECU, and proposed awards would be approved by the project consultant.
Contractors should have the choice of providing imported materials (cement
and steel) through normal commercial channels or of purchasing from PWD, at
standard prices. The 10% security deposit or a Performance Bond should be
effective for six months, after which MF should release it in writing provided
no defects had occured and the Contractor had given a written warranty for
structural integrity valid for two years after acceptance. Final acceptance
of the godowns should require a complete final joint inspection by PECU and
MF. The joint inspection report would enable the MF representative to show
concurrence or report his views. Final payment to contractor (and IDA dis-
bursements) should require a valid certificate of completion, approved by
the project construction manager, and co-signed by the project engineering
consultant.
Construction Supervision
5.        PECU, with the assistance of strengthened PWD field units, would
be responsible for site surveying, preparation of site plans and supervision
of construction. A locally appointed construction advisor could assist each
Area Superintendent for one year in the practical details of construction,
particularly concrete work. All sites would be subject to unannounced inspec-
tions by PECU executive staff and the consultant. Any unsound work would be
demolished and rebuilt. Each site would be visited daily by a Sub-Assistant
Engineer; while an Executive Engineer would inspect a construction site at
least 8 times during its construction. Particular attention should be paid
to the quality of brickwork and of concrete pouring. The job superintendent
would be present when concrete pouring was taking place.
PECU Staffing and Equipment
6.        PECU would be staffed full time by PWD personnel (a recommended
staffing pattern is in Table 4).  For the post of the project construction
manager (PCM), the Chief Engineer (PWD) should propose two candidates to the
Secretary, MF and the individual should have qualifications and experience
satisfactory to IDA. Other PECU technical posts should be filled similarly.
Additional staff would be appointed for field offices of PWD where necessary;
but where construction volume will not support full time staff, existing PWD
staff will supervise construction. PECU office space could be provided by PWD,
but where adequate office space was not available PECU should rent suitable
space. Office, surveying and testing equipment and special construction



ANNEX 3
Page 3
equipment (Table 4) unavailable at present with PWD, would be provided to PWD
for PECIJ under the project. Four-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles to be
providecl would be maintained by PWD.
Engineering Consultant
7.        The consultant should be chosen by the Project Steering Committee
from an internationally recognized firm of consulting engineers. The firm
would be required to furnish the services of one engineer. The use of a
firm would permit continuity, since then the firm would automatically provide
a replacement should the originally assigned engineer have to leave for any
reason. Furthermore, if other short-term supporting personel were required
in related areas, the consulting firm could furnish these quickly. Detailed
TORs and qualifications are in Appendix 2. The consultant would be respon-
sible to PECU.
Godown Maintenance
8.        One serious operational deficiency is in the area of storage main-
tenance. Most godowns become dilapidated because, although MF retains the
responsibility for maintenance, it has no engineering expertise. MF has to
submit work requests, including very minor ones, on a job-by-job basis to the
Ministry of Works, which prepares bid documents and gets the work done mainly
through private contractors. GOB buildings are maintained by the Public Works
Department (PWD) through annual contractual arrangements. PWD has not accepted
similar responsibility for godowns in need of major repair under this arrange-
ment, only those that are new or rehabilitated. This situation and a short-
age of funds has led to the extensive disrepair found at most depots. Project
godowns should be transferred to PWD maintenance roster immediately upon com-
pletion or rehabilitation for maintenance by PWD. However, EF should also
create a small regional godown maintenance cell headed by an superintending
engineer, to coordinate with PWD to ensure effective godown maintenance
program by PWD.

Construction Manager, upto one additional EE would be required in Mymensingh,
Dinajpur, Sylhet and possibly Ranjpur; but Bogra and Rajshahi would only need
additional AE, and SDE; each site would have a SAE for site supervision, whose
cost is in the work charge.

ANNEX 3
APPENDIX I
Page 1
BANGLADESH
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Design and Construction Methods
A. Design
1.        Following design details should be carefully studied for incor-
poration: 1/
(a)  Canopies - slope top of slab to edges and incorporate a drip
1-1/2" from the edge on the underside of the slab on the out-
side parimeter.
(b)  Ventilators - simplify the canopy by the use of pipe placed
as the wall is built.
(c)  Drainage - where site permits eliminate the ditch that is
built around the godown by paving (brick), with slope away
from building.
(d)  Doors - clear height to be set at 8' - 0" and width not less
than 9' - 6", preferably 10' - 0". Bottom of doors should
be below interior floor level, top should be at least 2" below
lintel, sides should close against an angle anchored to the
wall to eliminate gap between door and wall.
(e)  Floor Slabs - joint material should be used between slab
joints and wall. Slab at wall should not rest on wall ledge.
Mechanical or hydraulic compaction under slab should be used.
Vapor barrier, such as 6 Mill Visqueen (plastic sheet), should
be specified under slab. Specific finishing procedures should
be outlined in the drawings.
(f) Dock - it should be eliminated. Note that ledge is not
necessary if padlock is placed at 4' - 6" above grade.
1/   Sketches are available in the project supervision black book; PWD have
accepted a, b, c, d and e; others would be pursued by the consultant
and would be tried on an experimental basis.



ANNEX 3
APPENDIX I
Page 2
(g) Expansion Joints - since beams under the slab (T's) are easier
to build, they should not be turned up and an elaborate cover
built over them; small curbs should be used, these may be placed
with the expansion joint at the slab between beams, thereby eli-
minating the side by side beams. Slabs at this bay would canti-
lever from adjoining beams.
B. Site Information
2.        A vicinity map indicating all roads, railroads and rivers (especially
if a river loading or unloading point is being considered) should be provided.
The site plan should show the following:
(a) the boundary lines with the existing fence and gates;
(b) the location of all structures within the site;
(c) nearest and best location for coming into the site with power,
water and telephone lines;
(d) drainage of site with important elevations (this may require
typical sections where troughs exist);
(e) indication of materials in present driveways within the site
and railroads with the gauge and location of boat loading
facility if any; and
(f) if rerouting of outside roads is contemplated or suggested by
either ME or PWD, a plan should be included giving all pertinent
information.
C. Recommended Change in Construction Methods
3.        Present methods are satisfactory but possible savings could accrue
by small modifications in the construction methods. PECU should investigate
costs and technical suitability with the help of the engineering consultant,
the following:
(a) the use of prefabricated steel forms (shuttering) and
adjustable shores for the beams.
(b) the use of concrete planks cast on the ground, perhaps on the
finished floor.



ANNEX 3
APPENDIX 1
Page 3
(c) the use of hand winches or chain hoists to raise the precast
roof slabs to be placed on the previously cast-in-place beams.
(d) the method to use in finishing the roof once the planks are
in place.
4.        These changes are likely to have the following advantages:
(a) savings in framework (shuttering) and time.
(b) better finish and appearance of concrete thereby eliminating
having to point (whitewash and plaster) all the ceiling.
(c) slight movement of foundation would not be reflected on the
structure since it is more flexible.
(d) no heavy equipment is needed if roof planks are kept to a
small size.
(e) work could be done simultaneously for various phases
diminishing time of completion.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Paddy Marketing and Domestic Procurement
1.        Paddy constitutes 90% of the foodgrain production, mostly grown
on about 10 million small, fragmented and largely subsistence operations.
Most growers sell significant portions of their crop immediately upon har-
vest because of (i), the need for cash; (ii), the inability to dry or hold
in storage for long periods or (iii), need to repay crop production or other
loans. They often have to buy back later for consumption at higher prices.
However, only 20-30% of the production actually enters the market, the balance
being retained in production areas. Growers have three marketing channels to
consumers: a) private middlemen; b) government procurement; c) cooperatives
(Chart I).
A. Private Sector
2.        The most significant channel by far is the private sector, handling
about 80% of the total 2-3 M tons of domestic production that enters the
market. There are about 6,000 primary markets or bazaars, and about 2,000
"haats" which are markets assembling on specific days of the week. There are
about 450 secondary markets, dominated by "Aratdars" who handle the entire
operation of buying, bagging, weighing, and transportation and, who also
provide credit to the "Beparis" (small dealers) who bring in the produce. The
crop is sold without grading although price adjustments are applied for subjec-
tive assessment of foreign matter, moisture, and other factors.
3.        Post harvest farm gate prices are invariably depressed (Annex 1).
Significant margin exists between the farmgate price and the consumer price
in the private sector channel because of the following factors:
(a) Poor transportation system which increases marketing
costs and reduces competition at the primary market level;
(b) Spoilage and loss, because of poor storage facilities
and high risk of infestation and mold growth, especially
during March to October;
(c) The interest charge on funds tied up;
(d) Drying service rendered, especially in the Boro and Aus
season; and



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(e) considerable bargaining power of the private traders who
often also provide production and other credit as well
as rent out land, combined with the growers need for
immediate cash.
4.        The bulk of movement of paddy and rice is by waterways, which expand
from 3,000 miles to 4,500 miles during the monsoon months. The road network
is poor; movement is slow and the scale of movement (20-30 maunds per bullock
cart or 200 maunds per country boat) is inefficient. Moisture pick up during
slow river transportation creates a subsequent storage problem. A UNDP study
to prepare an inventory of storage facilities in the private sector is now
underway. However, it is well known that private dealers do not have the
physcial facilities or the technical manpower or knowhow for efficient storage,
essential in Bangladesh climatic conditions. Although reliable estimates of
existing losses in the private-channel are not available, every agent involved
in the chain would admit to losing 2-5% under his custody. Cumulatively this
loss is estimated to be in the range of 10-20% of the throughput. Significant
losses must also be taking place in the stocks retained in the rural areas
(by the grower or the large farmer/trader) a major portion of which must be
carried over 8-12 months since almost 60% of the area is monocropped. How-
ever, designing a specific program for improving private sector storage
facilities requires a more detailed examination. GOB should undertake a
study to prepare a suitable project for this important marketing channel
and for improving on-farm storage.
B. Public Sector
5.        Ministry of Food (MF) handles all the imported food grains, and also
undertakes a program of domestic procurement. Most procurement is voluntary,
with or without cordoning whereby shipment outside defined surplus districts
is banned. The purpose of the procurement program is to raise and maintain
farmgate prices at incentive levels, especially in the period immediately post
harvest, in order to stimulate production. However, procurement has not always
been Eor the above purpose; it has often been undertaken to enable GOB to ful-
fill its food distribution committments (in the urban areas) sometimes by com-
pulsory assessment whereby producers having more than 10 acres are asked to
deliver to Government or its notified agents, specific quantities of their
surplus, computed in a specific manner. GOB future procurement policy which
would emphasize the price support aspects of procurement and the potential
benefits from its implementation are discussed in Annex 1 and Annex 9.
6.        Government procurement operates through all 330 LSDs and CSDs, and
150-200 special Temporary Purchase Centers (TPC) specifically opened for the
purpose. Purchases are restricted to a minimum of I standard bag (1 md 30
seers of paddy or 2 mds of rice). The TPCs operate for a few months during
the peak procurement season. Each LSD or TPC is operated by a lone purchasing
officer, and is assisted by a handling agent who furnishes the labor required



ANNEX 4
Page 3
for weighing, bagging and stocking. Anyone wishing to sell to Government can
do so and nominally preference is given to growers over traders; though this
rarely operates in practice. About 50-100 selected traders in a district who
are specifically appointed as Authorized Grain Dealers (AGD) by MF obstensibly
to improve the reach of the procurement effort into the primary markets,
invariably obtain undue preference at procurement points effectively limiting
the competition at the primary market level, and thus reducing the impact of
the price support program. They are required to pay the farmer stipulated
procurement price less specific commission; and they are also required to sell
all the grain they procure to Government. However, their compliance with the
above requirements is doubtful.
7.        Government efforts to use the procurement program as a price sup-
port mechanism suffers from the following constraints:
(a) farmer attitudes;
(b) limited access to growers and timing of procurement activities;
(c) inefficient handling at purchase points; and
(e) payment difficulties.
8.        The past practice of compulsory procurement and fixing assessment
has led to a reluctance to deliver to GOB in case such deliveries are used
to raise future assessments. As a result, farmer attitude to selling to MF
is typically one of suspicion and it is not likely that all farmers would be
willing to sell to MF. Nevertheless, present policy of the willingness to
purchase at an incentive price, especially immediately post harvest and the
abandonment of compulsory procurement, are expected to gradually improve
farmers attitudes.
9.        On an average about 250 villages are served by an LSD/TPC, while
a "haat" or a "bazar" serves on an average about 11 villages. This high-
lights the magnitude of the access problem. The transportation system is
also difficult. Even in the dry areas of North Bengal where road transpor-
tation is the best, not all thana headquarters are accessible by truck-
able roads let alone union headquarters and villages. Normal means of trans-
portation would be by bullock cart, and a 5-8 mile round trip could take a
whole day. The current 8-10 miles procurement center range is undoubtedly
prohibitive in time as well as in expense (since a hired bullock cart would
cost at least 0.50 Tk/Md/mile). TPCs, by improving access, have naturally
been most successful. However, TPC facilities are poor and also small (200
mds). With peak arrivals of 1000-3000 mds/day, their ability to continue
procurement uninterrupted depends on their ability to ship out quickly. This
is severely limited by the few bullock carts (8-15) that are available and by
their limited carrying capacity (20 md). At the same time, however, indis-
criminate expansion of TPC to increase access would not be feasible until
payment difficulties (para. 12) are overcome.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
10.       Inefficient handling of a seller at a purchase point contributes
significantly to their unwillingness to sell to MF. Chart II depicts a sel-
ler's typical experience through the arrival and purchase transaction. The
lone purchase officer has to personally supervise all operations, test, re-
cord and issue payment certificate. Roughly 90 minutes are spent per 50 bag
transaction, and since transactions are sequential, a three day wait is
common. In addition, Aman procurement starts only in January, when most
arriving paddy meets the rigid moisture standards. However, by then most
growers have already sold their surplus to meet immediate cash needs and MF
thus loses an apportunity to support prices.
11.       MF Purchase standards are prescribed mainly with a view to reducing
risk of subsequent losses given the poor storage facilities and ineffective
pest control, are too complicated and rigid to stimulate procurement. At
least four quality discounts apply to the official paddy price. Without
testing devices assessment is naturally subjective. Fear of arbitrary dis-
counting exists. Although the testing methods are similar in the traditional
market, the fact that the seller can go to another dealer without great dif-
ficulty, offers some protection. Also, MF has been reluctant to purchase
high yielding varieties (HYV), mainly grown in the Boro season, because they
are difficult to store if moisture exceeds 12%. Even Aman HYVs are procured
reluctantly. Procurement of the Boro crop began in 1975, but was restricted
in 1976, since drying to even 15% moisture is difficult given the temperature/
relative humidity combination prevailing at harvest (Annex 5). Mission esti-
mates that 10% losses take place in the Boro and Aus procurement because of
poor facilities and improper drying.
12.       Payment mechanism is another major deterrent to growers.  The
four copy "weight quality stock certificate" (WQSC) issued to the seller is
exchangeable for cash at a designated bank, but the process is often ineffec-
tive because (i) bank operating hours are restricted; (ii) the bank's copy of
WQSC is not received in time; (iii) the bank branch has exhausted its credit
ceiling (para 13); or (iv) has no liquid funds; (v) the officer whose signa-
tures are recognized at the bank is not available to sign the WQSC in time.
Recently, banks have been operating payment booths at LSDs to help MF expedite
payments, and their cost is recovered by a special charge of 0.75% for payments
made at these booths. However, ensuring availability of adequate cash at these
booths has been a problem, mainly for security reasons. MF undertakes to
arrange for an armed escort and an armed guard from the police, but is not
always successful.
13.       Working capital needed by MF for procurement operations is provided
through designated commercial banks by the Bangladesh Bank which fixes quar-
terly limits on the total commercial bank lending for MF procurement opera-
tions. The speed of MF repayment of commercial banks for food procurement
advances determines the magnitude and duration of commercial banks advances.
Commercial bank receive a small margin (about 1/4%), but 100% refinance from
the Bangladesh Bank. Table 1 gives the overall limits set, their distribution



ANNEX 4
Page 5
between banks and the actual advances outstanding for 1975-1977. The banks
together have never exceeded the overall limit, reaching only 77% of it at
peak. However, individual banks routinely operate to within 95% of their
limit; and in January 1976, two banks did in fact exceed their sanctioned
limits and this resulted in a country wide stoppage of procurement operations.
Since then, commercial banks have established limits on the procurement lend-
ing of their individual branches, but this had led to problems of its own,
though in limited geographical areas.
14. Project Proposals
The project would seek to streamline the procurement system to
encourage more growers to benefit from the GOB support price by:
(a) improving access to the procurement system;
(b) improving handling system and procurement operations
and simplifying of purchase standards;
(c) providing drying facilities to MF;
(d) streamlining payment arrangements.
15.       All existing TPC's with high procurement records in the past but
with inadequate storage facilities would be converted to "pucca" facilities
providing minimum of 2 week holding capacity. Detailed criteria are in Annex
2. This would enable procurement to continue uninterrupted by the consider-
able difficulties in movement of procured stocks.
16.       Turnaround at purchase points would be improved by establising
at least two parallel purchase lines. Re-organization of all MF field staff
(Annex 7) would permit those inspectors normally responsible for rationing to
assist in the procurement operations since distribution work during these post
harvest months would be litle.
17.       Minor equipment and facilities would be added to reduce the 90 min-
ute transaction time by speeding up weighing and rebagging - which together
take almost 50% of the total time. The procurement (and drying) system
consultant (TOR in Annex 5) would undertake a time and motion study of the
working of a purchase point to recommend time reducing changes in the system
operation, with addition of minor hoppers or bagging machines, if necessary.
First attempt would be to streamline the existing system, but all aspects
of the present procedures would be questioned for their relevance. Specif-
ically, the usefulness of standard bags, and inspection of the entire lot
rather than using probes for sampling, would be investigated. Testing equip-
ment for moisture and foreign matter would be placed at each LSD/TPC, with
suitable back up. A set of standard moisture meters would be maintained at
the proposed Zonal Testing Laboratory (Annex 5) and sent around to various LSD
for calibration.   MF Inspectors would also be responsible for checking the



ANNEX 4
Page 6
accuracy of the moisture meters. Sellers would be allowed to witness sample
testing; calibration charts would be boldy displayed. Detailed sampling and
testing guidelines aready included in the MF procurement manual would be
revised, accordingly. Training in new methods would be organized by the
consultant.
18.       The present four discount pricing could be replaced by a 2 factor
system (for moisture and foreign matter) with the other two factors having
only maximum cutoff points, but no discounts within acceptable range. This
would expedite handling without serious risk of receiving unwanted stocks.
Present system of discounts for less than fair average quality (FAO) would be
replaced by a price for minimum acceptable quality plus premia for better
quality. The minimum acceptable quality (MAQ) could be defined as:
Subdivisions        Subdivisions
Without Dryers        With Dryers
Moisture                 14%                 20%
FM                        5%                  5%
Admixture                50% (no limit)      50%
Immature Grain            3%                  3%
and suitable premia, offered. MAQ base price would be about 70 Tk if FAQ
base is at 80 Tk as now defined (however for same quality, price paid would be
same). At locations with dryers, the maximum moisture permissible would be
relaxed to 20% and MAQ base price would be about 59 Tk.
19.       Procurement staff would be trained to detect unacceptable levels by
eye examination, but objective test procedures would also be specified. A
complaint book with numbered pages, and a prepaid postcard would be available
at each purchase point for effective feedback from sellers. Procurement
chief inspectors would be provided with vehicles to enable them to supervise
each procurement point at least once a fortnight. Details of the fortnightly
supervision report of the procurement chief inspector, and its subsequent
consolidation and analysis would be provided. Drying facilities to be provided
under the project are discussed in Annex 5. These would be available for both
Aman and Boro procurement, and also enable Aman procurement to start in December.
20.       Payment procedures through commercial banks would be improved.  At
new godowns being built under the project, safes would be provided. Gov-
ernment would also ensure that adequate security support is available to
commercial banks to deliver cash to and operate payment booths. The number
of banks for procurement payments in a sub-division would be restricted to one
to simplify escort problems and make field coordination more effective (Annex
7). MF would also ensure that signatures of at least two officers are recog-
nized at the bank for signing WQSC. The procurement lending ceilings on
individual branches, which are recognized to be purely administrative, could
be eliminated by expediting repayments to banks for procurement advances and
creating a mechanism for prompt repayment should the commercial bank exceed
the ceilings prescribed by BB. MF should consider the creation of a separate



ANNEX 4
Page 7
category in its account with the Bangladesh Bank (BB) to enable the latter
to make automatic and prompt repayments on behalf of MF to the commercial
banks when ever necessary to enable them to keep their (internal) procurement
lending within the limits. The necessary size,of this new internal procure-
ment account would vary over the year since procurement is most active in
January-March. Its minimum size should be at least equal to the value of
maximum quantity procured in any month in that quarter in the preceding three
years. During the busy January-March quarter of a year, its size is estimated
to be about Tk 70 million.
21.       Commercial banks are currently experimenting with establishing
fixed-days-of the-week banking services in currently unbanked Union head-
quarters and if successful this operation is likely to be expanded. Such
availability of banking service in remote areas would help in overcoming the
one major difficulty over timely payments that hinders the establishment of
more TPC in the interior (para 9). However, the likely procurement level at
those points would not warrant a full time TPC. Instead, procurement staff
could follow the same pattern of operating 2 day a week purchase center,
despatching the procured stock to the nearest LSD by contractor and shifting
to another location in the same general area with the bank offices. This would
enable the procurement program to influence the market price closer to the
farmgate.
22.       Project costs (Table 2) for this component cover equipment (weigh
scales, moisture meters and sampling devices); vehicles (for procurement staff
including motorcycles and motor launches); the consultant's local counter-
part; and training of about 400 MF procurement staff (1 basic I week course
followed by 3 refresher courses of 2 days each over the four year period).
C. Cooperative Marketing
23.       To benefit from economies of scale, and to retain some of the
middleman's margin, farmers, under official encouragement, have formed coop-
eratives to market paddy for member growers. About 4,000 multipurpose
societies and about 200 Thana Central Cooperative Associations (TCCA) are
entitled to market paddy, and at various times some 1,000 multipurpose socie-
ties, and about 50 TCCA, have attempted to do so. Successful experience is
scanty, main drawbacks being:
(a) small volume, typically only a few larger farmers in
a village participate;
(b) lack of technical knowledge or trained personnel to
operate any sophisticated marketing system;
(c) lack of physical facilities like storage godowns;



ANNEX 4
Page 8
(d) lack of a well though out system of procurement,
transport, storage and marketing;
(e) absence of an apex national federation to guide and
coordinate.
Thana Central Cooperatives
24.       In 1975-76, about 50 TCCA tried to operate as Authorized Grain
Dealers (AGD) for MF, but only 16 were given recognition, almost half in
the project area. They marketed about 10,000 maunds of paddy through ME.
Some TCCA also attempted open market sales, but had little success because
of poor marketing expertise. Modern rice mills, owned by some TCCA (Comilla
and Rangunia) are not operational partly because of spare parts, and engi-
neering difficulties, but mainly due to difficulties in entering into a
middlemen dominated marketing channel. Marketing to consumers directly
requires an expertise the TCCA has not been able to command in the absence
of an apex marketing organization. Cooperative marketing could assist in
the implementation of GOB program of raising farmgate prices by making the
procurement system more accessible to the farmers collectively.
Project Proposals
25.       The project would initiate a pilot project, through the Integrated
Rural Development Project (IRDP) organization, to develop the marketing expert-
ise of selected TCCA. Ten TCCA would be selected in the project area. Key
data on 18 TCCA which meet certain minimum criteria 1/ is in Table 3. The
development would be in three phases.
26.       Phase I would involve the development of a system of collection,
sampling, testing, bulking, record keeping, transporting and payments which
would be perfected, with TCCA marketing through MF. Assurances would be
obtained from GOB that all project TCCA (those participating in the initial
pilot project, and those subsequently adopting the procurement model devel-
oped) would be given the option to sell to LSD's, and that a day of the week
would be fixed for procurement from TCCA alone. Details of the system would
be TCCA specific, but broad features would include:
(a) Fixed collection days and times at Agriculture Cooperative
Society (KSS). Each farmer's lot would be sampled, weighed,
sealed and marked, then all lots bulked and taken to TCCA
as KSS lot. Record keeping register that enables quick
verification of operations would be developed. Sample
1/   These were:  previous paddy marketing experience, possession of a stor-
age godown, good production area, above average savings, good credit
recovery and effective management.



ANNEX 4
Page 9
testing would be done during the day, and samples re-
tained for subsequent confirmation if necessary;
(b) arrival at TCCA office, sampling, re-weighing (if necessary),
testing and record keeping;
(c) transportation to LSD, ensuring arrival at fixed time
and day;
(d) payment to KSS and farmers, keeping in mind farmers' need
for (part) cash, difficulties in en-cashing checks at
village and union HQ, and that fact that most farmers
visit Thana headquarters once in a week;
(e) training of 200 KSS/TCA staff in the system operation;
(f) continuous monitoring and improvement of the system;
(g) a system of supervision of KSS work by TCCA officers.
27.       TCA project officers at Godagari, and Bogra are presently involved
in developing the details of the initial pilot system for discussion with IDA
in September. The target is to initiate project marketing activities of at
least 2 TCCA (out of Table 3) by November 1978.
28.       Under Phase II TCCA would experiment with holding a members' paddy
in storage for selling in the open market when prices improve. This phase
would require storage facilities, pest control training and equipment, and
adequate working capital. Selection of TCCA who already have some storage
facilities, would assist in the shift from Phase I to Phase II, but the shift
would not be before year 3 of the project. Pest control training would be
available through the project (Annex 5).
29.       Phase III:  would be a development of the future, and involve TCCA
in million for itself and selling rice to consumers. Here, again selection
of TCCA would already have some milling facilities would help. Previous
experience at Rangunia and Comilla have established that this phase should
be entered into with great caution, only after the Phase I and II have been
perfected, and an assured marketing outlet has been established, possibly by
the creation of an apex marketing institution marketing through consumer
cooperatives.
30.       Project Costs for this component are in Table 2.  By selection of
TCCA that already have storage, initial investments need have been kept to a
minimum.  Equipment needs are for:
(a) Weighing and testing at 200 KSS likely to participate;
(b) motorcycles for 10 IRDP project officers for supervision;



ANNEX 4
Page 10
(c) technical assistance, a counterpart specialist, and training
of KSS/TCCA staff.
31. Implementation Steps
(a) Select TCCA/KSS based on criteria, in project area
(Nov 77).
(b) Write up initial system for each TCCA/Map/ Activity
Schedule (Jan 78).
(c) List of equipment/purchase (Mar 78).
(d) Record books, charts, posters (May 78).
(e) Training, etc. in testing, sampling, weighing,
etc. (Sept-Oct 78).

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Control of Storage Losses
MF Pest Control Operations
1.        In Bangladesh, conditions favorable for rapid growth of insects
and fungi, exist for 7-8 months in a year (Annex 6, Table 1). This poses a
massive pest control problem, which is further aggravated by the sub-standard
nature of the storage facilities used in many locations.
2.        MF inspection and control operations have become particularly
significant during the last three years, since for the first time, locally
procured paddy stocks in Bangladesh are being held in storage at dispersed
locations for several months, as a result of greatly increased procurement;
while previously most stocks consisted of dry imported rice at few large CSDs.
As procurement effort builds up, inspection and control requirements at
dispersed LSD's would become much greater.
3.        The Directorate of Inspection, Control and Training (DICT) spear-
heads the function of detection, fumigation and disposal of deteriorated
stock through 62 pest control squads and inspection squads, under 4 regional
offices. All CSD's have a permanent squad, while on an average 15-25 godowns,
or 3-8 LSDs are covered by one squad (Table 1). A central testing laboratory
at Dacca has facilities for both physical and chemical analysis for foodgrains
and services the entire country. Improving the ability of DICT to respond
to routine and emergency fumigation requirements would be critical to the
success of the project.
4.        Constraints on the DICT ability to provide adequate project sup-
port are: a) supply of chemicals; b) mobility and equipment; c) staff training.
Adequate stock of chemicals is a key requirement. Reported delays or absence
of fumigation in the 1975-76 was due to lack of chemicals. Present stock
position for malathion appeared satisfactory; but phostoxin and methyl bromide
stocks are likely to run out by end 1977. Bilateral assistance has recently
been available for chemicals, and commercial imports are also undertaken from
time to time. However, delays in availability of chemicals can cause grave
losses.
5.        DICT squads are unable to respond adequately to the fumigation
needs of LSDs because of a total lack of mobility. Toxic chemicals with
pungent odors can not always be carried on public transportation, if avail-
able. The need to move equipment with each squad further slows response.
Norms 'specified for frequency of fumigation are adequate, 72 hours being
the maximum response time, 2 months the norm for fumigation and fumigation



ANNEX 5
Page 2
of gunnies a standard practice. However, only 1.5 M tons of actual stocks
could be fumigated in 1976-77 giving a fumigation frequency only once in
7 months. This was mainly because of squad time lost in transportation
(Table 1). Pest control squads also need wide variety of equipment in good
working conditions ranging from gas proof sheets, sprayers and dusters to
protective gloves and gas masks. Most equipment for application of chemicals
is in the need for replacement; no gas masks are in working order. Equipment
of various makes are used in the same subdivision, making operator training
and maintenance difficult.
6.        Inspection squads too are in need of simple sampling and physical
measurement equipment to facilitate work. Frequency of inspection has to be
increased from the present once in three months to once in a month. Fast
issuance of diposal instructions (based on inspection samples from doubtful
stocks), is critical to reduce cross-infestation as well as release storage
space for fresh stocks. DICT is seriously constrained in this field because
a) all disposal instructions must originate in the Dacca Central Laboratory;
which has limited testing facilities, and, b) slow communication of test
results. An interval of 1 month between sampling and actual disposal in-
struction. is not unknown. Considerable further damage and possibly cross
infestation occurs in this time, and deteriorated stocks use up valuable
storage space.
7.        MF suffers from a lack of staff fully trained in monitoring quality
and pest control operations. Bilateral assistance for overseas fellowships
is presently available to MF. UNDP/FAO (under Project BGD72/017) is assisting
GOB in establishing a Warehousing Training Center (WTC) to serve the public
as well as the private sector, starting initially with short term training
of high and middle management level officers. The atttendance capacity of
the Center is 50-60 trainees and the Center would train 700-1,000 officers
over twenty months. However, the UNDP/FAO Project has its limitations as
regards to supply of equipment, teaching staff and hence its ability to
expand field training simultaneously to all the project areas. UK-ODM are
also providing 2-1/2 man years of training expertise during 1977-78 to train
9 chief operators in the field pest control operations, who would train the
operators under them.
Project Proposals
8.        Table 2 summarizes the proposed project investments in equipment
and vehicles for: (a) pest control squads and inspection; (b) equipment for
Central Testing Laboratory-Dacca and New Zonal Testing Laboratory-Rajshahi;
and, (c) staff training. The project would fully equip the 25 pest control
squads (each squad - one operator and 2 spraymen) that would be operating in
the project "core" area. Any usable equipment presently available in the
project area would be transferred to DICT units in other parts of the country.
This standardization would facilitate the training of operators and spraymen,
and also simplify the maintenance requirements. Each chief operator, and two
pest control squads would be provided with one vehicle (in the "haor" areas



ANNEX 5

of Mymensingh and Sylhet, a motor launch) and trailer for carrying chemicals
and equipment. Two squads would generally travel together. Chief inspectors
would be provided with motorcycles.
9.        The project would provide equipment and facilities for the estab-
lishment of a Zonal Testing Laboratory, under the Regional Controller of Food,
Rajshahi. The disposal instruction function would be delegated to this lab-
oratory. The Dacca laboratory would supervise the Zonal laboratory. Reduced
work load at Dacca would enable MF to improve the service to other areas,
including Mymensingh and Sylhet. Present procedures and forms for initiating
and issuance of disposal instructions would be simplified.
Training
10.       The project would also provide 2 man years of technical assistance
to carry the UK-ODM initiated program for intensive field training into the
field in the "core" project area. It would include:
(i) 2 man years of quality control specialist(s);
(ii) one truck/van equipped for practical teaching (with
projection and audio-visual equipment) per 2 districts;
(iii) local travel costs for consultant;
(iv) training (travel, boarding and lodging) costs for trainees.
11.       About 600 man-weeks of field training would be provided to MF and
TCCA staffqas well as to private sector observers. TORS for the consultant
and outline of the training program are in Appendix 1. Project assistance
would be channelled through the Warehouse Training Center to permit better
coordination of training activities of various donor agencies and also enable
the project to benefit directly from WTC activities in other areas and assist
in the development of the WTC training programs. However, the project
financed consultant would be first and primarily responsible for MF project
needs, be a member of the Project Implementation Unit and the Project Steering
Committee. All project equipment and vehicles would be placed with the WTC
with the right of first usage for the project implementation unit during the
project implementation period. Director WTC would meet monthly and coordinate
closely with the DICT in planning and conducting project field training.
Staffing
12.       Additional posts would be created for staffing the new Zonal Testing
laboratory. Early appointment of the senior analyst (ZTL) would be essential
to enable him to plan for the establishment of the laboratory.

Work Methods
4.        Mobile teams, one for two districts, would be operated under three
selected chief operators who would have already been trained under the UK-ODM
program. Training equipment would be carried with the training vans. Maximum
of thirty trainees would be accommodated at one time. They would come from
neighboring LSD, and private sector operators (traders) would also be invited.
Duration would be about one week; boarding and lodging would be arranged for
trainees for which a daily allowance would be paid. The consultant would have
funds to import or make relevant films, slides or posters. Refresher courses
would also be arranged in the 2nd and 3rd year. Lessons learned from the
proposed special investigations of the UK-ODM technical assistance would be
followed up.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Paddy Drying
1.        During field ripening, grain moisture content begins to reduce, and
when it reaches 25-30%, the kernel is fully mature. If harvesting, the ideal
moisture content is about 22-26% if done mechanically, but harvesting by hand
is possible at lower moisture levels (16-18%). At these levels, the possi-
bility of grain damage and field losses is minimized. However for post
harvest storage of paddy, ideal moisture content is 12%. Reduction of
moisture to this level can be achieved in different ways.
Sun drying
2.        Sun drying is the most common means of reducing grain moisture,
either pre- or post-harvest. Pre-harvest drying on the stalk is only possible
in the dry winter season. However, if paddy is dried below 16%, shattering
losses increase. These losses, which can occur at the slightest wind or
vibration during harvest and shoulder transportaion to the thresher floor,
are estimated at 2-6% for the Aman crop. Scarcity of adequate drying floor
space or labor are prime reasons for pre-harvest field drying.
3.        Post harvest sun drying is done by spreading a layer a few inches
thick, sometimes on a mat, but often directly on the floor. Frequent stirring
by feet is done. Cracking results during high temperature periods in contact
with the hot road surface. Foreign materials get mixed in, and loss from birds,
animals, and cars/bullock cart driving over is estimated at 2%. Drying times
for 16% paddy varies from 4 hours on a hot road surface to 8 hours on a mud
path, but if sunshine is intermittant 2 days may be required. In the Aman
season the relative humidity/temperature combination is such that it is fea-
sible to dry to 12-13% grain moisture.
4.        Boro and Aus crops are harvested during the high rainfall period
(Annex 1) and traditional sun drying is difficult because sunshine avail-
ability goes down to 40% and the paddy invariably gets wet before it can be
moved away. In the low lying "haor" areas, where Boro is the only crop crop,
there is an acute scarcity of suitable high grounds for sun drying. In
addition, with relative ambient humidity about 75%, the equilibrium moisture
is about 15-16%, sun drying beyond which is not possible. Thus, consequent
prolonged storage in bulk poses grave problems. The Boro crop has been high-
lighted as the crop with the highest growth potential (Annex 1). The newer
IRRI high yielding varieties are also harvested during the rainy season and
because of their higher yields, create further pressures on the limited
drying floor space available.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        IF procurement of these Boro varieties has been at best reluctant
(Annex 3). Nevertheless, despite limited procurement effort and cautious
purchasing standards because of previous years storage difficulties. In
1975/76 about 23,000 tons of the Boro crop were still procured, about 80% from
the three districts of Mymensingh, Sylhet and Rajshahi. Recently procurement
has been reinitiated with greater caution regarding moisture content, and with
plans to ensure quick disposal. Major Boro procurement centers in the past
are given in Table 2.
Role of Parboiling
6.        Parboiling is a much practiced process in which paddy is soaked in
cold water followed by boiling for 15-30 minutes. Its main advantages are:
a) yield of head rice during milling increases by about 10-15%; b) keeping
quality of milled rice improves; c) nutrition loss during washing and cooking
is minimized. Parboiling is sometimes used to tide over inclement weather,
when sun drying is not possible, since soaked paddy can be carried over
for 7 days. However, subsequent demand for drying is much greater because
moisture reduction requirement is increased six times. Parboiling has a
high fuel requirement, normally obtained by burning husk, and for handling
the increased Boro and Aus production, large scale dependence on this
process would not be justified.
Mechanical Drying
7.        In Japan, because of high yields and difficult drying conditions
about 2 million mechanical dryers are used, mostly by farmers with only 2-3
acres under cultivation. About 50% of the total paddy drying is done mechan-
ically. However, in Bangladesh the need for mechnical drying has not been
seriously felt because:
(a) almost 55% of the crop is harvested in the season when
sun drying is easy;
(b) production per farm is small, for which sun drying space
can be found;
(c) surplus per farm is small so that most storage is on-farm
in small lots which can be periodically areated and dried;
(d) traditional parboiling practices reduces urgency of
drying, but make subsequent mechanical drying diffi-
cult because of high moisture reduction load;
(e) low farm gate prices, which reduce the incentive to
prevent losses.
8.        Future production increases, especially in Boro and Aus through
irrigation and use of HYV, would increase yield and surpluses, and result
in greater difficulty in sun drying. MF failure to offer price support for



ANNEX 6
Page 3
the Boro, IRRI varieties and Aus crops through its procurement program
(Annex 3) is creating marketing difficulties. To assist in overcoming this
problem, the Danish International Development Agency (Danida) in 1973 in-
stalled pilot drying facilities in Comilla and conducted trials on different
designs and systems. Eight TCCA in the North West are now installing locally
fabricated small sack dryers for offering drying services to farmers. The
Bangladesh Rice Research Institute has also experimented with dryers of dif-
ferent designs. The cumulative experience with alternative designs and systems
of delivering drying services experimented so far in Bangladesh is that:
(a) drying has to be a part of an integrated marketing
system;
(b) farmers would spend money for drying only when faced
with total loss;
(c) a joint farming situation, where the whole produce is
mixed and dried (no lot identity) would be the most
appropriate; but farmers, on own account would not
mix paddy, even to reduce losses;
(d) mechanical drying would not be desirable for the
situation where sun drying is possible (Aman)
except when grain is going into long term
storage (12 months);
(e) dryers could be successful if pre-drying mixing
and bulking is possible, entering paddy is below
20% moisture, the farmers do not have option to
take away half dried paddy, and explicit payments
or labor input on part of farmer is not required;
(f) a batch type deep bed dryer would be well suited
to the situation in (e).
Project Proposals
9.        A modified procurement system would be introduced at selected
LSDs in the project area. The system would include:
(a) Purchase of paddy up to 20% moisture (wet basis);
(b) suitable testing and pricing procedures (Annex 3) to
determine moisture, discount for moisture and recover
drying cost;
(c) suitably located mechanical facilities for drying in
bulk after lot-identity is lost and paddy is bought
by MF;
(d) operator training and system supervision;



ANNEX 6
Page 4
(e) evaluation and recommendations for replication;
(f) technical assistance.
10.       Drying costs (Table 2) vary with the size of the drying facility
and range from 12 Tk/md for a 500 ton seasonal throughput facility to 3 Tk/md
for a 3,000 ton seasonal throughput facility. Price discounts would be applied
for both the weight loss on drying and the drying cost. For 20% wet paddy, an
estimated total discount would be 9.5 Tk (2.3 Tk for drying and 7.2 Tk for
weight loss) using a 3,000 MT facility; and 10.2 Tk for a 1,000 ton facility.
A single discount or premium factor of 1.2 Tk per 1% moisture would be used
between 12% and 20%. Paddy above 20% would not be accepted, to reduce burden
on the drying system and to encourage farmers to sun-dry as much as possible.
11.       Prime areas in four districts where such dryers would be considered
is in Table 1. Other criteria to be applied to narrow down the selection
would be, a) availability of electricity at site; b) availability of work-
shop facilities; c) access and transportation for effective supervision;
d) potential for increased boro procurement; e) availability of an operator
from the local area. Although it is possible that MF willingness to buy paddy
with 20% moisture, will increase the purchases, initial design capacities would
be based on past procurement levels. Only 2 sites are expected to handle
5,000 tons in a 60 day Boro season, with most in the range of 1,000 - 3,000
tons. About 15 locations would be finalized, based on above criteria.
12.       Driers with in-bin drying are recommended as the most appropriate
type of units to be used as a part of the MF procurement system. They are
simple to operate, can accommodate wide variability in daily arrivals, use low
drying temperatures, and the larger bulk would reduce drying cost to reason-
able levels. Appropriate systems in the 1,000 - 5,000 ton per season range for
each site would be chosen (Table 3). Total estimated costs are in Table 4.
In the 1,000 ton system, since the bins are fewer than four, layer drying would
be necessary, but in other systems batch-in-bin drying with 3 -4' depth of paddy
would be done. In-layer-drying would permit drying to begin with the first
layer and layers of grain would be added periodically so that a depth of wet
grain exists beyond the drying zone. Eventually the bin would be filled and
drying continued till the drying zone has passed through the entire bed.
Caution would have to be taken to ensure that retention time of any layer at
the likely temperatures and moistures is not too long to permit mold growth or
overheating. Batch in-bin drying would involve single layers (3-4 ), high air
flow rates (8-15 CFM per bushel), and higher temperatures to achieve rapid
drying. Two batches would be done in a day. A moisture gradient would exist,
but subsequent cooling and mixing would help reduce this gradient. Careful
loading would be required to avoid uneven layer height. Selection of drying
air temperature would be critical, adequate (1-2 hours) cool air areation
would be required prior to unloading to offset the effects of inadequate
mixing. Given the mould growth-temperature-time relationships full bin dry-
ing would not be recommended.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
13.       In order to simplify management, manufacturers of equipment would
he asked to provide instructions (given local conditions) that include a
suggested filling schedule, maximum depth of wet grain above drying zone,
measurement (or computation) of the depth of drying zone. Initial operator
training would be the responsibility of the supplier; operator selection
would be done by the drying system consultant who would also prepare suitable
nomographs and charts to assist the operator in dryer management.
14.       Terms of reference of the drying (and procurement) consultant
(4 man-years) are in Appendix 1. During the Aman season, the consultant
would assist with detailed study of the MF & TCCA procurement procedures;
and in the Boro season concentrate on the dryer operation and operator
training. Two counterpart local consultants would be employed to assist the
international consultant in drying and in procurement systems (Annex 4).
Vehicles would be provided to ensure effective supervision. The consultant
would be able to test alternative system components (different heating fuels,
indirect fired heating systems), operating methods (full-bin, cold air area-
tion), should this appear warranted after the first year's operation.
Procurement and Installation
15.       Design would be suitable for international tendering for equipment
with local civil works executed by local contractors, through PWD, to sup-
plier designs. Suppliers would be required to provide drawings for necessary
foundation and civil works, and install and start-up the equipment once civil
works are complete at initial 5 sites. The counterpart local engineer would
be trained to handle subsequent installation under supervision of the drying
consultant. MF would be responsible for shipment of the suppliers equipment
from the port of arrival to the site. Delivery of imported equipment would
proceed independently of civil works completion. Erection of the last 10
units would start after the evaluation of the operation of the first five.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Organization and Management
A. Background
1.        The Ministry of Food, which is at present headed by the Chief of Air
Staff and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator, is responsible for govern-
ment grain procurement, domestic and foreign, and for food distribution pro-
grams, except for emergency relief food which is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Relief. The staff of the Ministry is headed by the Secretary of
Food and the staff functions are vested with two Joint Secretaries (Adminis-
tration and Distribution, Procurement and Development) who supervise civil
servants with functional responsibilities under their respective jurisdiction.
The Directorate of Food is the operating arm of the Ministry, responsible for
day-to-day operational matters with broad policy and program determined by the
ministry.
Directorate of Food
2.        The Directorate of Food is headed by the Director-General (Chart 1)
who reports directly to the Secretary of Food, and its business is conducted
by the following six Directorates:
Directorate of Supply, Distribution and Rationing
Directorate of Movement and Storage
Directorate of Procurement
Directorate of Silos
Directorate of Inspection, Control and Training
Directorate of Accounts
3.        The Directorate of Supply, Distribution and Rationing (DSDR) is
responsible for public distribution and manages the 318 LSDs. The Directorate
of Movement and Storage is responsible for import handling and for inter-
regional shipment of MF food supplies and manages all the 12 CSDs. The 4 silo
depots are operated by the Directorate of Silos. In the recent past, DSDR has
been the core of the entire food operation. The Silo Directorate was created
to administer the first grain storage project (Cr 381-BD). The Directorate of
Procurement was created in January 1977, prior to which domestic grain pro-
curement was part of the responsibility of the then Directorate of Procurement,
Distribution, and Supply. In view of the importance GOB of late has attached
to domestic grain procurement as a major instrument for accelerating agricul-
tural development, the Directorate of Procurement is expected to play an



ANNEX 7
Page 2
increasingly important role in the future. The role of the Directorate of
Inspection, Control and Training (Annex 5), is to provide pest control and
foocgrain inspection and testing services. The Directorate of Accounts, with
a large staff of Superintendents and Auditors, carries out audit of accounts
of all the field operations.
Organization Structure
4.        The structure and the relative strength of various directorates
(Chart I) is a natural consequence of MF's historical role, having been con-
cerned mainly with distribution of imported foodgrain which generally arrived
in good condition and were held in storage at CSDs for relatively short
periods for use in chronically deficit areas. Areas with production surpluses
had sometimes to be used to feed the government distribution system, but
otherwise did not require attention. Procurement efforts were not concerned
with impact on farmgate prices and production. DSDR has the most extensive
staff, under four Regional Controllers of Food (RCF) with each district and
sub-division and having a district (DCF) and a sub-divisional controller of
food (SCF). Generally 1 chief inspector, 10 inspectors and 8-10 store keepers
work in a sub-division. The recently established Directorate of Procurement
in the major procurement areas operates through an Additional District Control-
ler of Food and has a staff strength of about one quarter of DSDR, most of whom
are recruited on a temporary basis. Similarly, the Directorate of Inspection
Control and Training (DICT) operates in the project area without chief opera-
tors in Dinajpur and Bogra, without chief inspectors in Sylhet, Rangpur and
Borga, but with extensive staff at the ports and CSDs which have been the
historical centers of activity. Regional, district or subdivisional staff of
the various directorates are managed directly from Dacca, except for DSDR,
where the District Controller exercises control over the SCF. Seasonality of
MF's distribution and domestic procurement functions are complementary, and
offer scope for more effective use of manpower than is possible with the
existing split of field responsibilities. Flow of communication between
various field directorates, which is through the Directorate Headquarters in
Dacca, also leaves room for improvement. Field coordination between various
directorates and with other ministries could also be improved.
6.        One serious operational deficiency is in the area of storage main-
tenance. MF has to submit work requests, including very minor ones, on a job
by job basis to the Ministry of Works, which prepares bid documents and gets
the work done mainly through private contractors. The entire process is time
consuming and involves excessively frustrating paper work, especially since
MF has no engineering expertise whatsoever. This has also led to MF having
to accept from contractors, godowns which were not fully satisfactory. Most
GOB civil works facilities are maintained by the Public Works Department
(PWD) through annual contractual arrangements. However, PWD naturally does
not accept godowns in need of major repair under this arrangement, only
accepting new godowns immediately upon completion of construction or rehabil-
itation. This situation has led to the extensive disrepair found at most
depots.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
Future Needs
7.        As a result of GOB's decision to operate an effective system of
domestic procurement in order to raise and maintain farmgate prices at an
incentive level (Annex 1), MF procurement (domestic and external) and distri-
bution activities are most important to the overall national objectives of
stimulating foodgrain production. As GOB increases market intervention to
keep farmgate and consumer prices under some control, formulation of food
sector policies would require close policy and program coordination between
MF and other ministries like agriculture, jute, finance, relief, planning
commission, Bangladesh Bank, commercial banks and national economic council.
Following the recent IDA Food Price Policy Mission, GOB has established an
inter-ministral coordination and policy formulation body for foodgrain sector.
8.        To assist MF in its distribution related responsibilities a large
bulk of information currently arrives daily at a central control room. How-
ever, use of this information could be made more effective, and additional
relevant information including data on procurement related activities would
be necessary and feedback on storage conditions, losses, condition of physical
vehicles and godowns etc., would be essential for effective decision making.
Table 1 analyses the future information needs for various decision purposes
of the different Directorates.
9.        As a result of GOB's new emphasis, MF's activities have begun to
show a clear shift. Since internal procurement has built up and stocks are
being held at dispersed locations, movement and milling planning has become
critical, and pest control become more significant because of longer duration
in storage of paddy which rarely comes in below 14-15% moisture. GOB has
rightly decided to actively procure Boro and Aus, but this would require
much more effective field coordination between directorates because of the
remcite locations involved and the difficulty of drying these crops. Under
the project, these shifts would be further emphasized; and streamlining of
the MF organizational structure and administrative arrangements would be
necessary to enable GOB to cope effectively with the new situation.
10.       Need for effective MF interaction with other ministries especially
at the field level where impediments are many, would increase with increased
domestic procurement. The lower grades of the District Controller of Food
in relation to the other district level officers of the Ministries with whom
he has to interact regularly (Agriculture, PWD, Commercial Banks) pose a
major constraint to the effective field management of the procurement pro-
gram (para 3). Also, the number of banks providing procurement lending in a
district (often 3 or 4) further complicate this problem. Coordination
with field GOB security staff to arrange police escorts for cash carrying
vehicles and payment booths of the many banks involved (Annex 4) also requires
attention.



ANNEX 7

B. Project Proposals
Project Steering Committee
11.       A Project Steering Committee (PSC) would be established under the
Secretary of Food and would meet as necessary, but at least quarterly, to
review progress of project implementation in conjunction with other ministries
and institutions involved in project execution.
The PSC would include: (a) Joint Secretary (Procurement);
(b) Director General Food; (c) Joint Secretary - Finance; (d) Joint Secretary
- Ministry of Agriculture; (e) Chief Engineer - PWD; (f) Bangladesh Bank
representative; (g) Project Construction Manager; (h) Director - IRDP.
A quarterly project progress report prepared by the Project Implementation
Unit and the Annual Report prepared by the Planning/Monitoring Cells (para
14) would form the basis for the PSC discussion. A section under the Joint
Secretary (procurement) working exclusively on the project would provide
the secretariat for PSC. Project consultants would also prepare quarterly
reports to the Chairman, PSC, outlining programs, problems, and plans of the
specific components for which they are responsible. PSC would also be respon-
sible for reviewing the Annual Report of the Food Ministry (para 14) to be
sent to IDA within three months of the close of the fiscal year. Outline of
the Annual MF Report, which would include an Annual Plan and focus on the
overall operations of MF, is in Appendix 4.
Project Implementation Unit
12.       A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be set up under the
project in MF. It would be headed by the Director General of Food. PECU's
project construction manager (Annex 3) would participate in the monthly meet-
ing of the PIU, and would also be available for all construction deliberations.
Director of Procurement, Chief of monitoring cell (para 14) would attend all
meetings of the PIU. PIU would be self-contained and have adequate staff to:
(a)  Prepare quarterly progress reports based on field
reports from RCF and deal with IDA; outline of the
quarterly progress report is in Appendix 2);
(b) manage the project construction fund, maintain project
accounts and prepare disbursement requests;
(c) handle project procurement including tender documents
for the import of equipment and vehicles and assistance
to the Project Tender Committee in bid documentation,
evaluation, ordering, etc.;
(d) handle recruitment of paddy drying/procurement and pest
control consultants and assist in their work, and coordinate
execution of project studies;



ANNEX 7
Page 5
(e) propose to IDA location and annual construction plan
by February of each year.
A staffing plan for PIU, agreed with GOB during negotiations, is in Table 1.
Planning Cell
13.       MF has recently established a Planning Cell, under the Joint
Secretary (Procurement) to focus on the formulation of long term plans and
policy in the food grain sector. The analytical capability of this cell
needs strengthening a research officer and economist would be recruited under
the project to focus specifically on the determination of procurement prices
that offer adequate incentive to producers to use yield increasing technology.
Monitoring Cell (HF)
14.       With a significantly greater stock of local paddy at dispersed
locations MF would need to devote greater attention to planning, developing
cost effective alternatives in stock movement, milling schedules, stock
management and disposal and monitoring their implementation. A Monitoring
cell would be established to assist DGF in continually improving the
Directorate's performance.  The cell would:
(i) review all information currently flowing into the MF
control room, and start collection of other operational
and cost information;
(ii) analyse data, and make specific recommendations to DGF
for increasing cost effectiveness;
(iLi)  prepare the Annual Operational Report of the Directorate
of Food which would include its Annual Operating Plan.
15.       Terms of references and staffing plan are in Appendix 1.  The
project would finance the cost of the cell (Table 2). Chief of the cell
would report directly to DGF.
DGF Administration
16.       To enable MF to cope effectively with the changed emphasis in its
responsibilities under the project, administrative arrangements both at head-
quarters, but especially in the field, need to be streamlined by establishing
new lines of operational command, and creation of key coordination points
between MF and other agencies. Details of changes being considered by GOB
and endorsed by the mission are shown on Chart 1 with dotted lines and in-
volve a closer integration of the various functions of DGF (rationing, dis-
tribution, procurement, movement, pest control) in the field under a senior
MF officer at the subdivision, district and regional level. Inspection staff



ANNEX 7
Page 6
should however, remain independent at subdivision and district level, report-
ing directly to the regional controller through their Assistant Director.
Specfically, DGF should:
(a) place all staff of DP and DSDR in the subdivision
placed under the SCF; this would enable procure-
ment and distribution staff to assist each other
as the relative work load varies through the year;
(b) place all MF staff in the district, except the chief
inspectors and inspectors of the DICT, placed under
the administrative charge of DCF and the ADCF; this
would enable more effective integration of pest
control operations with stock management, while
leaving the inspection staff independent.
(c) place regional staff of all directorates; i.e. assistant
director DICT, account officers and storage and movement
officers at CSD, under the administrative control of RCF;
(d) have the performance of the RCF appraised by DP and
DICT in addition to DSDR; of DCF by RCF and Assistant
Director DICT, and of SCF by Additional District
Controller of Food.
(e) ask the RCF to report to him for resolving issues that
effect more than 1 Directorate;
(f) create a godown maintenance cell under RCF to coor-
dinate godown maintenance work with PWD to ensure
effective godown maintenance program;
(g) establish a Regional Testing Laboratory under the
Assistant Director, DICT to assist him in issuing
faster stock disposal instruction.
17.       In view of increased responsibilities and greater experience
required of individuals filling the modified RCF, DCF and SCF positions,
and also to ensure their ability to deal effectively with field staff of
other Ministries, their positions need to be reclassified.
18.       MF would undertake a review of the delegation of responsibility
between HQ and field with a view to transferring greater responsibility to
the strengthened field officers. However monthly distribution requirements
would continue to originate with DSDR in Dacca. Once the Zonal Testing
Laboratory (Annex 5) is estblished, stock disposal instructions for N. Bengal
would be issued from there. Similarly, recommendations to the Director,
Movement and Storage for intra-regional stock movements would originate with
RCF. Areas for greater delegation would be identified by a management study
which would also study the overall organization structure, and management
information systems. The study would be undertaken in 1978.



ANNEX 7
Page 7
19.       Distribution of staff between various districts should need to
match the procurement and pest control work load rather than follow a
standard pattern for staffing per district or subdivision. Dinajpur,
which is the district with the highest procurement, suffers the most on this
account because it has only 2 subdivisions. Similarly, pest control staffing
is biased towards CSD's. Additional pest control squads, chief inspectors
(Annex 5) and procurement staff would be required. In addition, temporary
procurement inspectors should be formally confirmed (Annex 4). New staff
should receive appropriate training in procurement or pest control before
being assigned to a job.
Field Coordination
20.       Effective coordination between MF and field organizations of PWD,
Ministry of Agriculture, IRDP, commerical banks would be crucial for the
success of the domestic procurement effort and the project. To ensure this:
(a) The existing district food coordination committee, would
provide this co-ordination with addition of representation
from PWD, commercial banks, District Agriculture Officer
and IRDP project director (in the TCCA pilot project area).
The sub-committee should meet at least every quarter within
2 weeks of the close of the quarter to review the quarterly
report and the operational plan for the following quarter
prepared by the DCF. (During the January-March period
it would meet every month);
(b) The existing subdivision food committee, similar in struc-
ture and operations, would meet within 1 week of the close
of every quarter to consider the quarterly report and action
plan of the SCF.
Monitoring
21.       Monitoring would consist of two components.  First, project execu-
tion would be monitored against the schedules and expectations defined at
the start (see implementation schedule) and revised as necessary. Secondly,
there would be a continual review of the overall operations of the Food
Ministry. Monitoring of project implementation will be undertaken by the
Project Implementation Unit in the form of a quarterly progress report to
be submitted to PSC and to IDA. Parallel internal reporting systems would
be established. SCF would prepare quarterly reports within one week of
the close of the quarter for DCF, who would review these with ADCF and chief
operators and each SCF within two weeks of the close of the quarter. Similar
RCF reviews with Assistant Director DICT, each DCF, executive engineer (main-
tenance cell) would be held within three weeks of the close of the quarter.
Routine PSC meetings would be held six weeks after the close of the quarter
to discuss the quarter to discuss the quarterly report 1/ of DGF which would
1/   All reports would include an operational plan for the following quarter.



ANNEX 7
Page 8
be prepared on the basis of a review of the quarterly report 1/ from the
Regional Office by DGF with various DCF, RCF and Directors. Project con-
sultants' quarterly reports to the Chairman PSC and a report 1/ from IRDP
on the TCCA pilot project would also be prepared for PSC. The progress report
will concern itself with disbursements under the project, physical implemen-
tation, progress of contracts and orders and the filing of notes established
under the project, as well as detail current problems (details in Appendix
II).
22.       The monitoring of the overall operations of the Directorate of Food
will be done by the Monitoring Cell (para 14) and would cover the operations
of each of the six Directorates. Details of the operation of the monitoring
cell are in Appendix I, and the outline of the Annual Report (which would
include an Annual Plan) is in Appendix II.
Evaluation of Benefits
23.       An evaluation of the impact of the project upon production will
be attempted and it would be possible to measure the impact upon farmgate
prices and incomes of foodgrain producers (para 24). Also project impact
on the efficiency of the operations of the Food Ministry would be evaluated
(para 25).
24.       The impact of the project upon farmgate prices would be assessed
by means of a continuous farmgate price monitoring system, which would also
provide a key input to the interministerial policy formulation committee. A
suitable consultant should be recruited - Bangladesh Institute of Development
Studies (BIDS) would be competent to design this monitoring system which
should address itself to:
(a) the actual level of farmgate prices, seasonal and
geographical fluctuations, and relation to whole-
sale and procurement prices for both paddy and
wheat;
(b) the cost of inputs (fertilizer, seeds, irrigation,
etc.) in relation to the price received by the
producer;
(c) variation in marketing system and prices received
between small and large farmers;
(d) the process of farmers selling post harvest for low
prices and buying later at higher prices should be
examined. The study should place a primary emphasis
upon the six project districts.
1/   All reports would include an operational plan for the following quarter.

26.       The cost effectiveness exercise would be an ongoing internal
exercise carried out by the Monitoring Cell. The Cell should pay attention
to the estimation of and changes in such factors as:
(a) handling costs during trans-shipment and incidence
of double shipping;
(b) losses in storage and handling;
(c) turnover of stock and capacity utilization;
(d)  age of stocks; and
(e) costs of operation of godowns and silos.

DGF's Monitoring Cell
1.        The Cell will have three major functions;
(a) the establishment of a data framework suitable for the
assessment of the cost effectiveness and efficiency of
the Food Directorate's operations;
(b) preparation of the Directorate of Food's Annual Operating
Plan 1/, the monitoring of the implementation of the
plan and the level and changes in cost and operational
efficiency and reporting on such to the DGF, together
with any recommendations for consequent improvements
therein; and
(c)  the compilation of the Annual Operational Report of
the Directorate of Food (Appendix 2).
2.        Planning at present is limited to ensuring that sufficient stocks
are available in each sub-division for the coming month(s). A plan with a
broader framework and a longer time horizon is required in order to improve
stock movement, milling schedules, and stock management and thus lead to
greater operational efficiency.
3.        An essential requirement for improved planning is adequate data
base. MF currently operates a Control Room at Dacca, which needs to diver-
sify its data base to include cost information, age of stocks, losses, and
physical condition of facilities. The present practice of daily reporting
leads to excessive information which can not be fully analyzed.
4.        The planning process would commence with the national policy
guidelines and estimates for the coming year of procurement, distribution
and imports. These would need to be disaggregated to the sub-division level
by month and estimate made of requirements for hired storage capacity, trans-
portation, rice milling, etc. A recommended milling and month a transporta-
tion schedule for the year by sub-division would be prepared.
1/   Not for the project activities, but for the overall operations of the
Directorate of Food.



ANNEX 7
APPENDIX 1
Page 2
5.        A study of the management system, information flow and decision
making should be undertaken by the cell, for which technical assistance
would be provided.
Cost Effectiveness
6.        The cell would focus attention on operational costs and efficiency,
paying primary attention to:
(a) utilization of warehouse space and grain flows;
(b) the makeup, location and age of stocks;
(c) the regularity and effectiveness of pest control;
(d) the level of grain losses at each level of operation;
(e) transportation costs; and
(f) handling costs both during trans-shipment and in
storage.
The cell would make regular recommendation to the DGF regarding proposed
improvements in operations, and assist in their implementation.
Staffing of Cell
(a) Chief - at Dy. Director level. He should have expe-
rience on the practical problems of grain handling
(b) Transportation/Systems Analyst
(c) Financial Analyst
(d) Statistician
(e) Necessary support staff
The cost of the cell will be financed under the project for the first 4
years. Technical assistance could be provided to the cell if necessary.
Cost estimates are given in Table 1.

BANGLADESH
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Economic Analysis and Justification
General
1.        The project will assist GOB in improving the procurement capacity
and storage efficiency of MF. The project would enable GOB to reduce high
storage losses incurred in dilapidated and marginal private sector facilities.
The project godowns would also be available for the distribution of food.
In addition, higher levels and reduced risk of past harvest fall in farm-
gate prices is expected to stimulate domestic production.
2.        The economic analysis mainly considers benefits from reduced storage
losses analysing the project in three components (godowns, pest control and
paddy drying). The other benefit due to the production incentive effect of
higher farmgate prices is difficult to assess in the absence of economic data.
Important Assumptions
3.        The prime assumptions made in the economic analysis are:
(a) drastic improvements in the transport system, rice milling
location and private sector storage are not expected till
1985/86;
(b) unskilled labor is costed at 75% of the financial wage rate,
skilled labor at 100%, and foreign exchange at US$1 = TK 15.5;
paddy is valued at farmgate and ex-godown prices derived from
CIF prices (Table 4);
(c) reduction in storage losses in the alternative use of storage
facilities released by the project is valued at the current hire
charges (Tk 8/ton month), for 10 months (alternatively, if de-
rived from the loss estimates of Table 1, its value is imputed
to be about 11 Tk/ton month, assuming rice storage);
(d) storage losses in various types of facilities are in Table 1;
estimates are based on available data and on the considered
opinions of experts with extensive field experience in storage
under Bangladesh conditions.
(e) average storage utilization is assumed to be 85% for 6 months,
and godowns are assumed idle for the remaining 6 months;



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(f) economic life of project constructed godowns is taken to
be 30 years, rehabilitated godowns 15 years; pest control
equipment 5 years, paddy drying equipment 10 years;
(g) a turnover of 1.2 is assumed for the procurement storage
system, which is the best that can be achieved given the
high seasonality of procurement, poor transportation and
an even distribution pattern.
(h) costs of technical assistance and various studies are included
in the cost stream.
(i) reduction in handling and transport costs and benefits from
timely availability of relief supplies are not quantified.
The Godown Component
4.        In the six major procurement districts, the project will:  (i) re-
place 75,000 tons of hired capacity, (ii) rehabilitate 25,000 tons of TN
sheds; and (iii) add 70,000 tons of storage capacity. All new godowns would
have essential ancilliary and procurement facilities and full pest control
service. They would be able to store foodgrains at low loss levels (Table 1)
and thus eliminate high storage losses incurred in the marginal facilities
now used. They would also improve farmer access to the MF procurement cen-
ters, reduce handling and transportation of procured stocks. As a result of
the 70,000 tons additional MF capacity MF would be able to store under good
conditions increased annual procurement in the project area of 100,000 tons
rice equivalent 1/ which otherwise would have been stored under poor condi-
tions by private traders. For investment in the godown component including
an appropriate portion of the cost of pest control services but excluding
paddy drying, maintenance and additional staff, the economic rate of return
is estimated to be 14.6% (Table 3). The ROR for this basic component, which
is essential for paddy drying and production incentive benefits, is low
because benefits from reduced handling, transport and from use of project
godowns for distribution during 6 months they are not required for procurement
has not been quantified in the absence of reliable data.
Pest Control
5.        The pest control component of the project will provide fumigation
and testing services to existing MF godowns in the project area and all the
new godowns built under the project. Pest control cost for new godowns is
covered in the godown component. Because of improved mobility, equipment and
training, storage losses in existing godowns would also be reduced by about
0.3% per month for 6 month storage period (Table 1). The economic rate of
1/   70,000 tons nominal capacity has a loading capacity of 120,000 tons of
paddy for short-term storage (850 tons per godown). Allowing for addi-
tional 20% Boro and wheat procurement because of improved location,
additional procurement capacity is 100,000 tons (rice equivalent); this
is equivalent to a turn over of 1.2, which is the best that can be
achieved.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
return on the relatively small (TK 10 M) pest control component is greater
than 50%, because of the high sunk costs in existing godowns, without which
it is not very effective.
Drying Component
6.        The introduction of 15 dryers mainly for the Boro crop would reduce
losses that are likely to occur if 17% grain moisture boro paddy were put
into good storage (Annex 6). Estimated savings in losses will be 1.15% per
month on a Boro throughput of 35,000 tons of paddy for an average storage
period of 4 months. On average, Boro paddy is expected to require drying
from, 17% to 12% moisture. The economic rate of return on the component is
24% (Table 3). Benefits from drying the Aman procurement are not quantified.
Although this component is analysed separately, paddy drying is ineffective
without good storage.
Full Project
7.        The economic rate of return for the project as a whole, assuming
no increase in procurement estimated to be 21%: 1/
Estimated Rates of Return
Overall return                    21%
Godown Component                  15%
Drying Component                  24%
Pest Control Component      over 50%
Risk of Delay
8.        The most significant risk facing the project is delay in increasing
procurement and improving farmer access to the MF procurement system. Recent
GOB efforts to shift the emphasis of MF efforts from distribution to procure-
ment have shown encouraging results and exposed constraints which the project
aims to eliminate. A sensitivity analysis to study the impact of slower
increase in procurement has been done. A delay of four years in reaching
full development procurement levels would reduce the rate of return of para 7
to 17%, assuming that storage facilities temporarily surplus during this
period of delay would remain idle.
9.        The other important benefit of the project would be to stimulate
farmgate prices and thus foodgrain production. This benefit is difficult to
quantify since it represents a transfer payment between dealers and farmers
and involves a 'benefit' only when the changed distribution leads to either
additional or more optimal investment. The project evaluation exercise would
attempt to quantify this aspect.
1/   The rate has the following sensitivity:
Fixed Costs       +15% rate of return = 18% - 15% rate of return = 25%
Operating Costs   +15% rate of return = 20% - 15% rate of return = 22%
Benefits           +15% rate of return = 25% - 15% rate of return = 17%

J/ All godowns plus portion of pest oDntrol and godown and pzocurenent eqdipJent related to new godowns, engineez±ng and conatruction equipment,
but excluding technical assistance; unskilled labor valued at 75% of flnancial wages, the unskilled wage being 80% of total wage bill. Economic
life of rehabilitation godowns is 15 years, new godowns is 30 years.
/ See Table 2 for details.
3/ 25,000 ton of rehabilitated godowns are used for 8 months for procurement storage, at 85% utilization and left
idle for 4 months; while new godowns are used for 6 months at 85% utilization for HF foodgrain storage. and left idle 6 months; 70 o00
tons, which increases procurement by 100,000 wruld redice losses that would otherwise have occurred in private storage for six aonits. Hired space
released by HF for use b other aectcrs is valued at current hire charges. (8 Dk/ton month).
F *or post cmtrol equipment mBed on existing  Doomna ROR ia high becauee of auz* costs in godowmne which are essential for effective pat
control. Se Table 2  for econcmic coats; equipwAnt life is ammed to be 5 years; see Table 1 for impact on storage losses.
i/ Although anslyaed separately, paddy drying would be ineffective witbout good storage godowns.  See Table 1 for impact on Boro crop storage
losses; equipment life is assumed to be 10 years.
6/ For entire project, including technical assistance, procurement equipment and TCCA pilot project for which no benefits are qnantfted in this
Analysis; excluding any benefits frcm improved handling.
7/ This basic component is essential foF other benefits like paddy drying and production incentive (Table 7).
rf increase in procurement is delayed by four years compared to Table 7, and surplus storage is assumed idle during this period of delay,               e
the ROR becomes 17%.                                                                                                                                       °
