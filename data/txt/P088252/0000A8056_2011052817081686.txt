                         Component 2 (Arad) is proceeding satisfactorily with a limited implementation delay.

                         Component 1 (Bucharest) has accumulated delays and an extension of this component will be required and is currently being discussed. To ensure successful completion, the
                         following actions should be taken (i) ensure that construction permits are speedily delivered, (ii) works are accelerated; and (iii) counterparts funds from the various district
                         municipalities timely allocated to the project.
