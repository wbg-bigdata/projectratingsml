I. Disbursement Profile
Executive Summary

The Municipal Services Project (MSP) was approved in mid-2006 for a total project cost of €137.6 million
(and a loan of €106.2 million for 17 years with a 5-year grace period). The project aimed to assist Romania
meet the European Union environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, and improve the
quality and coverage of water and wastewater services. The project scope included: (i) a large (almost 10%
of the project) consulting services component for the preparation of regional Master Plans, covering over 5
million people in one quarter of Romania’s counties, for water supply and sanitation, feasibility studies, and
the preparation of complete application dossier for future financing by EU Grants; and (ii) physical
investment, and technical assistance for bidding documents and supervision for water and wastewater,
drainage and road surfacing in the capital city of Bucharest (54% of the total), and for sewerage, drainage
and road surfacing in Arad, an important industrial center in the north-east of the country (37% of the total).

The project was conceived during the process of Romania’s negotiations for entry into the EU (on January 1,
2007), which required the country’s compliance with the acquis communautaire, the entire body of EU
legislation. As part of the accession negotiations, Romania agreed to very ambitious targets for meeting the
relevant EU Directives in the area of environmental protection, including the Water Framework Directives
covering water and wastewater. The investment costs for Romania to meet such Directives by end-2018 was
estimated to be around €5.6 billion for water and €9.5 billion for wastewater, but only a third of such funds
were expected to be provided through EU grant funds and not all areas of the country were eligible to
receive grants (Bucharest for example does not have access to such funds). Additionally, TA grant funds
(from the EU instrument of pre-accession) for the preparation of Master Plans and a pipeline of projects for
future investments were insufficient to cover the whole territory of Romania. Considering the need for
supplemental funding, expertise, technical support and advice within a very tight time-frame, the
Government of Romania and the cities of Bucharest and Arad requested the Bank’s involvement in the
sector.

The project closed in March 2012, with an extension of nine months for the Bucharest component. In spite
of some early difficulties with the procurement of investments in both cities, due to higher than anticipated
prices, and the need for a level-one restructuring in early 2010, the project was implemented successfully
and delivered on its commitments. The project ratings, as detailed in this ICR, indicate a satisfactory
outcome and generally satisfactory implementation support. The MSP directly improved services in two
important cities, achieved the targets that were set, and had an economic benefit similar to what was
expected, and in some cases higher.

The TA component was rated highly satisfactory as it was developed swiftly and was well supervised by the
implementing agency (the Ministry of Environment, as the Managing Authority for the Operation Program -
Environment). All project applications prepared and submitted to the EU Commission were accepted,
leading to the approval of €1.1 billion funds (EU grants for more than €0.9 billion and national financing)
for water and wastewater projects in 10 Romanian counties, which are currently under various stages of
implementation, and that would directly benefit 2.4 million people. At closing, the Borrower also
reconfirmed its very positive experience with the MSP, compared to alternative sources of financing where
numerous delays and problems of quality were encountered. The Borrower was proven right in its bold
decision to borrow for TAs from the World Bank instead of waiting for future TA grant sources of funds.

For both Bucharest and Arad, the investment covered nine neighborhoods and directly benefitted
approximately 50,000 people, providing access to urban services (water, sewerage, roads, and drainage)
meeting EU standards.

The simplicity of the project concept and design, the straightforward implementation and procurement
arrangements, and the proactive supervision by the Bank’s team helped the project maintain, and in some
cases exceed, its disbursement schedule and to deliver two of the three Project components on time. Most

                                                       1
crucially, the very strong commitment towards project implementation from the Borrower and the three
project beneficiaries at all stages of project implementation ensured the successful delivery of the services
and pro-active actions to be taken when hurdles were encountered.

In summary, the Bank through this timely Project stepped into a space where there was a TA and investment
gap to fill. The Bank proved to be a trusted and reliable partner to Romania, in the politically charged
environment of pre-accession, with skepticism towards new entrants and questions about the role of the
Bank and a model of engagement in transition. It also helped transfer knowledge, especially in procurement
and supervision. Finally, the project supplemented Romania’s plan of action for entry into the EU and
meeting the EU directives, provided urban services to its citizens, and opened the space for additional EU
grant funding to be available to the country.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal and upon entry into the European Union, the Romanian water sector still suffered
from a high level of ground water contamination. This was compounded by aging water distribution network
leading to high water losses and increased operation and maintenance costs. Only approximately 52% of the
population in Romania had access to piped water supply and 35% had access to wastewater collection and
treatment, with 90% in urban and 10% in rural areas. To reach compliance with the EU quality parameter, it
was estimated that water access to piped water should reach 70% and of the wastewater collected 60%
should be adequately treated.

The Romanian National Development Plan (NDP) placed water and wastewater sector improvements high
on the agenda. The Sector Operational Program Environment (SOP-E) allocated the highest level of funding
under its Priority Axis 1 - Extension and modernization of water and wastewater systems. It also introduced
a series of key sector reforms including the establishment of regional water and wastewater system
operators, the preparation of regional master plans and priority investment programs, and the
implementation of projects to provide good water quality and improve wastewater services to meet the EU
directive.

Within this context, the Country Partnership Strategy (approved on June 13, 2006) included lending support
to comply with the EU’s environmental directives, through a project to finance investments in the water and
wastewater sector, particularly in Bucharest and Arad cities which would not be eligible for EU grants, and
to complete the Master Plans and project applications for EU funding (from EU Structural and Cohesion
grant funds) for the 11 counties (out of 41) lacking technical assistance (TA) funding from other sources.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDO), as noted in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 1, p.5) and the
Project Appraisal Document (p.3) were as follows: “to assist the Borrower/Romania to meet EU
environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, thereby improving the quality and coverage of
water and wastewater services, mainly through: (i) support of infrastructure development in the
municipalities of Bucharest and Arad to provide better water and wastewater service and improve storm
water management; and (ii) preparation of priority water and wastewater projects in eleven (11) counties.?

Key Indicators. These were: (i) improved access to water supply meeting EU standards (in Bucharest –
included: incremental benefitting population (people); and incremental water sold (in 1000m3); (ii) improved
access to sanitation meeting EU standards (in Bucharest and Arad – included: incremental benefitting
population (people); and incremental sewerage collected (in 1000m3)); (iii) proportion of the project area
protected from flooding (%) (in Bucharest and Arad); (iv) improved road surfacing (%) (in Bucharest and


                                                       2
Arad where water, sewerage, and storm water networks will be laid); and (v) Project applications prepared
for EU funding.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators. These were: (i) progress of implementation of water, sewerage,
stormwater, and road paving contracts in Bucharest and Arad (%); and (ii) progress of implementation of the
consulting contracts for the preparation in several counties by the MoEWM (%).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

As noted in the Project Paper for the restructuring approved in 2010 (p.1/p.4), there was a minor revision in
the PDO: “to assist the Borrower to meet EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector,
thereby improving the quality and coverage of water and wastewater services, mainly through: (i) support of
infrastructure development in the municipalities of Bucharest and Arad to provide better water and
wastewater service and improve stormwater management; and (ii) preparation of priority water and
wastewater projects in selected counties.? The only change was in the number of counties for the
preparation of EU applications, from “11? to “selected?. The number of applications was reduced to 10,
since TA grant funds had at the time of appraisal been identified to complete the applications for the 11th
county. Hence, in essence the “Original? and “Revised? objective were the same and there was negligible
impact on the project outcome.

The ‘adaptive’ project restructuring was necessary due to: (i) slowdown in the pace of urban development
Bucharest, especially in the new development neighborhood of Baneasa and Otopeni North, requiring a
change of focus for the project; (ii) increased civil work costs in Bucharest; (iii) the possible need to acquire
land to complete parts of the project not initially envisaged, triggering OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement);
(iv) a change in the Romanian legislation on water operators, requiring a different institutional set-up for
management of the water infrastructure financed by the project in Arad; and (v) the availability of grant
financing for one of the counties in Component 3, reducing the number of counties needing to access Loan
funds from 11 to 10.

Key Indicators. To make the project indicators more explicit and representative, the following additive
changes were made: (i) adding two indicators on “incremental water and sewerage connections? (unit= no.
of connections); (ii) changing the unit for “incremental stormwater drainage improvements? (km of drains
instead of %); and (iii) changing the unit for “improved road surfacing? (km of roads instead of %).

1
 Based on General Urban Plan for Bucharest.

1.5 Original Components

The PDOs, under the Specific Investment Lending (SIL), were to be achieved through three main
components.

Component 1: Urban Services in Bucharest Municipality (appraisal amount US$91.6 million equivalent;
actual US$128.5 million equivalent). This component included: (i) works and goods for the provision of
new urban services including water, sewerage, drainage and road surfacing in priority neighborhoods
(existing built-up area: Straulesti, Vatra Noua, Giulesti Sarbi, and Chitila Triaj; new development: Baneasa,
Otopeni North, and Odai); and (ii) technical advisory services to prepare bidding documents and for
construction supervision, and to support the Bucharest Municipality to implement the project and complete
financial audits.

Component 2: Urban Services in Arad Municipality (appraisal amount US$62.4 million equivalent;
actual US$78.3 million equivalent). This component included: (i) works and goods for the provision of new
urban services including: sewerage, drainage and road surfacing in priority neighborhoods (Bujac, Gai and
Sanicolau Mic); and (ii) technical advisory services to prepare bidding documents and for construction
supervision, and to support the Municipality of Arad (MoA) to implement the project and complete financial
audits.

Component 3: Project Preparation for the EU (appraisal amount US$16.2 million equivalent; actual
US$17.8 million equivalent). This component, implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Water
Management as Managing Authority of the SOP-E, was to provide technical advisory services in two
phases: (i) phase 1 would include data collection and the assessment of the current situation, development of
a Master Plan at the county level identifying all investment needs, carrying out a detailed feasibility study
(to include economic and financial analysis, institutional analysis, preparation of the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) studies, and a financing plans), and the preparation of application form for accessing EU
Cohesion and Structural Funds; and (ii) phase 2 would include elaboration of the complete tender dossiers
for the services, goods and works contracts required for the implementation of the selected infrastructure

                                                              4
investment programs. Institutional strengthening, including training to the MoEWM and relevant
beneficiary in the counties, and project audits were also included under Component 3.

1.6 Revised Components

Component 1: Urban Services in Bucharest Municipality (restructuring amount US$133.1 million
equivalent; actual US$128.5 million equivalent). 1 On restructuring, two changes were made: (i) remaining
funds under the Baneasa neighborhood 2 were re-allocated to all other remaining neighborhoods. 3 The loan
disbursement percentages were respectively adjusted from 65% to 83%; and (ii) the total share financed by
MoB increased from €74 million to €93 million due to rising cost of civil works. MoB agreed to bear the
additional costs.

Component 2: Urban Services in Arad Municipality (restructuring amount US$105.4 million equivalent;
actual US$78.3 million equivalent). On restructuring, two changes were made not affecting the scope of this
component: (i) changes in legislation related to the appointment of operators – the Project Agreement
required the MoA to select a water and wastewater operator through competitive bidding. However, changes
in Romanian legal framework since Project approval eliminated the rationale for this covenant. Romania
favored the creation of regional (county level) associations of municipalities charged to contract with a
regional operator. The EU approved this policy and joining such an association was made a pre-condition
for accession to EU structural funds. Arad hence joined the Inter Communal Development Association of
Arad County, which chose SC Compania de Apa SA Arad as the municipally owned regional operator.
(ii) the project cost of the component increased from €50 million to €73 million, due to changes in market
conditions between the time of the feasibility studies and actual procurement. MoA and MoPF agreed to
maintain current disbursement percentages under the project and MoA agreed to cover the remaining 100%
of project expenditures from its own sources once the Loan funding exhausts.

Component 3: Project Application for the EU (restructuring amount US$18.7 million equivalent; actual
US$17.8 million equivalent). On restructuring, 11 counties initially included under this component were
reduced to 10. The Government of Romania used funding from the Instrument for Structural Policies for
Pre-Accession (ISPA) for Galati, eliminating the need to use borrowed funds for this county. In replacement,
Vaslui County was added to the list of counties for the elaboration of master plans but not for the full
feasibility study. While the number of counties benefitting under the project did not change, only 10
complete applications for EU cohesion grants were prepared.

1.7 Other significant changes (not covered above)

    •    Projects Costs: The cost of the Project was initially estimated at US$170.6 million equivalent; on
         restructuring, the Project’s costs increased to US$257.2 million equivalent. At closing, project costs
         were US$225 million equivalent (132% of the original project costs). Such large variations were due
         both to exchange rate fluctuations and to increased costs from design stage to the time of receiving
         actual bids (mainly caused by inflationary pressures during a construction boom).


1
  Component 1, implemented by the MoB, were divided into three civil works contracts: B1 covering the Baneasa area under new
development; B2 covering already-built areas in Vatra Noua, Straulesti, Chitila Triaj, a social housing area in Odai, and Otopeni
North (investment only include bulk water supply pipes and trunk collectors); and B3 covering Giulesti Sarbi.
2
  As per common agreement, Bank financing under Contract B1 – Baneasa were first suspended (as per the letter of suspension
dated May 22, 2009) and then ceased to be available and work invoiced after June 30, 2009 became ineligible under the project. The
MoB continued to finance investments as per Project design using its own funds, as per original Project design.
3
  Investments continued in the remaining 5 neighborhoods as in actual implementation the Otopeni North residential area was
omitted from the project right after approval, at the time of approval of the bidding documents in 2007 and the trunk drainage main
was omitted in 2010. Investments in this area were considered premature and the Municipality had not secured the necessary
approval of urban plans to launch such new development. The revised components as reported in the Restructuring Paper, however
did not however explicitly mention the exclusion of Otopeni North and the revisions made during the very early years of project
implementation.

                                                                 5
     •    Financing: An IBRD commitment of US$131.7 million equivalent was approved (the Loan was
          expressed in Euro). On project restructuring this amount remained the same, but if expressed in US
          dollars it increased by almost 24% to US$153.1 million equivalent. At closing, the actual project
          disbursement was US$148.5 4 million equivalent or 113% of planned commitment. A small amount
          of US$0.12 million equivalent was cancelled at closing. 5
     •    Borrower Contribution: At appraisal the Borrower planned to contribute US$38.9 million
          equivalent. On project restructuring this was revised to US$104.1 million equivalent; whereas the
          actual contribution was US$81.8 million equivalent or 210% of planned. It should be noted that this
          large increase in Borrowers’ contribution (both for Bucharest and Arad) was due to price escalation
          and to the fact that one of the Bucharest component (Baneasa) was fully funded through the
          Municipality’s own funds after June 2009.
     •    Project Effectiveness: It was necessary to extend project effectiveness three times (to February 20,
          2007, to May 20, 2007, and to June 11, 2007 as the later date), due to delays in ratification of the
          Loan Agreement by the Romanian Parliament. Consequently, the Loan Agreement and two Project
          Agreements became effective on May 31, 2007, almost 10 months after project approval.
     •    Project Extension: The Loan closing date was extended once. The extension was processed as a
          level-two restructuring and was granted for 9 months but only for Component 1 (Urban Services in
          Bucharest Municipality), establishing March 31, 2012 as the later date. For Component 2 (Urban
          Services in Arad Municipality) and Component 3 (Project Preparation for the EU), the closing date
          remained June 30, 2011 as Loan funds had already been exhausted by the project’s original closing
          date.
     •    Restructuring: In addition to the above restructuring for closing date extension, the Board approved
          a level-one restructuring of the Project on January 28, 2010, and the Loan and Project Agreements
          were amended on February 3, 2010 to reflect these changes.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

     •    Project Design: The Project was to assist Romania meet its commitment under the EU directive in
          water and wastewater, by following a two-pronged approach: (i) support urban development through
          provision of urban services in Bucharest (water, sewerage, stormwater, and roads) and Arad
          (sewerage, stormwater, and roads); and (ii) help the country to implement priority environmental
          investment by preparing regional Master Plans and a pipeline of projects for financing through EU
          Structural and Cohesion grant funds. Alternative approaches to financing in the design of the
          Project were duly considered, including: (i) co-financing with the EU grants. This was omitted in
          view of the timing of availability of EU grants and the complexity for such financing arrangements.
          Instead, by helping prepare a good project pipeline, the Project would facilitate the absorption of EU
          funds; (ii) lending directly to the municipalities (with a sovereign guarantee). In view of the very
          heavy financing commitment for other parallel projects, the Government preferred instead to borrow
          from IBRD and on-lend to the municipalities of Bucharest and Arad at a favorable rate; and (iii)
          lending directly to the utilities. This was omitted due to Romanian Law and State Aid rules, as a
          new, competitively selected operator would have to be introduced after the assets were created in
          Arad Municipality. In the case of Bucharest, a concessionaire (Apa Nova) already existed. If Apa
          Nova used the IBRD Loan to create assets and transfer them to the municipality, the existing
          concession contract would have to be significantly amended (as the vice versa was stated in the
          contract) and that was not a feasible option for the municipality. 6

4
  This is based on actual Bank reported disbursement from the system (Client Connection), however due to exchange rate variation
this amount comes to US$143.2 million equivalent as reported in Annex 2.
5
  This small amount was from the Component 3 (Category 3 – Consultant Services of the project) not disbursed was cancelled.
6
  Currently, as per the contract Apa Nova would take on services in streets after the municipality installs the network infrastructure
and paves the street, which are activities to be carried out by the municipality under the project.

                                                                   6
    •    Lessons learnt from previous sector projects were adequately reflected in project design, mainly:
         (i) sustained political support was critical for municipal investments. This Project enjoyed very
         strong political support, at both central and local levels of government, as the investments were
         aimed at helping meet Romanian’s commitment for entry into the EU; (ii) the scale and complexity
         of the Project reflects the capacity of the implementing agencies. In the last decade, both the
         municipalities of Bucharest and Arad had strengthened their institutional capacity and implemented
         externally financed projects including those financed by the EU pre-accession funds (such as ISPA).
         MoEWM has also gained sufficient program and project management experience through
         programming and use of EU funds; (iii) lack of prepared projects were a major bottleneck to
         successfully absorb EU grants. Under the Project, Component 3 was specifically designed to adopt
         a country-wide approach of preparing a project pipeline for small towns and settlements to be
         financed under the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.
    •    Risks: Risks were generally adequately identified and mitigated, including: (i) municipalities may
         not have adequate resources to meet their financial commitments under the project; (ii) delays in
         selecting an operator in Arad could hamper services through assets created under the Project;
         (iii) the exchange rate risk could impact the municipalities’ financial positions; (iv) delays in project
         implementation due to procurement delays; and (v) development in the new urban districts (Baneasa
         and Otopeni) is slower than estimated by the Bucharest municipality. However, the risk of land
         acquisition was not sufficiently assessed during project preparation especially in a situation where
         construction would occur in densely populated areas or in new private development where scope of
         the pre-existing project conditions was limited. Associated risk that may possibly cause project
         delays were also not fully mitigated, related to: design not responding appropriately to site
         conditions, resulting in the need for lots of variation orders which were difficult to accommodate
         within the type of contracts awarded; delays in the delivery of construction permits; and problems of
         communication and strategic priorities among the different District authorities in Bucharest
         Municipality.
    •    Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA): No QEA of the project was carried out by the Quality
         Assurance Group (QAG) for this project.

2.2 Implementation

    •    Implementation Arrangement: The Borrower of the Loan was Romania, represented by MoPF, and
         the Project was implemented by three entities: MoB, MoA, and MoEWM (now MoEF). There was a
         Loan Agreement (LA) for all three project components. For Components 1 and 2, Project
         Agreements were also in place between IBRD and the two municipalities, in addition to Subsidiary
         Loan Agreements between MoPF and MoA/MoB. For Component 3, implemented by MoEWM, the
         General Directorate for Management of Structural Instruments (the Managing Authority of SOP-E)
         was responsible for programming, authorizing payments for the EU Structural and Cohesion funds
         for the environmental sector. The Government and the Bank coordinated the activities of this Project
         with the European Commission, both during design and implementation.
    •    Supervision: Project implementation spanned 5 years (6 years from project approval) and included
         approximately 12 implementation support missions, 7 with an average of two to three missions
         yearly. The task team leader (TTL) was based regionally in the initial and final years of the Project,
         with four TTL transitions over the life of the project, and country-level staff dealing with day-to-day
         issues. Mission reporting (aide memoires) were sufficiently detailed and the follow-up was diligent.
         The Project dealt with several implementation hurdles, mainly: (i) project effectiveness delayed by
         10 months. This created some problems in the early days of the Bank’s implementation support as
         the PIUs had to carry out substantial preparatory work in the absence of project engineer consultants
         (to prepare the bidding documents and carry out early procurement actions). Implementation delays
         were minimal, but quality of documentation suffered from this; (ii) by early 2008, all works and

7
 Actual implementation period was approximately 4 years for Components 2 and 3, whereas 5 years for Component 1, as the Project
encountered effectiveness delays, it was only in the middle of 2007 that project implementation started.

                                                              7
        consulting contract were signed, but with some initial procurement lag. Construction would begin
        after almost 20 months from project approval (also due to the inability to build in winters); (iii) in
        late 2008, the possibility to acquire land in Bucharest (for Contracts B1, B2 and B3) manifested
        itself, where proposed technical solutions for some works required non-public land, impacting the
        project timeline; (iv) in early 2010, the project was restructured, OP 4.12 was triggered, and a Land
        Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF) for the project was put in place; (v) the temporary
        suspension of a contract (Contract B1- Baneasa) in Bucharest caused delays, also because this had to
        be fully financed by the budget of the main Municipality. Numerous design revisions were needed
        to seek new technical solutions and adapt the design to site conditions, and there were recurrent
        counterpart funding delays from Sector 1 Municipality and delays in receiving construction permits;
        and (vi) in Arad, neighborhood of Gai (Contract A1) accumulated delays in works execution due to
        poor performance of the sub-contractors and the lack of decisive actions by the Municipality on the
        poorly performing contractor early on during project implementation.
    •   Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR and fact-finding mission took place during April 13-24, 2009
        followed by financial management review from May 3-17, 2009. Critical decisions at the end of the
        MTR were: (i) project restructuring was needed to address instance of non-compliance or potential
        non-compliance in the Project and Loan Agreements, and lifting the suspension for the Baneasa
        component (the MoPF formally requested to proceed with restructuring on August 11, 2009); (ii) the
        proposed changes in disbursement percentages will not modify funding allocated to MoB but only
        affect how funds are allocated to each contract; and (iii) managing risk posed by land acquisition
        and permit issuance would require very tight project management from both MoB and MoA to
        remain within the agreed timeline.
    •   Project Changes/Restructuring: The project was restructured in 2010 as fully described above. The
        proposed changes only marginally affected the project’s development objective, not requiring
        change in monitoring mechanism or outcome indicators. However, target values were modified for
        Components 1 and 3 as a result. A level-two restructuring was processed to extend the Loan closing
        date for nine months to March 31, 2012 for Component 1 (Urban Services in Bucharest
        Municipality).
    •   Projects Risk Status: On restructuring the risks and benefits were adequately revisited, to reassess
        the benefits, delays, counterpart funding, and procurement under the Project. It was concluded that
        restructuring would shift the Bank’s financing to poorer areas in Bucharest that would have a higher
        social and economic impact, mitigating the risk of the Project not achieving its PDO and not
        meeting the Bank’s safeguard policies. Delays due to possible land acquisition and expropriations
        may have the potential to cause slippage in the completion date, but the properties that may be
        affected were expected to be few. MoB had experience in these matters and had a specialized office
        to manage land acquisition.
    •   In hindsight, in spite of the above problems and changes, project implementation progressed well as
        the PIUs and their consultants, in conjunction with the Bank, took adequate and timely actions
        during implementation. Component 3 was completed ahead of the Project closing date and there was
        stellar disbursement schedule. As a result the project produced satisfactory outcomes.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design: The M&E design depended upon the use of project progress reports to monitor and evaluate
progress based on the parameter of the Results Framework of the Project, which were fairly simple and clear.
There was no Project Operational Manual and no centralized PIU. In addition project progress reports were
to be prepared semi-annually by the three implementing agencies – Bucharest Municipality, Arad
Municipality, and the MoEWM – and submitted in a consolidated manner by MoEWM to the MoPF for
transmittal to the Bank. On restructuring, nothing significantly changed other than introducing additional
indicators and clarifying measures to the Results Framework. The target values for Bucharest were revised
but despite changes in design, target values were not changed for Arad.



                                                      8
M&E Implementation: M&E in implementation materialized differently from its design. Reporting was not
as straightforward as the Project comprised of three standalone components which operated independently.
MoEWM (a separate unit from the one responsible for Component 3) was tasked to prepare the consolidated
Project reports. However, such unit had limited knowledge of the project and no power to enforce deadlines
or specific quality standards on the respective PIUs. As a result, in the early years of implementation such
reports were prepared late and were of mixed quality. Later, the Bank received numerous reports (at times
too many, including engineering reports). Lack of timely reporting submitted to the Bank created delays in
the Bank’s ability to anticipate problems and deal with delays. Towards the end of the Project M&E
reporting improved but the monitoring of outcome indicators remained weak. Overall, the quality of data
reported by the supervision engineers to the PIUs was reliable, and disaggregated data by each neighborhood
was easily available.

M&E Utilization: The Project comprised of simple indicators and the M&E was effectively deployed and
utilized by the Bank to monitor project progress. It was through intermediate project indicators that the Bank
realized about pre-existing works in the new development area of Baneasa in Bucharest. However, limited
attention was paid to project indicators monitoring, despite requests by the Bank’s missions. It was only at
the end of the Project that it became apparent that based on the data provided by the contracting engineer the
target values in Arad were not fully met.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguards

Environment: The Project was classified as Category B (Partial Assessment) at appraisal since the
investments were related to civil works without significant impact to the environment. The Project was
selected for piloting the Use of Country Systems (UCS) under the Bank’s OP/BP 4.00 to address
environmental and social safeguards in Bank-supported projects. The Safeguard Diagnostic Review (SDR)
confirmed that there were no gaps between the national legislation and Bank Policy in equivalency and
acceptability (thus conforming to OP 4.00). Hence, the scope of country system adopted was limited to
environmental assessment and physical cultural resources policies applicable to the three (3) project
components. Project supervision of UCS was adequate. The Bank also proactively reviewed the safeguard
compliance of the UCS in line with the SDR’s recommendations during implementation. In Bucharest, some
health and safety lapses were observed by the Bank on work sites; following notification to the engineer,the
contractor remedied the situation quickly. In both, Arad and Bucharest, a designated person in charge of
safety and environment protection activities was appointed according to the site environmental management
plan (EMP) provisions, who was adequately trained and fully aware of the environmental management plans
and the related mitigations measures. In most of the works contracts, the performance of the contractors on
UCS compliance was satisfactory, also as a result of the permanent involvement of the PIUs and its
engineers in supervision of contracts implementation. Under Component 3, Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) studies conforming to the EU and Romanian legislation and equivalent to the Bank’s
OP 4.01 were prepared for each project application. All EIA Reports were reviewed and approved by
MoEWM and the EU Commission. The EIAs demonstrated that the proposed sub-projects would contribute
to the fulfillment of Romania’s commitments under its Accession Treaty. Overall, the Use of Country
Systems in Romania during the implementation of Municipal Services Project is considered Satisfactory and
in accordance with the findings of the acceptability assessment.

The UCS did not cover the Bank’s policy on International Waterways (OP 7.50) which was triggered due to
its application of stormwater discharge in Bucharest and Arad.8 The compliance with this Bank’s policy was
considered as Satisfactory since Romania met its requirement in terms of notifying the riparian countries

8
 In Bucharest, the stormwater would discharge into Dambovita River, a tributary of Arges River that flows directly into the Danube
River – an international waterway. In Arad, the stormwater would discharge into the Mures River that flows cross-border to Hungary
and then into the Tisa River, another tributary of the Danube River.

                                                                9
through the International Commission for Protection of the Danube River for the Bucharest and Arad
components. For the technical assistance component of the Project, the Project falls under the exception to
the notification requirement. Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) were included under the UCS and the
Romanian systems were considered equivalent to that of the Bank and appropriate for application, if needed.
During project implementation, no construction or rehabilitation near historic buildings and sites of cultural
significance were undertaken, and no “chance finds? were encountered.

Social: At appraisal Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) was not trigged for two reasons: (i) no involuntary
resettlement was envisaged under the Project; 9 and (ii) based on the assessment by the municipalities
(confirmed in the Project Agreements) that all construction would take place on public land. However, in the
later part of 2008, two issues arose related to: (i) land ownership/land acquisition; 10 and (ii) resettlement,
resulting in non-compliance or potential non-compliance with Loan and Project Agreements’ covenants. 11
This issue was dealt with through project restructuring, and the Loan and Project Agreements were amended
to replace the covenant forbidding resettlement by a commitment to apply a Land Acquisition Policy
Framework (LAPF), annexed to the agreement and compliant with the safeguards on resettlements (OP
4.12) which was triggered. However, none of the technical solutions adopted after project restructuring
ultimately required land acquisition.

In retrospect, as the scope of planned project works at inception entailed both new urban developments and
existing built-up areas; and the Romania Safeguard Diagnostic Review (2006) highlighted that experience
on rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure increased the incidence of expropriation,OP 4.12 should
have been triggered at appraisal as a precautionary measure.

(b) Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement: Overall rating of procurement during the project cycle is Satisfactory. The Borrower, at
appraisal, had already developed a procurement plan for project implementation for all components. The
overall project risk for procurement was rated High due to limited experience in implementing large works
contracts, for which the Bank would provide necessary support to municipalities and would conduct prior
review of most contracts (above €4 million); and careful planning would be required to implement the
project in a timely manner, for which consultants will be hired to support the municipalities. By the end of
2008 all contracts under the project had been signed.

In early 2009, a procurement issue was flagged regarding MoB’s compliance with the procurement
covenants of the Project Agreement, based on a report that some pre-existing work (14%-19%) included in
the scope of Contract B1 had already been executed prior to August 2007, when Contract B1 physically
started. Although these works were paid by the Baneasa private developer (BISA) and executed mostly in
2005-06, i.e. before inviting bids for Contract B1, the concern arose from the fact that such works may have
been known to the bidder, hence potentially giving an unduly advantage. This raised concerns and the
Bank’s Operation Procurement Review Committee (OPRC) suggested that the Bank’s team hire independent
auditors for the determination of the possible impact of these pre-existing works on the bidding process. The
Bank suspended funding under Contract B1 (Baneasa) and a forensic audit of such contract pursuant to
Section 5.11 of the General Conditions and 1.15 of the General Conditions of Contract B1 was hence carried


9
  According to the Safeguard Diagnostic Review (2006), on assessment it was decided not to include Involuntary Resettlement in
the pilot for UCS. If needed, the Bank guidelines on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) would apply. During preparation it was
also expected that the MSP might trigger this safeguard, but following further analysis by the Regional Safeguards Advisor it was
concluded that triggering this safeguard policy was not necessary.
10
   Due to changes in technical design, Baneasa (Contract B1) required privately owned land for a wastewater pumping station, an
underground pipe linking the sewerage collector and for a drainage pipe; two areas in Straulesti (Contract B2) were at risk of
requiring expropriation, and in Giulesti (Contract B3), private land was needed for rainwater pre-treatment plant.
11
   Private developer for Baneasa (BISA) confirmed that 34 families, formerly renting housing from the University of Agronomical
Sciences, were still living on the Baneasa farm site when this land was transferred to BISA. These families were provided monetary
compensation on their eviction according to Romanian requirement, which the Bank’s internal review also assessed to be adequate.

                                                               10
out. The final results of such Forensic Procurement Review Audit became available in 2011 and indicated
that the existence of previously executed works did not seem to have influenced the results of the
procurement process nor led to any irregular payments.

While the Bank’s initiative to carry out such review was commendable, it took a very long time for the Bank
internally to clear all steps for carrying out such review. It may have been more appropriate and effective for
the Bank’s procurement experts to carry out a review rather than contracting this out to auditor/ consultants
with poor knowledge of the Bank’s policies. The client also was forced in the meantime to finance the sub-
component fully from its own budget.

Financial Management: Overall, Financial Management (FM) for the project of all the three (3)
components is rated as Satisfactory. This includes project accounting and reporting arrangements, staffing,
internal control procedures, planning and budgeting, counterpart funding, financial manual and external
audits. The accounting software used by the PIUs had adequate security levels and its outputs were used to
prepare semi-annually the un-audited interim financial reports (IFRs) of the Project. The audit reports for the
Project have been submitted on time with one incidence of delay (in 2008 when submission of Component 1
(MoB) audit report for 2007 was delayed by 9 months as the auditors were not in place). The audit opinion
was clean and no management letter points have been mentioned. During implementation, the Project
underwent FM review supervision missions at least once a year, if not twice from 2008 onwards. The
responses on agreed actions by the PIUs have also been satisfactory. The FM assessment of counterpart
funding rating for the Bucharest component was generally considered Moderately Satisfactory, due to
recurrent delays for the main Municipality of Bucharest to receive financial contributions from Sector 1. No
other components of the Project encountered problems. The final interim financial reports and FY2011 audit
reports for the Project were submitted to the World Bank and were accepted. The FY2012 audit report for
Component 1 - Bucharest (covering the final MoB project transactions, as this component closed on
March 31, 2012) is expected to be submitted by its due date of June 30, 2013.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Urban Services of Bucharest Municipality. The Project covered Phase 1 of the Municipality of
Bucharest’s program for extension, rehabilitation, and modernization of the water supply, sewerage, storm
water services and associated roads in two districts (called Sectors) out of six. The assets created as a result
of the project are being handed over as follows: the utilities networks to Apa Nova (the Municipality water
concessionaire would be responsible for improving reliability of service, safety, durability, minimizing
physical and hydraulic losses, minimizing leakages, allowing maximum usage of mechanical works and
minimizing the manual intervention, and high level of environmental safety); and roads to the City Councils
of Sector 1, Sector 6 and MoB – Streets Administration. During implementation necessary modifications
were made to allow the operator to use updated monitoring system (remote control, SCADA etc.).

Urban Services of Arad Municipality. The asset created under this component are transferred to the
Regional Operator (SC Compania Apa SA Arad) who is responsible for providing service to the targeted
neighborhoods with safety, durability, minimizing physical and hydraulic losses, minimizing leakages,
allowing maximum usage of mechanical works and minimizing the manual intervention and high level of
environmental safety. The project also included the commissioning of a SCADA system, which would allow
the Operator to apply updated monitoring systems.

Project Application to the EU Component. All project applications (including master plans, feasibility
studies and elaborated tender dossier) prepared were approved by the EU. They resulted in financing for
approximately US$1.4 billion equivalent (approximately €1.1 billion) of which about 85% would be
received from EU budget as grants and 15% from state and local budgets. All nine contracts (covering the
10 counties for which applications were prepared) are under implementation (initiated between March 2010
and September 2011). The Regional Water Companies (project implementer) are responsible for
implementation. and for operation and management of the assets.

                                                       11
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Original/Revised Objectives. The relevance of the original objective was Highly Satisfactory.
The project would finance investments and studies/ TAs to help the country meet requirements for key EU
Environment Directives, in so doing showing the country’s readiness to be a full member of the European
Union and averting possible sanctions (from future infringement procedures from the EU Commission) from
non-compliance. The Project’s objectives were consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2009-2013 and directly responded to CPS Pillar 2: Growth and Competitiveness through the Energy
and Environment Objective. In the immediate, the project was helping improve water and sewerage access
issues in the Romania’s capital city of Bucharest and Arad, where about 90% of the city population of
190,000 did not have access to sewerage networks. The Project would also support the development of
stormwater drainage and road re-surfacing to reduce flooding in both cities. At restructuring, the revised
objective was essentially the same as the original objective, and continued to remain highly relevant. Both
original and revised objectives were highly relevant to the country context and sector demands, and rated as
Highly Satisfactory.

Relevance of Original/Revised Design. The relevance of design was logical and highly relevant, and it is
rated as Highly Satisfactory. The project design adopted a two-prong approach of expanding infrastructure
coverage through: (i) physical infrastructure investment in Bucharest and Arad (municipalities identified by
the Government as high priority for investments, and not eligible for EU grant financing); and (ii) securing
EU grant financing for prepared pipeline of infrastructure investments at county level in Romania. Each of
the three components could have easily been three stand-alone projects. However, keeping the Project
together allowed for synergies, savings, and demonstration effect by the Bank during project implementation.
The results chain for the project was well defined. The results framework corresponded clearly to the PDO
translating into respective outputs and outcomes. Although water quality could not be an indicator of the
results framework, as Romanian legislation regarding private operators places the responsibility to supply
and monitor water quality to the operators, achieving satisfactory quality is part of the operator mandate
once assets built under the project are handed over to them. Also, the scope of the Project was in creating the
physical infrastructure assets and securing funding for infrastructure finance and not in service provision.
The relevance of the design did not change after restructuring and remained highly relevant. The results
framework was modified and elaborated which added more clarity to the outputs/outcomes to be
accomplished under the Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project underwent “adaptive? restructuring during implementation and the changes of the PDO were
minimal. The project achievement is hence being assessed on the original/revised PDO. Rating is defined as
“before? and “after? the project. The PDO consists of two parts: (i) investments in urban service meeting EU
standards in Bucharest and Arad, and (ii) technical assistance to secure EU grant financing for investments.

Original Objectives – Moderately Satisfactory.

Prior to restructuring, both the progress towards achievement of the PDO and project implementation
progress (IP) were rated Moderately Satisfactory implying that the Project was progressing well and would
be able to accomplish the development objective by project closing. PDO Part 1: at the time of restructuring
the implementation progress of Components 1 and 2 were at 30% and 39% respectively. PDO Part 2: at the
time of restructuring the progress of Component 3 was at 45%. The Project was progressing toward
completion of project applications for EU funding for Braila, Vrancea, Ilfov, Ialomita, Constanta, Galati,
Bistrita-Nasaud, Arad, Sibiu, Mehediniti, and Dolj counties (for details, see Annex 2).



                                                     12
Revised Objectives – Satisfactory.

(i) To meet the EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, thereby improving the
quality and coverage of water and wastewater services through support of infrastructure development in the
municipalities of Bucharest and Arad to provide better water and wastewater service and improve
stormwater management – Satisfactory.

All infrastructure created was of good quality. In Bucharest 23.4 km of water mains, 51.2 km of water
distribution network, 24 km of sewerage mains, 17 km of sewerage and storm water network (unitary
system), 2 pumping station for unitary sewerage network, 3 wastewater pumping stations, 3 pre-treatment
installation for stormwater, and 1 pumping station with pre-treatment installation for drinking water were
built. In Arad, 89.5 km of sewerage mains, 10 wastewater pumping stations and 6 pumping stations with
pre-treatment installation for stormwater were also built.

Outcomes:
   • Beneficiary population – Infrastructure investments in both Bucharest and Arad connected nine
      neighborhoods to water, wastewater, and drainage networks meeting EU standards and benefitted
      almost 50,000 people; directly impacting their quality of lives, well-being, and health. In Bucharest,
      overall the project provided improved access to water supply meeting EU standards for 27,105
      people, against a target of 24,449 in the six (6) targeted neighborhoods (111% of the target value)
      was met. This is a conservative estimate of beneficiary population as the number of household
      connected for new development (mainly in Baneasa and Odai) were made up of multi-story housing
      complex and counted as one connection to a property. In Arad, overall the Project provided
      improved access to sewerage meeting EU standards for 22,331 people, against a target of 23,238, or
      96% of the target value.
   • Incremental water sold and sewerage collected – In Bucharest, the target value of incremental water
      sold, based on system design was fully met, 1,254 m3 against a target 1,249 m3, or 100%. The target
      value of sewerage collected, based on system design was also fully met, 1,128 m3 against a target
      1,124 m3, or 100%. In Arad, as a result of the project, the target value of incremental sewerage
      collected, based on system design was also fully met, 1,746 m3 against a target 1,746 m3, or 100%.
   • Accrued health and other benefits – Although this benefit cannot be quantified, accrued health
      benefits to the communities in both Arad and Bucharest provided with better access to urban
      services meeting EU standards must be significant. In addition, the better roads infrastructure
      improved the overall outlook of the neighborhoods, attracting investment in real estate thereby
      increasing the demand and property values in these neighborhoods, provided better access, and
      reduced incidence of flooding due to improved drainage system and paved roads.

(ii) To meet the EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, thereby improving the
quality and coverage of water and wastewater services through preparation of priority water and wastewater
projects in selected counties – Highly Satisfactory

Outputs:
   • Ten (10) Romanian counties (Braila, Vrancea, Ilfov, Ialomita, Constanta, Bistrita-Nasaud, Arad,
       Sibiu-Brasov, Bihor, and Dolj) received EU grant financing. Project output results are represented
       by the deliverables prepared under the TA: Master Plans, Feasibility Study, tender document, EU
       financing application, etc.
   • Through the approved applications the Project was able to leverage approximately €1.1 billion
       (comprising of 85% from EU grants and 15% from state and local budgets) for infrastructure
       investments. Based on a project component worth €13 million (€11 million IBRD Loan and €2
       million Borrower’s contribution), MoEWM was able to leverage about €900 million EU grants
       (representing 30% of the total budget of €2.8 billion allocated for Priority Axis 1 of SOP
       Environment).

Other outputs included: (i) definition of a long-term phased investment program for water and wastewater
sector, though Master Plans covering 2007-37; (ii) high quality preparatory measures (measurements, site
investigations etc.) for elaboration of the preliminary design of planned works; (iii) environmentally sound
water projects through preparation of EIAs; (iv) well-prepared tender documents and procurement strategy;
and (v) increased programming and implementation capacity of projects at central and local level.



                                                     14
Outcomes: The main outcomes stemming from the implementation of projects in the ten counties of
Romania would be:
   • Additional population connected to basic water services in the 10 counties expected to be
      approximately 237,000 inhabitants by 2015;
   • Additional population benefitting from wastewater collection and treatment services expected to be
      approximately 512,000 inhabitants by 2015;
   • Indirect benefit to the total population of 2.4 million in the 10 counties of Romania;
   • Eventually increasing the water and wastewater connection rate meeting EU standards from 80% to
      99%, and 63% to 96% respectively, implying an average increase of 19% for water and 36% for
      wastewater connections in the 10 counties;
   • Number of localities targeted for new/rehabilitated water and wastewater facilities in a regional
      management system for the 10 counties is expected to be 102 against the SOP Environment target of
      300, or 37% of the 2015 target value; and
   • Wastewater treatment plants built or rehabilitated is expected to be 45 in the 10 counties of Romania
      against the SOP Environment target of 200, or 23% of the 2015 target value for the whole country.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Economic rates of return were estimated ex-ante and ex-post. The ex-ante (PAD, p. 13) assessed the cost
benefit analysis (CBA) independently of two project components – water and wastewater works in
Bucharest (for both existing and new developments) and wastewater works in Arad. The stormwater
component was not included in the cost benefit analysis. For these components, the benefits included in the
CBA were: (i) incremental water and wastewater revenues, as a proxy for benefits of piped water services
(convenience, better quality), and the benefits of having a sewerage system (and discontinuing the use of
septic tanks), respectively, and (ii) incremental property tax revenues to reflect increase in the value of
property and land where the infrastructure will be upgraded. The main costs used in calculating the
economic rate of return (ERR) on investments were: (i) the cost of building the water supply and wastewater
infrastructure; (ii) operational and maintenance costs, and (iii) in the case of new developments in Bucharest,
the cost of the distribution network. Based on this, the ex-ante ERR for existing areas in Bucharest
(including Straulesti, Vatra Noua, Giulesti Sarbi and Chitila Triaj) for water and sewerage was 12.3%; while
for new development areas (Baneasa, Otopeni North and Odai districts) was 9.4%. The ex-ante ERR for
Arad (including neighborhoods of Bujac, Gai, and Sanicolau Mic) for sewerage was 6.2%. No sensitivity
analysis was undertaken to assess the robustness of the model.

At appraisal, it was conceived that road paving in Arad would be financed if the investment showed a
satisfactory economic rate of return (ERR) on an assessment done during implementation based on the
Bank’s Roads Economic Decision (RED) model, taking into account the traffic and condition of unpaved
roads in dry and wet seasons, vehicle speed, types of paving and accident rates. According to the ex-ante
RED model, the ERR on investments for roads in Arad was 21%. This exercise was not carried out for
Bucharest either at appraisal or completion and per-hectare ERR estimates from the RED exercise for Arad
are assumed to obtain crude assessment for roads investment in Bucharest.

The scope of work was mostly unchanged during implementation, other than in Otopeni North where
anticipated water and wastewater works was canceled, 12 and in Vatra Noua (an existing development in
Bucharest) where two new streets were built because of housing development between the initial design and
actual project implementation, requiring additional population to be connected to the water and wastewater
services. The full stock-taking of Otopeni North and Vatra Noua at the restructuring stage was not

   Water and wastewater works was canceled in Otopeni North in 2007. Experience in Bucharest had shown that this large new
development would take a much longer time to realize. In view of the much higher bid received under the other project components,
which were considered to have a higher and shorter term impact and the fact that this development had not been included in the new
city spatial development plan, this component was therefore omitted.

                                                               15
undertaken and the Project Paper (p.8) for the 2010 restructuring did not indicate major modifications of the
project economic impact, except for a small reduction in expected outcomes in Bucharest attributable to
changed economic conditions and resulting in slower pace of urban development in the Baneasa area.

necessary comparison. The overall ERR for Arad and Bucharest (existing developments) is more than 20%.
A further breakdown by component (namely, water, wastewater and roads) shows that in Arad the returns on
investments in sewerage and roads has been positive (12.9% for sewerage and 19% for roads) – exceeding
baseline expectations. Similarly, in the existing developments of Bucharest where the project was active,
investments in water, wastewater and roads yield an ex-post ERR of around 26% (15.7% for water and
wastewater and 10% for roads). In new developments in Bucharest, the scope of the project was narrowed
during implementation, and according to CBA at completion, the investments in roads, water and
wastewater investments in Baneasa and Odai are expected to yield significant material gains in the longer
run (16.1%).

For investments in both Arad and Bucharest, the ex-post ERR(s) remain acceptable under a wide range of
scenarios. It must be noted that the methodology used in both ex-ante and ex-post analyses gives the lower-
bound of the benefits of the water and wastewater investments made by the project. This is because
important environmental benefits (reduction of pollution risks, improving of the public health, reduction of
leakage in the wastewater system, elimination of flooding risks, reduction of energy consumption, etc.) have
not been quantified owing to the lack of data and complexity of modeling these effects.

Based on above narrative, it can be concluded that efficiency was high for the project and that the
investments were effectively targeted towards meeting the EU directive on water and wastewater in
Romania. Additionally, other factors that contributed to support the strong efficiency of the project are as
follows: (i) tariffs increments in both Arad and Bucharest; (ii) target values, in most indicators, were fully


                                                                16
achieved; (iii) investment of €13 million for Component 3 was able to leverage approximately €1.1 billion
financing for infrastructure investment for future infrastructure projects in Romania.

Overall efficiency is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was highly successful in achieving its project development objective of supporting Romania
meet the EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector through Technical Assistance and
investments. The biggest project accomplishment was the substantial leveraging effect in securing EU grant
financing. In addition the Project successfully provided access to urban services, such as water, wastewater,
drainage and roads to nine (two green fields and seven existing development) priority neighborhoods in
Bucharest and Arad, cumulatively benefitting almost 50,000 people. Additionally, the Project stayed on
track with disbursement (no small achievement in Romania as the Bank’s project portfolio is plagued by
slow disbursing projects), successfully piloted the UCS, and benefitted from strong municipality ownership.
These are proxies of a successful project, making significant impact (for photographs see Annex 10).

Relevance of the original objectives and design is rated as Highly Satisfactory. Efficacy is rated Moderately
Satisfactory before restructuring because the project was making slow progression towards achieving the
PDO. Overall, efficiency is rated as Highly Satisfactory. As a result, Original Project Outcome is rated as
Satisfactory. Relevance of the revised objectives and design is rated as Highly Satisfactory. Revised Efficacy
is rated Highly Satisfactory. Overall, Efficiency is rated Highly Satisfactory. As a result, Revised Project
Outcome is rated Highly Satisfactory. According to the Bank’s ICR guidelines, based on the harmonized
rating, a restructured project is weighted according to the Loan that was disbursed before and after
restructuring. Before restructuring, the Project had disbursed US$89.25 million, or 60% of the US$148.48
million, whereas US$59.23 million or 40% were disbursed after restructuring, bringing the weights to 3.0
and 2.4, respectively (as can be seen from the table below). Therefore, the combined outcome of 5.4 results
in ‘Satisfactory’ overall outcome rating for the project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project delivered on significant social benefits due to increased coverage of basic service of water and
wastewater, in line with the urban development plans of Bucharest and Arad. The infrastructure
development also supported industrial growth in Arad, directly impacting livelihoods. Stormwater drainage
would reduce incidence of flooding in both Bucharest and Arad. In the neighborhood of Odai in Bucharest,
a new development planned for social housing, the Project provided 21 connections of water and wastewater
to social housing projects comprising of multi-story buildings, in addition to roads and drainage facilities. In
Bucharest, the neighborhood of Straulesti mostly houses Roma population (Romania's most socially and
economically disadvantaged minority) to which the Project provided upgraded urban service which directly
impacted the quality of their lives, indirectly increasing access to economic opportunity and poverty
reduction.


                                                      17
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

During implementation of Component 3, the staff of the MoEWM gained extensive experience in project
cycle, and were involved in the preparation and implementation of large infrastructure projects from
procurement, contract management etc. These capacity gains were effectively utilized during SOP-E
implementation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No beneficiary survey was undertaken for the project at closing. A reconnaissance stakeholder survey was
undertaken during the ICR mission of all three implementing agencies and some of the main findings are as
follows (more details provided in Annex 6):

Component 1: Bucharest Urban Services. According to the Bucharest PIU, several issues were
encountered during implementation, mainly: (i) lengthy administrative procedure to obtain construction
permits; (ii) difference in land ownership regime between the time of feasibility study and start of work;
(iii) poor response from other utilities/administrators during construction, interfering with the work
schedule; and (iv) unsatisfactory cooperation with District 1 with respect to project objectives, construction
permits, and the availability of the counterpart financing. The original technical design was poorly adapted
to the modern environmental requirements and existing site situation (land ownership, rapid development of
the areas, outdated or lack of PUZ), creating the need for numerous design modifications and time extension
for project completion. The biggest lesson learnt for the PIU seemed to be that good design and improved
city management, coupled with cooperation with other operators, is critical when dealing with such complex
project and to stay within time and budget constraints. The Project resulted in sufficient technical capacity
transfer. The biggest accomplishment during project implementation was that the PIU has obtained valuable
experience and expertise on managing projects of such complexity.

Component 2: Arad Urban Services. According to the Arad PIU, issues under this component were as
follows: (i) Procurement: The prequalification for works procurement had to be cancelled, due to a small
number of substantially responsive bids. Hence, a second tender procedure, without prequalification, was
carried out, resulting in three works contracts awarded separately (with a separate lead contractor) for each
district. One of the JVs included three local and two foreign contractors and the Contractors proved to have
little experience and insufficient human and material resources for the tasks and the two foreign companies
played no role in the project implementation; and (ii) Design: Due to insufficiently developed design,
redesign was often necessary during works implementation. Roads and sewerage design was not based on
the actual situation on site and the existing groundwater level led to higher costs than initially estimated by
the contractor. Aspects such as underground utilities and high groundwater level should have been known at
the time of design. The biggest learning of project implementation was that in managing big works the
municipality and the Engineer should pay special attention from the very beginning to time schedule and
quality of the works and impose strict rules on the Contractor. The municipality is of the opinion that there
was insufficient technical capacity transfer during implementation. The biggest accomplishment of the
project was connecting a large number of houses to quality sewerage services and the overall physical
improvement of the three districts.

Component 3 – Project preparation for the EU. The main problems identified under this component
were the large number of actors involved, including: (i) a large number of local authorities was required to
establish and manage a common strategy for unanimous decision for each project; (ii) national legislation
amendments in order to establish clear institutional framework of the regional projects; (iii) data collection
for the preparation of the projects; and (iv) revised national legislation on public procurement, which
triggered delays in implementation. The biggest project design problem was attributed to lumping five
project applications under one contract, which entailed a higher risk factor. The risk could have been
minimized by using a larger number of contracts covering less application under each contract. This may
have led to faster implementation. The PIU stressed that their biggest learning was applying the Bankrules

                                                      18
for procurement of consulting services and contract management, instead of national rules, allowing faster,
clearer and transparent procedures. The project facilitated sufficient technical knowledge transfer regarding
procurement procedures and contract management. The main accomplishment of the component was the
approval by the EU Commission of all the applications developed under this project and using €13 million
to leverage a financing in the amount of €1.1 billion for major infrastructure investment in water and
wastewater.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible

At project closing the majority of the infrastructure investment was complete and the assets created were of
good quality. 13 Risk to development outcome is rated Low or Negligible for four main reasons: (i) the
Project is protected by the Romanian legislation and the national regulatory regime in place regarding the
water operators’ in Romania, specifically Apa Nova in Bucharest and SC Compania de Apa SA Arad.
Experience in Romania shows that practically all users will connect to the sewerage network, if available, to
reduce the maintenance costs of septic tanks and because sewerage services are billed by operators even if
the user chooses not to connect; (ii) the sustainability of the investments under the project is highly likely,
since the Project supports basic services such as water supply, sewerage, and drainage, of which the water
and sewerage are subject to specific EU performance standards and monitoring; (iii) tariff increases were
observed from 2006-11 in the range of 74% for sewerage in Arad (from €0.34 to €0.59), and 53% for water
and sewerage combined tariff in Bucharest (from €0.68 to €1.04) to meet the EU directive and level of
service requirement; and (iv) the objective to meet the EU directive in water and wastewater would drive the
implementation of the project pipeline prepared under Component 3 (utilizing the €1.1 billion leveraged),
including to avoid penalties from the Commission for non-compliance after 2015.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance during preparation is rated Satisfactory. The project adequately responded to the
sector and country demands with the objective to help Romania meet the EU water and wastewater
directives. The scope of project design was simple and straightforward, even though it comprised three
independent and standalone components, and adequately assessed and responded to the country capacity.
The results framework for the project was simple and explicit, and the target values were established. The
procurement and implementation plans were clear and consistent, and in spite of delays encountered,
disbursement projections were maintained. The risk of land expropriation under the Project, though
thoroughly assessed by senior level experts in the Bank, was not fully covered under the adopted use of
country systems (UCS), especially in view of investments to be made in new and existing development in
Bucharest. The Bank demonstrated somewhat weak judgment (with reasons) in not triggering OP 4.12, and
putting LAPF in place at appraisal, especially in view of higher reported incidence of expropriation in the
country for rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure at the local level.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance during implementation is rated Satisfactory. The project supervision was adequate,
and provided the necessary hand holding, when necessary, during implementation. Although project
supervision was challenged on many fronts, the Bank responded proactively and was vigilant on the

                                                                    19
progression of the Project on all fronts, taking the necessary steps to keep the project on track through
procurement, technical design, and effectiveness delays. The restructuring was carried out with great caution
by the Bank, to mitigate risks of not achieving the Project’s development objectives, and to introduce
adjustments necessary to ensure compliance with the Loan and Project Agreements without significantly
modifying Project outcomes. This is to be commended. The transition of four task team leaders caused some
disruptions but did not affect the necessary project actions to be taken because the Bank was cautious to
provide continuity in the support provided by the local country staff. The project filing was not efficiently
undertaken throughout the Project and therefore there were lapses in available documentation (especially in
the early years 2007-2008, when project implementation mainly consisted of procurement actions). The
fiduciary and safeguard aspects which came up during the course of implementation were delicately handled,
though effectively. The social safeguard was triggered on restructuring but was not exercised during
implementation. Resolving the Baneasa issue (back office and auditing) took longer than necessary, hence
the project suspension (and disbursement) extended for more than a year for Component 1. Procurement did
encounter delays in providing guidance on the best course of actions and in responding to the forensic
review. The need for several variation orders of the Bucharest contracts due to price and other changes took
numerous back and forth with the client and was on the contrary adequately handled by the Procurement
team. Overall, even with the issues the Project faced during implementation, and responding to necessary
adjustments, the Project more than successfully accomplished its PDO.

In hindsight, two issues for which the necessary stocktaking was not undertaken by the Bank during
implementation support and at restructuring were: (i) the Bank team did not adequately report in the project
documentation (aide memoires/ISR) or in the restructuring paper that the Otopeni North neighborhood
(proposed in the PAD) had been omitted from the project scope of Component 1 in 2007 during the
procurement process; and (ii) in Arad, the technical design was revised during implementation resulting in
assessing lower numbers for residents in the project area and new target values. Target values should have
been revised during restructuring as the number of beneficiaries now appears not to have been fully reached,
although the neighborhoods have been fully serviced. However, the Project successfully achieved its project
development outcomes on all three components and was especially successful in its accomplishment of
Component 3.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The project was well designed, simple, and adequately targeted, impacting water and sanitation services
meeting EU standards in Bucharest and Arad (two main cities of Bucharest), and Romania as a whole
(through leveraging EU funding for infrastructure investment). While there were some lapses during project
implementation support, they were not significant enough to downgrade performance, as the thinking for the
Project evolved during implementation and the team managed them well. Most importantly, the Project
responded directly to the Borrower’s needs in a timely and responsive manner.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government’s (MoPF) performance is rated Satisfactory. The Government’s support for the Project and
its objectives remained unwavering from design to implementation. The Government maintained a tight
supervision and working relationship with all the counterpart agencies/implementing agencies (MoB, MoA,
and MoEWM). The ten months’ initial delay in reaching project effectiveness, as the parliament ratification
process of the Loan Agreement had to follow due course of the Romanian legislation, did not majorly
impact implementation. The Borrower supported the Bank’s action in dealing with recurrent delays in
counterpart funding and issuance of construction permits, and provided guidance with procurement actions.
In addition, on restructuring the Borrower endorsed the decision for forensic survey and necessary actions

                                                    20
needed for the timely restructuring of the project, and, when necessary, it supported the need for project
extension for Bucharest.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Municipality of Bucharest (MoB) performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory (which includes Sector 1
and Sector 6 Municipalities in addition to the Greater Municipality of Bucharest). Such rating stems mainly
from delays during implementation due to many reasons: (i) unsatisfactory cooperation with District 1 with
respect to construction permits, day-to-day execution and the timely availability of the counterpart
financing; (ii) lengthy administrative procedure to obtain construction permits; (iii) limited direct
supervision by the PIU of the Contractors and over-reliance on the Engineer in the preparation of reports and
in the process of decision-making, including for contract variations orders; (iv) difference in land ownership
regime between the time of feasibility study and start of work; and (v) poor response and lack of
coordination with other utilities which interfered with the works schedule. All this cumulatively contributed
to the need to extend the closing date of the Project by nine months. Even within this challenging context,
the Project was able to accomplish the PDO and all its indicator target values successfully, in some cases
exceeding it. The Project successfully provided access to quality water and sewerage services, drainage, and
roads meeting EU standards covering six priority neighborhoods in Bucharest (two green fields and four
existing development), consequently resulting in physical improvement of the districts. Additionally the
cooperation between the Municipality, the Engineer, and the Bank was managed well, ensuring more than
successful outcome of this component.

Municipality of Arad (MoA) performance is rated Satisfactory. Arad also experienced challenges during
implementation: (i) the biggest problem was that roads and sewerage designs were not sufficiently
developed, based on the actual situation on site, and revisions were necessary, (ii) the contractors proved to
have little experience and insufficient human and material resources for the tasks, and (iii) performance of
the Joint Venture was not very favorable. Collectively all these aspects triggered some delays. The PIU
could have taken more decisive actions earlier on to deal with such issues and resolve the problem with the
contractor. The Project was nevertheless able to provide access to quality sewerage services, drainage and
roads meeting EU standards covering fully three priority neighborhoods in Arad, consequently resulting in
physical improvement of the districts. The Municipality’s senior management was always fully behind the
Project and supported it by increasing the city’s counterpart financing of the project, due to higher costs. The
cooperation between the Municipality, the Engineer, and the Bank was good and ensured the successful
outcome of this component.

Ministry of Environment and Water Management (MoEWM, now MoEF) performance is rated Highly
Satisfactory, as the expected results of the component were more than successfully accomplished, and ahead
of time, and close supervision of the consultants was exercised. Closer cooperation with the Bank’s team on
documents sharing, to ensure additional quality control on the design of the Master Plans and priority
projects, could have further helped in improving the design of the investment packages. MoEWM was also
tasked with M&E consolidated reports, which encountered some delays during the initial implementation
phase of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The support for the project remained strong at both central and local levels of government as the investments
were targeted in helping Romania meet its commitment to the EU directives, which is a common political
and economic goal across the country. The projects in Bucharest and Arad were prepared by the
municipalities using their own resources, approved and supported by all local and central governmental
agencies, the first time in Romania. Municipalities had to struggle with some issues during implementation
which triggered delays; however, these issues were managed well in collaborations with the Government,

                                                      21
Engineers, and the Bank to successfully achieve the project outcome. The Project demonstrated stellar
disbursement (despite early start-up delays), and strong ownership (high municipality contribution), all
target values were successfully achieved, access to water, sewerage, drainage, and roads meeting EU
standards was provided in two counties (Bucharest and Arad) fully covering nine neighborhoods, and the
project successfully leveraged €1.1 billion for infrastructure investments for ten counties of Romania to
meet the EU directive. In sum, the achievements of the project successfully advanced Romania to meet EU
environmental directives, thereby improving the quality and coverage of water and wastewater services
meeting EU standards.

6. Lessons Learned

If project design entails infrastructure investments, new land development, and final foot print of all
proposed investments is not known upfront, as a precaution OP 4.12 should be triggered during project
design. This issue was debated at length during appraisal and conclusion was reached not to trigger OP 4.12.
However, Bank and ECA Region thinking have evolved since then as cumulative experience indicated that
is safer to be conservative. It is better to trigger OP 4.12 for this type of investments as the policy provides
additional protection and support to people using land informally or illegally, and is intended to protect the
poor and vulnerable. Therefore, as needed, Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)/Land Acquisition Policy
Framework (LAPF) should be put in place, as was observed during this project, and this would safeguard the
Bank’s and Borrower’s interests more effectively.

Countries like Romania (then an EU accession country) may not so much need help in developing hardware,
but may benefit more from the Bank on the software side or in creating systems and processes, and capacity
through TAs and transference of knowledge. The most successful aspect of the project was Component 3,
where the Bank provided technical assistance to leverage EU grant financing successfully. This may be an
area that the Bank might consider providing support to Romania and other countries moving forward,
especially for the preparation of projects pipeline. The Bank is already implementing the lessons learned
under the project in other accession countries, such as Croatia, through both similar projects and TAs.

Beneficiary assessment should be programmed during implementation for projects that are designed with
the objective of basic services delivery such as water and wastewater. Beneficiary assessment can be
valuable to understand the social gains made under the project and should be integrated into project design
or at least planned before project closing.

Projects implemented at lower level of Government (through municipalities) and in a decentralized manner,
demonstrate strong Borrower commitment and ownership, resulting in higher counterpart contribution even
during a financial crisis. The project portfolio in Romania confirms that in the last 10 years, all the well-
performing projects, with fast disbursements, strong ownership, higher borrower contributions were
implemented by Local Government Units (LGU) or in a decentralized manner. This project’s experience
further confirms this finding. The projects in Bucharest and Arad were prepared by the municipalities using
their own resources, approved by the respective municipal councils, reviewed by the inter-ministerial
commission chaired by Ministry of Finance, and had the support o f the central Government and the
municipalities for implementation. This helped ensure Quality at Entry and is a very important lesson for
Romania and some other EU and pre-accession countries and for future lending. In countries with limited
administrative capacity and poor governance, a project performs better when implementation by LGUs.

Project lending in Euro denomination could avert the currency-associated risk adequately during
implementation. Project experience shows that Euro lending in EU accession countries provides necessary
risk coverage against currency fluctuations and help during project implementation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Before Restructuring

Prior to restructuring, both the progress toward achievement of the PDO and project implementation
progress (IP) were rated “moderately satisfactory? which implied that project was progressing well and
could be able to accomplish the development object by project closing. Therefore, the Original Objective of
the project are being assessed on the above stated assumption.

-   To meet the EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, thereby improving the
    quality and coverage of water and wastewater services through support of infrastructure development in
    the municipalities of Bucharest and Arad to provide better water and wastewater service and improve
    stormwater management – Moderately Satisfactory - At the time of restructuring the implementation
    progress of component 1, and 2 were at 30% and 39%, respectively.

Outputs:
   • Water – In Bucharest, 1,033 water connections were provided in the seven (7) targeted
       neighborhoods prior to project restructuring, as this was a new indicator on restructuring, there was
       no original target value, based on the revised target value of 3,566, or 29% was met.
   • Wastewater – In Bucharest, 1,456 wastewater connections were provided in the seven (7) targeted
       neighborhoods, as this was a new indicator on restructuring, there was no original target value,
       based on the revised target value of 3,028, or 48% was met. While in Arad, 39% of the physical
       works had been completed but no final sewerage connections had been finalized.
   • Drainage – In Bucharest, 17.8km stormwater drainage network were provided in the seven (7)
       targeted neighborhoods, against a target of 39km, or 46% of the original target value was met versus
       63% of the revised target value of 28.1km. While in Arad, 49.9km of stormwater drainage network
       were provided in three (3) targeted neighborhoods, against a target of 81km, or 61% was met.
   • Roads – In Bucharest, 13.2km of 62km target value was completed, equaling 21% of the original
       target value; while in Arad, 13.6km of 84km target was completed, equaling 16% of the original
       target value. The progress toward achieving the target value of outputs was satisfactory.

Outcomes:
   • Beneficiary Population – In Bucharest, overall the project provided improved access to water supply
      meeting EU standards for 14,439 people, against a target of 30,620 in the seven (7) targeted
      neighborhoods, 47% of the original target value was met versus 59% of the revised target value of
      24,449 people. In Arad, overall the project provided access to wastewater meeting EU standards,
      however, the beneficiary number was not available in view that 39% of the physical works had been
      completed but no final sewerage connections, drainage, or roads had been finalized.
   • Incremental water sold – In Bucharest, the target value of incremental water sold, based on system
      design prior to restructuring, 598 m3 against a target 2,066 m3, or 29% of the original target value
      was met, versus 48% of the revised target value of 1,249 m3.
   • Incremental sewerage collected – In Bucharest, the target value of incremental wastewater collected,
      based on system design prior to restructuring, 538 m3 against a target 1,860 m3, 29% of the target
      value was met, versus 48% of the revised target value of 1,124 m3. While in Arad, the value was not
      available as the connections had not been finalized.

-   To meet the EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, thereby improving the
    quality and coverage of water and wastewater services through preparation of priority water and
    wastewater projects in 11 counties - Moderately Satisfactory - At the time of restructuring the progress
    of component 3 were at 45%. The project was making progression toward completion of 11 applications

Component 3: Project Preparation for the EU. This was the most successful component of the project.
Initially, applications for 11 counties (Braila, Vrancea, Ilfov, Ialomita, Constanta, Galati, Bistrita-Nasaud,
Arad, Sibiu, Mehedinti, and Dolj counties) were to be prepared with the overall financing of €13 million
under (two contracts). The assignment was expected to be carried out in two (2) phases with the following
outputs:
     • Phase 1: Preparation of project applications, consisting of: (a) Preparation of Project Applications
         for EU co-financing and supporting documents: (i) Pre-feasibility stage - Development of Master
         Plans and macro-affordability assessment at the county level; and (ii) Feasibility stage - Preparation
         of the EU co-financing Application; and b) Institutional strengthening to foster the efficient
         management of water and wastewater investments, including training for MoEF (previously
         MoEWM) and for local/regional authorities.
     • Phase 2: Elaboration of complete tender dossier for services, goods and works contracts for priority
         projects, required for implementation of the feasibility studies carried out under Phase 1, which
         would include: (a) Preparation of the Tender Dossiers (for services and for works/goods); and (b)
         Support during tendering and evaluation.

During implementation, the two contracts were modified by addenda to include the following: (i) the Master
Plan for Galati was replaced by that for Vaslui county; (ii) the application for Vaslui county was removed;
(iii) Mehendinti county was removed from the scope of the contract; and (iv) the integration of Fagaras
agglomeration was integrated within the scope of Sibiu county application. As a result, the number of tender
documents to be prepared was changed. Consequently, on project restructuring, application for EU financing
to be prepared covering only 10 counties was finally prepared (Braila, Vrancea, Ilfov, Ialomita, Constanta,
Bistrita-Nasaud, Arad, Sibiu-Brasov, Bihor, and Dolj).

As a result, nine (9) applications were filed for EU grant financing for ten (10) counties of Romania. Project
output results are represented mainly by the documents/deliverables prepared under this component in two

Feasibility Study, Cohesion Fund application etc.); and elaborated Tender Dossiers.

The total value of the investment included in the approved applications prepared under Component 3 is
about €1.1 billion (of which 85% from EU budget and 15% from State and Local budgets). Based on €13
million component cost (comprising €11 million WB’s contribution and €2 million Borrower’s contribution),
MOEF (previously MoEWM) was able to leverage about €850 million from EU funds for infrastructure
investments to meet the EU directives, which represents 30% of the total value (€2.8 billion) allocated for
Priority Axis 1 - “Extension and modernization of water and wastewater systems? to be used for
infrastructure investment from EU through SOP Environment for programming period Phase 1 -2013. 14

In addition, according to the Borrower’s ICR on this component the expected result under this component
were:
    • Definition of a long term phased investment program for water and wastewater sector for investment
         priority areas;
    • High quality preparatory measures (measurements, site investigations etc.) for elaboration of the
         preliminary design of planned works;
    • Environmentally sound water projects ready to be proposed for EU financing;
    • Well prepared tender documents and procurement strategy;
    • Increased programming and implementation capacity of projects at central and local level.

The main outputs expected from project investment proposed in the ten (10) counties would serve a total
population of 2.4 million; this would include 0.24 million additional population served by water projects;
and 0.51 million additional population served by wastewater projects. The investment would result in
increasing the water and wastewater connection rate in these ten counties from 80% to 99%, and 63% to
96%, implying an average increase of 19% for water and 36% for wastewater, respectively (Table 1 below).

Investments, for which documents for approval were prepared under this component, were to be financed by
SOP Environment for 2007-2013 programming period. This would be monitored through SOP Environment
indicators, based on commitments to be achieved by Romania under the EU Accession Treaty. A summary
of some of the main expected outputs to be achieved by 2015 are reported in the Table 2 below.

To implement these investments, MoEF (formerly MoEWM) has established a financing contract between
the Managing Authority for SOP Environment and the Regional Water Companies (beneficiaries) for
implementation and for operation of the assets created, as a result. Currently, nine (9) contract covering ten
(10) counties of Romania (Bistrita Nasaud, Vrancea, Arad, Braila, Ilfov, Constanta-Ialomita region, Sibiu-
Brasov, Bihor, Dolj counties) are under implementation, initiated during 2010-2011 (March 22, 2010 to
September 26, 2011) in the amount of €1.1 billion with a beneficiary contribution of €36 million or 3%.

15
   According to SOP Environment Indicators 70% of the population will have access to piped water. Currently 52% of the
population benefits from this service.
16
   According to SOP Environment Indicators 60% collected will be adequately treated, currently 35% is treated.

                                                                29
Under implementation, average physical progress of the contract is at 3%, while the average financial
progress is reported to be approximately 4% with 35% time period lapsed towards completion.
Implementation progress has been slow, as observed as projects have to be completed by 2015 to be able to
utilize the secured EU grant financing (Table 4 below).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Water and Wastewater

Scope and Methodology. Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was undertaken at appraisal and completion for the
following three project components:
    1. Wastewater works in three neighborhoods of Arad City (Gai, Bujac, Sanicolau Mic)
    2. Water and wastewater works in four existing developments in Bucharest (Straulesti, Vatra Noua,
        Chitila Triaj, Giulesti Sarbi)
    3. Water and wastewater works in two new developments in Bucharest (Baneasa, Odai). 17

The analytical frameworks used for calculating returns on investment- at appraisal and completion- are
similar to allow for necessary comparison. A list of the key parameters used in the CBA exercises at
completion is given in Table 1 below, along with the data sources and estimation approach (followed by
details in the next sections). In summary:

The main benefits accounted for in the CBA were:
   1. Incremental water and wastewater revenues, as a proxy for benefits of piped water services
       (improved coverage, convenience, better quality), and the benefits of having a sewage system (and
       discontinuing the use of septic tanks), respectively;
   2. Incremental property tax revenues to reflect increase in the value of property and land where the
       infrastructure will be upgraded;
   3. In the case of Arad, the two other sources of revenue are: (a) development tax, and (b) concession
       fee.

The main costs included in the CBA were:
   1. Cost of building the water supply and wastewater infrastructure;
   2. Operational and maintenance costs;
   3. In the case of new developments in Bucharest, the cost of the distribution network.

The water and wastewater investments supported by the project also had a number of other important
external benefits, which have not been quantified owing to the lack of data and/or complexity of modeling
these effects. These benefits included:
    1. Reduction in polluting risk for soil and subsoil, including underground and phreatic water, as well as
         surface water due to leakage produced either by old age or/and under-dimensioning of the sewerage
         network, or by malfunction of the pumping process in project areas;
    2. Reduction in leakages in the waste water system decreases the danger of water born diseases;
    3. By improving plant and system efficiency, energy consumption is reduced;
    4. Elimination of flooding risks by providing storm water systems. This investment also affects the
         improvement of the population health safety and comfort due to elimination of the residues lying on
         the streets during floods, as well as due to elimination of the drinking water contamination.18

Therefore, the CBA methodology used in both ex-ante and ex-post analysis gives the lower-bound of the
benefits of the water and wastewater investments made by the project. In addition, many sensitivity tests
were done in the CBA exercise at completion assuming different scenarios (for e.g. low increases in tariff
rates, decline in population growth rates, etc.) to assess the robustness of the returns on investment under
these different assumptions. 19


17
   At appraisal, water and wastewater works was expected to be undertaken in three new developments: Otopeni North, Baneasa and
Odai. Hence, the ex-ante analysis estimated the costs and benefit streams of works in all three neighborhoods combined. In 2007,
Otopeni North was excluded from the scope of work; therefore, the cost benefit analysis at completion only captures returns on
investments in Baneasa and Odai.

Costs. Three types of costs are included in the CBA are investment costs (without VAT and contingency),
O&M costs and (in the case of Baneasa and Odai), the cost of the distribution network that has to be built
after project completion but is not financed by the project. As seen in Table 2, for works in both Arad and
Bucharest investment costs at completion are higher than investment costs reported at appraisal. 21 The
differences are justified and arise due to:
    1. Increase in project costs: In the restructuring paper of 2010, cost of works in both Arad and
         Bucharest was revised upwards due to changes in market conditions leading to higher bids. The
         costs for the Arad component was increased from EUR 50 to EUR 73 million, while the costs for
         the Bucharest component increased from EUR 74 million to EUR 93 million.
    2. Exchange rate variation: The ex-ante CBA uses an exchange rate of 3.65 for converting costs
         incurred in RON into Euros. However, during the project period, due to the financial crisis, the
         exchange rate movements were markedly pronounced: in 2006, the average exchange rate was 3.52
         RON/EUR; 3.34 in 2007; 3.68 in 2008; 4.24 in 2009; 4.21 in 2010; 4.24 in 2011; 4.39 in the first six
         months of 2012.
    3. Real value adjustment: Investment costs in the ex-ante CBA are expressed in 2006 currency, while
         in the ex-post CBA, these are expressed in 2011 currency. Since the consumer price index in
         Romania increased by 34% between 2006 and 2011, investment costs at completion would seem
         smaller if expressed in 2006 terms.

Benefits. The benefits of these investments are:
     1. Positive externalities at the regional and country levels due to the environmental improvements
        supported by the project. These externalities are difficult to quantify and as a result are not included
        in the cost benefit analysis either at appraisal or completion.
     2. Provision of water and wastewater services through an operator, which improves quality of service
        and reduces health and environmental risks. The incremental revenues due to piped water are used
        as a proxy for benefits of piped water services (coverage, convenience, better quality). Similarly,
        incremental wastewater revenues are used as a proxy for benefits of having a sewage system and
        discontinuing the use of septic tanks. To estimate the incremental revenue due to the project, the per
        capita consumption and average tariffs have been used. In Arad, the per capita consumption is
        calculated separately for domestic and industrial consumption on the basis of volume of water sold
        to domestic and industrial consumers respectively, while in Bucharest, consumption is inclusive of
        domestic, industrial and commercial consumption as disaggregated numbers were not available at
        the time of this analysis.
     3. Increase in the value of property and land where the infrastructure is upgraded. For Arad, the
        increase in the value of the property is proxied by incremental property tax revenue, and most recent
        projections by the city government are used to calculate incremental property tax revenue stream. In
        Bucharest, updated property tax information was not available, and the estimation strategy used in

(excluding VAT (19%) and contingency (10%)) investment costs for new developments in Bucharest as appraised was 13,737.

                                                                 33
         the ex-ante CBA is replicated. In addition, in Arad, two additional sources of revenue are considered
         (which are mentioned in the PAD as well)- namely, development tax and concession fees.

The total incremental revenue estimated in the ex-ante and ex-post models are shown in Table 3 below, and
as can be seen, revenue projections is higher for both Arad and Bucharest at completion than at appraisal.

The differences in benefits/revenue estimated at appraisal and at completion arise because of updating
values and/or applying different assumptions to the variables used in the calculation:

     1. Population: Population estimates in the ex-post model are lower than estimates at appraisal (see
        Table 4 below). In Arad and existing developments in Bucharest, population was assumed to be
        growing at the rate of 1% and 2% per year in the ex-ante model; however, INSSE projections for
        Arad and Bucharest show a decline in population in between 2006-2025. Hence, ex-post population
        estimates were adjusted to reflect this. In the case of new development in Bucharest, same 2005 and
        2034 population estimates were assumed in both the ex-ante and ex-post CBA. While the ex-ante
        model for new developments in Bucharest applied a constant annual growth rate of 14%, the ex-post
        model used 2005 and 2034 population estimates to interpolate population estimates for the
        intervening years.

Note: Population #s for Arad for 2005 and for Bucharest for 2005 and 2034 are drawn from the PAD. Population numbers for Arad
in ex-post CBA for 2025 are estimated based on INSSE population projections for 2025.

     2. Water Consumption: In Bucharest, consumption values in the ex-post analysis were the same as
        used in the ex-model (i.e. 220 lpcd in 2006 and declining to 165 lpcd in 2025), as no other data was
        available. In Arad, the ex-ante model included the total of domestic, industrial and commercial
        consumption. In ex-post CBA, we considered domestic and industrial consumption separately as
        disaggregated values were available for 2009-2011 (see table 5). In the case of domestic
        consumption, future consumption values were held constant at 102 lpcd, as international guidelines
        suggest that domestic consumption should not fall below 100 lpcd. In the case of industrial
        consumption, we first estimated industrial consumption per industrial worker by dividing total

                                                                34
              industrial consumption for 2009-11 by the industrial population in 2009-11. We then projected
              industrial consumption per capita values for 2012-onwards based on past trends and applied a
              variable (negative) growth rate schedule- with consumption declining more rapidly in earlier years
              and less so in later periods. Once industrial consumption per capita was estimated, we multiplied it
              by number of industrial jobs in Gai and Bujac (i.e. the areas where industrial consumption was to be
              affected by project activity) to obtain total volume of industrial wastewater treated. The different
              bases for calculating consumption and population values were therefore one source of the deviation
              between the ERRs in ex-ante vs. ex-post CBA. For instance, total volume of wastewater treated26
              was estimated to be 25.9 million m3 in the ex-ante model vs. 26.9 million m3 in the ex-post model.

          3. Tariff: In the ex-ante model, tariff rates were underestimated (see Table 6). In the ex-post model, we
             obtained real tariff rates for 2006-2012 for Arad and Bucharest. A growth rate of 5%, as assumed in
             the ex-ante CBA, was applied to get projections from 2013 onwards. This difference in tariff rates
             between the ex-ante and ex-post models is the most significant reason why incremental revenue is
             higher for Arad and Bucharest.

          4. Property Tax: In Arad, we used property tax projections prepared by city government in 2012.
             While ex-ante model did not include development tax and concession fee (although these are
             mentioned in PAD), they were included in ex-post model for the years 2013-2025 as they are
             significant sources of tax revenue. Overall, this meant that tax revenue stream in ex-post is higher
             than in ex-ante CBA model (see Table 7), and has contributed to overall revenue being higher in the
             ex-pot model than in the ex-ante model. In Bucharest, no updated projections were available. We
             replicated the methodology in ex-ante model while adjusting for foreign exchange rate and CPI
             movements. Based on this, the ex-post willingness to pay/capita in ex-post model is lower than in
             the ex-ante model even though the same initial point (44.4 RON/capita in 2010) and annual growth
             rate (5%) is assumed.

     The analysis assumes that incremental volume of wastewater treated equals incremental volume of water sold.

Economic Rate of Return. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) calculated at appraisal and completion is
given in Table 8 below. As can be seen, the ERR for Arad is higher at completion (12.9%) vs. at appraisal
(6.2%). As explained before, the deviation is explained by inclusion of new tax revenue streams
(development tax and concession fee) and updating the tariff rates (which was underestimated in the ex-ante
CBA) in the ex-post analysis. Similarly, the ERR for water and wastewater works in Bucharest is higher at
completion (15.7% for existing developments and 10.1% for new developments) than at appraisal (12.3%
and 9.4% for existing and new developments respectively) - substantial benefits materializing in new
developments in Bucharest over the longer run Although investment costs increased for both new and
existing developments in Bucharest, they were more than offset by an increase in revenue via higher tariff
rates, whose growth was much higher than anticipated in the ex-ante CBA.

It must also be emphasized that the ERR presented here is an underestimation, because environmental and
public health benefits of these investments have not been quantified, owing to lack of data and the
complexity in measuring such benefits.

Sensitivity Analysis. The ex-ante CBA exercise did not incorporate robustness checks. At completion, the
ERR was estimated under different scenarios - a few high and mostly low-case scenarios- to assess if ERR
remains positive, under even the most conservative scenarios. As seen in Figures 1 below, the ERR was
positive in all these scenarios.

                                                                                Bucharest (new)



         Note: Number of alternative scenarios tested: Arad (14); Existing developments in Bucharest (17); New developments in
         Bucharest (17).

Some of these alternative scenarios tested include:
   1. Varying Population Growth Rates: For existing developments in Bucharest, two alternative
       population projections were estimated: (1) Assuming that population in 2034 is same as projected in
       the feasibility study; (2) Assuming annual population growth rate of 2.21% for Giulesti Sarbi based
       on 2034 projections 27 while population estimates for Vatra Noua, Chitila Triaj and Straulesti are
       based on INSSE projections. For new developments in Bucharest, we estimated alternative
       population projections (i) assuming a constant increase in population numbers during 2006-2034;
       (ii) assuming a negative population growth rate after 2034. 28
   2. Varying Tariff Growth Rates: In Arad, we re-estimated ERR assuming (i) growth in tariff rate is
       same as growth rate in last three years; (ii) tariff growth rate until 2013-2020 is same as growth rate
       in 2009-2012 and declining thereafter. The same assumptions were also applied to re-estimate ERR
       for both existing and new developments in Bucharest. A non-constant (i.e. declining) tariff growth
       rate schedule is applied under the assumption that it will not be sustainable to maintain a constant
       annual growth rate over the long term.
   3. Different Tax Scenarios: In Arad, the two different tax scenarios considered were: (i) assuming
       property tax projections made in 2006 but not including development tax and concession fee; (ii)
       assuming property tax projections made in 2012 but not including development tax and concession
       fee. Like the ex-ante CBA, these scenarios do not include revenue from development tax and
       concession fee. In Bucharest- both existing and new developments- the alternative tax scenarios
       considered were using tax projections from 2006 and population estimates from INSSE as well as
       2034 projections to calculate alternative willingness to pay per capita estimates.


27
   Based on INSSE projections, population growth rate between 2005-2010 for Giulesti Sarbi seemed too high (>15%), so we re-
calculate population for existing developments based on assuming INSSE projections for Vatra Noua, Straulesti and Chitila Triaj,
and using 2034 projections to interpolate population #s for Giulesti Sarbi (this is equivalent to annual growth rate of 2.21%).
28
   INSSE population estimates for Bucharest overall show a negative growth rate.

                                                                                       37
    4. Different Industrial Job Growth: For Arad, we re-estimated ERR assuming industrial job growth
       rate of 3.5%- which is equal to growth rate in jobs in Arad in 2010-2011.

Roads

The economic analysis of investments for paving the streets was carried out at appraisal and completion for
Arad in the Gai, Bujac and Sanicolau Mic Districts. The evaluation was done using the Road Economic
Decision Model (RED), version 3.2, developed by the Word Bank for the economic analysis of low volume
roads. The main project benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time costs (road user costs)
and reduction in maintenance costs. The assessment did not consider the social benefits of paving the streets
such as eliminating dust and facilitating the movement of non-motorized traffic.

The economic analysis was done over a 15 year evaluation period, considering a without project-alternative
that maintains the roads at their current condition, and evaluating a paving alternative that will yield an
average roughness of 3.0 IRI, m/km.

The basic parameters used to run the RED model are given below.
   1. Vehicle Characteristics and Operating Costs: Vehicle fleet characteristics (utilization, loading and
       traffic composition) and economic unit costs were defined for nine vehicle types. The traffic values
       were estimated for each street based on several sources: previous traffic studies, performed for the
       Arad Urban Area (that offer estimation on traffic forecast, for each street category), visual
       inspections and traffic counts on reduced scale (counting of 15 minutes) and a generalized traffic
       model, on national scale, that contains only inter-regional traffic volumes.
   2. Road Works Alternatives and Unit Costs: The carriageway and sidewalks structures were chosen
       comparing 4 alternatives based on the traffic level of the streets. The selection considered the traffic
       prognosis and the geo-technical study and, also, the conformity with the National standards in force.
       The unit costs were estimated based on detailed information such as: topographical survey, geo-
       technical report, traffic study, road signalization (for crossroads, zebra crossing, access spot to the
       property entry, etc). Annualized maintenance costs used for the global analysis of the network were
       estimated considering the following: (i) routine maintenance (cleaning services); (ii) periodical
       maintenance (repairs); and (iii) sewerage maintenance. Each of the parameters was estimated for the
       without project alternative and with project alternative.

In the ex-ante model, a network of 81.4 km was evaluated and the economic analysis showed that the ERR
from paving the network was 21%, and the Net Present Value, at 12 percent discount rate, was EUR 8.62
million. In the ex-post model, a network of 86.2 km was evaluated, and the analysis yielded an ERR of 19% ,
and the and the Net Present Value, at 12 percent discount rate, was EUR 11.79 million (see Table 9 below).
The sensitivity and the risk analysis (scenarios included benefits dropping to 15 percent of the current level
and a 15 percent increase in investment costs) suggests that individual and the simultaneous variation of the
model variables do not lead to obtaining negative or unfavorable results upon the investment decision.

This economic analysis was not carried out for Bucharest either at appraisal or completion, and per-hectare
ERR estimates from the RED exercise for Arad are assumed to obtain crude estimates for roads investment
in Bucharest (see Table 10 below).

Overall ERR

Based on the discussion in preceding sections, the overall ERR for Arad and Bucharest (existing
developments) is substantial at more than 20%. In Arad, the returns on investments in sewerage and roads at
completion (31.9%) exceeded baseline expectations (27.2%). Similarly, in the existing developments of
Bucharest where the project was active, investments in water, wastewater and roads yield an ex-post ERR of
around 26% (15.7% for water and wastewater and 10% for roads), which is higher than baseline estimate of
22.3%. In new developments in Bucharest, the scope of the project was narrowed (i.e. Otopeni North was
excluded) during project implementation, and according to CBA at completion, the investments in roads,
water and wastewater investments in Baneasa and Odai are expected to yield significant material gains in the
longer run (> 16%). As mentioned before, the methodology used in both ex-ante and ex-post analyses in
Arad and Bucharest, gives the lower-bound of the benefits of the water and wastewater investments made by
the project. This is because some very meaningful environmental benefits (for e.g. reduction of pollution
risks, improving of the public health, reduction of leakage in the wastewater system, elimination of flooding
risks, reduction of energy consumption, etc.) have not been quantified- owing to the lack of data and
complexity of modeling these effects.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Full stakeholder workshop was not undertaken. A reconnaissance stakeholder assessment was undertaken as
reported below, a brief summary is provided in the main body of the ICR.

Component 1: Bucharest Urban Services

Overall. The main accomplishment of this component was improving the quality of life for 120,000 people
through high quality of water supply, sewerage collection, and property’s easy access to these service, and
also roads. The main project challenge was to achieve the targets (monitoring indicators) with the best
achievable quality in the available budget. Several challenges were encountered under this component,
mainly: (i) lengthy administrative procedure to obtain construction permits; (ii) difference in land ownership
regime between the time of feasibility study and start of work; (iii) poor response from other
utilities/administrators of which utilities interfered with the work; and (iv) unsatisfactory cooperation with
District 1 with respect to construction permits, day to day execution and the timely availability of the
counterpart financing.

Project Design. The technical design was poorly adapted to the modern environmental requirements and
existing site situation (land ownership, rapid development of the areas, outdated or lack of PUZ), these were
the reasons for quite a large number of design modifications and time extension for completion. The
technical design was elaborated in 2004-05 and therefore once the works started (2007-2008), it required
updating

Implementation. The biggest implementation impediments were created by the extensive time needed for
obtaining the approvals for execution of electricity supply connections, taking some times more than 12
months. The biggest problem faced during implementation was the time needed for obtaining the
construction permits, beginning with Zonal Urban Plan (PUZ) approval and continuing with other utilities
operator. Due to the importance of the project (ratification by Law No. 124/2007), the municipality had to
adapt and responds to issues and constraints with “high priority,? on the decision making process. The
biggest lesson learnt by the project experience was team work and good design is critical when dealing with
achieving project targets within time and budget constraints. The project resulted in sufficient technical
capacity transfer. The biggest accomplishment during project implementation was that the PIU have
obtained valuable experience and expertise on managing projects of such complexity.

Component 2: Arad Urban Services

Overall. The main problems under this component were as follows: (i) Procurement for Works. The
prequalification procedure was cancelled, at the Bank's suggestion, due to small number of substantially
responsive bids received and a second tender procedure, without prequalification, was carried out, resulting
in 3 works contracts awarded separately (with a separate lead contractor) for each district to a JV made up of
3 local contractors and 2 foreign (Hungarian and Polish); (ii) Contractors Competence. The Contractors
prove to have little experience and insufficient human and material resources for the tasks. The two foreign
companies played no role in the project implementation; (iii) Design. Due to insufficiently developed design,
redesign was often necessary during the works; and (iv) Ground water led to higher costs than initially
estimated in the proposals made by the contractor. Following and managing the works time schedule and the
quality if the works have been among the biggest challenges, along with the large number of work order
variations. The main accomplishment of this component was improving the quality of life for the population
living in 3 important districts of Arad, by: providing sewerage services, providing drainage in areas with
high flooding risk, and providing road access on streets with poor roads or un-surfaced roads.

Project Design. The biggest problem in the design of the project was that roads and sewerage design was
not sufficiently developed, based on the actual situation on site. Aspect should have been incorporated in


                                                     43
design for a successful project, were assessing underground utilities and groundwater level in advance.
Finally, the design of the roads was not sufficiently developed at the time of Works contract award.

Implementation. The biggest hurdle faced during implementation was that the joint venture (JV)
arrangements for the 3 contracts, involving 3 local companies, each taking the role of leader for one of the
contracts (A1 - ICIM, A2 - Confort, A3 - Amarad) didn't prove very efficient, due to insufficient resources
from their part and lack of involvement from the part of the foreign partners was not very successful. On
what changes should have been made or were made during implementation was that foreign partners of the
JV should have been present on site, providing material and human support and sharing their expertise and
the design should have been more accurate. The biggest learning of project implementation was that in
managing big works project the Municipality and the Engineer should have a close cooperation. They both
should pay a special attention, from the very beginning, to time schedule and quality of the works and
impose strict rules on the Contractor. The municipality was of the opinion that sufficient technical capacity
transfer did not occur during implementation. The biggest accomplishment of the project was connection of
a large number of houses to quality sewerage services, the overall physical improvement of the districts, not
only because of the direct impacts of the works, but also obvious improvement in property maintenance,
values, etc. Despite the above mentioned difficulties, the project represents the most important infrastructure
project ever developed by the Municipality of Arad, significantly contributing to the social, economic, and
environmental development of the city, with short, long and medium term impact. Additionally the co-
operation between the Municipality and the Engineer’s team was vital for a successful outcome of the
project.

Component 3: Project Preparation for EU Funding

Overall. The main problems identified under this component was the large number of actors involved,
which included: (i) a large number of local authorities not used to establish and manage a common strategy
for unanimous decision was required for each project; (ii) the national legislation amendment in order to
establish clear institutional framework of these regional project; (iv) data collection for the preparation of
projects; (v) changing national legislation on public procurement, among a few, triggered delays in the
implementation of this component. The main challenge of this component was preparing a large number of
investment project (9 funding application with supporting documents) within a relatively short time, and
responding to: (i) SOP Environment 2007-13; (ii) CE approval; and (iii) Demands of the DG REGIO and
DG Environment; which meant making the necessary mandatory adjustments by the consultant to attain the
quality for EC approval. The main accomplishment of the component was using €11 million, to leverage a
financing in the amount of €1 billion for major infrastructure investment in water and wastewater.

Project Design. The biggest project design problem was attributed to lumping five project applications
under one contract, which entailed a higher risk factor. The risk could have been minimized going with a
larger number of contracts covering less application under each, would have also led to faster
implementation The component design appropriately responded to sector demand and investment needs
because the project included a long term strategy for water sector (master plan) responding to SOP
Environment commitment to meet the EU directive.

Implementation. The biggest learning was applying WB rules to public procurement of services contract
and contract management. The project facilitated sufficient technical knowledge transfer regarding
procurement procedures and contract management. The biggest accomplishment was the approval of all
application for EC/EU financing for SOP Environment developed under this project.

Annex 9. Assessment of the Use of Country System (UCS) 29

Background

In March 2005, the World Bank Board approved a pilot program to test the use of borrower or “country?
systems to meet the objectives of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies. The rationale for
using country systems was to scale up development impact, increase country ownership, build institutional
capacity, facilitate harmonization and increase cost effectiveness. This led to the issuance of World Bank
Operational Policy 4.00 (OP 4.00) which lays out specific criteria for advancing pilot projects. It was
recognized in the background paper for Board consideration that sector-specific Bank operations in new
member states and candidates for European Union (EU) accession hold particular promise as pilots.

Two operations proposed for Romania for piloting OP 4.00, were the Municipal Services Project (MSP) and
the Transport Sector Support Project (TSSP). The Municipal Services Project main objective was to support
the rehabilitation and improvement of wastewater, stormwater and drinking water systems to reduce
pollution, improve public health, and assist Romania in meeting environmental requirements for European
Union accession. The Transport Sector Support Project main objective was to provide funds to rehabilitate,
maintain, and improve national road and rail systems.

In cooperation with Romanian officials, and with the support of European Commission staff, the World
Bank compared the Romanian systems (including those which stem from EU directives) against the
objectives and operational principles laid out in OP 4.00 for safeguards that would normally apply to these
two Bank-assisted projects. This assessment included a legal and technical review, both on paper and
through field interviews and site visits.

The Safeguards Diagnostic Review carried out during the project preparation to assess the UCS concluded
that the operational principles of EA and Physical Cultural Resources as per Bank policies and the
Romanian system laws, regulation and procedures in the sub-sectors supported by this project are considered
equivalent and acceptable. Consequently, the Bank recommended the use of Romanian systems to address
environmental issues related to this project in the area of (i) Environmental Assessment (EA) and
(ii) Physical Cultural Resources. However, Bank supervision on safeguards related matter was
recommended throughout the project implementation to: (i) ensure compliance with equivalent and
acceptable Romanian procedures, and (ii) track results in environmental outcomes.

Nevertheless, to avoid any significant differences in the environmental protection outcome of the EA
process, and maintain acceptability during the pilot program, the Bank and Romania agreed on an approach
to initially review and clear sub-project EAs jointly, as follows:
     • the first three environmental impact assessment reports and the first three environmental
          permits/licenses that were required under Romanian Law for the carrying out of the project, to be
          submitted to the Bank for its prior review; and
     • As an integrated part of the normal procurement practice (with ex-ante and ex-post provisions),
          reviewing of relevant annexes of bid documents describing environmental mitigation and
          monitoring procedures to be carried out by works contractors, supervisory contractors, etc.




29
  This note is based on a World Bank mission fielded from January 27 - February 2, 2012 comprising of Cesar Niculescu
(Environmental Specialist) to conduct an environmental safeguards review for the Romania Municipal Services Project before
project closing, with guidance provided (in December 2011) by Ruxandra Floroiu (Senior Environmental Engineer). The project is
one of the two Bank-supported projects in the country piloting the Use of Country Systems (UCS) to address environmental and
social safeguard issues according to the OP/BP 4.00. The main objective of the mission was to visit the most important project sites
for which construction activities were under implementation or already completed, and to review UCS implementation, in
compliance with the environmental safeguards’ requirements generally applicable to the project.

                                                                 50
Main Findings

The assessment focused on piloting experience of the MSP UCS during the project implementation of all
three components, and the UCS compliance with regards to current practice of the local implementing
entities; contractors, and supervisor engineers to mitigate environmental impacts and monitor environmental
progress for the works financed under MSP. In parallel, the Bank supervision activities on safeguard-related
matters were carried out periodically, and included: (i) reviewing relevant annexes of bid documents
describing environmental mitigation and monitoring procedures to be carried out by works/supervision
contractors; (ii) discussions with local environmental officials on the compliance, monitoring and
enforcement with respect to Romanian procedures; (iii) reviewing of work done by contractors to implement
and monitor environmental management actions during constructions undertaken in Bucharest and Arad
municipalities; (iv) site visits where civil works were implemented.

The Bank’s supervision missions focused overall on implementation issues linked to environmental as well
as cultural property aspects (from both sides - Bank and Client), and if there were any concerns (e.g., mass
media, private persons, etc.) regarding the project’s reliance on Romanian laws, policies, and institutions
inadequacies in protecting peoples’ health and well-being.

Overall, the project exercised acceptable level of implementation of environmental safeguards under
the project, and the application of UCS MSP pilot in Romania can be considered satisfactory and in
accordance with the findings of the acceptability assessment.

Most of the technical/engineering aspects of the environmental protection and mitigation measures included
in the projects were compatible with the national and international practice, with the Bank’s requirements
and safeguards, and suitable for the types of works implemented under the project. In Arad and respectively,
in Bucharest, each of the contractors had appointed a specialized person in charge with the Health & Safety
and Environmental protection activities, who implemented the site EMP accordingly.

The Environmental Protection and Health & Safety Plans prepared by the contractors and approved by the
Supervising Engineers for components 1 and 2 specified mitigating measures for all significant
environmental issues, and main environmental parameters for monitoring during the project implementation.
Generally, these covered protection measures related to construction site: dust and noise, collection and
disposal of solid wastes, recycling of the excavated material, construction material transportation and supply,
vegetation and green areas.

The PIUs for components 1 and 2 established in general a good approach to environmental monitoring
within the project to assure that high standards are followed for their respective components. There was
evidence of the positive effects of this approach at all sites - all works contracts included environmental
protection measures to be followed according to the actual legislation in force, with mitigation procedures
and responsibilities for the contractor. Specific requirements for inspection, identification, and handling of
hazardous materials and construction debris were included in the procurement documents. All
environmental impact mitigation and monitoring activities were carried out in parallel with the construction
activities.

Site visits from both sides – the Client and the Bank – were carried out during project implementation of
works contracts for construction of water, sewerage, drainage network systems and associated urban roads in
Bucharest, sectors 1 and 6, and respectively, Arad.

Progress reports on environmental monitoring parameters at project site locations were prepared regularly,
with description of monitoring activities for water and wastewater, air pollution, soil pollution and noise
levels, as well as status of roads, construction materials and gas used, soil and waste management, and water
surface collection. Other related documents available and/or developed at the project site included a detailed
environmental action plan, required authorizations (environmental approval, use of water/wastewater, etc.),

                                                      51
specific waste management plan, and list of legal aspects (e.g., laws, ordinances) required to mitigate and
monitor site/activity specific possible environmental impacts.

Component 3 - Project Applications for the EU (implemented by MoEF) – the Safeguards Diagnostic
Review recommended that the first three EIAs with respective environmental permits prepared for
investments financed under this component to be sent to the Bank for review. The Client fulfilled this task,
and in addition submitted to the Bank all 10 EIAs reports prepared for each application for EU financing.
All EIA Reports were accepted by the Bank, and approved by MoEF and EU Commission for all project
locations. The EIAs demonstrated that the proposed projects contribute to the fulfillment of the
commitments of Romania assumed by the Accession Treaty and is in line with the EU Operational Program
Environment.

Main conclusions

•   Overall, the UCS MSP pilot program under OP 4.00 could be considered successful in achieving
    its goals.
•   The supervision process of the UCS MSP pilot (both on the Bank and the client side) did not prove to be
    easier than that of a regular SIL, given that the project needed to trigger a new safeguard policy during
    project implementation (OP 4.12 e.g., Involuntary Resettlement). The Safeguards Diagnostic Review
    (2006) concluded that the Bank’s policy on Involuntary Resettlement was not equivalent and acceptable
    with the relevant national legislation in Romania. Also, currently the EU does not have a policy or
    regulations governing land acquisition, and this remains an issue at the national level and for Bank
    financed investments in the country.
•   The UCS MSP pilot in Romania positively contributed to institutional capacity building, by increasing
    the client’s capacity on creating awareness of environmental management – as environmental protection
    aspects related to the works contracts were being managed by the requisite technical departments of
    Arad and Bucharest municipalities.
•   The UCS pilot program under MSP pilot did not induce any change in the legal system in Romania for
    both, Environmental Assessment (EA) and Physical Cultural Resources, more so as there was no need
    due to equivalency.
•   Country ownership of UCS was sufficient, but this fact cannot be attributed directly to the UCS pilot,
    but mainly due to the regulatory regime to comply with EU requirements and standards. Using the
    country systems approach for the safeguards policies proved realistic and efficient, and allowed the
    Bank staff to focus more on the transfer of necessary knowledge and development of skills to
    counterparts.
•   The MSP experience suggests that the anticipated time and cost savings under this project may not have
    fully materialized as expected under the OP 4.00, which anticipated lower costs. The incremental
    preparation cost to the Bank for UCS project was expected to decline as a share of fixed cost of the
    diagnostic work taken before project implementation; however, the project experience indicates that this
    may not have been the case, and incremental costs assessment to the Bank for UCS pilot project may be
    difficult to be assessed accurately mainly due to the following reasons: (i) as this was the first and only
    UCS pilot in ECA region, input from various safeguards specialists were requested for this project for
    different evaluations related to the progress of this pilot, including QAG evaluation as well as
    facilitation on the ground of the IEG mission (conclusion of higher costs being in line with the
    safeguards evaluation provided by IEG in their report of May 2010); and (ii) since mid-project OP 4.12
    (Involuntary Resettlement) had to be triggered. As a result, additional Bank’s expertise and costs were
    necessary for overall project supervision of safeguards.
•   Romania‘s environmental policies are sufficiently robust, and the evidence on the ground indicates that
    they are being implemented satisfactorily. Therefore, it is possible to rely on the existing national
    environmental safeguards which reflect the European Union Directives, regulations and policies on
    environmental protection and management. On safeguard policies, such as Environmental Assessment
    and Physical Cultural Resources, the country has demonstrated sufficient capacity to implement EU
    rules and processes and international good practices.

                                                      52
•   In conclusion, the piloting of UCS for Romania MSP showed positive results during the project
    implementation, and demonstrated possibility of scaling-up this approach at the country-wide
    level for category B investments.
