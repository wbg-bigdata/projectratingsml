The Inspection Panel was created in September 1993 by the Board of Executive Directors
of the World Bank to serve as an independent mechanism to ensure accountability in
Bank operations with respect to its policies and procedures. The Inspection Panel is an
instrument for groups of two or more private citizens who believe that they or their
interests have been or could be harmed by Bank-financed activities to present their
concerns through a Request for Inspection. In short, the Panel provides a link between the
Bank and the people who are likely to be affected by the projects it finances.

Members of the Panel are selected "on the basis of their ability to deal thoroughly and
fairly  with the request brought to them, their integrity and their independencefrom the
Bank's Management, and their exposure to developmental issues and to living conditions
 in developing countries."'

The three-member Panel is empowered, subject to Board approval, to investigate
problems that are alleged to have arisen as a result of the Bank not having observed its
own operating policies and procedures. Therefore the Panel investigates the actions of
Bank Management, and not those of any other parties, including the borrower.

In the current case,the Panel found the Requesters and Request for Inspection eligible for
an investigation and recommended that the Board of Executive Directors authorize it to
carry out an investigation. The Board approved the investigation.

As with all investigations this report, which contains the Panel's findings, is being
submitted to the World Bank Board of Executive Directors. The report is also transmitted
to the Bank Management who will have six weeks to determine what recommendations,
if any, it will make to the Executive Directors to addressthe Panel findings.

Once the Board has come to a decision, the Panel will inform the Requesters, and Bank
Management will make public this Investigation Report, the Management's Response to
the Panel's findings, and the Board's decision. The Panel will also place these documents
on its website, where those interested will also find further information about the Panel,
its    processes     and     its    operations.     The   Panel's website     address   is:

                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. The Coal Sector Environmental         and Social Mitigation   Project (CSESMP)    was
   designed to assist Coal India Ltd.`s efforts to mitigate the environmental and social
   impacts of mining expansion to be undertaken in 25 mines under the Coal Sector
   Rehabilitation Project (CSRP). After being tested over a five-year period financed
   by the Bank, Coal India Ltd. was expected to apply the experience in more of its
   495 mines. It was initially conceived as a component of the CSRP. Starting in 1990,
   preparation began with the aim of supporting India's reform and expansion of the
   coal sector. Mitigation      of the resulting environmental and social impacts was
   initially a part of this Project. Subsequently, in November 1995, the project was split
   into an environmental and social component, the CSESMP, and an investment
   component, the CSRP.

2. In May 1996, the International Development Association (IDA) granted a Credit of
   US$63 million     to finance the CSESMP. The Credit was due to close on June 30,
   2001, but it was extended to June 30, 2002. At that time, about US$24 million was
   undisbursed. The associated CSRP investment loan was approved in September
   1997 and cancelled in July 2000. The CSESMP, however, continued.


3. This Report concerns only the Parej East mine, owned and operated by Central Coal
   India Ltd. (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. (GIL), where two villages, Parej
   and Durukasmar, are affected by mine expansion operations.

4. The Request for Inspection was submitted on June 21, 2001 by Ms. Bina Stanis of
   Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS), a local nongovernmental organization
   (NGO) representing residents of Parej East. The Requesters claimed that they had
   suffered harm as a result of failures and omissions of IDA         in the design and
   implementation of the CSESMP in Parej East Project area. They claim that their
   rights to participation      and consultation    were effectively denied them. The
   Requesters believe they have been deprived of fair and adequate compensation for
   their lands and villages. They have focused their key complaint on the failure to
   restore their income levels. Although previously landowners, they now claim to be
   living in colonies without legal possession of any land, where their former skills are
   no longer applicable, their productive sources dismantled, and their supporting
   networks and kin groups dispersed.

5. This harm is alleged to be the result of the Management violating various provisions
   of the following Bank policies and procedures: Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30),
   Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20), Environmental           Assessment (OD 4.01), Project
   Supervision (OD 13.05), Disclosure of Information (BP 17.50), and Management of
   Cultural Property (OPN 11.03).




                                                                                      vii

6.  In its Response of July 2001, Management maintained that the Bank had complied,
    and intended to continue complying,        with the relevant policies and procedures
    related to the design and implementation of the CSESMP.

7.  After reviewing Management's Response and visiting the Project area, the Panel
    recommended an investigation to the Board of Executive Directors. The Board
    approved the Panel's recommendation on September 7,200l.

8.  Subsequently, on January 11, 2002, the Panel sent Management two documents
    from the Requesters, which had been received too late to be considered during the
    eligibility phase. On April 4, 2002, Management commented on these documents in
    the form of a Second Response. After examining this second Response (Annex 3 to
    this report), the Panel considered it necessary to ask Management for clarification of
    two major issues. These clarifications were received on October 2, 2002.

                              Involuntary     Resettlement

9.  The Project involved the potential involuntary resettlement of over 2,500 families of
    whom 227 were in Parej East. More than 10,000 Project Affected People were
    entitled to income restoration, 628 of whom were in Parej East. Over 6,500 were
    targeted for self-employment assistanceof whom 202 were in Parej East.

10. A basic contention of the Requesters is that the design of the Parej East subproject
    has been flawed from the very beginning. Before the CSESMP was approved, they
    pointed out the need for a regional area-wide impact assessment of the effects of
    other local mines to aid in present and future planning. However, Management
    explained that this was not within the scope of the CSESMP.

11. In April 1994, Coal India Ltd. prepared and adopted a new corporate Resettlement
    and Rehabilitation (R&R) policy. In accepting it, Management decided that it would
    need to review the RAPS for each of the 14 mines after they had been prepared in
    order to satisfy itself that they were in compliance with OD 4.30.

12. The Panel observes that an area-wide plan for each of the 14 mines with involuntary
    resettlement was not a requirement of Coal India Ltd.`s R&R. At the same time,
    however, given the fact that in the future additional mines are expected in the area
    of Parej East, the preparation of an area-wide plan would have been a prudent
    course to take and might well have revealed many of the problems that have
    confronted Management.

13. The Panel finds that the original RAP for Parej East did not reflect the actual
   situation    in  Parej    East   and   was not     location-specific as required     by
   Management       when it approved Coal India Ltd.`s R&R policy. In the Panel's
   view, Management's        failure during appraisal to ensure that the original RAP
   reflected reality on the ground resulted in many problems that are at the root
   of    the   Requesters     complaints.   In  light  of   this, the  Panel finds    that


                                                                                           . .
                                                                                       Vlll

     Management's       appraisal of the Parej East RAP was not in compliance with
     paragraph 30 of OD 4.30.

Level of Compensation for Land

14. A basic principle of OD 4.30 is that displaced persons should be compensated for
     their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move. The Panel finds that,
     in Parej East, many of the displaced Project-affected        persons (PAPS) have not
     been and are not being compensated at full replacement cost, with the result
     that many of them have suffered and continue to suffer harm.

15. The Panel notes that although the Indian Land Acquisition Act reflects the principle
     in OD 4.30 that PAPS should be compensated for their land at its "market value," in
     practice, it defines "market value" to be the registered value of plots in official land
     records. Since, as a rule, these values are substantially under-reported, the principle
     is  effectively   disregarded    and   the   PAPS    are    usually  compensated      at
     considerably less than replacement cost, even with the customary 30 percent
     `solatium'  paid in addition to "market value."

16. When affected landholders         are not satisfied with compensation       decided by
     CCL and the District       Authorities,  they may seek a decision to increase the
     amount    from   a special tribunal,    constituted  under section 14 of the Coal
     Bearing Areas Act. In this regard, the Panel considers it revealing that, in all
     cases so far finalized     in Parej East, the Tribunal       has awarded     increasz
     compensation to those PAPS able to lodge an appeal. In the Panel's view, it is
     not appropriate     that PAPS should have to go through          a lengthy and costly
    judicial  processes to get just compensation, especially since not all PAPS can
     afford the direct costs of an appeal process and, even if they could, they would
     end up losing unless the costs of the appeal were added to their award. Even
     then, the delays and uncertainties     associated with the process could result in
     tangible harm, especially since the awards are subject to further           appeal by
     CCL. It is unfortunate to note that CCL is appealing all these decisions. In light
     of this,   the Panel finds     that   Management     was not in      compliance    with
     paragraph 3(b) of OD 4.30.

17. There is another problem: the lack of transparency in the compensation process. In
     the Panel's view, it is clear that, as the Requesters claim, the compensation
    process in Parej East was and is not transparent.           In light of this, the Panel
    finds that Management is not in compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.

Level of Compensation for Houses

18. Paragraph 14 of OD 4.30 requires that valuation of all assets be made at
    replacement cost. Since many of the oustees' original houses were constructed a
    long time ago, depreciation at 1.6 percent a year could be significant, in spite of the
    price escalation of five percent. Moreover, in view of the fact that housing costs



                                                                                           ix

    have risen since their original houses were built, it is likely that the difference
    between the depreciated value of their old houses and the replacement cost of a new
    house could be significant. In the Panel's view, both the process and the basis for
    house compensation is open to abuse and raises serious questions, as in the case
    of compensation for land noted above.

19. In April   2000, Coal India Ltd. made a major change that gives the PAPS an
    additional option. They may take a one time cash grant of Rs50,OOOin lieu of a
    house plot in the resettlement site. This grant is in addition to the above-noted
    compensation for loss of homestead land and house. Since then, as Management
    notes, 82 Project-affected families (PAFs) have chosen the cash option to relocate
    elsewhere than the resettlement site. This means that since early 2000 all PAFs have
    chosen cash.

20. In the Panel's view, it is difficult,  if not impossible, to reconcile the Bank's aim
    of development with a one time cash grant for acquisition         of home and land.
    Presenting a poor oustee, whose previous source of survival included a small
    patch of land, with a check may be a legal way of getting them to move on, but
    it should not be confused with         development. The Panel highlights      that the
    ESRP has recommended          that the Bank commission        a post-Project  audit to
    assessthe long-term results of the cash settlement approach.

Resettlement Sites

21. Management explains that resettlement sites compensate for loss of villages. There
    are two resettlement sites for Parej East. The main one is Pindra, where around 20
    PAFs have settled. The other is Prem Nagar where three PAFs have settled.

22. Concerning the choice of sites, the PAPS generally complain that they had never
    been consulted in their selection. They were guided to a pre-selected site and told to
    move there. The Panel finds that the PAPS in Parej East were not consulted in
    the selection of the Pindra resettlement site as required by paragraph 8 of OD
    4.30 and that Management was not in compliance with the OD in this respect.

23. Concerning causal labor opportunities,       OD 4.30 provides that "[flor   land-based
    resettlement, the new site's ... locational advantages should be at least equivalent to
    those of the old site." The Requesters claim that Pindra is further away from causal
    labor opportunities. Management only mentions the labor opportunities for Pindra
    resettlers at the coal-loading dump, not opportunities for causal labor or informal
    labor at the mine site, which is about three km. This lack of opportunity appearsto
   be confirmed by the fact that PAFs who were moved to very substandard temporary
    accommodation (barracks) to allow them some months to build their houses at
   Pindra have not yet moved there about three years later.

24. The Panel visited the barracks beside the CCL Headquarters              and observed
    that the conditions are pathetic, as the Requesters claim: they are hardly fit for



                                                                                         X

    human habitation,     especially families. Even so, however, it would now appear
    that the seven PAFs regard remaining there a better alternative than building a
    house in Pindra      because of the proximity      of the barracks    to causal labor
    opportunities    and the informal economy at the mine site.

25. Concerning the size of plots offered to the PAPS, OD 4.30 provides that planning
    for shelter, infrastructure, and services should take into account population growth.
    Management accepted Coal India Ltd.`s R&R policy on the clear understanding that
    it would have to review each RAP to be sure it contains the obligatory requirements
    for a successful RAP. The Parej East RAP simply repeated Coal India's R&R
    policy in respect of the size of plots, and did not provide for second-generation
    growth    or land for gardens and animals.         The Panel therefore     finds that
    Management's      appraisal of the Parej East RAP was not in compliance with
    paragraphs     13 and     19 of OD 4.30. However,         in practice,   Management
    immediately     recognized this flaw, and in response to CASS insistence, CCL
    allocated plots twice the size of that provided for in the RAP. In addition, since
    implementation     commenced, Management         has continued to press Coal India
    Ltd. to change its policy.

26. Concerning potable water, based on the Panel's review of the records available, it
    seems clear that the date set for the families to move to Pindra, December 15, 1999,
    was dictated by the scheduled mine expansion and that they were moved without
    establishing whether potable water was available at Pindra. For failing to ensure
    access to potable water before the PAPS were moved to the Pindra resettlement
    site, the Panel finds that Management        was not in compliance with paragraph
    19 of OD 4.30.

27. Concerning access to health care, the Panel finds that in the absence of statistics
    to show that morbidity     and mortality   in Parej East might be outside the norm,
    it is extremely difficult,  if not impossible, to ascribe any alleged increases to the
    Project.

28. Concerning schools, in December 1999, the PAPS from                Borwa   Tola  were
    involuntarily  relocated some distance away to Pindra. There they found a school
    building with no teachers, despite OD 4.30 and promises to the contrary. The Panel
    therefore finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 19 of
    OD 4.30 in this respect.

29. The Panel recognizes, however, that the current          situation differs completely
    from    that  anticipated    in 1999. With    the late 1999 introduction      of cash
    compensation, and the real prospect that the population of the Pindra site will
    not increase beyond about 20 instead of about 227 families, a new approach is
    needed.




                                                                                        xi

Cultural  Property

30. The Requesters raised several issues concerning cultural property, including two
     sacred groves (sarna) in the hamlets of Ganju Tola and Majhi Tola, a sacred grove
     in Borwa Tola, and the tribal graveyard of Pare, all of which are located in the path
     of mine expansion.

31. Management explains that the Sectoral Environmental Assessment for the Project
     did not identify   any issues related to cultural property, and OPN 11.03 on
     Management of Cultural Property in Bank-financed Projects was therefore found
     not to apply. Nevertheless, when issues have been raised by PAPS regarding sites of
     religious importance, Management maintains that they have been dealt with in a
     manner consistent with OPN 11.03.

32. While there are irresolvable issues related to cultural property management, in
     the Panel's view, Management has acted responsibly in consulting local people,
     and has acted in good faith in attempting      to mitigate the issues. It therefore
     finds Management in compliance with OPN 11.03.

Title to House Plot

33. OD 4.30 requires that in the case of both rural and urban resettlement, the borrower
     needs to make legal arrangements for transferring titles to resettlers. The Requesters
     claim that PAPS are living in a resettlement colony without legal possession of any
     land whereas before they were landowners. Management acknowledges the problem.

34.  The records show that the supervision         teams have consistently        reiterated
     Management's      expectations that  an, appropriate    solution   would    be found.
     Nevertheless, as Management acknowledges, the issue is still unresolved. The
     December 1998 Aide Memoire acknowledged that not only does the lack of pattas
     leave people with a sense of insecurity, but also it prevents them from accessing
     finance for income generation schemes. As a result, implementation            of these
     schemes is undermined.

35.  It is clear that the question of title transfer should have been identified        and
     dealt with when the Parej East RAP was prepared, as required under OD 4.30.
     CCL had already purchased the Pindra resettlement site by that stage. Now, up
     to four years after affected people have been involuntarily        resettled they are
     still suffering the harm that results from     lack of title, including    a sense of
     insecurity and, as Management itself has stated, an inability      to borrow for self
     employment     income restoration  schemes. The Panel finds that Management
     was not in compliance with paragraphs 13(c) and 14(a) of OD 4.30 when the
     RAP for Parej East was prepared.

36.  The Panel recognizes that the supervision        missions have raised the issue
     repeatedly. The Panel has not been able to ascertain whether a renewable 30-



                                                                                         xii

    year lease provides       the same security of tenure as the 99-year lease that
    Management      demanded. It is understood that Management           is continuing   to
    follow this issue closely through arrangements for post-Project monitoring        and
    reporting.

The Grievance Mechanism

37. Since a grievance mechanism was established in Parej East and appeals process
    described, the Panel finds that Management          is formally   in compliance   with
    paragraph 17 of OD 4.30. However, Bank staff were unable to confirm that any
    independent     person was on the grievance         committee.    The Panel is also
    concerned that it was unable to establish whether or not PAP members are
    elected democratically,     or are selected by authorities.

                               Traditional    Land Rights

38. The story of traditional land rights in Parej East reveals a serious failure to comply
    with   the relevant Bank policy       provisions. In proceeding with the CSESMP,
    Management apparently expected (and Coal India Ltd. agreed) that the PAPS,
    including the tribals, would be treated in accordance with Bank ODs 4.30 and 4.20
    with respect to compensation for land cultivated under traditional rights. Yet, when
    implementation commenced it became apparent that the laws of Bihar precluded
    automatic recognition of such rights. The Panel finds it difficult to understand how,
    at the time of preparation, Management could be unaware of this. Furthermore, it
    seems clear, however, that during preparation, Management did not raise any
    questions about the possible lack of legal recognition of traditional land rights, or
    the process required to ensure compensation for tribals cultivating traditional land
    without title or documentation.

39. Legal recognition of traditional land rights is a serious problem. In Bihar (and now
    Jharkand) authentication by state authorities is required. During its field visit, the
    Panel was told that this process was and is not on the District Administration's
    priority list, so it continues to be delayed, with the resulting serious consequences
    for the PAPS. Nearly eight years after adoption of the Coal India Ltd. policy, and the
    RAP for Parej East, about 150ha. out of a total of about 167ha. claimed by tribals
    "cultivating  land under tradition rights" have not been settled. This is extremely
    serious, in the Panel's view, and needs immediate action.

40. The Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 17 of
    OD 4.30 and paragraphs          15(c) and 17 of OD 4.20, in connection with the
    preparation of the Parej East RAP. At the same time, the Panel recognizes that
    after this flaw was raised by CASS and international            NGOs, Management
    acknowledged       the problem.    It  raised the issue to the level of a cross-
    conditionality   under the CSBP loan. And, since then, it has worked              with
   persistence to try to get the matter resolved.




                                                                                         ...
                                                                                      x111

41. The Panel questioned Management on this and received a response in mid October
    2002. The Panel notes that there are two villages in Parej East, Parej and
    Durukasmir. With respect to Durukasmar village, the Management Response is
    clear and no PAP's      have yet been relocated. For the village of Parej, the
    Management Response appears to deal only with one of the hamlets of Parej,
    namely Borwa Tola. This hamlet no longer exists so clearly every PAP has been
    relocated. Apparently six tribals from Borwa Tola claimed they were cultivating
    GMK land. Of these, two claims were rejected. Of the four claims approved two
    were paid compensation before relocation, one was not paid before relocation due to
    a bureaucratic error, and one had died but their heirs have not been informed of the
    claim. This response informs that 18 non-tribal PAPS apparently from Borwa Tola
    claimed they were also cultivating land under customary rights.
    This   response does not state whether compensation was paid, before their
    relocation, to the seven whose claims were authenticated. Of the 11 whose claims
    were rejected, Management could not discover the status of the appeal lodged by
    eight of them, so it would appear that they have relocated before a decision on their
    appeal. Finally, all three times Management has addressed this question in its
    response, it mentions that for Parej village a total of 8.17ha out of 59Sha has been
    authenticated and that claims regarding the other 42.44ha remain to be settled. None
    of the answers provide any further information on this, so the Panel does not know
    how many PAPS are involved, which hamlets of Parej village they are from, and
    whether or not they have been relocated. For the above reasons, the Panel notes
    that Management       has failed to provide the Panel with evidence that it has
    complied with the OD 4.30 with regard to the compensation of PAP's who own
    land under traditional   or customary rights, prior to their relocation.

                                  Forest Resources

Access to Forest Products

42. The Requesters claim that the basis for the PAPS former non-formal economy was
    income from common property resources. However, as a result of the expanded
    mining, common property resources have been greatly depleted, and are not being
    replaced. Management points out that the depletion of forest resources has been
    caused by several years of mining in the Parej East area unrelated to Bank funded
    projects so there has been a decreasein dependenceon such resources.

43. The Baseline Survey shows that there are no landless tribals because of the
    Chotanagpur Tenancy Act which prohibited the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals.
    It also shows that there are no tribals who depend exclusively on forest products.
    But it makes it very clear that most of the population, tribals and non-tribals were
    dependent,in varying degrees,on forest products for a portion of their income or for
    household use. The subsidiary occupation of 345 or 71.13 percent of the PAFs was
    collection of forest produce and it provided the third largest source of income,
    nearly ten percent.




                                                                                     xiv

44. The Panel finds that the Parej East Baseline Survey provides information         on
    the resource base of the affected population,     including  income derived from
    forest resources as required    by paragraph     11(h) of OD 4.30. However, for
    failing to recognize the dependence of the tribals on natural resources vital to
    their subsistence and ensuring continued access to these resources, the Panel
    finds that Management      was not in compliance with paragraph        15(a) of OD
    4.20.

Compensation for Loss of Access to Forest Products

45. As provided for in paragraph 15(c) of OD 4.30 the RAP states that the Pindra
    resettlement   site will provide equivalent   access to the forest, but it fails to
    support this statement with any details about the adjacent forest including
    whether the forest will support the same income earning opportunities       for the
    227 families originally  expected to move there, or whether the host community
    is prepared to share the resource. The Panel found no evidence to indicate that
    during appraisal Management       ensured that access would be available or that
    access to the forest beside Pindra would provide PAPS who moved there with
    equivalent compensation for loss of their access to forest products. Because of
    this, the Panel finds that Management     was not in compliance with paragraph
    15(c) of OD 4.30 during Preparation.

                               Income Restoration

46. The Bank's objective in OD 4.30 on Involuntary      Resettlement is to ensure that
    people who are displaced, benefit from       the project.  Displaced people must
    be assisted to improve    or least restore their standard    of living. In spite of
    significant  efforts on the part of a number of people during implementation,
    these objectives have not been achieved in Parej East and, as a result, PAPS
    have been harmed and continue to suffer harm.

47. It   is absolutely  essential for  the Bank     to support   difficult involuntary
    resettlement   challenges, but the Panel would     caution   that unless they are
    matched by time, the early planning     required by OD 4.30, and the resources
    and realism needed to achieve them, the poorest and most vulnerable          of the
    people affected by a project may end up carrying       a disproportionately  heavy
    burden.

48. In light of the above, the Panel finds that, as Management itself recognizes, it is
    not in compliance with paragraphs 3(b)(iii) of OD 4.30 since, according to the
    April  2002 Management Response, the income of at least 21 percent of EPAPs
    in the Parej East subproject had not been improved, still less, restored.




                                                                                     xv

RAP Entitlements    in Parej East

49. The Requesters maintain that three years after displacement the people of Turi Tola
    and Borwa Tola generally have not been given jobs or replacement land, and the
    self-employment opportunities have come to nothing.

Jobs in The Mine

50. During Project preparation and the early stages of project implementation, at least
    through late 1996, the records indicate that the Parej East PAPS were led to expect a
    mine job. In February 1997, the mine had expanded to within a few hundred yards
    of the hamlet of Turi Tola where the PAPS resisted relocation. At this point, the
    Bank supervision team noted the discrepancy between what the PAPS expected and
    the eligibility criteria in the RAP. They reported that the previous mine manager had
    given promises of jobs to PAPS with less than two acres of land.

51. In the Panel's view, it is quite understandable that PAPS who opted for jobs in
    June 1994 should naturally        expect to receive those jobs. Nor is it surprising
    that those who owned less than two acres continued to demand and expect jobs
    for land. It must have been a shock for them to discover otherwise when finally
    presented with the reality of their situation in early 1997. The Panel finds that
    Management      was not in compliance with paragraph 30(e) of OD 4.30 during
    preparation and appraisal of the Parej East RAP.

Land for Land

52. OD 4.30 states that preference should be given to land-based resettlement strategies
    for people displaced from agricultural settings. In April 2000, four years after the
    CSESMP Credit was granted, Coal India Ltd. revised its policy, essentially dropping
    the land-for-land option. Instead it provided for monetary compensation, in addition
    to land compensation, for those who lose land.

53. Under the Bank's policy, the land for land option is not mandatory,          but it is
    clearly preferred wherever possible. Under CCL's Parej East RAP, CCL was
    to offer assistance to PAPS to find replacement land. According to Management
    CCL received no requests for such assistance. But in the RAP some 117 opted
    for  this assistance and 115 qualified.        Management      also indicated in its
    Response that a large number of PAFs found replacement land, indicating that,
    with effort, it could be obtained. The Panel finds that Management was not in
    compliance with paragraph 4 of OD 4.30.

54. In September 2000, Coal India Ltd. received advice from International        Mining
    Consultants, Group Consulting Ltd., which, recognizing that Coal India Ltd.`s
    policy provides for nothing more than the cost of land, proposed that some
    transitional   costs should be contemplated in any land for land proposal, such as
    legal fees related to land purchase and allowances to cover the period between



                                                                                      xvi

    the   move    and   the  first  harvest.  The   Panel   agrees and     suggests that
    Management       take this advice fully    on hoard   before commencing      another
    similar project.

Non-Farm Based Self-Employment

55. The Panel finds that Management failed to ascertain the adequacy or feasibility
    of the self-employment      income rehabilitation  strategy in the Parej East RAP
    during appraisal and, after a Market       Survey was finally conducted in March
    1998, it failed to ensure that the recommended follow-up measures were taken.
    In light of this, Management      was not in compliance with paragraphs 24, 29,
    and 30 of OD 4.30.

Income Restoration through Self-Employment

56. The Requesters contend that self-employment         schemes have failed to restore
    incomes. In mid-1998, recognizing that non-farm self-employment schemes were
    limited,  the current supervision team insisted that Coal India Ltd. find other
    alternative income generating schemes, suggesting that the most obvious was land
    based.

57. During Project preparation      and appraisal, Management relied almost entirely
    on non-farm     self-employment    as the strategy to regain standards of living,
    without   assessing its feasibility for income restoration      in Parej East. As a
    result, many PAPS in Parej East have failed to restore their living standard and
    incomes to their previous levels and consequently have suffered and continue to
    suffer harm. In light of the foregoing, the Panel finds that Management was not
    in compliance with OD 4.30 in this respect.

Wage Labor

58. Coal India Ltd. R&R policy entitles sharecroppers, land lessees, tenants and day
    laborers to jobs with contractors stating that "Contractors will be persuaded to give
    jobs to eligible PAPS on a preferential basis, wherefeasible."

59. The Requesters state that while a few PAPS find daily wage employment around the
    mine, the majority are not able to do so. According to Management, CCL has now
    "made an agreement with the contractors who execute civil works contracts for the
    mine to employ PAPS as causal laborers."

60. In the Panel's view, it is positive that the supervision       team's efforts to get
    formal   agreement to employ PAPS as causal laborers have finally         succeeded
    and it is to be hoped that this will make quite a difference to some of the
    displaced families.




                                                                                     xvii

Changing PAPS into Entrepreneurs

61. The PAPS in Parej East were being asked to make a huge adjustment in their lives.
    In the Panel's view, it was unrealistic to assume that, in the space of five short
    years, people affected by the project in Parej East, many of them poor tribals lacking
    social mobility,  education, or an entrepreneurial culture, could be uprooted from
    their communities,    transferred to a new one, provided with training for self
    employment, and some level of monetary compensation, and then expected to
    improve, or at least restore, their former living standards, income earning capacity
    and production levels. Doubly unrealistic when it is realized that, before this change
    can commence, the implementing agency, CCL, must itself undergo a significant
    change in institutional culture and build new capacity to undertake environmental,
    social and resettlement work. The Panel found evidence that, with the Bank's
    assistance,progress had been made in this regard, but much remains to be done.

62. In the Panel's view it was a major       planning flaw for the Bank not to have
    recognized that it was unrealistic    to expect that the PAPS in Parej East could
    become entrepreneurs      in five years. In accordance with paragraph       30 of OD
    4.30 the feasibility of Parej East PAPS regaining their livelihood      through self-
    employment should have been reviewed when the RAP was appraised.

Rehabilitation  before Displacement

63. In the case of Parej East, there was a lengthy time period between completion of the
    RAP in 1994 and actual displacement in 1998, 1999, and 2000. According to
    experts, this time gap is usually about two years, not four, five, or six. Two years
    seem a sufficient amount of time to have the income restoration plans well in place
    to accommodate PAPS before they shift.

64. In the Panel's view, a feasible strategy for income generation should have been
    in place in Parej East at the time the RAP was prepared.

Transition  Period and Subsistence Allowances

65. The Requesters complain that many PAPS have lived and are living              off their
    compensation money. Although income figures provided by Management as of July
    2001 appearto show increases for some PAPS, the hardships and losses experienced
    by other PAPS during the period when they were without some income, is not
    known. The group of greatest concern are those 21 percent whose income has
    decreased.

66. A Bank expert on involuntary resettlement acknowledged that the Bank should
    require some sort of transition package, ideally cash income for a defined length of
    time that includes the period of retraining. Investment assistance after training was
    to be the central requirement of the 2002 RAPS.




                                                                                         . .
                                                                                     xv111

67.   On July 25, 2002, the Panel asked Management for a clarification as to whether the
     PAPS received the transition allowance' provided for in paragraphs 3.4.4 (A and B)
     of the Parej East RAP. In its response of October 16, 2002 Management provided
     data on PAPS who had received the Relocation Allowance              (Part A of 3.4.4).
     According to Management, 30 PAPS have received this `transition' allowance of
     Rs7000, but the Panel notes that there are PAPS that continue to suffer harm. In the
     Panel's view, Management         failed to ensure that the Parej East RAP made
     effective provision     for support during   a time-bound     transition   period after
     displacement     as required    by OD 4.30. Some PAPS have suffered harm             by
     temporarily    losing their standard of living and a number continue to do so.

68.  Management provided no data as to whether PAPS had received the Subsistence
     Allowance (Part B of 3.4.4). The Panel notes that Management's response of April
     2002 asserted that "no PAP has received a subsistence allowance because the
     eligibility criteria have not been met." The R&R budget for Parej East, however,
     contains a line item for subsistence allowance/grant for the years 1994 - 1998. No
     such line item appearsin the budget for years 1998-2002. Management has provided
     no explanation      concerning the disposition     of the monies allocated for the
     subsistence allowance/grant or the reasons why the PAPS were regarded as
     ineligible for this benefits or the procedures followed to arrive at this determination.
     The supervision reports made available to the Panel do not provide any further
     information    on this matter. The Panel finds that Management            has failed to
     demonstrate that its has complied        with paragraph    3(b) (ii) of OD 4.30 that
     requires that displaced persons "be supported during the transition           period in
     the resettlement site."

                     Alternative     Income Generating Schemes

Related to the Coal Industry

69.  Being given no legal right to coal supplies like company employees, the Requesters
     complain that the displaced PAPS have to resort to illegal acquisition of coal
     supplies, which makes them vulnerable to police action. Management notes that the
     CCL has never initiated any police action against the local population to prevent
     people from collecting coal for domestic use or for small-scale commercial soft
     coke production.

70.  In the Panel's      view, given the comparative       income    advantage,    it is not
     surprising that PAPS would prefer to engage in so called "illegal"         coal trading
     activities. During    its second visit,  the Panel found that the current          CCL
     Managing Director well understands the situation and shares the Panel's view
     that a way should be found to legalize the soft coke activity.




                                                                                          xix

Land Based Income Generation

71. Like the ESRP, the Panel believes that land-based income generation schemes
    would offer the most promising possibility for restoring or improving the lives of
    PAPS, in particular in Parej East. In the Panel's          view, the current    Bank
    supervision   team must he commended           for recognizing   that a land-based
    income restoration option was essential. Since doing so, the Team has made an
    impressive    effort to have it adopted. Noting the success of the one pilot in
    operation in another mine, the supervision team has recommended its immediate
    adoption in other subsidiaries. Unfortunately, this will not help the PAPS in Parej
    East.

                     Indigenous Peoples Development Plan

Separate IPDP for Trihals

72. Coal India Ltd. already had a community development program to cover vulnerable
    people and, during Project Preparation, Management proposed that CCL should
    restyle it to conform to the requirements of OD 4.20. Issued in September 1995,
    Coal India Ltd.`s revised Corporate Community        Development Plan, or "generic
    IPDP" was to serve as an umbrella terms of reference for mine-specific IPDPs,
    setting out guidelines for their preparation. Management found it to be in
    conformity with the OD 4.20.

73. The Panel considers that, while the Coal India Ltd. "generic IPDP"             is not
    directed exclusively at trihals, the decision to include all vulnerable people in
    the context of a framework      plan to he eventually applied to all 495 Coal India
    Ltd. mines was in conformity      with OD 4.20.

The Original Parej East IPDP

74. In late November      1995, the Asia      Social Unit  cleared the "generic IPDP"
    conditionally. It stated that "[alppraisal cannot be finalized until the mine specific
    IPDPs have been reviewed andfound to satisfy the requirements of OD 4.20."

75. In failing to require a review of IPDPs for all mines at appraisal,        the Panel
    finds that Management      was not in compliance with paragraph       18 of OD 4.20.
    Specifically, the IPDP for Parej East was not reviewed.

76. Coal India Ltd. was to prepare location-specific IPDPs for each mine. Where a
    community consisted only of tribals, a tailor made IPDP would reflect their needs.
    Where a community      was mixed, tribal and non-tribal, the benefits were to be
    directed to the vulnerable: tribals, women and youth.

77. In the Panel's view, as recognized by the ESRP, the Parej East IPDP should
    have been responsive to local needs. It was not. Moreover, Management clearly



                                                                                      xx

     erred in ignoring a local NGO report on the IPDP, especially since it did not
     itself review it. Having      failed to review the Parej East IPDP, Management
     could not have assessedwhether it was in compliance with paragraph 18 of OD
     4.20 during appraisal. The Panel finds that Management               did not ensure that
     the original Parej East IPDP was prepared in compliance with paragraph 18 of
     OD 4.20.

Annual Implementation        Plans

78.  Beginning    in   1998, community       development     activities  in  Parej East were
     implemented under annual hamlet-specific          IPDP Implementation       Plans. Later,
     however, a Bank supervision mission found that the CCL employees and the NGO
     engaged to develop annual village-specific implementation plans understood that
     the original generic Parej East IPDP actually defined the activities to be covered,
     and felt that very little alteration was allowed to reflect local village needs

79.  In its review, the Panel found that, each year, entire sections of the annual
     IPDP for Parej East are repeated verbatim,            including    the one indicating   a
     community's     "felt needs." Each year there appears to be a "one size fit all"
     plan for each of the 11 communities, regardless of specific needs.

80. In the Panel's view, OD 4.20 does not contemplate "indicative"            IPDPs either as
     a substitute for, or as a near-rigid        template for, location-specific   IPDPs. In
     Parej East, an indicative      IPDP was the basis for the Annual Implementation
     Plans, which turned out to be inflexible and largely unresponsive exercises. In
     light of this, the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with OD
     4.20 in the preparation of the original IPDP for Parej East.

Local Participation

81. OD 4.20 sets out the prerequisites for successful indigenous peoples plans. The first
     and fundamental one is community participation.

82. An early 1997 Bank supervision mission acknowledged that there had been
     virtually  no meaningful     participation   of indigenous people in the preparation
     of the IPDPs. Unlike the IPDPs for some other mines, the original              IPDP for
    Parej East does not describe any consultation or participation.           During its field
     visit, the Panel was able to confirm a lack of consultation in the preparation of
     the IPDP.    In light    of this, the Panel finds that, Management           was not in
    compliance with paragraphs 14(a) and 18 of OD 4.20.

83. OD 4.20 requires that the contents of an IPDP plan must include a "Strategy for
    Local Participation. " The community          development     strategy for Parej East is
    described in the exact same terms for all three mines in the two different
    States. Although      the strategy has evolved, it is not location specific, nor is it
    sensitive to the composition, structure and needs of the community.            In light of



                                                                                           xxi

    this, the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph
    15(d) of OD 4.20.

84. The Panel wishes to recognize, however, that recent efforts by Management
    have resulted in some progress in addressing an enormous challenge in Parej
    East. Not only does this challenge presume a massive shift in the institutional
    culture of the implementing     agents, who have other overriding     priorities, it also
    requires processes of participation     and involvement     that are new and strange
    to those who must relate to the project affected peoples and elements of civil
    society who represent them.

Dominance of Infrastructure    Activities

85. During   its investigation,  the Panel found that many of the IPDP activities in
    Parej East are disconnected, have little depth, are just marginal          and, on the
    whole, do not reflect a real "felt"    need. The Panel is concerned that there has
    been no concentration      on long-term    projects such as literacy and numeracy
    classes, maternal and child health, and self-help groups.

86. Although     very   late,  it  is  encouraging      to note    that  the  2002     IPDP
    implementation    plans consist exclusively of self-help group capacity building
    and income generation. The Panel would urge that Management take steps to
    ensure that this does in fact materialize.     It also urges Management        to ensure
    that the planned post-project       audit determine   whether Coal India Ltd. and
    CCL take steps to continue to improve relations with local civil society groups
    like  CASS     and to maintain       and   strengthen   a participatory,      bottom-up
    approach to preventing and ameliorating        the environmental    and social impacts
    of their mines on affected peoples, especially the most vulnerable, including the
    tribals.

                            Environmental       Compliance

Land Reclamation and the Parej East RAP

87. The Requesters' main environmental concern is the preservation of topsoil and the
    restoration of the surface for agricultural use. The Panel was not shown nor did it
    observe any topsoil conservation during its visit to the Parej East Open Pit.
    Although    requested at the site, no documentation       or information    on the five
    year CSESMP mine reclamation program could be provided to the Panel team.
    The Panel found little     evidence that the mine level staff had training          and
    knowledge     of soils and reclamation     activities at the Parej East site. Mine
    rehabilitation  and closure appears to be handled as a separate matter to mine
    planning    and operation    and staff were unable to provide         the Panel with
    evidence that the eventual configuration      and rehabilitation  of mined areas were
    being planned.




                                                                                        xxii

88. Despite persistent efforts by NGO's and the ESRP, the reclamation          of mined
    land to a situation that would allow tribals to reuse land taken for mining, has
    not happened, as noted by the ESRP. Management           must have been aware of
    the lack of action on reclamation     at least since the 1997 report of the ESRP,
    findings that were repeated in their 2000 and 2001 reports. And it must also
    have been aware of CCL's position that it had no intention of reclaiming mined
    areas for post-mining    use. At the same time, this does not constitute a formal
    violation of Annex C of OD 4.01 as far as land reclamation         in Parej East is
    concerned.

89. As reclamation    was included in the Coal India Ltd. Environmental       Policy for
    new mines, the Panel fully      agrees with   and supports the ESRP view that
    Vmproving     reclamation   of mined     land in the future    ... is an issue ...
   fundamental to GIL's future environmental and social performance."

90. The    Panel also notes and supports        the recommendations      made    by the
    international  consultants   (IMC)   in the Report commissioned      by Coal India
    Ltd. entitled Strengthening Social and Environmental       Management Capacity.
    This   study  formed    part  of the CSESMP       and the Panel thus deems its
    recommendations      to be of particular  relevance. The first recommendation         is
    that each subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. be required to prepare and implement
    an Environmental      Management Strategy. The second advises that Coal India
    Ltd. improves planning      systems for new mines, with particular      reference to
    land use issues and reinstatement      of mined areas to agricultural    use. In the
    Panel's view, the implementation       of the IMC    recommendations     is vital. In
    addition, because present legal conditions prevent the transfer of land acquired
    under the CBA Act, the IMC recommends that Coal India Ltd. should lobby
    the Government to amend existing legislation to allow for the eventual transfer
    of reclaimed land.

Water Quality Management at Parej East

91. The Requesters have a number of complaints about water quality monitoring
    commitments. Management explains that monthly environmental monitoring reports
    are submitted by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI) on air
    quality, water quality, and noise level. The monitoring results are further reviewed
    on a quarterly basis by the supervision consultant, DCL, and by the Bank during
    each supervision mission.

92. The Panel was shown that systems have been implemented to prevent the release of
    untreated mine water and effluent from the maintenance yard; that systems have
    been implemented to recycle and reuse mine water and cleaned effluent water from
    the maintenance yard; and standard analyses of December 2000 and March 2001
    which showed that all water quality parameters, except for manganese levels, were
    within permissible limits. No coliforms were reported from any samples. The Panel
    notes that the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI),         in whose



                                                                                         . ..
                                                                                     xx111

     laboratories these analyses are made and from where the monthly environmental
     monitoring reports emanate, is, like CCL, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited.

93.  The Requesters complain that the Company wants to build a bore well for the
     employee's colony in Lupuntandi, which will affect the water level of the tribal
     village. The Panel noted that, although sunk, the Lupuntandi tube well which is in
     close proximity   to the recently dug Prem Nagar resettlement site well, has
     fortunately not been fitted with a pump and is not in operation.

94.  The Requesters complain       that sewage from     the CCL      employee's colony is
     discharged into the fields of Lupuntandi. Parej East OCP staff showed the Panel a
     modern and efficiently    operating sewage treatment facility in the mine employees
     colony. On the other hand, the Prem Nagar resettlers showed the Panel a mal-
     functioning  sewage pump station close to their site. Here raw sewage was
     overflowing and being prevented from contaminating agricultural land by a hand-
     constructed earth berm erected by the villagers. The Panel believes that careful
     monitoring    of the domestic     sewerage treatment     facility serving  the CCL
     employees' mine colony is required to ensure that malfunctioning          equipment
     does not lead to raw sewage leaking into the three rain-fed agricultural      plots -
     cultivated  by tribals under claimed customary        rights -and causing a health
     hazard.

95.  The   Panel   found   no evidence     that  the Sectoral    Environmental    Impact
     Assessment, (SEIA) which contained the Parej East five year Environmental
     Action Plan (EAP), was made "available at some public place" in Parej East
     "accessible to affected groups and local NGOs for their review and comment."

96. Based on its review of the documentation       and interviews, the Panel notes that
     while Management      ensured that the SEIA and the Parej East EAP and RAP
     were placed in the Bank's Public InformationCenters        (PIC) in Washington and
     New Delhi before appraisal, it failed to ensure that the reports were available
     in Parej East at a public place accessible to affected groups and local NGOs for
     their review and comment, not even a summary of their conclusions "in a form
     and language meaningfkl      to the groups being consulted," as required by OD
     4.Ol/BP 17.50. In light of this, the Panel finds that Management          was not in
     compliance with paragraph        21 of OD 4.01 and paragraph      12 of BP 17.50 in
     respect of disclosure.

Parej East Public Information    Center

97. In 2001, it is obviously not possible to verify what precise documents were or
     were not available in the Parej East Center in 1996/97. In the Panel's view,



                                                                                     xxiv

     however, the location of the Center in the office of the R&R          Officer, in the
     gated    CCL    mine    Headquarters'     compound,     does nothing    to  facilitate
     information    being provided    ". . .in a timely manner and in a form       that is
     meaningful for, and accessible to, the groups being consulted." On the contrary,
     for poor, vulnerable     and now dependent people, it is clearly intimidating        to
     approach    an office in that location,      let alone walk  in and freely    request
     information,     register   complaints      and   engage   in  dialogue.   When       a
     representative of an NGO was present, the Panel witnessed an atmosphere,
     tone and mood that was not at all conducive to any kind of open exchange of
     information.   Moreover,    the information     being provided in 2001 was largely
     technical and inaccessible to project affected people and without         summaries
     "...of its conclusions in a form and language meaningful        to the groups being
     consulted." Management could and should have been aware of this. In light of
     this, the Panel finds Management not in compliance with paragraph 21 of OD
     4.01 and paragraph 12 of BP 17.50.

                                     Consultations

98. The Requesters,both in their Request for Inspection, in prior communications to the
     Bank, and in subsequentcommunications to the Panel, allege lack of consultation in
     both the preparation and implementation phases of the CSESMP. In a sense,this is
     their bottom-line    complaint. Management considers that consultation has been
     carried out in all respects,both at the preparation and implementation stage.

Environmental    Assessment and Environmental        Action Plan

99.  The    Panel finds    no evidence of, and no documentation           of, meaningful
     consultations    on the Sectoral Environmental        Impact   Assessment and the
     Environmental      Action Plan with the PAPS or local NGOs in Parej East, as
     required under OD 4.01. In light of this, the Panel finds that Management was
     not in compliance with paragraph         20 of OD 4.01 concerning consultations in
     Parej East on preparation      of the Sectoral Environmental     Impact Assessment
     and the Parej East Environmental        Action Plan.

Preparation   of Resettlement Action Plan

100. Based on a review of the records and interviews in the field, the Panel found no
     evidence to indicate that, apart from being interviewed for the Baseline Survey,
     the PAPS were consulted in the preparation of the Parej East RAP itself.

101. The Panel recognizes that Management           ensured that the PAPS in Parej East
     were interviewed during the process of the Baseline Survey preparation        and, to
     the extent that this provided inputs for the RAP, finds that Management was in
     compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.




                                                                                        xxv

102. But, beyond these interviews,     there is nothing to indicate that the PAPS in
     Parej East were `%ystematically informed and consulted during preparation of
     the resettlement plan about their options and rights." In light of this, the Panel
     finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.

103. The evidence is clear that the host community      for the Pindra resettlement site
     was not consulted during project preparation       and, in light of this, the Panel
     finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 9 of OD 4.30.

Implementation   of Resettlement Action Plan

104. The Panel notes that, after the RAP was prepared, consultation with PAPS and
     PAP participation    in the resettlement process, was to be undertaken entirely
     through   the implementing    NGO, but also observes that in Parej East the
     implementing   NGO, Xavier Institute (XISS), set up an office in Parej East only
     in July 1997. During     the three years that elapsed since the RAP had been
     prepared there is scant evidence of consultations on planning for displacement,
     except occasionally at the insistence of CASS. The Panel finds, however, that
     once XISS began work, there was systematic consultation and involvement          of
     the PAPS, on behalf of CCL, and therefore finds Management           in compliance
     with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.

Consultation with Parej East NGOs

105. The Panel notes Management's       view that consultation with local NGOs was to
     be undertaken exclusively with the implementing      NGOs, but also observes that
     in Parej East the implementing      NGO, XISS (employed only in March         1997)
     was located in Ranchi, and could not be considered a local NGO until it set up
     an office in Parej East only in July 1997. It is evident therefore that, prior to
    mid 1997, any consultation      the borrower    may have had with XISS did not
     constitute consultation with a local Parej East NGO. It is also worth noting that
    since XISS was contracted by CCL it was accountable to the subsidiary           that
    employed it. In the Panel's view, it is, at best, not clear how this arrangement
    could serve to discharge Management's       obligation to ensure consultation with
    local NGOs acting on behalf of the PAPS, rather than on behalf of CCL. At
     worst, it places the implementing     NGO in a serious conflict    of interest, the
     results of which the Panel itself had the opportunity   to witness.

106. The Panel notes, however, that Bank staff did meet with CASS in the field at
    least once in 1996 and twice in 1997. Beginning in early 1998 and through to
    February    2000, the supervision team did, after consultation      with Coal India
    Ltd., systematically   respond to CASS letters, and met with the NGO several
    times in the field to discuss issues. However, this ended in March         2000 and
    since then, the Panel understands there has been no communication           between
    the Bank and CASS.




                                                                                    xxvi

107. The Panel therefore finds that, before 1998 and after 2000, Management           did
     not ensure that the views of "local NGOs" in Parej East were taken "fully into
     account in the project design and implementation"     as suggested by paragraph 19
     of OD 4.01, in particular    with regard to implementation      of the RAP. In this
     respect, Management was not in compliance with paragraph 19 of OD 4.01.

                                     Supervision

108. The Requesters allege that the Bank has failed to adequately supervise the CSESMP
     project as guaranteed when it undertook the project. Management maintains that it
     conducted an intense supervision effort.

The Supervision Consultant

109. The SAR noted that the Bank's supervision missions would not be able to visit all
     the subprojects even once a year. In light of this, a local consultancy company was
     engaged to supervise all the project mines at least once every quarter. The Bank
     found the supervision consultant's environmental reporting adequate, but, after the
     first two reports, the February 1998 supervision team was not satisfied with his
     reporting on social mitigation. This was monitored for the next year until the mid-
     term review of March 1999 when the supervision team still considered the social
     reporting inadequate. Supervision of the environmental aspects was done almost
     exclusively by one Bank expert who told the Panel that, given the huge scale of the
     CSESMP, he relied completely on the supervision consultant's reports.

110. In the Panel's view, it is most unfortunate that Management did not act on the
     unsatisfactory   nature of the supervision     consultant's   reports on the social
     aspects of the Project before February 1999. By that time, over three years had
     passed since the local NGOs        in Parej    East had begun to submit        their
     complaints   about lack of consultation. As the Panel reported earlier, it found
     no evidence of consultation on the preparation of the SEIA and the RAP, which
     deals with matters that have a fundamental      impact on the future well being of
     those being forced to resettle. The Panel would also note that the ESRP reports
     should have alerted Management       to a number of problems as early as April
     1997, two years before it concluded that its supervision consultant's       reports
    were unsatisfactory.    In light of this, the Panel finds that, prior    to February
     1999, Management was not in compliance with OD 13.05 on Bank Supervision.

Bank Supervision Missions

111. Up to June 30, 2001, Management        undertook 21 supervision missions during
    the implementation    period, with each of the 25 mines being visited once a year.
    In the case of Parej East, it undertook 18 missions, an average of six per year.
    Thus,    supervision  of the CSESMP        in Parej    East has been regular     and
     represents an intense supervision     effort in terms of resources allocated and
    numbers     of visits. In part,  because of the inadequacy        of the supervision



                                                                                    xxvii

     consultant's reports, the supervision team's knowledge of ground realities was
     limited, and for that reason, their efforts to resolve problems had virtually     no
     impact on the ground.

112. Judging from the Back to Office Memoranda,        Aide-Memoires,    other mission
     reports and documents since 1998, Management has not hesitated to he frank
     about problems and difficulties  encountered. It has also proposed solutions and
     worked with the borrower     to find ways of achieving them, and to the extent
     that Management can, to follow-up. In the Panel's view, based on this evidence,
     the supervision team generally made a significant     effort to overcome some of
     the problems stemming from the flawed RAP and IPDP for Parej East.

113. Since its establishment,  the current  supervision   team has generally made a
     significant effort to overcome the major problems outstanding       and, short of
     suspending or canceling the Credit, doing its best to translate its efforts into
     outcomes on the ground. In light      of this, the Panel finds that since 1998
    Management has been in compliance with OD 13.05.

Part One: Introduction


                                              Chapter 1

1. The Coal Sector Environmental                                 and Social Mitigation
                                               Project

1.    The Coal Sector Environmental Social Mitigation               Plan (CSESMP) was initially
      conceived as a component of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation                     Project (CSRP).
      Starting in 1990, preparation began with the aim of supporting India's reform and
      expansion of the coal sector. Mitigation           of the resulting environmental and social
      impacts was initially      a part this Project and was included in the Initial Executive
      Project Summary of March 1992. In 1993, the Government of India (GOI) formally
      requested financial assistance from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
      Development (IBRD) for the investment components of the Project, and from the
      International Development Association (IDA)               for the environmental and social
      mitigation measures required to bring the then selected mines in line with Indian
      laws and regulations as well as the Bank's operational policies and procedures.
      Subsequently, in November 1995, the project was split into an environmental and
      social component, the CSESMP, and an investment component, the CSRP. The
      CSESMP        was designed to assist Coal India             Ltd.`s    efforts to mitigate       the
      environmental and social impacts of mining expansion to be undertaken in 25 mines
      under the proposed CSRP.2Later, after being tested and revised as necessary during
      the five-year time slice financed by the Bank, Coal India Ltd. anticipated applying
      its new environmental and social mitigation policies in more of its 495 mines.

2.    In May 1996, Management informed some international NGOs that the CSESMP
      and the CSRP          would    be linked        by  cross conditionality.    This     meant that
      disbursements under the CSRP for any particular mine would be contingent on
      timely and effective implementation of the mine specific RAPS, EAPs, and IPDPs.
      Thus, for example, if implementation were to be unsatisfactory at Parej East, then
      the Bank would suspend or cancel further disbursements for that mine under the
      CSRP.3

3.    In the same month, May 1996, the International Development Association (IDA)
      granted a Credit of US$63 million to finance the CSESMP. On September 9, 1997,
      the Executive Directors approved an IBRD Loan for the equivalent of US$530
      million   and an IDA Credit to India for about US$2 million                 equivalent to help
      finance the CSRP. Because of implementation difficulties, it was cancelled in July
      2000. Coal India Ltd., however, decided to continue with mitigation                     programs
      started under the CSESMP. On April 20, 2001, it requested, and the Bank agreed,to

       the time the extension was granted, about US$24 million was undisbursed.4

4.     This Report concerns only the Parej East mine, owned and operated by Central Coal
       India Ltd. (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. (GIL). This opencast mine is one
       of the 25 coalmines selected for CSESMP financing. The mine is located in the
       midst of a number of mines in the West Bokaro Coalfield of Hazaribagh District,
       near Ranchi, in the state of Jharkand (formerly part of the state of Bihar until August
       2000). Mining began at Parej East in 1993. Two villages are affected by this mine
       expansion - Parej and Durukasmar.S




                             Box 1. India Coal Sector Backwound
        According to the CSESMP Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) coal currently meets two-
        thirds of India's energy needs, and India's coal resources are large enough to meet
        projected demands for the next 250 years. Indigenous coal is likely to remain the
        least costly option for the bulk of India's energy needs for the foreseeable future.
        However, coal production, whether opencast or underground, requires access to
        land.

        According to the SAR, it has become increasingly difficult for Coal India Ltd. to
        acquire land for the expansion of its operations, and in recent years the social and
        environmental costs of developing coal reserves have increased steeply, particularly
        in densely populated areas. Several studies have shown that the expansion of coal
        mining into remote areashas a profound impact on local people and communities,
        who originally     had only limited      contact with the modern world,           and whose
        livelihood was based mainly on subsistence agriculture, hunting, and foraging for
        forest products.




4The World Bank extended the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project (CSRP) Loan of about US$530 million
and Credit of about US$2 million 14 months later on September 9, 1997. The Loan and Credit became
effective nine months later on June 17, 1998.

       2. Inspection Panel Asked to conduct Investigation

5.      The Panel's investigation was initiated by a Request for Inspection submitted to the
        Panel on June 21, 2001. The Request was submitted by Ms. Bina Stanis of
        Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS), a local NGO representing residents of
        the Parej East coal mining project area (together referred to as `the Requesters').


2.1.      The Request for Inspection

6.      The Requesters claimed that they have suffered harm as a result of failures and
        omissions of IDA in the design and implementation of the CSESMP in Parej East
        Project area. Moreover, this harm is alleged to be a result of the Bank violating
        various provisions of the following           Bank policies and procedures: Involuntary
        Resettlement (OD 4.30), Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) Environmental Assessment
        (OD 4.01), Project Supervision (OD 13.05) Disclosure of Information (BP 17.50)
        and Management of Cultural Property (OPN 11.03).

7.      Citing the objectives of the CSESMP, the Request points out the PAPS understood
        that the implementation of the Project would mean "that the quality of their lives
        would improve, that they would share in the benefits of the mining project, that their
        displacement and relocation would be undertaken as a development programme,
        that their former living standards, income earning capacity and production levels
        would be restore [d], if not improved."6 Instead, they assert that "now, as the end of
        the CSESMP project is imminent, it has failed in its professional aims and failed in
        the guarantees that were given to the PAPS, guarantees that were used as levers to
        win consent to give their land and livelihood for the project."'

8.     The Requesters claim that their rights under the World Bank policies cited above
       were not respected. They            also claim        that their rights to participation          and
       consultation were effectively denied to them, and that their attempts to raise the
        aforementioned concerns were not successful.

9.     The Requesters allege that failure to provide income restoration has resulted in
        significant harm since they are now without compensatory land, employment or
       self-employment, and they now subsist as causal laborers at mere survival levels
       with a total loss of human dignity. They assert that they have "a right to fair and
       adequate compensation for         the loss of their lands and villages,"8 and they focus
       their complaint on the "key issue" of failure to restore their income levels. One of

                                                                                                           4

        the reasons they assert that income restoration has not taken place is that mine
        expansion has greatly depleted their common property resources such as water, fruit
        trees, and forest sourcesfor fodder, fuel, and building material.

 10. Moreover,        they maintain       that "monetary         compensation for         private      income
        producing assets (land) has not been adequate to secure replacement by other
        income producing         assets (replacement land, other capital                assets), and that
        ultimately [the cash compensation they receive] is spent on consumer items."9 They
        assert that although they were former landowners, they now live in colonies without
        legal possession of any land, where their former skills are no longer applicable, their
        productive sources are dismantled, and their supporting networks and kin groups are
        dispersed.

 11. The Requesters further claim that Coal India Ltd.`s resettlement and rehabilitation
        policy has kept employment by the company to a minimum, and they assert that the
        "much flaunted self-employment projects which the Bank guaranteed would fill                         in
        for the ... shortages, are grossly failing         to replace livelihood, if they have at all
        materialized."`o They do concede that training has been given, but they say it is
        "often short and ineffective, and not linked to explicit employment opportunities.""

 12. The Requesters also allege that they now suffer increased illness as a result of the
        pollution of wells and other water sources in the resettlement colonies. They claim
        that there are no medical services to handle increased illnesses, even though a
        dispensary was built, and they now lack other basic services, such as education.

 13. The Requesters nevertheless called on Management and the Board of Executive
        Directors to extend the CSESMP, and requested that the remaining money be
        targeted toward the restoration of livelihoods of the PAPS as well as environmental
        remediation.`*

14. The above summarizes the main body of the Request for Inspection. There are 55
        attachments to the Request, which show the Requesters' correspondence with the
        Bank, starting from early 1996. These attachments contain details of the Requesters'
        complaints, which will be referred to often in this Report.


2.2.      Management          Response

15. The Panel received Management's Response to the allegations in the Request on
        July 20, 2001. Management maintained that the Bank had complied, and intended to
        continue complying, with the relevant policies and procedures related to the design
        and implementation of the CSESMP.

                                                                                                             5

 16. Management acknowledged that throughout the Project, resettlement in Parej East
        encountered a number of problems, which, in their view, resulted from an initial
        lack of flexibility  and understanding on the part of mine management, and from
        resistance by the PAPS to resettlement. Nonetheless, they claimed that while the
        problems have not been entirely overcome, there has been progress.

 17. Management explains that the borrower began to implement the CSESMP later than
        anticipated, i.e. towards the end of 1997, about 18 months after the Credit became
        effective. Management admits that during 1998 and 1999 progress was both slow
        and uneven across the 25 mines under the Project, and that it was only in the first
        half of 2000 that significant progress began on implementation throughout all the
        mines. However, even then, economic rehabilitation remained unsatisfactory. As a
        result of this, as well as for other reasonsrelated solely to the implementation of the
        CSRP, Management states that the investment loan was cancelled at the request of
        the Borrower.

18. Management noted that since the purpose of the CSESMP was to mitigate impacts
        of the CSRP and to strengthen Coal India Ltd.`s capacity to manage such mitigation
        issues, the Bank's withdrawal from the CSESMP would not have provided the
        context for continued dialogue. Management further pointed out that the Bank's
        withdrawal might have adversely affected "the considerable task that still remained
        regarding improvement of mitigation efsorts."`3 Therefore, Management decided to
        "continue to actively work with CIL to help develop practical solutions to improve
        environmental and social mitigation at the mine and corporate level, and to achieve
        compliance with Bank policies."`4 Management believed that after cancellation of
        the CSRP there had been noticeable progress on implementation of the CSESMP.

19. Management further maintains that it has devoted full attention to the intense
        supervision effort required by the scale and complexity of the Project's physical,
        mitigation, and institutional activities. Management also asserts that consultations
        have been adequate,but admits that Coal India Ltd. did not consult the PAPS before
        it introduced changes on eligibility          and entitlements in its Resettlement and
        Rehabilitation (R&R) policy in the year 2000.

20. Referring to the Requesters' right to adequate and fair compensation for loss of
        villages and land, Management explains that resettlement sites constitute the
        compensation for loss of villages. Management acknowledges that resettlement in
        Parej East had encountered a number of problems "deriving from initial lack of
       flexibility and understanding on the part of mine management, and from resistance
        to relocation by the PAPs."`~ Management also assertsthat in addition to the general

       resistance to relocation that exists in every involuntary        relocation situation,
       difficulties arose in Parej East because of the PAPS' changing demands that
       undermined previous agreements between mine management and the PAPS.

21. In response to the Requesters' claim that they are without legal titles or long term
       leases for house plots in resettlement sites, Management agrees and says that the
       supervision team had raised the issue during each of its missions, and that they
       would continue to seek a resolution of it. Management assertsthat it is satisfied that
       compensation paid to entitled PAPS (EPAPs) for agriculture land was equivalent to
       replacement costs. To this they add that CCL           cannot delay the release of
       compensation payments to avoid PAPS spending the cash they receive on consumer
       items rather than on land or houses.

22. According to Management, common property resources are available for those
       choosing to shift to the resettlement sites. Management is also satisfied that the
       compensation provided for houses enabled the PAPS to construct a replacement
       house at par with their original house as required under the Bank's OD 4.30.

23. Management observes that it is too early to judge whether efforts made will result in
       full income restoration as intended. It acknowledges that mine jobs are limited to
       those losing more than two acres. Otherwise compensation consists of training and
       assistance for self-employment. Management acknowledges that this "cannot by
       itself bring about full economic rehabilitatio?P   or result in an income comparable
       to working in the mines. Availability  of replacement land through market purchase
       is limited and Management is still discussing the possibility of introducing land-
       basedincome generation with CCL.

24.    According to the Management, ,the Environmental         Assessment did not identify
       issues related to the Bank's policy on cultural property (OPN 11.03) and, therefore,
       the policy did not apply. However, Management claims that when issues have
       arisen, "they have been dealt with in a manner-consistent with"17the policy.

25.    Management also asserts that the Bank policy on disclosure of information (BP
       17.50) has been complied with in Parej East, but agrees that the Borrower did not
       permit release of the CSESMP mid-term review.

26.    In terms of services in the resettlement sites, Management asserts that a drinking
       water problem has been corrected, but that the school and health clinics are not yet
       staffed. Management stated that the supervision team would continue to follow up
       on this issue with CCL.

27. In its Response, Management announced that the CSESMP closing date had been
       extended for one year until June 30, 2002.`* Management claims in this connection
       that some "key activities" related to the extension of the closing date "will                     also
       address the issues raised in the Requestfor Inspection."19


2.3.      The Panel Report and Recommendation

28.    For purposes of determining the eligibility           of the Request and the Requesters, the
       Panel reviewed the evidence submitted by the Requesters and Management. Also
       during a field visit between August 8 and 14, 2001, Panel Members, Jim MacNeill
       and Edward Ayensu,*Omet with Government and World Bank officials in New
       Delhi. They then visited the Parej East Project area where they met with the PAPS
       and officials of CASS who represent them. They also met with officers of the CCL.
       Before and after the visit, the Panel consulted with the Bank Executive Director
       representing India and his staff.

29.    On August 20, 2001, the Panel submitted its Report on the eligibility                          of the
       Requesters and the Request and its recommendation on the Request for Inspection.
       It concluded that the Requesters were eligible and that the Request met all of the
       technical eligibility    criteria contained in paragraph 9 of the 1999 Clarifications.21 It
       also concluded that the Request and Management's Response contained conflicting
       assertions and interpretations about the issues, the underlying assumptions, the facts,
       compliance with Bank policies and procedures, and harm and potential harm. The
       Panel therefore recommended an investigation into the matters alleged in the
       Request.


2.4.      The Board's Decision

30.    On September 7, 2001, the Executive Directors recorded on a non-objection basis,
       their approval of the Panel's recommendation for an investigation.


2.5.      Supplementary           Submission and Management                     Comments

31. On January 11, 2002, the Panel sent Management two documents received from the
       Requesters, which         the Requesters had intended to annex to the Request.
       Unfortunately, the Panel received the documents too late to be considered during the
       eligibility phase. They are attached as Annex 2 to this Report.




l8The need for an extension was apparently envisaged as early asFebruary 1999. Coal India Ltd. requested
it on March 26,2001, and the Government formally requested an extension in April.

                                                                                                            8

32. The first of these documents is a note elaborating on Paragraph 4(a) of the Request,
       and lists the provisions of ODs 4.30 and 4.20 that the Requesters' believed have not
       been observed. The second document is an analysis conducted by CASS, in table
       form, of what has happened to the PAPS who have already been displaced from the
       four hamlets in Parej East.22

33. Management sent its comments on these documents to the Panel on April 4, 2002 in
       the form of a Second Response.In it, Management statesthat all issues raised by the
       Requesters were investigated by the CSESMP team during a mission to Coal India
       Ltd. headquarters and the Parej East mine                 from    February 4 to        14, 2002.
       Management assertsthat its Second Response provides additional evidence that it is
       in compliance with all relevant policies and procedures. Management's Second
       Response is attached as Annex 3 to this Report. After examining this second
       Response (Annex         to this report), the Panel considered it necessary to ask
       Management for clarification            of two major issues. These clarifications            were
       received on October 2, 2002.


2.6.     The Investigation           Process

34. The investigation phase was conducted by Panel member Ms. Maartje van Putten
       (Lead Inspector) and then Panel Member Jim MacNeill.23 It consisted of two parts.
      The first part took place at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, DC while
       the second took the form of in-country, fact-finding visits. To facilitate its work, the
      Panel enlisted the services of three consultants who are experts in their respective
      fields: Professor Sachchidananda, anthropologist and social scientist, Professor
      Richard     Fuggle,    environmental         specialist, and Professor Elliot        M.   Fratkin,
       anthropologist and social scientist. The Panel also hired Ms. Tatiana Tassoni to
       assist the Secretariat on this investigation. Mr. Serge Selwan assisted in finalizing
      the Report and a translator, C. K. Singh, assistedthe Panel in the field visits.

35. The Panel studied all relevant documents available to it, and analyzed the facts
      presented to it during the field visits. The Panel also interviewed World Bank staff
      both in Washington, DC and the New Delhi Office.

36.    The Panel Team made two visits to India, and in particular to Parej East. During
      these visits, the Panel met with officials of the Governments of India and Jharkand,
      Coal India Ltd., and Central Coalfields Ltd. In Ranchi and Parej East, the Panel
      Team also met with the representatives of the Requesters (CASS), project affected
      people, members of the CSESMP facilitating NGO, Xavier Institute (XISS), and
      others in the area knowledgeable about the Project. The Team met with project-
      affected people in the resettlement sites of Prem Nagar and Pindra, the temporary
      barracks, and villages in Durukasmar from which people have not yet been

22Both documents were received as a supplements to the June 14,200l   Request for Inspection, and are
attached as Annex 2 to this Report (hereinafter `Supplement to Request').
23Mr. Jim MacNeill served as a Panel Member from August 1997 through July 2002, and thereafter
continued to work on this report until its completion.


                                                                                                      9

    displaced. Five of the eleven Parej East hamlets included in the Indigenous Peoples
   Development Plan were visited.

37. The investigation of the preparation and design aspects of the CSESMP was based
    entirely on an examination of the relevant documents available to the Panel, since
    the staff involved have largely left the Bank and are unavailable.




                                                                                    10

                          3. Involuntary             Resettlement


38. The Project envisaged the involuntary resettlement of a large number of families
      and individuals.     As shown in the following              table, the Project as a whole
      contemplated the resettlement of over 2,500 families, 227 of whom were in Parej
      East. More than 10,000 PAPS were entitled to income restoration, 628 of them in
      Parej East. Over 6,500 were targeted for self-employment assistance,of whom some
      202 were in Parej East.




39. The potential impacts were also significant. In 1994, a year before the CSESMP
      began operations, a Xavier Institute (XISS)24 study summed up the general changes
      brought about by the existing coal mines in the vicinity of Parej East as follows: "0~1
      the one hand Coal mining has brought many benefits to all those people who are
      directly employed by CCL (or TISCO) and those who are otherwise involved in the
      `Coal Business' as it is called (Contractors and transport operators). Unfortunately
      the majority of thesepersons have comefrom outside the area. For the majority of
      the local people the Coal Mines have brought about a total disruption of their life.
      The economic base of their livelihood (land and forest) have been taken away or
      destroyed. They feel a deep sense of loss. Those among them who are educated do
      realize that the process of coal mining operation cannot be stopped, but they feel
      deeply disturbed at the speed at which               [mechanized] mining        operation are
      destroying the total environment, both physical and social. The total scenario is
      changing rapidly and the local population             is not at all prepared to face such
      changes."25

40.   The same report warns that illiteracy           would be the major stumbling block to
      adaptation to the changes imposed by the mine: "[t]he fact that literacy rate is very
      low is an indication that the local population is not at all ready for            such    modem
      disruption in their lives. Unless remedial steps are taken to increase the level of
      literacy and awareness among the population, mining operations will have a

        disastrous efiect on the local population. This is the challenge to which the coal
        industry should respond."26

41. The first objective of the Bank's resettlement policy, OD 4.30, is "to ensure that the
        population displaced by a project receives benefits from it."21 The OD goes on
        immediately to add that: "[ijnvoluntary               resettlement is an integral part of project
        design and should be dealt with from the earliest stages of project preparation.7'28It
        then spells out a number of policy considerations to be factored into project design.
        The first two of these are that: "(a) Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or
        minimized where feasible, exploring all viable alternative project designs...(and]
        (b) Where displacement is unavoidable, resettlement plans should be developed. All
        Involuntary       resettlement should be conceived and executed as development
        programs, with resettlers provided suflicient investment resources and opportunities
        to share in project benefits ... Particular attention should be paid to the needs of the
        poorest groups to be resettled."29

42. Most of the problems associated with involuntary resettlement that the Requesters
        raised were evident in other Bank-financed                       projects in India. Management
        mentioned similar problems with three previous projects the Bank had financed in
        the Indian coal sector in the Project Information Document (PID) on the CSESMP.
        As of November 1995, it stated, rehabilitation either had not been completed or, in
        the case of one project, was "plagued by land acquisition and unresolved social
        issues." The lesson Management drew from these operations was that "Land
        acquisition is dificult      unless project aflected people are consulted from the outset
        and offered acceptable alternatives that ensure that they at least regain their
        livelihood."3Q

43.     In the Request, CASS states that "[tlhe basic contention of this application is that
       from the very beginning there have beenflaws in the design of the CSESMP project.
        There were flaws that the Bank with its multiple competencies and resources could
        have seen and corrected ... both at the planning stage, and at the monitoring
        stage."31One alleged general flaw is related to the lack of the mention of the
        existing impacts of other mining projects in the Parej East.32Before the CSESMP


26Id, p. 12. Appendix p. 13 of the Report, notes that of the total number of 626 Project Affected People
(PAPS)in Parej village only 187 were literate, leaving 264 illiterate, the rest being children below school
age. For Durukasmar village the total number of PAPSwas 546, of whom 204 were literate, 2 12 illiterate
and the rest children below school age.

29Ibid. Specifically, subparagraph (b) goes on to state that "[d]isplacedpersons       should be (i) compensated
for their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move; (ii) assisted with the move and supported
during the transition period in the resettlement site; and (iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their
former living standards, income earning capacity, and production        levels, or at least to restore them."

31Supplement to Request, supra note 22, p. 1, in Annex 2 of this Report.
32In Supplement to Request, supra note 22, para. 13(b), in Annex 2 of this Report, the Requesters state that
the villages in East Parej are multiply affected by other surrounding mines, and that whereas CCL claims it
is only taking part of the village lands, the rest of the village lands is being taken by other mines. They


                                                                                                               13

       was approved CASS had called for a regional area-wide impact assessmentto aid in
       present and future planning but received no response.33

44.    In its Response, Management explains, basically, that mitigation of land acquisition
       impacts caused by non-Bank funded investments in non-CSESMP mines are not
       within the scope of the CSESMP. However, they outline the extent to which the
       Parej East RAP and IPDP cater for the consolidated losses to villages within one
       kilometer around the mine.34


3.1.      Coal India Ltd. corporate R&R policy

45.   Paragraph 26 of OD 4.30 allows for general resettlement plans or policies for sector
      investment loans on the condition that the Bank approves the RAPS individually for
      each subproject. As noted earlier, in April               1994, Coal India Ltd. prepared and
       adopted a new corporate Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) policy.35 Prior to
       Management accepting the policy, the Bank's Legal Department reviewed it. After
       expressing his understanding that "there is pressure to review this quickly," the
      Bank lawyer concerned made several important points that Management decided not
       to pursue with Coal India Ltd.. Without changes, the lawyer said, Management must
       review     each mine       specific  RAP      to ensure that it          met the Bank's         policy
       requirements.36In addition, feeling that much of the language in the policy was too
       discretionary, he highlighted several shortcomings. Among them:
       l    The policy's provision that the PAPS should regain their former standard of
            living, but only after a "reasonable transition period." He pointed out that this
            must be "time-bound." Otherwise, it could imply that PAPS would have to give
            up their standard of living for an unknown period of time, thus ending up worse
            off than they were before. This, he said, was hardly consistent with paragraph 3
            (b) of OD 4.30.

       l    The absenceof a definition of "adult individuals."

       l    The reliance on evidence that a person was a legitimate PAP for purposes of
            compensation and rehabilitation           should include the ability to get a "SWOVZ
            aflidavit".

      l     The absenceof any description of an appeal mechanism for PAPS grievances.

comments on the CSESMP, dated February 25, 1996, where CASS first raised the question of why the EAP
and RAP failed to address the multiple impacts of many already existing adjacent mines with a multiple
impact assessment (West Bokaro, Parej West, Tapin North, Tapin South, Tapin OC, Basantpur, Kedla
South, Laiyo, and Jharkand), and considered a structural flaw. See also Id., Attachment 6, CASS/JJM to the

           The fact that a house site measuring 100m2 per family would not provide much
           space for a large family or, if the previous homestead was larger, would result in
           a drop in the PAPS' standard of living. He felt that house sites should be "at
           least" 200m2.
           That Coal India Ltd.`s subsidiaries need only "persuade" rather than require
           their contractors to provide jobs to PAPS.
           That the self-employment package provided no assurance that PAPS would
           maintain their standard of living.37

46.    An area-wide plan for each of the 14 mines with involuntary resettlement was not a
       requirement of Coal India Ltd. R&R policy. The Panel observes that an area-wide
       plan for each of the 14 mines with involuntary resettlement was not a requirement of
       Coal India Ltd. R&R policy. At the same time, however, given the fact that in the
       future additional mines are expected in the area of Parej East, the preparation of an
       area-wide plan would have been a prudent course to take and might well have
       revealed many of the problems that have confronted Management.

47. In May 1994, ASTHR (Asia Technical Human Resources) gave its clearance "in
       light of the fact that the document has been through several edits and difSicult
       negotiations with the borrower."38 However, it did have a number of reservations.

48. Regional Management had proposed none of the above changes to Coal India Ltd.
      In May 1994, Management formally told Coal India Ltd. that it accepted the policy
       as "in line with the Bank's policies regarding the resettlement and rehabilitation of
      project-affected people and, as such, is a workable instrument for the preparation of
      Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAPS) ...IJowever. we will have to review each RAP to
       be sure it contains the ob1iRator-yreauirements for a successfid RAP"39 (emphasis
       added). However, Management added comments indicating what it "hoped" Coal
      India Ltd. would take into account when preparing the RAPS. For example,
      reflecting the above-noted concern about the "transition      period,"   Management
      reminded Coal India Ltd. that the RAPS would need to contain a time-bound
      program for reestablishing the livelihood of the PAPS.

49.   Thus, the Panel notes that Management accepted Coal India Ltd. R&R policy on the
      grounds that it "clearly shows the intent to meet the Bank's" OD 4.3040(emphasis in
      original). The Panel also observes that Management decided that it would need to
      review the RAPS for each of the 14 mines after they were prepared, for actual
      compliance with OD 4.30.

3.2.       The Parej East Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)

50.    CASS claims that many sections of the Parej East RAP are little more than an
       outline of policy statements.41Management prepared Guidelines for preparation of
       the 14 RAPS and sent them to Coal India Ltd. in early July 1994. The Guidelines
       made it clear that different issues should be given priority in different sub-projects,
       and that the RAPS should be tailored accordingly.4z

51.     Paragraph 30 of OD 4.30 provides that " [t]he appraisal mission should ascertain
       ...the adequacy of the plan, including the timetable and budgetfor resettlement and
       compensation.. ."

52.    Management cleared the RAP for Parej East in 1994. The Panel has reviewed it and
       finds that it is not location specific as required by Management in accepting Coal
       India Ltd. R&R policy. It contains a number of deficiencies, which are discussed in
       detail in the remainder of this Report. A few examples at this point, however, may
       be useful. The Panel found, for example, that the RAP contains no description of
       how house compensation rates would be calculated. It found that PAPS were not
       asked to give any preference for future employment should a job in the mine not be
       available. It     found that there was no feasibility                 study of       self-employment
       opportunities in Parej East, including a market survey while RAPS for other mines43
       had one. It found that there are no details on the size of, or usable products in, the
       forest adjacent to the chosen resettlement site to indicate that the forest would
       actually compensate PAFs for this loss of opportunity from common property
       resources. And it found that there is no time-bound income restoration strategy.

53. Management required annual updates of the RAP implementation plans for each
       mine as a cross-conditionality under Schedule 9 of the CSRP Loan Agreement.44
       Under the CSESMP Project Agreement, Coal India Ltd. was required to appoint
       NGOs to assist its subsidiaries in implementing the RAPs.~~In the case of Parej
       East, the XISS was appointed in March 1997. It opened its office in Parej East in
       July   1997 and was given responsibility                for preparation of the annual RAP
       implementation plans.

54. The NGOs appointed for this task had not prepared the original RAPS and were not
       experienced in this work. The subsidiaries' own officials designated to work with

"[b]y December of thefollowing   year: (i) complete information of all activities described in such
rehabilitation plans; and (ii} complete actions relating to resettlement to the satisfaction of the Bank."

      the NGOs were similarly inexperienced and untrained. To compound the problem
      further, the Environment and Social Review Panel (ESRPy6 considered that Coal
      India Ltd.`s subsidiaries had instructed their own officers and the contracted NGO
      to follow the original RAP. This would appear to have been the case in Parej East.
      Barring this, CCL officers working with XISS might have been able to improve the
      original RAPS and bring more activities into compliance with OD 4.30.

55. It appears that each year the Bank staff sent the annual RAP update submitted by
      XISS      back for revisions.       And     each year staff considered there was some
      improvement, a view apparently shared by the Requesters. Despite this, however,
      early in 1999, the supervision team concluded there were still significant areas
      where improvements were required. In the Task Leader's view, most of them
      concerned income restoration.47

56. The original         RAP for Parej East did not reflect the actual situation in Parej
      East and was not location-specific                  as required   by Management         when it
      approved Coal India Ltd.`s R&R                  policy. In the Panel's view, Management's
      failure during appraisal to ensure that the original RAP reflected reality on the
      ground resulted in many problems                  that are at the root of the Requesters'
      complaints.

57. In light of this, the Panel finds that Management's                 appraisal of the Parej East
      RAP was not in compliance with paragraph 30 of OD 4.30.


3.3.     Level of Compensation for Land

58. A basic principle of OD 4.30 is that displaced persons should be compensated for
      their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move.48

59.   The Requesters claim that monetary compensation for land has not been adequateto
      secure replacement land that will produce the same income,49and that "infact some
      of the villagers have already filed applications in the coal tribunal in the Civil Court
      Ranchi for enhancement of compensation as in many other villages [in the area of
      Chotanagpur] higher compensation has beenprovided."50 The Requesters maintain
      that, since the very beginning in 1996, land compensation has been provided at the
      price in effect on the date of notification of land acquisition, rather than the price in
      effect on the date of payment. As a result, the amount paid is lower than the cost of

        replacement land.51In November 1996, CASS acknowledged that, since mine
        development had inflated the price of land, authorities were starting to compensate
        at prices in effect after the date of notification. 52Nevertheless, they maintained, it
        was still only enough to enable the PAPS to cover the cost of replacement land
        outside the mining area.53

60.     In its Response, Management contends that "[awer                      comparing recent market
        purchase prices with the compensation paid to EPAPs, Management is satisfied that
        the compensation paid for            agricultural   land [within       the past two years]        is
        equivalent to replacement costs."54

61. Management also agreesthat compensation is based on land prices registered in the
        area at the time of notification         of acquisition, but points out that a 30 percent
        solatium55is added in recognition of the injured feelings for compulsory acquisition,
        plus a 12 percent cost escalation, and interest.56Furthermore, Management states
        that PAPS contesting the compensation assessed by CCL                           and the District
        Administration can appeal the decision.57

62. According to Management, out of the total of 33.89 hectares of privately owned
        (tenancy) land acquired for mine expansion in Parej East up to March 31, 2002,
        compensation had been paid for 28.23 ha For the balance of 5.66 ha, PAPS have
        exercised their right to have their compensation awards reviewed by the Tribunal.
        The Tribunal has settled 16 cases (75.58 acres) out of the 43 cases (154.23 acres)
        referred to it, all with an increase in the awards. The remaining 27 cases (78.66
        acres) are still under review with the Tribunal. Management assertsthat it has found
        two cases where land compensation paid from July 1999 to July 2002 was
        sufficient.

63.     The Tribunal's decision to award increased amounts has been appealed to the High
        Court by CCL. However, Management considers this evidence that "[rlegardless of

54Management Response 2001, supru note 13, para. 62. Management points out that in Parej East "recent
market purchases are reported at between Rs.12 to 15,OOOper acre for lower quuli9, and Rs.40 to 45,000
per acre for better quality land, which corresponds with the average awards made to PAPS."

57Id., para. 62. Under Section 4(l) of the Coal Bearing Area (CBA) Act of 1957, as modified in 1976, a
notification is issued announcing the intention and purpose of the acquisition. A second notification is
issued under Section 7 within two years from the date of the first one. Thereafter Section 14 of the Act
provides for an appeal to a Tribunal by PAPScontesting the compensation that has been assessedby the
District Administration  and CCL. The Tribunal will be constituted by the Central Government and will be
headed by a person at the level of a High Court judge.

        the final  outcome, a functioning           grievance redress mechanism which does not
        discriminate against the PAPS is in place."58

64.     The Panel notes that in 1994, even before the original RAP was prepared, 127 out of
        134 of the PAFs in the village of Parej were not satisfied with the compensation
        they had or would receive.59At that point, no one in Durukasmar, the other village
        of Parej East, had received compensation. The Panel also notes that the date of
        notification in Parej was 1983, a decade before the mine commenced. The date of
        notification of Durukasmar was 1986.60

65.     Coal India's R&R policy provides that the "value of land is determined on the basis
        of the prevailing legal norms." In examining the records, the Panel has observed
        that Bank staff preparing the Project were aware that compensation paid for land is
        usually inadequate.61The Task Manager decided, however, that the issue should be
        dealt within each of the mine specific RAPS, stating that the "ultimate                      test of
        whether compensation is adequate in light of OD 4.30 will be the provisions
        contained in the RAPs."~~As noted earlier, the Parej East RAP is not tailored to the
        situation at that mine and merely provides the usual Land Acquisition Act formula
        that is described in the Management Response.

66. It appears that the approach taken in the CSESMP has been standard for Bank
        supported projects in India, and a review of the literature shows that it has almost
        always given rise to problems in implementation.63 The recent Implementation
        Completion Report (ICR) for the NTPC project sums up this experience as follows:
        "These values are normally substantially under-reported and PAPS are usually
        compensated at considerably less than replacement cost, even with the customary
        30 percent `solatium' paid in addition to `market value'." The report goes on to
        point out the difficulty for the Bank in trying to secure compliance with a policy that
        required higher standards than are provided under state or national land laws. As
        Minewatch stated recently, compensation rates are not set by the Coal India Ltd.
        subsidiary, but by the local land revenue department. It takes an average of three
        sale deeds but the "weakness of this is that the sale deeds rejlect dejlated rates in
        order to avoid tax - a deflated rate is written and the rest of the money is passed
        under the table."@

67.   In 1996, Management acknowledged that this system of valuation resulted in
      "deflated values," even with the provision for interest and a solatium. Nevertheless,
      it accepted this problem on the grounds that there is a process of judicial appeal and
      the courts have routinely enhancedcompensation that was found to be inadequate.65

68.   There is another problem. Towards the end of 1994, XISS, the NGO engaged by
      Coal India Ltd. to assist CCL, reported that "[i]t was observed that in many cases
      the land oustees did not receive the full amount of compensation. Even if the money
       was deposited in the bank in the name of the landed oustee, the middlemen take a
       share when the money is withdrawn from            the Bank."66

69.    Clearly,    the process is open to serious question. First, it does not provide a
       realistic avenue for appeal for many PAPS who may he illiterate and very poor.
       The direct costs of the appeal process have to be significant                     for poor people
       whose average income is less than 100 rupees per day. These costs need to be
       deducted from the compensation ultimately                  awarded to arrive at a figure for
       net compensation. In the meantime, the delays and the uncertainties                        that they
       may or may not end up with a sufficient sum to enable them to negotiate for
       alternative land, results in tangible harm. 67And, at the end of it all, whatever
       money is deposited in the bank in the name of the landed oustee has to be
       shared with some middlemen when the money is withdrawn                        from the Bank.

70.    Coal India Ltd. maintains that these problems could not be avoided by purchasing
       land from landowners on a private basis. Management explains that: "Coal India
       oficials shy away from       acquiring land through direct negotiations" becausein such
      negotiations "there is always the risk of allegations of corruption."68 Management
      has not explained why, if this is the case, the land required for other types of
      projects has been purchased on a private basis. Pointing out that this has been done
      in other projects, international NGOs considered this to be nothing more than an
       excuse to avoid the perhaps, higher, costs of privately negotiated purchases in the
      coal pr0jects.69

71. In 1997, under a new Task Leader, Management told NGOs that compensation be
      determined at the date of payment, rather than the date of notification. "While CZL's
      R&R policy does not distinguish between the notification date and the payment date,
      the Bank will request CIL to use the latter as the basis to estimate the land's

67In addition to the appeal costs the PAPSmust bear, the Panel notes that according to the Bank supervision
team in 1997 and as Minewatch points out, compensation does not have to be paid in advance of Coal India
Ltd.`s taking over the land, and lengthy appeals against valuation appeal tribunal's decisions effectively
delay and discount the compensation Coal India Ltd. eventually might pay. The process of purchase and
appeal, described in the Management Response indicates that PAPSmay only protest after the land has
been vested in Coal India Ltd.

                                                                                                          20

       replacement value"70 (emphasis added). While this could improve the situation
       somewhat, as far as the Panel can ascertain, there has been no effective follow-
       UP-

72.    A basic principle       of OD 4.30 is that          "[d]ispZaced persons should be (i)
      compensated for their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move ..."
       In light of the above, the Panel finds that, in Parej East, many of the displaced
       PAPS have not been and are not being compensated at full replacement cost,
       with the result that many of them have suffered and are still suffering harm.

73.    The Panel notes that although the Land Acquisition             Act reflects the principle in
       OD 4.30 that PAPS should be compensated for their land at its "market                 value,"
       in practice, it defines "market        value" to be the registered value of plots in
       official land records. Since, as a rule, these values are substantially               under-
       reported, the principle      is effectively    disregarded     and the PAPS are usually
       compensated    at considerably         less than     replacement     cost, even with      the
       customary 30 percent `solatium'        paid in addition to "market value."

74. When affected landholders            are not satisfied with         compensation     decided by
       CCL and the District       Authorities,    they may seek a decision to increase the
      amount     from  a special tribunal,       constituted     under section 14 of the Coal
      Bearing Areas Act. In this regard, the Panel considers it revealing that, in all            -
      cases so far finalized       in Parej East, the Tribunal           has awarded       increased
      compensation to those PAPS able to lodge an appeal. In the Panel's view, it is
      not appropriate     that PAPS should have to go through                a lengthy and costly
      judicial  process to get just compensation, especially since not all PAPS can
      afford the direct costs of an appeal process and, even if they could, they would
      end up losing unless the costs of the appeal were added to their award. Even
      then, the delays and uncertainties         associated with the process could result in
      tangible harm, especially since the awards are subject to further                   appeal by
      CCL. It is unfortunate to note that CCL is appealing all these decisions.

7.5. In light of this, the Panel finds that Management               was not in compliance with
      paragraph 3(b) of OD 4.30.

76.   There is yet another problem: the lack of transparency in the compensation process.
      In late December 1999, the PAPS from Borwa Tola were shifted under suspicious
      circumstances that are the subject of conflicting reports. Earlier in 1999, before the
      displacement of the Borwa Tola PAPS, CASS, asked for "an itemized breakdown of
      land compensation giving the land grade, rates and items" because "a blanket

       unitemized Award, as now, is unacceptable."71Under paragraph 8 of OD 4.30, the
       PAPS have a right to this information.

77.    After the Borwa Tola PAPS were moved, the supervision team felt that in the future
       relations between CCL and the PAPS would be better and transparency would be
       promoted if PAPS were to have access "to the house measurement report with
       information on compensation valuation at the Public Information Center."72At the
       Parej East Public Information Center, the Panel team found, as did Management,
       only "a specimen of a house compensation assessment." In 2000, the Environment
       and Social Review Panel (ESRP) stated that: "[t]he process of compensation
      payment should be quick, and [it should] require [an owner] to vacate the property
       at a specific agreed upon time." In addition, the "[clompensation packages should
       be consistent, transparent andfair."73

78.    In the Panel's view, as the Requesters claim, the compensation process in Parej
      East was and is not transparent.                  In light     of this, the Panel finds      that
      Management is not in compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.


3.4.     Level of Compensation for Houses

79. Paragraph 14 of OD 4.30 requires that valuation                        of all assets be made at
      replacement cost. According to the RAP, a CCL committee is responsible for the
      valuation and it is based on the plinth area of the building and the specification of
      construction.74

80. The Requesters claim that "the homestead compensation is being given at the
      depreciated dated value of the homestead, which compensation makes it impossible
      for  the PAPS to build new houses with it."75In its Response, Management contends
      that it "is satisfied that the compensation provided for            houses enables the PAPS to
      construct a replacement house at par with their original house ..."76The Second
      Management Response, which is attached to this Report, describes the method for
      calculating house compensation.77

81. It appears that during its February 2002 supervision mission, Bank staff took
      measurements of a random sample of houses at the Pindra site to compare with&
      house compensation assessmentrecord of the homes owned by the same PAPS in
      Borwa Tola before their displacement, as listed in. According to Management, in

       three out of four cases, the new houses were bigger than the old ones and of better
       quality.78Management does not comment on the houses built at the other site, Prem
       Nagar.

82. Villagers told the Panel that they believed that there were inaccuracies in house
       measurements. The         Panel also learned from       an independent source that
       measurements were recorded in pencil so they could be altered later, opening the
       door to suspected abuse. And, as noted above, due to the unfortunate lack of
       transparency, the PAPS did not have access to information              on the recorded
       measurements of their houses.

83. The Panel visited the Pindra resettlement site twice, and the houses that the PAPS
       had so far been able to build in the Pindra resettlement colony seemed to be as good,
       if not better, than similar houses they were shown in the area. It is not known,
       however, whether their new houseswere as large as, and were constructed only with
       the money paid in compensation for, their old houses.

84. The Panel also visited the resettlement site at Prem Nagar. The size of this site
       clearly cannot accommodate eight families when they build houses of their own. At
       the time of the visit, there was only one house in which three families reside. Some
       families also occupied a community center.

85. Since many of the oustees' original houses were constructed a long time ago,
       depreciation at 1.6 percent a year could be significant, in spite of the price escalation
       of five percent. Moreover, in view of the fact that housing costs have risen since
       their original   houses were built,    it is likely that the difference between the
       depreciated value of their old houses and the replacement cost of a new house could
       be significant. Under the practice noted above, it seems that the oustee is expected
       to cover this difference. In the Panel's view, both the process and the basis for
       house compensation was open to abuse and raises serious questions, as in the
       case of compensation for land noted earlier.

                                                                                             23

86. In April 2000, Coal India Ltd. made a major change to its R&R policy that gives the
        PAPS an additional option. They may take a one time cash grant of Rs50,OOOin lieu
        of a house plot in the resettlement site. This grant is in addition to the above-noted
        compensation for         loss of homestead land and house.79 Since then, as the
        Management Response notes, 82 PAFs have chosen the cash option to relocate
        elsewhere than the resettlement site.8oThis means that since early 2000 all PAFs
        have chosen cash.

87. In their 2000 report, the ESRP stated that this option "does have the advantage of
        being quick transparent and consistent."x1 On the other hand, they said, "... the
        World Bank's resettlement policy is reluctant to accept cash payments in lieu of
        more complete resettlement support, and so care must be taken to ensure that such
        payments are not consumed leaving the PAPS destitute ..."x2 In their final 2001
        report, the ESRP repeats an earlier recommendation:                        "[i]t  is again stron,&
        recommended that EPAPs be monitored after receiving payments of this kind to see
        what happens to them, to help assessthe long-term result of this sort of approaMg3
        (emphasis in original).

88. In the Panel's view, it is difficult,            if not impossible, to reconcile the Bank's aim
        of development with a one-time cash grant for acquisition                       of home and land.
        Presenting a poor oustee, whose previous source of survival included a small
        patch of land, with a check, probably more money than he or she has ever seen
        or expected to see in a lump sum, may be a legal way of getting them to move
        on, but it should not be confused with development. The Panel highlights that
        the ESBP's has recommended that the Bank commission a post-Project                              audit
        to assessthe long-term results of the cash settlement approach.


3.5.       Resettlement Sites

89. In its Response, Management explains that resettlement sites compensate for loss of
        villages. There are two resettlement sites for Parej East. The main one is Pindra,
        where around 20 Project-affected families (PAFs) have settled.84The other is Prem
        Nagar where three PAFs have settled.85

3.51.     Choice of Site

90. Drawing upon the 1994 Baseline Survey, which states that "95% of the PAPS were
       not aware of the site for rehabilitation, " CASS in 1996 claimed that the PAPS have
       never been consulted in the choice of the Pindra resettlement site.86On the other
       hand, Management claims, the selection of the Pindra resettlement site "has been
       made in consultation with the PAPs."~~

91. In the original 1994 RAP, it was reported that the land for the resettlement site had
       already been acquired and was under the physical possession of CCL; that it had
       been surveyed, and that a contour plan had been prepared as well as a detailed
       layout plan of the complex with provision for 339 housing plots.** All this, the RAP
       reports, was done in consultation with the PAPS. In addition, "[a]11 PAPS have
       agreed to shift to [the] site."89 The Baseline Survey, however, prepared about a
       month earlier makes it clear that this was not SO.~O

92. The Turi Tola refused to move to Pindra and, in 1997, the ESRP took up the
       question of their relocation. They observed that: "[t]he families that are currently
       refusing to move were resettled by the TISCO mines 2.5 years ago and resettled
       themselves on government land for which they never received any legal title. They
      feel that CCL management has not listened to their grievances - not sat in their
       village and listened to them ... The promised resettlement site has still not been built
       and they see no prospect of employment."91

93. The ESRP also confirms that PAPS generally complained that they had never been
       consulted in selection of the sites. They were guided to a pre-selected site and told
       to move there.92

94. The ESRP felt that "[rlesolution of the Parej East dispute is urgently required." In
       their view, "[tlhe dispute will not be resolved amicably unless CCL makes a new
       beginning and starts to listen sympathetically to the villagers'                  grievances. JI&
       believe that bringing CASS into any new dialogue with the villagers is a necessary
       part of achieving an amicable settlement" (emphasis added).

95. The nine Turi Tola PAFs were eventually involuntarily                     displaced in May 1998.
       Represented by CASS, they took the view that they were not to be forced to relocate
       to Pindra as a result of a Court order provoked by an incident related to the impact
       of blasting, as the mine expansion came closer to their back doors. They chose, and

       CCL agreed to a resettlement site they preferred at Prem Nagar. Only three families
       relocated to Prem Nagar. The others moved to temporary accommodation in CCL's
       employee quarters to give them time to construct houses.They are still there.93

96. It seems evident that PAPS in Parej East were not consulted in the selection of
       the Pindra resettlement site as required by OD 4.30. In light of this, the Panel
       finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.


3.5.2. Causal Labor Opportunities

97. Paragraph 13 of OD 4.30 provides that "For land-based resettlement, the new site's
       ... locational advantages should be at least equivalent to those of the old site."
       Paragraph 18 concerns access to employment and requires that the RAP should,
       where feasible "exploit           new activities made possible by the main investment
       requiring the displacement ..."

98. The        Requesters claim           that   "Pindra       is further     away from        causal     labor
       opportunities."94 Management responded that "[tlhe                      distance from      the Pindra
       resettlement site to causal labor opportunities ... is roughly the same as was the
       case with Borwa Tola, namely 1.5 to 2km."95(See Map 1).

99. Another issue is related to this. "As of the date of this submission," the Requesters
       claim, "many PAPS are still residing in pathetic condition on a temporary basis in
       the company quarters and barracks."96In its Response, Management states that the
       PAFs living in barracks told the February 2002 supervision team that they " were
       not interested in shifting to the resettlement site, since many male and female PAPS
       were now earning an income from different forms of causal labor related to the
       mine and mine colony. One PAP had even built his own house within the compound
       where the barracks were located" (emphasis added). 97

100. The Panel also notes that the Baseline Survey found that the principal occupation
       for 51.48 percent of the PAPS was non-agricultural labor work.98The RAP discusses


93A local independent professional visited Prem Nagar with the Panel. Although the site is said to have
been selected at the instance of the Tut-i themselves, he felt that it was an unfortunate choice. He pointed
out that the site is located just outside the boundary wall of the CCL Colony and the contrast between the
two worlds is appalling. To take advantage of some facilities available in the Colony, a big hole has been
made in the boundary wall, which separates the Colony from the settlement site. The comparative
deprivation of the Turi families has thus been made very apparent. He also pointed out that the forests are
adjacent to the Colony and there is frequent encroachment on the forest area by the resettled families
leading to quarrels with the local forest guards resulting in harassment of these families. The number of
families on this site is so small that no school and health facilities have been provided. Some Turi children
have been enrolled in a local government school which is about one kilometer from the Prem Nagar
Colony.

      access to economic activity from the Pindra site, maintaining that PAPS would be
      able to take advantage of opportunities in a number of new collieries and two new
     local washeries planned for the near future in the area.99Access to work around the
     Parej East mine is not mentioned.

101. In its Response, Management only mentions the labor opportunities for Pindra
     resettlers at the coal loading dump, not opportunities for causal labor or informal
     labor at the mine site which is about 3km away. This lack of opportunity appearsto
     be confirmed by the fact that PAFs, who were moved to very poor temporary
     accommodation (barracks) to allow them some months to build their houses at
     Pindra, have not yet moved there about three years later.

102. The Panel visited the barracks beside the CCL Headquarters                        and observed
     that the conditions are pathetic, as the Requesters claim: they are hardly fit for
     human habitation,         especially families. Even so it would now appear that the
     seven PAFs regard remaining             there a better alternative than building        a house
     in   Pindra     because of       the proximity        of   the    barracks    to  causal   labor
     opportunities     and the informal       economy at the mine site. The Parej East RAP
     limited   its discussion of causal labor opportunities              for resettlers at Pindra to
     mentioning     some future nearby industrial            development. The Panel could not
     find any record of a professional analysis of the pre- and post- relocation causal
     labor market. Those who have moved to Pindra thus have superior physical
     accommodation        but lack access to formal and informal              labor opportunities  at
     mine site. Thus in neither case have these PAPS regained their former standard
     of living.


3.5.3. Size of Plots

103. Paragraph 19 of OD 4.30 provides that "[p]lanning for shelter, infrastructure, and
     services should take into account population growth." Paragraph 13 of OD 4.30
     states that "the new sites productive potential ... should be at least equivalent to
     those of the old site..."

104. The Requesters state that "the allowed plot of land of 200 sq.m. makes second
     generation growth .... [and] vegetable garden and domestic animal                       rearing
     impossible."100Management maintains that the site allotted to the PAFs in the
     resettlement sites is twice the size prescribed in Coal India Ltd. R&R policy, which
     is 100m2. In addition, each married son who lived in joint families before relocation

     site, six are married sons, who received a separate plot.`O' Management also states
     that the supervision team visited Pindra in 2002 and found that 12 of the families

       to utilize that spacefor soft coke coal productionlo

 105. In the case of another CCL mine (K.D. Hesalong), the Panel notes that, following a
       visit in April   1997, a Bank Social Scientist reported that 20 households had been
       allotted 50 plots of 100m2. This, he explained, was because unmarried sons and
       daughters are defined as individual PAPS and entitled to separateplots. Therefore a
       household with a father, mother and three unmarried children would receive four
       plots?

 106. During its visit to the Prem Nagar site, the Panel Team observed that a family was
       grazing a cow. At the same time, however, when the Prem Nagar PAFs made a
       vegetable garden a few yards from their plot, the Forestry Department stopped it.
       The Team observed that the area was scrubland - not forestland - and wondered
       why this land cannot be used for kitchen gardens. Accompanying officials informed
       the Panel that these activities by the PAFs were causing problems with the Forest
       Department. They were simply not allowed to engage in such activities on the land
       adjacent to the site owned by the Forest Department.

107. As re ards plot size, the Requesters point out that in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa
       400m!2are provided.lo4The Management explains that while "[t]!ze Madhya Pradesh
      Package of 1991 and the Orissa Package of 1989 provided plots in resettlement
       sites of 400 sq.m.," this was supersededby Coal India Ltd.`s 1994 policy "which
       sets out to `streamline the difeerent resettlement and rehabilitation practices being
      followed by the subsidiaries and to modify these'." But, as is the case with the Parej
      East mine, all other subsidiaries (except CCL's K.D. Hesalong) provide resettlement
       plots that are larger than the 100m2.105

108. The Requesters acknowledged that the resettlement plot had been increased from
       100m2 to 200m2. but pointed out that this would only be sufficient when people
      have independent sources of income. At Parej East, people needed to supplement
      their income and that is why they asked for 500m2.106Some weeks later in
      November 1996, they made the same point to Coal India Ltd. as one of the reasons
      the Turi Tola residents did not want to move to Pindra.`O'Management agreed that
       100m2 might not suffice for second-generation expansion but pointed out that under
      Coal India Ltd. R&R policy each adult is a unit of entitlement. Management said,
      however, that it would urge Coal India Ltd. to consider giving families more than

lo5Plot sizes vary depending on the availability of land and the number of PAFs to be resettled. The largest
plots are provided in Belpahar, MCL, and are 400m2, while Jagannath, MCL, provides plots of 200m'. In
the SECL mines of Gevra and Dipka the plot sizes are 240m2 and in Kusmnda they are 150m2.

       one plot of land, which would also provide room for "certain commercial activities
       such as gardening."los

 109. It seems clear that the Bank's supervision team has been recommending that the
       Coal India Ltd. policy be changed: that the minimum                      plot size per family  be
       increased above 100 m2, and that unmarried "sons" aged 18 years and over should
       be entitled to additional plots in resettlement sites. The Team's Aide Memoire of
       June 2001 recommended that the practice in most subsidiaries of allotting plots of
       200m2 or more should be made part of Coal India Ltd. policy in order to provide
       room for second generation expansion as required by OD 4.30. The Panel also notes
       that this was one of the flaws the Bank lawyer pointed out in the Coal India Ltd.
       R&R policy during Project Preparation.

 110. Management accepted Coal India Ltd. R&R policy on the clear understanding that it
       would "have to review each RAP to be sure it contains the obligatory requirements
       for a successful RAP."109The Parej East RAP simply repeated Coal India Ltd.`s
       R&R      policy in respect of the size of plots and did not provide for second-
       generation growth or land for gardens and animals. The Panel therefore finds
       that Management's           appraisal of the Parej East RAP was not in compliance
       with paragraphs         13 and 19 of OD 4.30. However, in practice, Management
       recognized this flaw, and in response to CASS insistence, CCL allocated plots
       twice     the  size of      that    provided       for  in    the   RAP.     In  addition,  since
       implementation       commenced, Management               has continued to press Coal India
       Ltd. to change its policy.


       3.5.4.     Water, Health and Services

111. The Request alleges that the water sources in the resettlement sites are polluted and
       the wells are not fit for drinking, "medical services have not been provided to
       handle the increased illness," nor have any teachers been provided for the school.
       And, CASS maintained, "efforts, if any, to involve local governing bodies to provide
       such services have produced no results."`1o

112. To ensure economic and social viability,                paragraph 19 of OD 4.30 requires that
       water and social services (e.g. schools, health care centers) should be provided.
       According to paragraph 5(i) they should be provided for in the RAP. The Parej East
       RAP states that the PAPS would shift to the development site only after this
       infrastructure had been provided.`l' It also states that relocation of the PAPS to
       Pindra would not affect the host community's water supply "as it is proposed to
       develop thesefacilities for the complex independently."`12

 113. Potable water. In January 2000, CASS wrote that when they were first shifted
       "[t]he Pindra people used the host community well [because] the 2 wells and one
       hand-pump do not provide potable water." In its Response, Management reports
       that the 2001 testing of the water at both Pindra and Prem Nagar sites was
       favorable. 113

 114. When nine families from Borwa Tola were moved to Pindra in December 1999,
       they needed to use a host community well, but they were prevented from doing so
       becausethe host community fenced it in. As a result, the women had to walk about a
       kilometer to fetch potable water. According to CASS, the host community resented
       sharing their well with the resettlers. Management does not dispute this and says
       that the host community           was resentful because they were of a higher caste.
       Interviews at the site revealed that the host community withdrew its objections to
       the sharing of the well when it realized that only about 20 families were expected,
       rather than around 200.

115. Management also stated that about six weeks after relocation, mine officials had
       cleaned up two open wells on the site. They also promised to upgrade them'and, in
       addition, to provide two tube wells.114Nevertheless, it seems clear that access to
       potable water at the Pindra resettlement site had not been either pre-planned or pre-
       arranged. This raises the question of why the families were moved before accessto
       potable water was assured.

116. Based on the Panel's review of the records available, it seems clear that the
       date set for the families to move to Pindra, December 15,1999, was dictated by
       the scheduled mine expansion.                Both   the September          and November       1999
       supervision team doubted that CCL could be ready by the scheduled date of
       December l&1999.          Nevertheless, the PAFs were relocated late December.

117. In the Panel's view, the host community's                     initial opposition     to allowing the
       PAPS to have access to their well indicates a failure to consult with the host
       community      as required by paragraph 8 of OD 4.30. By failing to ensure access
       to potable water before the PAPS were moved to the Pindra resettlement site,
       the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 19 of
       OD 4.30.

118. Access to Health Care. In response to the Requester's claim that medical services
      have not been provided to handle the increased illness, Management explains that
      the access to health services for PAPS in the Pindra and Prem Nagar resettlement
       sites "is on par with that before the resettlement. Prior to displacement, the PAPS
      had access to a hospital run by TISCO about 4km from Parej Village. Medical
      facilities  are also available at the Mine Colony at Tapin about OSkm from the

        Pindra resettlement site, and at the Government Public health center at Chari about
        9km away."115

119. A number of PAPS complained to the Panel, not about location of the health clinics,
        but about their real or perceived ability to get treatment. During interviews, staff
        acknowledged that staffing of the facility at Pindra is a problem and maintained that
        it involved the relationship between CCL and the appropriate District authorities.

120. Health Status. CASS states that a total of 21 people had died since 1998 in Parej
        East for various causes,including accidents, TB, malaria, and alcoholism, which are
        in some way project-related. 116

121. Management refutes CASS's allegations and, based on two recent health surveys
        conducted in the area, suggeststhat: "the health related issues raised by CASS are a
        result of a variety of economic, political          and social factors, which pre-date the
        project."117 It also provides an examination               of these two         studies and their
        relationship in general to Parej East.l18

122. In the absence of statistics to show that morbidity                  and mortality        in Parej East
        might be outside the norm, the Panel is of the view that, it would be extremely
        difficult,  if not impossible, to ascribe any alleged increases to the Project.

123. Schools. On its initial site visit, the Panel confirmed that the Pindra site included a
        building for the school and that it was unused since no teacher had been provided. In
        its Response, Management points out that CCL maintains that its responsibility
        ended with the construction of a school building. In their view, it was the State's
        responsibility to provide the services, including a teacher.l19In the absence of a
        teacher, Management states that children living in Pindra go to school outside the
        resettlement site.

124. It should be noted that the State of Jharkand, where the Parej East mine is located,
        was created in August 2000 through a division of the former State of Bihar. It goes
        without saying, perhaps, that this division and the establishment of the new State's
        government, resulted in some exceptional problems limiting its ability to provide the
        normal range of services.



`15Management Response 2001, supra    note 13, para. 53.
I'6 Management notes that as Agraria Tola is an IPDP village, there has been no land acquisition related to
the Bank assisted Parej East mine. The latest mine plans indicate that this village is unlikely to be displaced
for another 12 to 15 years.

 125. The Pindra school was built to accommodate 257 families. Only around 20 PAPS
       have relocated, and since most PAPS are now taking cash compensation, it is
       unlikely that this population will increase. In the meantime, children from Borwa
       Tola are attending a private school about OSkm from Pindra as well as another
       school about 2.5km away."O Pointing out that CCL "recently" arranged for the
       teacher of the Parej school to be transferred to the Pindra school, Management states
       that CASS insisted, and CCL agreed, that the Parej teacher be moved to Lower
       Barrisom village school instead.121

 126. In the Panel's view, in a situation                where most of the PAPS are poor and
       illiterate,   the parents        would     need every incentive          to continue    with     their
       children's education. In this instance, in December 1999, the PAPS from Borwa
       Tola were involuntarily           relocated some distance away to Pindra. There they
       found a school building with no teachers, despite OD 4.30 and promises to the
       contrary. The Panel therefore finds that Management                        was not in compliance
       with paragraph 19 of OD 4.30.

127. The Panel recognizes, however, that the current                       situation differs completely
       from     that   anticipated      in 1999. With        the late 1999 introduction            of cash
       compensation, and the real prospect that the population                     of the Pindra site will
       not increase beyond around 20 instead of about 227 families, a new approach is
       appropriate. 122


3.6.       Cultural    Property

128. The Requesters raised cultural property issues in the Request for Inspection and, in
       the past, during implementation. In its Response, Management explains that the
       Sectoral Environmental          Assessment for the project did not identify              any issues
       related to cultural property, and OPN 11.03 on Management of Cultural Property in
       Bank-financed        Projects     was     therefore    found     not     to   apply.  Nevertheless,
       Management maintains that during implementation                     they have dealt with issues
       raised by PAPS regarding sites of religious importance in a manner consistent with
       OPN 11.03. These instances, as well as specific issues raised in the Request are
       explained in detail in Management's Responses.lz3

129. While there are irresolvable issues related to cultural property management, in
       the Panel's view, Management has acted responsibly in consulting local people


12'Ibid.
12'These schools include the state government school and the DAV school in Tapin, and, a private school
and an English medium school operated by the Parej East mine. See in Management Comments 2002,

where the children, particularly the tribals, are now going to school. In this case, Management refers to 16

        and has acted in good faith in attempting                  to mitigate the issues. It therefore
        finds Management in compliance with OPN 11.03.


3.7.       Title to House Plot

 130. The Requesters claim that PAPS are "living in a [resettlement] colony without legal
        possession of any land, whereas [before] they were landowners." 124Further, "[i]t is
        absolutely essential for an eflective rehabilitation              that legal ownership title be
        provided to the villagers."`25 In fact, they add, the PAPS are being given `pattas'
        (title to land), with no legal value.126

131. OD 4.30 requires: "[flor          both rural and urban resettlement, the borrower needs to
        ... make legal arrangements for transferring titles to resettlers" and "paying special
        attention to the adequacy of             the legal arrangements concerning land title,
        registration, and site occupation.`7'27

132. In its Response,Management acknowledges the problem. It states that the "CCL has
        issued `temporary pattas' allotting specific house plots to the PAFs who chose the
        resettlement sites." Management explains the effort the supervision team has made
        over the years to address this situation and adds that "[t]he supervision team will
        continue to seeka resolution to this issue."128

133. In 1991, during the very early stages of Project Preparation, the Bank sociologist
        wanted to be sure homestead owners would have title to land after relocation.129It
        appears that the question was not raised further during Preparation of the Project or
        of the RAP. The Panel notes that CCL had already acquired the Pindra resettlement
        site under a law that did not enable the award of titles by the time the RAP was
        prepared.

134. Both before the CSESMP was approved,130and later in 1996, CASS pointed out that
        the Turi Tola residents must be assured that they would have rights over the land,
        which would protect them against the possibility that a "traumatic displacement will

       not happen a third time."`31 At that time, the only relocation offered the Turi Tola
       PAPS was the Pindra site. CASS stressedthat it was "CCL lease land, and they will
       have no legal title over it."132Early in 1997, international NGOs took up the issues
       and requested Management to resolve it before Negotiations for the CSRP.133
       Management recognized the problem and proposed cross conditionality                           with the
       CSRP, asking for ownership titles or 99-year leases.

135. In July 1997, the Minutes of the CSRP Negotiations set out what was agreed: "[tlhe
       Indian delegation has reconfirmed its commitment to the requirement under OD
       4.30 that land titles or long term leasesfor house-plots in resettlement sites will be
       given to all entitled project affected people ... The borrower agreed to take the
       necessary action to obtain from the relevant authorities written waivers or consent
       to grant PAPS renewable long-term leases with the rights 1. to mortgage such leases
       in favor of institutions or individuals and 2. to transfer such a lease upon the death
       of the lessees."134

136. A Supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement shows that this was expected to affect
       182 PAPS from Parej East between 1998 through 2001; i.e., those who were
       expected to be displaced in that period. The Agreement also shows that this was an
       issue at 13 mines. It affected a total of 2,626 PAPS at seven mines, and an unknown
       number at six mines.

137. In the meantime, nine families                from the Turi Tola hamlet were involuntarily
       resettled in May 1998. Beginning in September 1998, and again in December,
       CASS wrote to the Bank for help. It informed the Bank that "in the court agreement
       with the Turi Tola people, the agreementfor legal papers (pattas) for allotted house
       sites totaling 200 sq. m on a lease for             30 years has not been implemented. The
       people have been given `CCL certificates' which have no legal or government
       recognition at all. Further, at the termination of the mine (30 years) all land will
       revert to the Government. This is a crucial point in the rehabilitation program.`7'35

138. The      records show        that the supervision          teams have consistently            reiterated
       Management's        expectations that an appropriate solution                 would     be found.13(j
       Nevertheless, as both Responses by Management acknowledge, the issue is still
       unresolved. The December 1998 Aide Memoire acknowledged that not only does
       the lack of `pattas' leave the people with a sense of insecurity, but also it prevents

       them from       accessing finance for         income      generation schemes. As a result,
       implementation of these schemes is undermined.137

139. In February 1999, however, Management informed CASS that the issue was "a state
       government matter and outside the authority of CZL."138CASS asked for an update
       in July 1999 because of the trouble the PAPS at Prem Nagar were having with the
       Forest Department. It had evicted and detained a PAP because he was building a
       house there. Cass explained that their "consistent demand for land pattas ... has
       beenprecisely to avoid this sort of situation where the PAPS become hapless victims
       between two powerful groups." Recognizing that the Task Leader took the matter
       seriously, CASS pointed out that "again, on the ground the situation has not
       changed."139

140. In December 1999, PAPS were involuntarily moved from Borwa Tola. About a year
       later, correspondence indicated that Coal India Ltd. was pursuing the matter of
       leasesbefore the Ministry of Coal (MoC). 140Coal India Ltd. had been informed that
       lease agreements for 99 years in favor of PAPS could be drafted separately, subject
       to approval of the Law Ministry, on a case-by-casebasis. Coal India Ltd. asked for
       prompt decisions.

141. The February 2002, Aide Memoire confirms that the December 2000 application for
       titles in Pindra mentioned in the Management Response has gone nowhere. It says
       that "CZL will resubmit the specific case applications before February 28, 2002."141
       It adds that the issue is expected to be resolved soon "... so that PAFs can have
       security of tenurefor their plots in resettlement sites." The Panel was also informed
       that a 30-year renewable lease, rather than the 99-year lease that the Bank had
       sought, would be offered.

142. In its 2002 Response, Management maintains: "[a]lthough this specific issue has not
       adversely affected the resettlement process, the Bank has raised this issue during
       every supervision mission with both the CZL and the Government of Zndia"142
       (emphasis added). The Panel cannot agree that this issue has not adversely affected
       the resettlement process. The opposite is clearly the case, at least for these PAPS
       who, as a supervision team pointed out, are suffering from a senseof insecurity and
       inability to borrow. In addition, PAPS worry that they will be moved again. If so,
       will they get compensation? And what about the question of inheritance?

143. Considering the lack of title, the Environmental and Social Review Panel (ESRP)
       stated that "[t]he major Jaw in CZL's resettlement planning is that settled farmers
       go from being landowners with full land rights to land users, given only a patta,

      which gives them usufructory rights to the land, not ownership. Such usufruct land
      cannot be alienated in most states. Thus ownership is traded for a lease." In
      addition, they note that in the case of another involuntary move for further mine
      expansion, "it is unclear whether a patta holder would be eligible then for any
      compensation on subsequent moves, or whether he would be added to the growing
      number of the landless merely being expelled without compensation by the mines."`43

144. It is clear that the question of title transfer should have been identified                    and
      dealt with when the Parej East RAP was prepared, as required under OD 4.30.
      CCL had already purchased the Pindra resettlement site by that stage. Now, up
      to four years after the affected people have been involuntarily                    resettled they
      are still suffering the harm that results from lack of title, including                a sense of
      insecurity and, as Management itself has stated, an inability                  to borrow for self
      employment income restoration schemes.

145. In light of the above, the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance
      with paragraphs 13(c) and 14(a) of OD 4.30 when the RAP for Parej East was
      prepared.

146. The Panel realizes that supervision missions have raised the issue repeatedly. It
      has not been able to ascertain whether a renewable 30-year lease provides the
      same security of tenure as the 99-year lease that Management demanded. It is
      understood that Management is continuing to follow this issue closely through
      arrangements for post-Project monitoring             and reporting.


3.8.     The Grievance Mechanism

147. Since 1996, CASS's allegations regarding the grievance redress mechanisms have
      focused on the PAPS' participation             in the committees formed to hear their
      grievances. The Requesters point out that "the people's participatory committees do
      not function as representative of the people because democratic procedures have
      not been used in their selection."144They claim that the grievance redress committee
      established in Parej East does not include an independent party among its members
      and that its PAPS representatives have been selected without consulting the people
      they are presumed to represent.145

148. With respect to grievance redress instruments, paragraph 12 of OD 4.30 requires
      that each resettlement plan include "the grievance procedures available for disputes
      over land acquisition.7"46The policy calls for a "clear understanding of the legal

        issues involved in resettlement" among which                 "the legal and administrative
       procedures applicable including the appeals process and the normal time frame for
        such procedures ..."147(emphasis added).

149. Paragraph 25 of Coal India Ltd.`s R&R policy requires a mechanism to deal with
        disputes and that its membership include "an independent party, such as a respected
        community leader, a retired judge or principal              of a reputed local institution of
        higher education"148(emphasis added).

150. In its Response, Management describes in detail the committees formed at various
        points to solve grievances in Parej East."149The Response added that a grievance
        register is available at the Public Information Center (PIC) in Parej East. Allegedly,
        30 grievances have been recorded.150Management claims that the low number of
        recorded grievances is due to CCL's prompt dealing with the PAPS' petitions as
        soon as they are submitted.lS1In its second Response, Management focused mainly
        on the selection of PAP representatives, asserting that selection "is always done by
        the PAPS themselves."`52

151. The RAP for Parej East describes the grievance procedures.153The compensation
        grievance committee provides for "a local respected community leader" but does
        not state that such a person be independent.lT4The RAP also describes the PAPS
        right of appeal to a judicial tribunal composed of a High Court Judge or a Judicial
        Commissioner. The Tribunal's decision can also be challenged in the. High Court or
        Supreme C0~r-t."~~~

152. Since a grievance mechanism was established in Parej East and appeals process
        described, the Panel finds that Management                 is formally     in compliance  with
        paragraph 17 of OD 4.30. However, Bank staff were unable to confirm whether
        any independent         person was on the grievance committee.                The Panel is also
        concerned that it was unable to establish whether or not PAP members are
        elected democratically       or are selected by authorities.

                              4. Traditional               Land Rights

 153. Paragraph 3(e) of OD 4.30 on Involuntary                      Resettlement stipulates that "land,
         housing, infrastructure, and other compensation should be provided to the adversely
         affected population, indigenous groups, ethnic minorities, and pastoralists who may
         have usufruct or customary rights to the land or other resources taken for the
        project. The absence of legal title to land bv such groups should not be a bar to
         compensation" (emphasis added). As far as indigenous people are concerned this
        provision is cross-referenced to OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. Therefore relevant
        provisions in that OD must be applied.

 154. Coal India Ltd.`s R&R policy, reflected in the RAP for Parej East, provides that
        tribals cultivating land under traditional rights will be entitled to exactly the same
        compensation and rehabilitation as title holders (tenancy land holders). In Parej
        East, 77 percent of the people to be displaced were tribals, according to the Indian
        classification system. Most of the land acquired for the mine expansion was not
        tenancy land but Government land, which tribals were cultivating under traditional
        rights.

 155. As regards tribals cultivating land under traditional rights, CASS asserts that in
        Durukasmar and other villages compensation is being paid only for tenancy land
        and not for Ghar Mazarua and other types of customary land usage.ls6"The PAPS
        have made innumerable attempts to have their traditional rights registered, but it
        was bureaucratic indiflerence which prevented them from having it registered. Now
        there is consistent and firm refusal to acknowledge their traditional                    rights. GOI
        says it is not their policy, but in other ways they adjust according to the WB
        demands."`57

 156. In both of its Responses,Management emphasizes that Indian law requires PAPS to
        have "a valid claim to the land" before compensation is paid. "Claims are examined
        on a case by case basis by the District authorities" and during 2000 they conducted
        field camps to authenticate PAP's claims to GMK land (Ghair Mazurua Khas)


ls6According to the Requesters, Gair Mazurwa (GM) land is vacant land, which means that at the time of
the settlement it was not registered under any tenant. A very detailed special register exists for this type of
tenure. Gair Mazurwa is subdivided into GM Aam (public land, such as roads, rivers grazing fields - the
most important Common Property Resource; and into GM Khas (reserved land, which, in the absence of
tenants, is considered government land). Those who take possession de facto, with no settlement patta
(title), become sikmi ryots. Those who, on the other hand, formalize the occupation with the local revenue
office and start paying rent are called kaimi ryots with full settlement rights. Bhudan Land (or Bhumidan)
is land given to landless people either under the Bhudan Movement or under the government "land         to
landless"   program. People are given pattas, take possession and pay taxes. There are other categories for
which the Requesters informed the Panel no rights are being claimed. See Request for Inspection, supru

       land.15*According to Management, for Parej village, 8.17ha out of 59.5ha of GMK
       land has been authenticated in favor of 11 PAPS, while 13 have had their claims
       rejected regarding 8.89ha. Claims regarding the balance of 42.44ha are yet to be
       settled. For Duru village, authentication of claims regarding 107ha have been
       completed by the state authorities, but a final settlement is delayed by the transition
       to the new state Government.159In April                2002, Management stated that the
       compensation amount for recognized claims is calculated in the same manner as for
       tenancy land.160

157. Also, in both Responses, Management stresses that the supervision teams have
       monitored the land authentication process during every mission and have repeatedly
       requested CCL to make efforts to have the procedure expedited."jl In addition, they
       have asked CCL and XISS to assist the PAPS in assembling evidence for their
       claims and to see that the decisions are made in a transparent manner.162They add
       that during the February 2002 supervision                mission,     Management         "received
       assurances from CIL and CCL, that they would henceforth assist PAPS claiming
       rights in GMK land to provide the necessary documentation for authentication
       review by the state authorities."163

158. In 1997, the ESRP concluded that the Coal India Ltd. R&R policy was contrary to
       OD 4.30. They pointed out that paragraph 11 requires a "written legal document or
       reference to a record (such as a revenue officer certificate, electoral roll, ration
       order card or school report)"164as evidence that a person is a legitimate PAP. The
       ESRP stated that: "[cllearly         CIL is bound by State Laws asfar         as the land rights of
       PAPS are concerned. However, this requirement fails to acknowledge the rights of
       PAPS without written proof of land rights, including those PAPS with a claim to
       traditional land rights and is directly contrary to the requirement of the World Bank
       Operational Directive, OD 4.30"`65(emphasis added).

159. The ESRP's finding has to be examined in relation to the provisions of paragraph 17
       of OD 4.30 and paragraphs 15(c) and 17 of OD 4.20 relating to implementation of
       compensation for customary rights. As noted below, these provisions acknowledge,
       inter alia, that land tenure rights can be governed by local systems. They also
       require the issues to be addressed in the earliest stage of project planning and
       development and in the RAP.

 160. Paragraph       17 of OD 4.30 requires that: "Resettlement plans should review the
       main land tenure and transfer systems, including common property and non title-
       based usufruct systems governed by locally recognized land allocation mechanisms.
       The objective is to treat customary and formal rights as equally as possible in
       devising compensation rules and procedures. The plan should address the issues
       raised by the difherent tenure systems found in a project area, including (a) the
       compensation eligibility       of  land-dependent populations;. .. Plans should contain
       provisions for conducting land surveys and regularizing land tenure in the earliest
       stages of project development. Planning should also anticipate' the approximate
       time neededto acquire and transfer land" (emphasis added).

 161. Paragraph 15(c) of OD 4.20 concerns land tenure. It requires that "the Bank should
       offer to advise and assist the borrower in establishing legal recognition of the
       customary or traditional land -tenure systems of indigenous peoples ... These steps
       should be taken before the initiation of other planning steps that may be contingent
       on recognized land titles."

 162. Paragraph        17 of OD 4.20 states that the above should be done during the
       preparation period. "Zn a project that involves the land rights of indigenous peoples,
       the Bank should work with the borrower to clarify the steps neededfor putting land
       tenure on a regular footing as early as possible, since land disputesfrequently lead
       to delays in executing measures that are contingent on proper land titles (seepara.
       15(c))."

163. In reviewing the files available to it, the Panel concluded that, during Project
      Preparation, Management did not raise any question about these provisions. Staff
      confirmed this. When the Legal Department suggested that a "sworn afidavit"
       should be included as the type of evidence required by paragraph 11 of Coal India
      Ltd. R&R policy, the suggestion was not taken up by Management.`@ However, in
      the final review before appraisal, the Bank sociologist did point out that "the policy
      contains a number of definitional problems such as `traditional         rights of tribals'
      and lacks clarity in implementation procedures."167

164. RAPS for individual mine sites were supposedto fill the gaps in the Coal India Ltd.
      R&R policy and ensure compliance with OD 4.30. Both paragraph 17 of OD 4.30
      and paragraph 15(c) of OD 4.20 require that indigenous land rights be dealt with at
      the earliest stagesof project preparation.

165. The 1994 Parej East Baseline Survey provides "... a word of caution. Even if the
      Government of India considers the families having 0.50 acres of land as landless
     families, this concept is not followed here. It is a matter of fact       that even if one
     family has less than 0.5 acres of land, that family will be eligible for    compensation

        relatives for which they had no legal evidence."`(j9However, neither the Baseline
        Survey nor the RAP indicated how many of these PAFs were tribals cultivating land
        under traditional rights.

 166. The Parej East RAP is silent in terms of data and process for tribal's cultivation land
       under traditional rights. It simply does not say what a project affected tribal
       cultivating land under customary right is supposed to do, or when, or how he is
        supposedto do it. In addition, while the RAP describes the need for "authentication"
       of GMK land, the Panel finds it difficult            to understand how this can be achieved
       when neither the Baseline Survey, nor the 1994 RAP (nor subsequent annual
       updates of the RAP, nor the later database)provided the CCL with any list of tribals
       cultivating, or claiming to cultivate, land under customary rights. It is not possible to
       discern who owns what types of land, or to isolate those who "cultivate land under
       traditional rights."170

 167. In late 1994, the XISS, the same NGO that had prepared the Baseline Survey,
       conducted a study of mining impacts in the West Bokara area. In this study they
       refer to the RAP for Parej East, and note that "in the matter of compensation we
       found the policy guidelines are reasonable at least on paper, but many problems
       arise at the time of implementation."`71 This Report continues by saying that: "[a]s
       pointed out in our Report on Parej [referring to their Baseline Study] persons who
       do not have any papers (patta) of ownership are not entitled to compensation
       because they are cultivating Ghair Majurwa land. They have been cultivating the
       land for    two or three generations. Not to give them compensation is certainly a
       great injustice"172(emphasis added). This XISS study re-enforced the extent of the
       injustice experienced, and the harm suffered by many of the tribals in West Bokara
       area by pointing out that many of them had been involved in relocation for the
       nearby TISCO mine and had been waiting for payment since 1986 when TISCO
       acquired the site for that mine.173

168. Prior to 1995, Bank files insist that the tribals who were to be relocated had been
       taken care of in the RAPS in accordance with OD 4.30 and OD 4.20.174However,


I68Baseline Survey, supra note 59, para. 4.9.2.
169Id., para. 0.18. The Panel notes that for those who have houses whose homestead was in Gair Mazura
land the question of needing evidence would not apply because they were, in any case entitled to a plot in
the resettlement site, or later to an alternative Rs50,OOOcash compensation.
17'While the later CSESMP-CIL database (2001) designates by Tribe/Caste and ROlUUCR land, nobody is
listed under UCR. Staff informed the Panel that this is because work on inserting data in all field is not yet
complete.

174December 1994 Pre-Appraisal Mission of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project, para. 20 states that
"[t]he mission has ieviewed the requirement for a Tribal Development Plan, according to OD 4.20. The
mission found that tribal issueshave been satisfactorily addressed in the Rehabilitation Action Plans that
have been prepared for this project."


                                                                                                            41

       there is no mention of this in either the later CSESMP Sectoral EIA or the Staff
       Appraisal Report (SAR). 175Management cleared the Parej East RAP at the end of
        1994 in agreement176with the pre-appraisal mission that reported "[t]he mission has
       come to the conclusion that the actions required bv the spirit and intent of OD 4.20
       are adequately met by the Rehabilitation Action Plans.`7'77

 169. As far as the Panel can see from the records, this issue would not have surfaced had
       CASS not raised it in 1996. At this point in time Management was not responding to
       local NGOs, so a number of outside NGOs, including the Swiss Berne Declaration,
       UK Minewatch, and others, decided to support CASS's claim and presented it to the
       Bank. The Berne Declaration stated that "Coal India should ensure that the
       concerned government officials             hold camp courts in the villages and finalize
       respective certifications. 178It would be the responsibility of Coal India to get the
       required certification without harassment to PAPS. (These actions are required in
       order to comply with OD 4.20, OD 4.30 and Coal India's Displacement Policy)"`79
       (emphasis added). Management responded that "Coal Zndia cannot ensure that the
       Government hold camp courts. This is not required nor has it been agreed to by
       Coal Zndia or the Government. There is a formal appeals process, which any people
       who believe that they were neglected can follow. This appeals process is on-going
       and no guarantee is made that it will be completed before negotiations for the Coal
       Sector Rehabilitation Project are held."180On the other hand the files show that the
       Bank sociologist felt that Coal India Ltd. should be held responsible.181

170. In June 1997, after the NGOs had raised the issue a number of times,182the Bank
       team, under a new Task Leader, admitted that although Coal India Ltd. R&R policy
       stipulates that tribals cultivating         land under customary tenure arrangements are
       entitled to full compensation under package A, Coal India Ltd. admits that this is at


17'While the Coal India Ltd. Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy with the correct text is included in the
SAR, the Panel notes an error in the Table (at Box 2.3.1) that shows the evolution of Coal India Ltd.`s
R&R policy, from 1991 to 1994, lists "Tribals cultivating land under traditional   rights" as a separate
category entitled only to be "rehabilitated through self-employment schemes and jobs with contractors"
instead of as landowners entitled to the same compensation and rehabilitation options as titled owners.
176Project Files, November 17, 1994, para. 10-l 1. "ASTHR [Asia Technical Human Resourceslfinds         that
concerns and spirit of OD 4.20 will be sujjkiently addressed in the RAPS... The issuesthat need to be

      present not possible becausethere is no legal framework to accommodate this. The
      R&R policy is in this respect ineffectual unless the required legal provisions are
      created. To achieve this Coal India Ltd. accepts an additional cross-conditionality
      for the CSRPlx3(emphasis added). The Agreed Minutes of the CSRP Negotiations
      held in July        1997 state that: "The Bank team expressed its concern that
      compensation for        land held under customary tenure has not been uniformly
      provided by all Coal India's subsidiaries. The Indian delegation assured that these
      issues will be addressed to the satisfaction of the Bank."lg4In a Supplemental Letter
      to the CSRP Loan Agreement, signed in March 1998, "GIL Obligations Relating to
      Resettlement Action Plans" was attached. The "Agreed Actions" for Parej East lists
      the need for a "Record of Right" for all land held under tenure forms such as Ghai
      Mazurwa Aam, Ghai Mazurwa Khas, Bhudan and Bahamian and states that there
      were a total of eligible 382 EPAPs in Parej East.I85The Letter shows that for there
      were a total of 3,350 EPAPs at eight mines in need of a "Record of Right" and
      figures were to be provided for the other six mines.

171. Bank files reveal that, following           the July 1997 CSRP Negotiations, every Bank
      supervision mission raised the matter of compensation to tribals "cultivating                    land
      under traditional rights." Nevertheless, in June 1998 the issue was still outstanding
      with Management reporting that, according to Coal India Ltd., "since such lands
      would in efj',ct be paid for       twice (first to the concerned government authority and
      then to the PAPS) compensation to PAPS can only be considered based on a review
      of the merits of each        case."lg6  At this point, the June 1998 supervision mission
      recommended that Coal India Ltd. undertake a study of the legal framework in
      Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

172. In September 1998, a year later, there appeared to have been no action and CASS
      had to inform the Bank that in Parej East: "[ulntil           this land is recognized the PAPS
      refuse to shift."187The Task Leader told CASS that Coal India Ltd. had informed
      him that the authorities had tried to visit the area but the villagers had not
      cooperated. He suggested that CASS may be able to help in facilitating the process
      by impressing on the villagers the need for cooperation "if and when they attempt to
      verify the claims once again."188

173. Management's          Mid-Term    review    reported  that  Indian   law   only  provides
       compensation to persons who have been declared "interested persons" with a claim
       to the land recognized by the State authorities. It states that it "appears that the
       procedures used to identify       `interested persons' do not ensure that all those
       cultivating land under customary arrangements are compensated." Thus, in Parej
       East, by February 1999 "about 17 PAPS" with a recognized claim had received
       compensation. CASS gave CCL a list of another 43 PAPS cultivating GMK land in
       February 1999. "Others who also cultivate GA4K land have not had their claim for
       compensation recognized by the District Authorities."ls9 The CCL (Project Officer)
       agreed to intercede immediately "with the District Collector for review of claims for
       status as `interested persons 'for users of GMK land in Parej East."lgo

174. The above account in Parej East of traditional            land rights reveals a serious
       failure to comply with the relevant Bank policy provisions. In proceeding with
       the CSESMP,        Management     expected (and Coal India      Ltd. agreed) that the
       tribals would be treated in accordance with Bank ODs 4.30 and 4.20. Yet, it
       appears that the laws of the State of Bihar precluded such treatment           without
       documentation.      The Panel finds it difficult  to understand how, at the time of
       preparation,     Management     could be unaware of this when the Bank had been
       involved in resettlement projects in India for some years. Furthermore,           based
       on the foregoing, it seems clear that, during preparation,       Management did not
       raise any questions about the possible lack of legal recognition or the process
       required to ensure compensation for tribals cultivating       traditional land without
       title or documentation.

175. The Parej East RAP does not identify tribals as claiming             land rights; it does
       not provide any details of the process required under Bihar law; and it does not
       include a time-bound       schedule for authenticating   GMK land rights that were
       not already settled. There is no mention of camp courts or of what the PAPS
       would need to do in order to establish their rights. All this should have been
       done because Management          accepted the Coal India Ltd. R&R          policy as a
       working    framework     on the understanding     that it would review mine specific
       RAPS for compliance with OD 4.30. These now recognized flaws have resulted
       in injustice and harm.

176. Legal recognition of traditional land rights is a serious problem. In Bihar (and now
       Jharkand) authentication by state authorities is required. During its field visit, the
       Panel was told that this process was and is not on the District Administration's
       priority list, so it continues to be delayed, with the resulting serious consequences
       for the PAPS. Nearly eight years after adoption of the Coal India Ltd. policy, and the
       RAP for Parej East, about 150ha out of a total of about 167ha claimed by tribals
       "cultivating land under tradition rights" have not been settled. This is extremely
       serious, in the Panel's view, and needs immediate action.

                                                                                           44

177. The Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 17 of
     OD 4.30 and paragraphs            15(c) and 17 of OD 4.20, in connection with the
     preparation of the Parej East RAP. At the same time, the Panel recognizes that
     after this flaw was raised by CASS and international              NGOs, Management
     acknowledged      the problem.       It   raised  the issue to the level   of a cross-
     conditionality   under the CSRP loan. And, since then, it has worked               with
     persistence to try to get the matter resolved.

178. The Panel would observe that OD 4.30 is clear that compensation is supposed to be
     paid before people are involuntarily        displaced. The records indicate that months
     before December 1999, Management expressed concern that the mine expansion
     would not be able to proceed as planned in December 1999 since resettlement
     arrangements were not in place. In June 1999 CCL submitted a "contingency
     resettlement plan for 22 PAFs of Borwa Tola."`91

179. The Panel questioned Management on this and received a response in mid October
     2002. The Panel notes that there are two villages in Parej East, Parej and
     Durukasmir. With respect to Durukasmar village, the Management Response is
     clear and no PAP's         have yet been relocated. For the village       of Parej, the
     Management Response appears to deal only with one of the hamlets of Parej,
     namely Borwa Tola. This hamlet no longer exists so clearly every PAP has been
     relocated. Apparently six tribals from Borwa Tola claimed they were cultivating
     GMK land. Of these, two claims were rejected. Of the four claims approved two
     were paid compensation before relocation, one was not paid before relocation due to
     a bureaucratic error, and one had died but their heirs have not been informed of the
     claim. This response informs that 18 non-tribal PAPS apparently from Borwa Tola
     claimed they were also cultivating land under customary rights.
     This response does not state whether compensation was paid, before their
     relocation, to the seven whose claims were authenticated. Of the 11 whose claims
     were rejected, Management could not discover the status of the appeal lodged by
     eight of them, so it would appearthat they have relocated before a decision on their
     appeal. Finally,  all three times Management has addressed this question in its
     response, it mentions that for Parej village a total of 8.17ha out of 595ha has been
     authenticated and that claims regarding the other 42.44ha remain to be settled. None
     of the answers provide any further information on this, so the Panel does not know
     how many PAPS are involved, which hamlets of Parej village they are from, and
     whether or not they have been relocated. For the above reasons, the Panel notes
     that Management       has failed to provide       the Panel with evidence that it has
     complied with the OD 4.30 with regard to the compensation of PAP's who own
     land under traditional     or customary rights, prior to their relocation.

180. In  February    2000,     after the eviction,     Management    informed   CASS,   that
     compensation "is also being paid to those who hold land under customary rights
     (GMK). Of five EPAPs three have been approved as eligible for compensation, one
     is under consideration as an `interested party', and one has been rejected by the

                                                                                         45

      District    Collector     due to lack       of documentation        supporting  the claim for
      compensation."192It is not entirely clear to the Panel that these people were from
      Borwa Tola.

181. At the same time, the March 2000 supervision team spelt out a number of measures
      that CCL should take to facilitate future relocation after the Borwa Tola problem.
      Among      them, "[a]11 compensation payments should be completed before the
      relocation takes place. To improve relations with the PAPS, CCL together with the
     facilitation   NGO should assist PAPS to get claims for land under customary tenure
      (GMK land) processed before the relocation."`93

182. The Panel would observe that the 1992 Morse Commission report on the Sardar
      Sarovar dam dealt with the question of encroachers,including tribal people, holding
      land under customary rights. The Commission                    pointed out that "[bloth   states
      [Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra] have provided that encroachers who can prove
      that they were cultivating encroached land prior to a certain date ... will be entitled
      to have their interests recorded. But these arrangements depend on documented
      proof which does not often exist." The Commission estimated that at least 60 percent
      of tribal displacees in the two states, who were engaged in cultivating land, would
      not receive adequate land on resettlement. Most would become landless laborers.
      They concluded that the two States were not in compliance with the Bank's credit
      and loan agreements.194In the Panel's view, during                    the preparation    of the
      CSESMP, Management              and staff should have been aware of this 1992 Morse
      Commission finding and taken it fully into consideration.

183. In 1997, as noted earlier, the Environmental and Social Review Panel (ESRP) found
      that "[t]he poor without such documentary proof lack the knowledge and resources
      necessary to follow       the processes required to prove communal and/or traditional
      rights. This eflectively excluded them from receiving payments on land that may
      have occupied for years."19i "The whole land rights issue needs to be addressed
      once again."196The latest 2002 supervision mission report indicates that CCL will
      now help PAPS obtain the necessary documents needed to get their authentication
      reviewed, but this is too little and much too late to avoid the unnecessary harm that
      Management recognizes the PAPS have suffered.

5.1.        Access to Forest Products

184. Paragraph         15(a) of OD 4.20 points out that in an IPDP "[p]articular     attention
       should be given to rights of indigenous peoples to ... have access to natural
       resources (such as forests ...) vital to their subsistence and reproduction. " It adds
       that baseline data should include "... inventories of the resources that indigenous
       people use and technical data on their production systems; ...It is particularly
       important that baseline studies capture the full range of production and marketing
       activities in which indigenous people are engaged."

185. Paragraph 11 of OD 4.30 recognizes that Socioeconomic Surveys should describe
        ". ..information   on the full    resource base of the afSected population, including
       income derived from informal sector and non-farm activities, and from common
       property. "

186. The Request claims that "the basis for the PAPS' former non-formal economy was
       income from ... common property resources (CPR)."197However, as a result of the
       expanded mining, "common property resources ... have been greatly depleted, and
       ... are NOT being replaced."198

187. In its Response, Management points out that the depletion of forest resources has
       been caused by several years of mining in the Parej East area unrelated to Bank
       funded projects so there has been a decrease in dependence on such resources.
       Management        continues by      claiming   that the Requester's assertion "is   not
       empirically     correct"`99 since according to the Baseline Survey "there was not a
       single landless tribal family       dependent on forest produce."2ooIn any event, the
       Responsenotes, the resettlement site has been chosen in consideration of its vicinity
       to forest and grazing land. Nearby forest is accessible from both the Pindra and
       Prem Nagar resettlement site. In its April 2002 Response, Management reports that,
       in February 2002, the supervision mission discussed the availability of the resources
       with the PAPS and received positive feedback by the people who stated that they
       have accessto forest land for forest co11ection.201

188. In the Requester's view, Management's use of the statement that "not a single
       landless tribal family dependent on forest produce" is a twisted ambiguity. They
       point out that every tribal family did have a large amount of their subsistence

       income coming from the forestzo2The Requesters do not claim that any family
       relied exclusively on forest produce or common property resources. Nor do they
       claim that the tribals' former non-formal economy suddenly disappeared with the
       CSESMP.

 189. In the Panel's view, after examining the Baseline Survey, Management's approach
       to the issue is misleading. The Baseline Survey shows that there are no tribals who
       depend exclusivelv on forest products. But it makes it very clear that most of the
       population, tribals and non-tribals were dependent, in varying degrees, on forest
       products for a portion of their income or for household use. In fact, the Baseline
       Survey concludes that forest produce comprises, on the average, 9.75 percent of
       PAF income. A nearly 10 percent loss in the food supply of poor and vulnerable
       families can be a matter of survival.2o3

190. CASS assertsthat the Baseline Survey "fails to mention the right of commons or the
       common property resources which are a vital source of income for the villagers and
       for   which no compensation is being given."2o4They claim that the proposed
       rehabilitation site will obviously have none of the forest products previously used;
       nor are the villagers being compensated for their 10~s.~~~

191. Management disagrees with the Requesters and refers to the census of PAPS which
       "does list `forest collection' and `forest products' as a source of income for                those
       EPAPs, who dependedon this for part of their livelihood."206

192. The Panel notes that it was clearly incorrect of CASS to assert that the Baseline
       Survey fails to "mention" common property resources. It does so very extensively.
       However, the Panel notes that there is no individual income data in the Baseline
       Survey.

193. According to the Baseline Survey, dependence on forest products has diminished
       because of the impact of mining in the area. The number of family members whose
       main occupation is collection of forest products is 0.95 percent, and cultivation is
       13.25 percent, whereas 51.48 percent are non-agricultural                    laborers and 25.87

        percent have jobszo7However, the subsidiary occupation of 345 or 7 1.13 percent of
        the PAFs was collection of forest produce and it provided the third largest source of
        income.2o8Cultivation was the next largest subsidiary occupation engaging a total of
        90 or 18.56 percent and providing about 6.41 percent of income.2o9




                                       Picture 3: Use of forest resources


 194. It is thus clearly evident that collection of forest products is the major subsidiary
        occupation of the vast majority of the PAFs. The Baseline Survey, however, only
        provides averages. During its visits to the area, the Panel observed that both tribal
        and non-tribal communities depend on the collection of forest produce to varying
        degrees. This was also true within a community. In addition, many tribals own
        Mahua trees whose fruit is eaten as well asbrewed for liquor.

 195. The Baseline Survey indicates a loss of opportunities to accessforest products used
        for basic household needs. "Around 43.38% of PAFs reported the likely loss of
        opportunity of procuring various kinds of forest products, such as timber, fruit,
        kendu leaf herbal medicine, shoots,flower for food and leafy vegetation. 50.19% of
        the PAFs apprehended their loss of the opportunity to collect firewood                       as the
        maximum of all.      85.6%    of the PAFs revealed that [they] will lose the availability of
        mahua [oil seed], used by them in various ways domestically."210

 196. The Panel finds that the Parej East Baseline Survey provides information                          on
        the resource base of the affected population,                including    income derived from
        forest resources as required by paragraph 11(b) the OD 4.30.

5.2.      Compensation for Loss of Access to Forest Products

197. Paragraph        15 of OD 4.30 recognizes that "Some types of loss, such as ... (c)
       fishing, grazing, or forest areas, cannot easily be evaluated or compensated for in
       monetary terms. Attempts must therefore be made to establish access to equivalent
       and culturally acceptable resources and earning opportunities" (emphasis added).

198. Under the CSESMP, compensation for loss of common property resources is to be
       provided by choosing a resettlement site with accessto similar resources. The RAP
       notes that "a good forest is contiguous to the site. Hence, the families              who were
       dependent on forest in their living place can derive the samefacilities."211

199. The RAP, however, fails to provide any details about how the forest beside the
       resettlement site would adequately compensate PAPS for their loss of essential
       forest products, both in terms of their value to the household, or their income
       producing value. Over 250 families were expected to move there. There is no
       measure of the acreage of the forest beside the site, no inventory of the products it
       contains, and no indication of whether or not the forest is degraded, and, if so, to
       what extent.212

200. Although the Panel could find no record of it in the official                   documents, it is
       interesting to note that Bank staff told the Requesters213that during CSRP
       negotiations it was agreedthat a "methodology will be developed to assessthe value
       of common property resources in order to provide compensation to tribal PAPS in
       cases where such resources are lost either due to mine expansion or because the
       utilization of the resources cannot continue due to the location of the resettlement
       site.. ."214

201. Paragraphs 7-10 of OD 4.30 spell out the importance of the relationship between
       resettlers and the host population. Describing the host population as "small" and in a
       cluster of scattered homes on the eastern side, the RAP provides no indication of the
       number of homesteads or families that exist there; no indication of whether they are
       Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes or other caste designation. It asserts that the
       relocation of PAPS will not affect the economic base of the host community. It
       provides no evidence that the host community was ready to welcome the proposed
       settlement of about 339 houses.215It provides no indication that the host community
       uses the forest resources and to what extent. It does not say whether the host
       community has been consulted, or if it has, whether it is prepared to sharethe forest.
       It does not even indicate that the host community is aware of the fact that it would
       be asked to sharethe forest with a huge influx of outsiders.

202. During its visit to the resettlement site at Prem Nagar, where there is no host
      community, the Panel found that the PAPS are using the adjacent forest for some
      purposes but that their right to use it is disputed by the Forest Department, which
      owns both the site and the forest. During its visit to Pindra, the Panel found that the
      around 20 families of PAPS who were relocated there have access to the adjacent
      forest, apparently without opposition from the host community.

203. In its Response, Management points out that PAFs now have a choice of taking
      Rs50,OOOand are no longer choosing to relocate at the Pindra resettlement site, in
      which case CCL would not be able to facilitate access to common property
      resources. But, to the extent "that PAFs choose to settle in the villages that are
      targeted for IPDP     activities, they will be able to benefit from the community
      development assistance extended by CCL. `j216

204. As provided for in paragraph 15(c) of OD 4.30 the RAP states that the Pindra
      resettlement  site will provide equivalent       access to the forest, but it fails to
      support this statement with any details about the adjacent forest including
      whether the forest will support the same income earning opportunities          for the
      227 families originally   expected to move there, or whether the host community
      is prepared to share the resource. The Panel found no evidence to indicate that
      during appraisal Management          ensured that access would be available or that
      access to the forest beside Pindra would provide PAPS who moved there with
      equivalent compensation for loss of their access to forest products. Because of
      this, the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph
      15(c) of OD 4.30 during Preparation.

                                 6. Income Restoration

 205. Paragraph 3 of OD 4.30 states that the objective of the policy on Involuntary
       Resettlement is to ensure that "the population displaced by a project receives
       benefits from it." With respect to income restoration, paragraph 3(b) (iii) states that
       the displaced people must be "assisted in improving their former living standards,
       income earning capacity and production levels, or at least in restoring them" and
       adds that " Particular attention should be paid to the needs of the poorest groups to
       be resettled. "

206. Before the CSESMP was approved, the Requesters sent repeated complaints to
       Management about the proposed income restoration scheme for Parej East which
       they considered fundamentally flawed in its design. In their Request for Inspection,
       they now assertthat income restoration has failed, and that, as a result, the CSESMP
       has "only impoverished people."211CASS claims that the project "set out to do what
       is impossible"218so that "three years after displacement the people of Turi Tola and
       Borwa Tola have not regained their former standard of living ..."219

207.   In its Response, Management reports that income levels were analyzed for 337 of
       the 625 EPAPs entitled to income restoration. Income data was available from both
       the 1997 census and either the June 2000 or April 2001 census. "Of those 337
       EPAPs, 265 or 79% have reported that they have either maintained or increased
       their   incomes, during        the project      period,    after  adjusting for       inflation."22a
       Management acknowledges that "[aldditionally,             11% of the EPAPs have reported a
       decrease in income while 10% have reported incomes that have not kept pace with
       inflation. "221The Response does not indicate the income level brackets of the 21
       percent of the 337 EPAPs surveyed who have seen a decline in their standard of
       living.222In its April 2002 Response, Management also gives figures and provides
       charts showing an improvement in inflation-adjusted, monthly-average, individual

221Ibid.
222Management Comments 2002, supru note 34, para. 10, in Annex 3 of this Report. Management claims
that the incomes of only 16 percent of EPAPs have decreased: "Analysis of inflation adjusted income data
for Purej East from the April 2001 census, shows that for the 236 EPAPs (out of the total caseload of 480
EPAPs), who had two or more data points from which their incomes could be compared, 64% have
increased their incomes, 20% have maintained their pre-project incomes, while 16% have experienced a
decrease in their reported incomes. Among the 79 EPAPsf rom the tribal population    (out of a total of 1.52),
who had two or more data points from which their incomes could be compared, 58% have increased their
reported incomes, 25% have maintained their pre-project incomes, while 16% have experienced a

        income from 1997 to 2001, as well as the household incomes of EPAPs in Parej
        East from 1994 through 2001.223

208. The Requesters also submitted a list of EPAPs from the four villages of Parej who,
        they claim, are entitled to rehabilitation assistance that they were not receiving. It
        shows the EPAPs' current condition/status/sources of income.224In its April 2002
        Response, Management provided a detailed analysis of the list. It compares, where
        possible, the 1997-survey reported incomes with the reported 2000 or 2001-survey
        incomes.225In light of this, Management contends that "of the 167persons on the list
        submitted by CASS, only 40 could actually be entitled to economic rehabilitation
        assistance under the CSESMP."226The Panel accepts the clarification Management
        provides to the Requesters' claims about the incomes of the 167 persons. The details
        are available in Annex 3 to the 2002 Management Response attached as Annex 3 to
        this Report. The Panel also notes that, as discussed in the previous chapter, it will be
        difficult assessthe increase or decreasein the incomes of EPAPs who choose not to
       relocate to the resettlement site, since the 1994 and 1997 income data bases do not
       record individual household informal income amounts.

209. The Requesters maintain that "in spite of the sincere and best efsorts of WB persons,
        in spite of the sincere and best efsorts of CCL persons, in spite of most                    of the
       progress bench-marks being achieved, in spite of any number of inspections,
       consultants and experts, the fact       is that the PAPS have been now deprived of their
       former economic survival base, andfor an alarming large number of them, this has
       NOT been replaced."227In the Panel's view, this is largely correct.

210. The Bank's objective in OD 4.30 on Involuntary                   Resettlement is to ensure that
       people, who are displaced, benefit from the project.                    Displaced people must
       be assisted to improve or at least restore their standard of living. In spite of
       significant    efforts on the part of various Bank officials                and others involved
       during implementation,          these objectives have not been achieved in Parej East
       and, as a result, PAPS have been harmed and continue to suffer harm.

211. While       it  is absolutely      essential for     the Bank       to support       these difficult
       challenges, the Panel would caution that unless they are matched by time, the
       early planning        required    by OD 4.30, the resources and realism                  needed to
       achieve them, the poorest and most vulnerable                  of the people affected by the
       project may end up carrying a disproportionately                heavy burden.

cut off date in 1997; 24 of the remaining 77 have relocated elsewhere, as indicated by CASS itself; two
have died and 11 have either a pension or ajob in the mines. After applying the criteria of the R&R policy,

 212. In light of the above, the Panel finds that, as Management itself recognizes, it is
       not in compliance with paragraphs 3(b)(iii) of OD 4.30 since, according to the
       April    2002 Management Response, the income of at least 21 percent of EPAPs
       in the Parej East subproject had not been improved, still less, restored.


 6.1.     RAP Entitlements             in Parej East

 213. Paragraph 16 of OD 4.30 notes that "the resettlement plan must include land
       allocation or culturally acceptable alternative income-earning strategies to protect
       the livelihood of these people."

214. Prior to 1993, Coal India Ltd. provided mine jobs, in addition to monetary
       compensation for land loss. With the phasing out of Government support during the
       early nineties, Coal India Ltd. was unable to continue this practice. Moreover, the
       objective of the CSRP, the Bank's parallel investment project, was to reduce
       employment and increase mine profitability.               It is clear from the project files that
       Management recognized that employment in the mine could no longer be an income
       restoration option.228

215. In light of this, Management determined that a new Coal India Ltd. policy would
       have to provide a wider range of options for the PAPS than employment in the
       mine.229It identified (a) an option for the purchase of equivalent land using the
       compensation they received for land; (b) assistance to establish non-farm self
       employment through the provision of infrastructure, petty contracts or the formation
       of co-operatives; and (c) for PAPS with less than two acres, a rehabilitation
       assistance grant against productive assetsor a rehabilitation allowance. In addition,
       Coal India Ltd. accepted the requirement of Bank OD 4.30 that sharecroppers, land
       lessees and tenants must be entitled to resettlement packages. Coal India Ltd. R&R
       policy entitled them either to assistance in establishing self-employment, or to help
       in obtaining jobs with contractors.230Employment in the mine would only be given
       to those who lost land, if this was feasible for the subsidiary.231And for the landless,
       jobs could be given on a preferential basis when outside recruitment became
       necessary.232

216. The options CCL offered in the Parej East RAP are identical to those provided in
       the Coal India Ltd. R&R policy. But CCL spells out the size of land holding that
       qualifies those who lose land for ajob in the mine.233

233For every three acres of non-irrigated land or two acres of irrigated land owned, a PAP who had
graduated from school is offered one job. For those who have not graduated from school, one job for every
two acres of land is offered. However, a number of families with smaller land holdings are entitled to
combine their holdings and nominate one person for ajob. RAP, supru. note 74, para. 1.3.2.


                                                                                                        54

217. The 1994 Baseline Survey for Parej East recorded the future income restoration
       preferences of the 514 EPAPs from the 257 families to be displaced.234The RAP
       repeats235the PAPS stated preferences and records that 223 people chose "sewice,"
        117 opted for the "land for land' package, and the rest expressed a preference for
       either self-employment or continuing their former occupation (animal husbandry,
       business, cottage industry).

218. The Requesters and international NGOs who supported them contended that the
       Parej East RAP contained fundamental flaws. They pointed out that the PAPS
       expected, but were not receiving, jobs in the mine; there was no viable land-for-land
       option; no proper income base was established, as there is no record of the informal
       economy; non-farm based self-employment schemes were not based on a market
       survey; it was unrealistic to expect PAPS in Parej East to adapt to the concept and
       culture of non-farm self employment in the short space of five years; there was no
       plan for income restoration to be completed before relocation; there was no
       assistance to PAPS to face the transition period; and the subsistence allowance was
       inadequate. Each of these is addressedbelow.


6.1.1. Jobs in The Mine

219. Paragraph 30 of OD 4.30 requires that the Bank appraisal mission must "ascertain
       ... thefeasibility of the implementation arrangements" in the RAP.

220. The Requesters claim that CCL's employment of PAPS in the Parej East mine "has
       by company policy been kept minima1."236They assert that the PAPS agreed to shift
       against the promise of jobs in the mine.

221. In its Response, Management asserts that "[tlhe NGOs conducted an extensive
       house to house census ...[t o] receive input on each individual's preferred means of
       economic rehabilitation       if jobs in the coal mines were not available"237(emphasis
       added).

222. The Panel notes that there is nothing in the records that it has seen to show that the
       EPAPs in Parej East were asked to do this. Nor is there anything to show that they
       were informed that it would not be possible for them to obtain ajob without meeting
       the minimum land holding size.238

235See RAP, supra note 74, para. 3.5.

237Management Response 2001, supra note 13, para. 35.
238RAP, supra note 74, para. 3.4.5(a). The RAP states that "[a]s per present land schedule only   15 persons
qualifyfor  the job in CCL." See para. 3.4.5(a). This was particularly important in Parej East since all tribals
owned some amount of land because local laws did not allow them to transfer it to non-tribals. Therefore as
the Baseline Survey notes all PAPS were landowners except two (who were not tribal).


                                                                                                             55

223. The evidence is clear that in 1994 nearly half the EPAPs wanted and expected jobs
       in the mine. The Panel is surprised to observe that, in 1994, the PAPS were allowed
       to express a preference for ajob in CCL, regardless of the size of their land holding,
       considering that, during Project Preparation, Management itself made the point that
       CCL was the onlv subsidiary that was "unlikely to be able to offer any jobs to
       affected people."239It is clear that Management failed to notice that 223 EPAPs in
       Parej East wanted a job in the mine, while the RAP stated clearly that only 15 of
       them qualified for one.24o

224. Management also failed to notice that the PAPS who wanted jobs expressed no
       alternative if a job was not available. The Panel believes that if Parej East had been
       a stand-alone Bank project, instead of one of fourteen subprojects, the Bank
       appraisal review of the RAPS would have picked up this very misleading message
       being given to the PAPS.

225. Only in 1997 when the Turi Tola PAPS were resisting their relocation, did the Bank
       supervision team note the discrepancy between what the PAPS expected and what
       was actually available. They reported that "there seems to have beenproblems in the
       past, in the sensethat the previous mine manager had given PAPS promises of jobs,
       that were not available"241(emphasis added).

226. Only during the updated census of PAPS, carried out in 1997, were the majority of
       Parej East PAPS presented with the fact that they would not get a mine job, and
       must instead choose a self-employment income restoration scheme.242

227. In the Panel's view, it is quite understandable that PAPS who opted for jobs in
       June 1994 should naturally          expect to receive those jobs. Nor is it surprising
       that those who owned less than two acres continued to demand and expect jobs
       for land. It must have been a shock for them to discover otherwise when finally
       presented with the reality of their situation in early 1997. The Panel finds that
       Management         was not in compliance with paragraph 30(e) of OD 4.30 during
       preparation and appraisal of the Parej East RAP.


6.1.2. Land for Land

228. Paragraph 4 of OD 4.30 state that "Preference should be given to land-based
       resettlement strategies for people displaced from agricultural settings."



239See March 1994 Aide Memoire, para. 5.
240The 15 land-owing PAPS who qualified in 1994 received jobs in the mine. In its Response, the
Management states that that another nine PAPS, who had sufficient land to qualify, have received jobs.
241Project Files, April 10, 1997.
242The 1998 Annual RAP, para. 2, states that seven EPAPs opted for training in driving cars and eight for
basket making. The Quarterly Consultant Report for period ending March 1998, reports that 51 trainees had
been identified and training programs arranged for drivers and tailors. To date, 31 EPAPs had received
training.


                                                                                                        56

229. The Requesters contend that "whereas WB OD 4.30 says `The Bank encourages
       land for land approaches', this land replacement option has not been pursued." In
       its Response, the Management points out that the Coal India Ltd. R&R policy
       option consists of an offer from the subsidiary to assist PAPS in identifying and
       purchasing land. According to the Management "the PAPS were informed of this
       option when the R&R Policy was issued in April 1994, but CCL has not received
       requestsfor such assistance."243

230. The Parej East RAP states that CCL will offer assistance to PAPS, "wherever
       possible," to purchase land on a willing buyer - willing seller basis "within a limited
       geographic area and specified time period," and it stipulates that the "land and area
       should provide better or at least the same income that the PAPS were deriving from
       their original      land."244It is clear, as Management states, that the PAPS were
       informed of this option. But it is not clear why Management states that CCL
       received no requests for such assistance. The Parej East RAP states that, in 1994
       117 PAPS opted for assistance in identifying                  and purchasing land because they
       wished to continue their traditional occupation as farmers, and confirms that 11.5
       PAPS qualified for this rehabilitation option.245

231. The ESRP visited some mines, including the CCL mines, in 1997. They noted that
       parts of the Coal India Ltd. policy                 were a source of much discontent and
       confusion.246They observed that, contrary to Bank policy, "this [land for land]
       option has never been offered to PAPS in any of the Subsidiaries visited. Partly as a

245Ibid. See also Baseline Survey, supra note 59, para. 6.3(2). Repeating the Baseline Survey analysis the
RAP stated that in Parej village, 27 out of 32 families wanted land along with irrigation facilities and inputs
with only five satisfied with land alone. In Durukasmar village, 29 out of 51 were expecting land along
with irrigation facilities. A total of 83 families opted for land for land.

                                                                                                            57

        result, the question of the adequacy of compensation paid for                   land is an important
        source of discontent with landowners."247

 232. During interviews, Bank staff, as well as Coal India Ltd. and CCL officials, told the
        Panel that no nearby replacement land was available at Parej East. However, in its
        Response, Management states that "a total of 44 purchases of replacement land
        have been made by PAFs comprising a total of 97 EPAPs."~~~This was apparently
        done without CCL assistance.Management provides no details about location of the
        replacement land, its quality, comparative size, or whether it was purchased with
        compensation money alone. In addition, Management does not indicate whether the
        land and area are providing a better or at least the same, income that the PAP was
        deriving from his original land.

 233. In April 2000, Coal India Ltd. revised its policy, essentially dropping the land for
        land option. Instead, it provides for monetary compensation, in addition to land
        compensation,         "for     land   losers whose loss of           land   entitle   them to mine
        employment."249

234. In their September 2000 report on Institutional Strengthening, the IMC recognized
        that the land-for-land option is not common in India. However, it should be "the
        easiest to implement as nearly all the PAPS have the necessary skills for                    it."250 The
        IMC suggested that "the simplest approach would be to allow any PAPS ... to select
        an area of similar size and productive capacity to that affected by the project."251
        Recognizing that Coal India Ltd. policy provides for nothing more than the cost of
        land, they propose that "some transitional costs should be contemplated in any land
       for   land proposal" such as legal fees related to land purchase and allowances to
        cover the period between the move and the first harvest.2s2The Panel agrees and
        suggests that Management               take this advice fully on hoard before commencing
        another similar project.

235. Under the Bank's policy, the land for land option is not mandatory,                               but it is
        clearly preferred wherever possible. Under CCL's Parej East RAP, CCL was
        to offer assistance to PAPS to find replacement land. According to Management
        CCL received no requests for such assistance. But in the RAP some 117 opted
        for    this assistance and 115 qualified.                Management         also indicated        in its

247Id ., p. 6. In its next report, the ESRP concluded that "[tlhe stated reason is that the necessary
replacement land is not available.       We are unsure whether this is true or whether the approach being
followed merely avoids the higher land acquisition costs which the Subsidiaries would have to incur if they
pursued this option." See also Id., para. 3.1.4.2.
24aSee Management Comments 2002, supra note 34, para. 19, in Annex 3 of this Report.
249See November 1994 Aide Memoire, para. 22. The payment is Rs100,OOOfor the first acre of land, or
pro-rata payment subject to a minimum of Rs25,OOO. For the two and three acres the compensation is,
respectively, Rs75,OOOand Rs50,OOOon pro-rata basis for land above three acres.

       Response that a large number of PAFs found replacement land, indicating that,
       with effort, it could be obtained. The Panel finds that Management was not in
       compliance with paragraph 4 of OD 4.30.


6.1.3. Non-Farm Based Self-Employment

236. OD 4.30 requires a detailed resettlement plan, a timetable                       and a budget if
       displacement cannot be avoided. Paragraph 4 statesthat "[rlesettlement plans should
       be built around a development strategy and package aimed at improving or at least
       restoring the economic base for             those relocated." The importance of project
       preparation work is stressed.Paragraph 29 states that "[dluring project preparation,
       the feasibility     of resettlement must be established, a strategy agreed upon, the
       resettlement plan drafted, and budget estimates prepared." Paragraph 30 requires
       "[slubmission       to the Bank of a time-bound resettlement plan and budget that
       conforms to Bank policy            is a condition      of   appraisal for    projects     involving
       resettlement."

237. The Requesters claim that the "the much flaunted self-employment projects which
       the Bank guaranteed would fill        in for    the [CCL employment] shortages, are grossly
       failing   to replace livelihood, if they have at all materialized."2i3 They contend that
       the income restoration schemes in Parej East "are mostly on paper, they have not
       worked on the ground."2i4

238. In its Response, Management states that the 1994 Baseline Survey identified 418
       EPAPs entitled to income restoration assistance.This number was increased to 625
       EPAPs in the 1997 census,255of whom 169 are in training or are still to be trained. In
        1994, just 26 EPAPs expressed an interest in self-employment.                      Another     109
       expressed an interest in continuing their current primary occupations (animal
       husbandry, cottage industries, and business). Yet, it is evident that three years later,
       in 1997, most EPAPs had to choose a self-employment option to restore their former
       standard of living. There is nothing in either the 1994 Baseline Survey or the RAPS
       to indicate that the EPAPs were counseled about the implications                     of the self-
       employment option, and nothing to suggest that the EPAPs were aware of the
       implications of trying to become full time entrepreneurs.256


          6.1.3.1.            The Market Surveys

239. Paragraph 30(e) of OD 4.30 requires the Bank appraisal mission to ascertain, inter
       alia, "the feasibility of the implementation arrangements." It does not spell out the
       need to conduct market surveys on the income restoration options offered to
       displaced PAPS. However, Bank internal reviews advise Staff to carry out feasibility

       studies on income restoration during the preparation stage.257Bank staff interviewed
       by the Panel confirmed that this should be done.

240. Management cleared the Parej East RAP in December 1994. From the preparation
       of the RAP in 1994 to the approval of the CSESMP in May 1996, no market survey
       was conducted. Nor had any study been undertaken of the PAPS' capacity to
       become entrepreneurial. From early 1997 Bank supervision reports recognized that
       training was being offered for occupations that had not been the subject of any
       economic, financial or technical feasibility test.X* The records indicate that it was
       March 1998 before the Parej East market survey was prepared, in compliance with a
       condition of effectiveness for the CSRP loan.259This was four years after the
       original RAP and nearly two years after approval of the CSESMP.

241. However late, the March 1998 Market Survey26oappearsadequate in identifying the
       technical, economic and financial needs of the Parej East community, particularly
       the consumption needs of the mine and the ability of local PAPS to participate in
       this economy. It attempts to addressthe specific problems and needs of the PAPS in
       Parej East. It also does a good job of listing particular products and services
       required by the mine, and identifies those which could be provided by PAPS
       including    unskilled labor to contractors (e.g. cleaning, maintenance, cooking,
       security, construction) and producing foods for mine personnel (e.g. dairy, meat,
       spices, vegetables, and mushrooms).

242. The problem of income restoration or generation does not lie with the Market
       Survey itself but in the absence of follow-up                      mechanisms to implement           its
       suggestions. In particular, subsequent annual RAPS fail to follow up on the central
       suggestion of developing a Central Marketing Cell (CMC) and hiring a consultant to
       facilitate the self-income projects. The RAPS discuss "training"                     only in general
       terms without specific reference to the particular situation at Parej East and its
       PAPS. In addition, while the Market Survey is adequate in identifying                             needs,
       feasibility studies testing some of its suggestions could have and should have been
       done within a short time of its completion. The measures suggested by the Market
       Survey as avenues of income restoration are not adequately addressedin the annual
       RAPS. Workshops and seminars suggested by the annual RAPS are not in
       themselves sufficient to implement theseincome generation ideas.

243. The Panel finds that Management failed to ascertain the adequacy or feasibility
       of the self-employment         income rehabilitation            strategy in the Parej East RAP


257See, for example, a handbook on involuntary resettlement projects in India, that specifically advises the
staff to conduct technical and financial feasibility studies of all income generating options, in order to
determine each option's capacity to help achieve the goal of restoring the PAPSpre-project income.

       during appraisal and, after a Market               Survey was finally       conducted in March
       1998, it failed to ensure that the recommended follow-up measures were taken.
       In light of this, Management           was not in compliance with paragraphs 24, 29,
       and 30 of OD 4.30.


         6.1.3.2.           Income Restoration through Self-Employment

244. Paragraph 24 of OD 4.30 requires the Bank to ensure that displaced people are
       "assisted to improve, or at least restore their former living standards, income
       earning capacity, and production levels." Coal India Ltd. R&R policy states that
       PAPS will be assisted "to establish non-farm self-employment through the provision
       of infrastructures, petty contracts or formation of c00peratives."261CCL's original
       RAP states that CCL "would render assistance to PAFs in taking up non-farm
       income restoration measures."262(emphasis added)

245. The Requesters contend that "after a suitable lapse of time" self-employment
       schemes have failed           to   restore incomes.263 In          its   Response, Management
       acknowledges that "[iIncome restoration requires not only adequate training but
       also follow up support to enable the PAPS to use the training received."264

246. Management indicates that about 37 percent of the EPAPs who have completed
       training    are earning an income related to it.265In its April                  2002 Response,
       Management emphasizes that the focus is now on training follow-up assistance for
       the EPAPs who, as yet, have not established a relevant income base.`"

247. In the Panel's view, this follow-up assistance should have been designed or planned
       as part of an income-generation strategy, as it is recognized in the CSESMP SAR as
       we11.267

248. In its Response, Management suggests a number of reasons for lack of income
       earning after training. For example, they point out that CCL has provided support in
       terms of infrastructure and/or productive assets to 78 EPAPs. Even with this,
       Management considers that "there is no guarantee that the EPAPs will make the
       necessary effort to turn this assistance into a viable source of income." Whatever

        incomes by means of their own or with assistance from the project, 268remain in the

249. The Panel is surprised that Management would accuse those who never asked to be
        relocated of "not making the necessary efsort" to do something that was imposed
        upon them by those who acknowledged that such schemes had mostly failed
        elsewhere. After all, the PAPS never expressed a preference for non-farm self-
        employment; they were erroneously led to believe for years that they would get a
       job in the mine; and they were in effect forced into this situation for the greater good
        of others. Most are already suffering the extra traumas of displacement experienced
        by the poor, many of whom have been forced to give up ownership for land without
        title, or have been waiting for years to receive compensation for tribal land rights, or
        who received court awards for increased land compensation that is now being
       challenged by CCL.

250. During its visits to the Pindra resettlement site, the Panel observed that a number of
       PAPS appeared to be listless and depressed. Given their initial vulnerability, the
       many uncertainties they have experienced and, in some cases, their still pending
        anxieties, it seems understandable that some would suffer depression. Paragraph 19
       of OD 4.30 stressesthe need for health services to prevent increases in "morbidity"
       due to "the stress of being uprooted."270The Panel considers that this condition
       deservesappropriate treatment rather than criticism.

251. Amount         of Income     from    Self-Employment.         In its Response, Management
       explains that "[elf     the 138 EPAPs who have completed training,                       58 report
       additional sources of income. After training, the level of income is likely to fluctuate
       depending upon the season, the type of trade, and the amount of time the EPAP has
       available to practice the trade."271

252. In the Panel's view, it was misleading to advocate training/self employment as the
       means to restore most EPAPs standard of living in Parej East. As pointed out by the
       ESRP, poor families in India cannot survive on one source of income and tend to
       have many jobs each year. The data in the Baseline Survey indicates that this was
       evident from the outset in Parej East.

253. The supervision team appearsto have recognized, quite early on in implementation,
       that in reality the training/self employment schemesin Parej East could only provide
       a supplementary source of income. For example, in December 2001 the supervision
       team points out that 89 EPAPs who have taken training are using their skills to
       supplement their household earnings. Activities like cane basket making and carpet


268Management Response 2001, supra note 13, para. 84 note 53, notes that: "[alportion  of the EPAPs are
women who are using the skills acquired to meet their household needs and do not intend to generate
outside income."

      making continue to provide supplementary income. Those engaged in basket
      making also work for coal loading contractors.272The Panel concurs and considers
      that this approach places self-employment schemes in a correct perspective for a
      community like Parej East.

254. Many EPAPs engaged in the informal sector were not interested in self-employment
      training. In its Response, Management acknowledges that "[plotential                         incomes
      derived from most of the self-employment training options cannot compete with
      those of mine employees or those who are engaged in the sale of pilfered coal and
      the production of coking coal. In Parej East, the incomes of the 87 EPAPs who are
      engaged in the pilferage and sale of coking coal rangefrom Rs.3.50to Rs.2,500 per
      month and average Rs.l,200per month."273

255. In preparing the CSESMP, Bank staff were aware of the huge risk and challenge
      involved in accepting a policy that essentially made non-farm self-employment the
      only income restoration measure available for PAPS to regain their standard of
      living.274However, while the Bank had long acknowledged that experience with
      non-farm based self-employment               schemes was rarely successful, particularly in
      India, it accepted such schemes as the central pillar of Coal India Ltd.`s R&R policy
      for restoring or improving standard of living of those involuntarily                 resettled. The
      initial approach after the CSESMP was approved appears to have been to put off
      consideration of other alternatives until it was shown definitively that the strategy
      had not worked.

256. In 1996, the Task Manager informed the Requesters that "... a time of one year
      [should] be given to see if the new policies work. Then an independent review panel
      would be coming to see the situation."275Just over a year later the independent ESRP
      did visit the site. It found that "training villagers in new income -generating skills
      and actually creating viable alternative income sources is dificult                    and ... takes
      much time."276The ESRP repeatedthis judgment during each of the next four years.
      In its 2000 Report, they said that "the results from the income restoration activities
      to date have been largely disappointing."

257. In June 1997, Management admitted that the self-employment schemes were not
      working. Recognizing this, the current supervision team insisted that Coal India Ltd.
      find other alternative income generating schemes, suggesting that the most obvious
      was land based277(emphasis added). The Staff member concerned in the matter told

       the Panel during interviews that non-farm self-employment                      should be just one
       option among several others.

258. During Project Preparation            and appraisal, Management relied almost entirely
       on non-farm     self-employment         as the strategy to regain standards of living,
       without   assessing its feasibility        for income restoration          in Parej East. As a
       result, many PAPS in Parej East have failed to restore their living standard and
       incomes to their previous levels and consequently have suffered and continue to
       suffer harm.


       6.1.4.     Wage Labor

259. Coal India Ltd. R&R policy entitles sharecroppers, land lessees, tenants and day
       laborers to jobs with contractors. It states that "[clontractors             will be persuaded to
       give jobs to eligible PAPS on a preferential basis, where feasible"278(emphasis
       added). The Requesters state that "while a few PAPS find daily wage employment
       around the mine the majority are not able to do so," and contractors are not giving
       jobs to the PAPs.~~~

260. In its April 2002 Response, Management replies that "causal labor opportunities
       exist, and have been capitalized               on by      interested PAPs.~~OAccording         to
       Management, CCL has also "made an agreement with the contractors who execute
       civil works contracts for the mine to employ PAPS as causal laborers."281

261. In the Panel's view, it is a positive development that the supervision                      team's
       efforts to get formal agreement to employ PAPS as causal laborers have finally
       succeeded and it is to be hoped that this will make quite a difference to some of
       the displaced families.


6.2.      Timing of Income Restoration

262. From 1996 to date, the Requestershave raised several basic issues about the timing
       of income restoration. In summary, they stated that the Bank had a misguided
       assumption about the length of time it would take for the Parej East population to
       become entrepreneurial; income restoration should be in place before PAPS are
       displaced; there must be a time bound transition period with payments to help PAPS
       for a reasonable period to make the switch between current and new livelihoods;
       and the rehabilitation grant was not available to the PAPS in Parej East. These are
       taken up in turn.

         62.1.    Changing into Entrepreneurs

263. During the investigation, the Requesters told the Panel that the people of Parej East,
      whether tribal or non-tribal, have largely lived in a non-formal, non-monetary
      economy, with little social mobility, little education and no entrepreneurial skills. In
      their view, if you dispossess such people of their natural resource subsistence basis,
      there is no way they could be rehabilitated within                  the five-year span of the
      CSESMP.282They felt that "to convert a person from a tradeless villager ... into an
      entrepreneur will take not less than a decade.7'283

264. During interviews, one Staff member recognized that the PAPS would find it very
      difficult to become businessmen, while others focused on the Bank's effort to help
      Coal India Ltd. change its culture. They stressed the time it takes for a huge
      corporation run by engineers to change its approach to involuntary resettlement,
      especially its approach towards the poor, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.
     During project preparation, Coal India Ltd. recognized its lack of capacity to carry
      out resettlement according to Bank conditions, and, at times, objected to adopting its
     new policy for this reason. To deal with this, one of the three components of the
      CSESMP is capacity building.

265. As OD 4.30 recognizes, special attention must be given when the poor and
      vulnerable are involuntarily     resettled. In the Panel's view, the PAPS in Parej East
      were being asked to make a huge adjustment in their lives. Even though their life
      and income base had gradually changed before the CSESMP started, it is also clear
     that, to their detriment, they have not been able to participate in the new economy.
     The literacy rate alone suggests their vulnerability,            as does the fact that for the
     largest percentage of them, causal or wage labor, was their main source of income.
     Tribals, in particular, had already been deprived of much of their traditional sources
     of income because expanding mines had encroached over their traditional lands, or
     the forests were degraded.

266. In the Panel's view, it was unrealistic to assume that, in the space of five short
     years, people affected by the project in Parej East, many of them poor tribals lacking
     social mobility, education, or an entrepreneurial culture, can be uprooted from their
     communities, transferred to a new one, provided with training for self employment,
     and some level of monetary compensation and then expected to improve, or at least
     restore, their former living       standards, income earning capacity and production
     levels. It was Ddoubly unrealistic when it is understood that, before this can
     commence, the implementing agency, CCL, must undergo a significant change in
     institutional culture and build new capacity to undertake environmental, social and
     resettlement work. The Panel found evidence that, with the Bank's assistance,
     progress had been made in this regard, but even CCL admits that much remains to
     be done.

267. In the Panel's view it was a major planning                   flaw for the Bank not to have
      recognized that it was unrealistic           to expect that the PAPS in Parej East could
      become entrepreneurs in five years. In accordance with paragraph 30 of OD
      4.30 the feasibility     of Parej East PAPS regaining their livelihood through self-
      employment should have been reviewed when the RAP was appraised.


6.2.2. Rehabilitation before Displacement

268. The Requesters, backed by international NGOs, complained that the strategy for
      income restoration should have been in place and implemented long before people
      were displaced.284Management replied that "[t]otaZ economic rehabilitation is not
      possible before displacement, since the success of the rehabilitation                 can only be
      assessedafter resettlement"285

269. Resettlement causes immediate hardship compounded by loss of income and, in an
      ideal world,      income restoration activities         should clearly     be in place before
      displacement. But, in practice, the Panel appreciates Management's view that total
      economic rehabilitation may be impossible before displacement. In the particular
      case of Parej East, however, there was a long time period between completion of the
      RAP in 1994 and actual displacement (1998, 1999, and 2000). According to the
      experts this time gap is usually about two years, not four, five, or six. Two years
      seems a sufficient amount of time to have the income restoration plans well in place
      to accommodate PAPS before they shift.

270. The first PAPS had been scheduled for relocation in 1997 but objected because,
      among other things, they did not know how they would survive. However, Coal
      India Ltd. officials told the Panel that they had personally intervened and made a
      special arrangement for income generation for these PAFs. They then agreed to
      move. Clearly, then, there was not even an income restoration strategy for Parej East
      before PAFs began to be displaced. Since then, according to one Staff member,
      many PAPS have at least been given training before being shifted.

271. In the Panel's view, a feasible strategy for income generation should have been
      in place in Parej East at the time the RAP was prepared.

62.3.     Transition Period and Subsistence Allowance

272. The Requesters complain              that the Coal India Ltd. R&R                policy   mentions a
       subsistence allowance,286but that allowance has never been given to the eligible
       PAPS. In any event, they claim, at the fixed rate of 300Rs a month it could not
       achieve any subsistence purpose.287Without referring specifically to a transitional
       allowance, the Requesters further complain that many PAPS have lived, and are
       living, off their compensation money, while other families still find it difficult to
       sustain themselves.288

273. In its April       2002 Response, Management asserts that "no PAP has received a
       subsistence allowance because the eligibility              criteria have not been met"289and
       further states that the Coal India Ltd. policy does not mention an amount. In the
       Response, Management does not refer to the possible existence of a transitional
       allowance under the RAP.

274. The Panel notes that OD 4.30 para. 3(b)(ii) calls for support during the transition
       period in the resettlement site. Pursuant to that, the Coal India Ltd. policy provides
       for the "transition period to be kept to a minimum,"29oThe Parej East RAP reiterates
       the Coal India Ltd.`s R&R policy.

275. The Panel also notes that the conversion of OD 4.30 to OP 4.12 in December 2001
       explains this policy requirement more clearly when it states that the RAP should
       include measures to ensure that displaced persons are "ofired                         support after
       displacement, for a transition period, based on a reasonable estimate of the time
       likely to be needed to restore their livelihood and standard of living."291The policy
       adds suggestions concerning the type of support to be offered. "Such support could
       take the form of short-term jobs, subsistence support, salary maintenance or similar
        arrangements."

276. According to Bank records, as far back as 1991, a Bank sociologist stated that there
        should be a separate section on the transition arrangements for all categories of
        PAPS.292A few years later, in 1994, the legal department asked Management to
        persuade Coal India Ltd. to establish target dates for the transition period, because

       certain aspects of the resettlement plan need to be time bound.293In 1995, an NGO
       associated with CASS proposed assistancefor up to three years until PAPS had been
       restored to at least their former standard of living.

277. One of the Bank's experts on involuntary resettlement acknowledged that the Bank
       should require some sort of transition package, ideally cash income for a defined
       length of time that includes the period of retraining. The Task Leader informed the
       Panel that he felt cash assistance was dangerous as PAPS would be very unlikely to
       make any effort to follow up on their training. Instead, he had continually pushed
       Coal India Ltd. to help PAPS in transition with immediate investment assistance
       after they had completed their training but acknowledged that this had not always
       been done. Investment assistance after training. was the central requirement of the
       2002 RAPS.

278. The Panel also notes that Coal India Ltd. policy provides a subsistence allowance or
       lump sum grant as a rehabilitation option (package D) for the purpose of productive
       investment. To be eligible, the PAP must be an individual from whom less than two
       acres of land is acquired, the PAP must not have income from other sources that
       exceeds Rs12,000/- per year, and none of the other options should be available to
       the PAPs.~~~

279. The RAP for Parej East reiterates the Coal India Ltd. policy.295Under another
       Section entitled "Relocation and Transitional allowance," however, it states that,
       apart from      the one time relocation grants, "there is separate provision for
       subsistence allowance for those PAPS who lose their land and do not opt for jobs or
       do not qualify for jobs."296The RAP then specifies that families losing up to one acre
       of land are entitled to "Rs.300/- per month + an ex-gratia amount of Rs.100 per
       month." Families losing more than one acre of land are entitled to "Rs.300/- [per]
       month per acre subject o a maximum of Rs.1000 [per] month + an ex-gratia amount
       Rs.1OO/-per month."297It adds that these allowances are payable for 20 years.298

280. It is clear that the eligibility criteria for the so-called "subsistence allowance" in the
       Parej East RAP differ significantly          from those provided in the Coal India Ltd.
       policy. It is also clear that the Coal India Ltd. policy treats the subsistence allowance
       as "rehabilitation      assistance" against productive investments when none of the
       other rehabilitation options are available to PAPS who have less than two acres of
       m.      On the other hand, the Parej East RAP appears to treat the subsistence
       allowance as a "transitional allowance" for all those who lose land and who either
       do not choose a iob in the mine or who do not qualify for one.

281. The "transitional    allowance" in the Parej East RAP is the only "subsistence
     allowance" for which details are given. In the Panel's view it is not clear whether
     the subsistence allowance detailed in the RAP is in addition to, or instead of, the
     rehabilitation assistance allowance provided for in the Coal India Ltd. policy. It is
     clear that the Requesters refer incorrectly to the Coal India Ltd. R&R policy when
     they intend to refer to the Parej East RAP "transitional allowance." The eligibility
     criteria for this transitional allowance are broader than those in the Coal India Ltd.
     R&R policy. It is not clear why Management has, in its Response, referred only to
     the Coal India Ltd. policy. It is not at all clear why Management then asserts,that no
     PAP has received a subsistence allowance because "the eligibility criteria have not
     beenmet."

282. On July 25, 2002, the Panel asked Management for a clarification as to whether the
     PAPS received the `transition allowance' provided for in paragraphs 3.4.4 (A and B)
     of the Parej East RAP. In its response of October 16, 2002, Management provided
     data on PAPS who had received the Relocation Allowance               (Part A of 3.4.4).
     According to Management, 30 PAPS have received this `transition' allowance of
     Rs7000, but the Panel notes that there are PAPS who continue to suffer harm.

283. In the Panel's view, Management          failed to ensure that the Parej East RAP
     made effective provision      for support during      a time-hound   transition  period
     after displacement as required by OD 4.30. Some PAPS have suffered harm by
     temporarily    losing their standard of living and a number continue to do so.

284. Management provided no data as to whether PAPS had received the Subsistence
     Allowance (Part B of 3.4.4). The Panel notes that Management's response of April
     2002 asserted that "no PAP has received a subsistence allowance because the
     eligibility criteria have not been met." The R&R          budget for Parej East Ocp.,
     however, contains a line item for subsistence allowance/grant for the years 1994 -
     1998. No such line item appears in the budget for years 1998-2002. Management
     has provided no explanation concerning the disposition of the monies allocated for
     the subsistence allowance/grant or the reasons why the PAPS were regarded an
     ineligible for this benefits or the procedures followed to arrive to this determination.
     The supervision reports made available to the Panel do not provide any further
    information    on this matter. The Panel finds that Management             has failed to
    demonstrate      that its has complied with paragraph        3(b) (ii) of OD 4.30 that
     requires that displaced persons "be supported during the transition           period in
    the resettlement site."




                                                                                          69

6.3.     Adoption of Alternative            Income Generating Schemes

 63.1. Related to the Coal Industry

285. The Requesters complain that they have to resort to                 "illegal   acquisition of coal
      supplies," and thus be exposed to police action, because they have not being given
      any legal right to those coal supplies.299

286. In its April 2002 Response, Management points out that no police action has ever
      been initiated against the local population for illegal collection of coal. Management
      contends also that 87 EPAPs refrained from self-employment training because the
      potential income would not compete with the income that PAPS can obtain from the
      sale of pilfered coal and production of coking coa1.3oo




                     Picture 5: Income restoration.     Major informal   sector activity



287. The Panel team observed a great deal of soft coke activity during its visit. In the
     Panel's view, given the comparative income advantage, it is not surprising that
     PAPS would prefer to engage in so called "illegal" coal trading activities. During its
      second visit, the Panel found that the current CCL Managing Director                        well
     understands the situation and sharesthe Panel's view that a way should be found to
     legalize the soft coke activity.


6.3.2. Land Based Income Generation

288. Soon after CSESMP implementation began in 1997, the supervision team felt that
     the objective of all the PAPS improving, or at least regaining their former standard
     of living was unlikely to be achieved through non-land-based self employment. In

                                                                                                    70

       their view, additional measures were needed. In December 1997, Management and
       Coal India Ltd. agreed on a land-based income restoration scheme to be carried out
       on unused or reclaimed mine land.30i

289. No action was taken in 1998, and, in February 1999, Coal India Ltd. agreed to select
       consultants for five pilot projects, including one in CCL, to develop an approach to
       undertake land based income restoration.302Management warned Coal India Ltd. to
       find a solution; otherwise, it would have to pursue other viable income restoration
       alternatives in order to comply with the legal covenants under the CSRP and
       CSESMP.

290. In February 2000, Coal India Ltd. informed the supervision team that CCL would
       not proceed with the pilot becausethere was no land available. However, they stated
       that such land might become available in two to three years. When the Panel met
       with CCL officials, they explained that it was difficult   to undertake this scheme
       because there was no financial incentive: at the end of the mine operation the land
       would revert back to the Government.

291. Like the ESBP, the Panel believes that this would offer the most promising
      possibility     for restoring or improving  the lives of PAPS, in particular  in Parej
      East. In      the Panel's    view, the current     Bank  supervision  team must     be
      commended for recognizing that a land-based income restoration             option was
      essential. Since doing so, the Team has made an impressive effort to have it
      adopted. Noting the success of the one pilot in operation in another mine, the
      supervision        team   has  recommended      its immediate    adoption   in   other
      subsidiaries.303Unfortunately     this will not help the PAPS in Parej East.

                 7. Indigenous Peoples Development                                    Plan

292. OD 4.20 describes "tribal groups" and "scheduled tribes" as social groups that have
       a distinct social and cultural identity from the dominant society that makes them
       "vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process."3o4The objective of
       this Bank policy "is to ensure that indigenous peoples do not sufSeradverse efsects
       during the development process, and that they receive culturally compatible social
       and economic benejiits."305When a Bank-financed                      project affects indigenous
       peoples, the borrower should prepare an indigenous peoples development plan
       (IPDP) consistent with the Bank's policy.3o6

293. Under the CSESMP social mitigation activities are undertaken through either RAPS,
       or Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs), which deal with two different
       target groups. The RAPS are instruments to mitigate individual property and income
       losses caused by land acquisition for people being resettled. The IPDPs are for
       communities in the vicinity of the mines not subject to involuntary resettlement to
       enable them sharein development benefits.307


7.1.       Separate IPDP for Tribals

294. During project preparation, Management and the Borrower agreed that the OD 4.20
       would cover not just tribals but also other vulnerable people affected by mine
       expansion. With the CSESMP covering five different States in India, the total target
       group under the IPDPs comprises around 186,000 people belonging to 186 villages.
       In its Response, Management explains this decision by pointing out that "about a
       third of the IPDP target group belong to scheduled tribes who are generally settled
       in mixed villages among caste Hindus and scheduled caste Hindus.3o8In this context,
       development activities focusing exclusively on tribals would be socially divisive, and
       the IPDPs       are therefore aimed at the community as a whole with particular
       emphasis on the poor and women."3o9

295. Coal India Ltd. already had a community development program to cover vulnerable
       people,310and during Project Preparation Management proposed that CCL should

307Management Response 2001, supra       note 13, para. 17.
308Management points out that the official classification of social and/or ethnic groups and the land they
live on rests on principles established in 1890, and not changed substantially since then. As a result, what
is classified as forest area may long since have been converted into farm land, and people who were
originally in migratory groups may have become sedentary farmers.
309Management Response 2001, supru       note 13, para. 18.

and running should be supported rather than replaced with new programs.

       restyle it to conform to the requirements of OD 4.20. Issued in September 1995,
       Coal India Ltd.`s revised Corporate Community Development Plan, (or the `generic
       IPDP')    states that its "... immediate objective is to assist indigenous local
       communities     in the mine area to create, revive and maintain                relevant and
       functioning   community assets, institutions and services that can improve their
       choices and living standard in the `modern' world, and maintain and develop
       traditional ways of living and social ties of the communities."3"

296. The `generic IPDP'         states further that its aim "... is to present a policy,            an
       institutional framework    and a strategy for implementation of activities that will
       assist indigenous communities .... allowing for        informed public participation     in the
       formulation   and implementation of the plan, and ensuring that benefits reach the
       weaker sections of the communities, in particular Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled
       Castes, on a sustainable basis."312The "generic IPDP" was therefore to serve as an
       umbrella terms of reference for the mine-specific IPDPs, setting out guidelines for
       their preparation, including the components required.

297. Recognizing that coal mining has contributed to deteriorating environmental and
       social conditions, the Plan acknowledges that "[t]he most obvious social efSecton
       indigenous communities of the mining activities has been the loss of land for           living,
       agriculture, grazing, collection of forest produce for food and fueY313 while "[t]he
       less obvious, gradual and long-term impact may be the change in traditional
       lifestyles which was based largely on subsistence economy."314

298. Prior to appraisal of the CSESMP, Management found Coal India Ltd.`s new
       "generic IPDP" to be in conformity with the OD 4.20.

299. The Panel considers that, while the Coal India Ltd.                  "generic IPDP"      is not
       directed exclusively at trihals, the decision to include all vulnerable people in
       the context of a framework       plan to be eventually applied to all 495 Coal India
       Ltd. mines was in conformity        with OD 4.20.


7.2.      The Original Parej East IPDP

300. Paragraph 18 of OD 4.20 requires that "[t]he plan for the development component
       for   indigenous peoples should be submitted to the Bank ... prior                to project
       Appraisal. Appraisal should assess the adequacy of the plan, the suitability                 of
       policies  and legal frameworks,        the capabilities     of the agencies charged with
       implementing the plan, and the adequacy of the allocated financial,               and social
       resources."

301. The Panel has examined the records available and finds that in May 1995, the Bank
       Loan Committee decided that the requirement of paragraph 18 of OD 4.20 could be
       met through a two-stage process. First, Coal India Ltd. was to submit a generic
       IPDP, and second, a representative sample of mine specific IPDPs before appraisal
       in time for the appraisal mission to assessthem. The General Counsel dissented. He
       warned the Loan Committee that Bank policies and procedures had to be followed
       "to the letter." He stressedthat all IPDPs "had to beformally submitted to the Bank
       before Appraisal."315

302. In late November, the ASTHR (Asia Technical Human Resources) gave conditional
       clearance for appraisal. Although it was noted that the generic IPDP had been
       "developed in accordance with OD 4.20," the 24 mine specific IPDPs had not yet
       been received and reviewed. "It is a condition for this clearance that the 24 IPDPs
       reflect the generic IPDP,       thus complying with OD 4.20. Appraisal      cannot be
      finalized until the mine specific IPDPs have been reviewed and found to satisfy the
       requirements of OD 4.20."316This suggests that, despite the Loan Committee
       decision, that the reviewing social scientist expected all IPDPs to be reviewed.

303. As required by the pre-appraisal conditional clearance, ASTHR reported on March
        11, 1996 that it had "reviewed the mine specific IPDPs in terms of their adherence
       to the generic IPDP. The mine specific IPDPs are found to have been prepared in
       compliance with the requirements defined in the generic IPDP, and thus with OD
       4.20."317The note implies that all 24 IPDPs had been reviewed. Attached to this
       ASTHR cover note is the review upon which the clearance was based. It is clear
       from this document that:


       l    First, a "representative sample" of mine specific plans was not submitted prior
            to appraisal as agreed at the May Loan Committee meeting. They were
            submitted and reviewed after the appraisal mission but before appraisal ended
            and before Negotiations.

       l    Second, as had been agreedby the Loan Committee in May 1995, the consultant
            stated that he was not reviewing &l24 IPDPs, but only "five randomly selected
            IPDPs representing each of the consulting firrns"318 employed to preparethe 24
            plans.

       l    Third, the IPDP for Parej East was not among those reviewed for clearance.

       l    Fourth, the consultant considered the five IPDPs to have been prepared in
            "general" compliance with the requirements of the generic IPDP.319

304. Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the Bank was not in compliance with
       paragraph      18 of OD 4.20 in failing to require an assessment and clearance of

      the IPDPs for each mines at appraisal. Specifically,                  the IPDP for Parej East
      was not reviewed.

305. The Requesters' basic contention is that the original Parej East IPDP was flawed in
      design: "with inaccuracies, and trivial development projects being presented as
       `mitigation'    for  the destruction      of life-giving     natures resource base of the
      villages."320

306. Coal India Ltd. was to prepare location-specific IPDPs for each mine. Where a
      community consisted only of tribals, a tailor made IPDP would reflect their needs.
      Where a community           was mixed, tribal and non-tribal, the benefits were to be
      directed to the vulnerable: tribals, women and youth.321

307. The region around Parej East is inhabited by a large number of tribal people. The
      bulk of them are from the Santhal tribe, which is the largest tribe in eastern India.
      They are all settled cultivators and live in permanent villages. They have their own
      religion, language, and polity, which is characterized by a democratic tradition, with
      a hereditary village headman. By and large these characteristics are still found in the
      villages that qualified for IPDPs in this area. The other tribes, known as Birhor, are
      hunters and food gatherers and are very small in number.

308. For Parej East, an overall lPDP was developed for CCL in late 1995 by a consulting
      firm. According to Management, the original IPDP was intended to be indicative of
      the scale and range of activities in hamlets within one kilometer of the mine site at
      Parej East. CCL's consultants identified 11 hamlets within this range with a total
      population of 2,913 persons as warranting IPDP benefits.322In its Response,
      Management notes that 71 percent of the population in the 11 communities belongs
      to Scheduled Tribes, and the rest to different Scheduled Castes.

309. In March 1996, when the Bank's consultant was asked to review a sample of the 24
      individual mine IPDPs,~~~he warned that, if implementation was to be "based on
      participatory     involvement of the project afected population,"           a number of issues
      must be clarified before actual implementation could begin.324

310. During appraisal of the CSESMP, both the Requesters and their local expert
      professional advisors reviewed the Parej East IPDP in great detail. They sent their
      detailed comments and suggestions to Management and requested the Bank
      President to delay Board presentation of the CSESMP until their report had been
      considered.325The Panel found no record in Bank files of any consideration of the

       Requesters' report, nor any response to their detailed conclusions either before or
       after Board approval of the CSESMP in May 1996. In its April 2002 Response,
       however, Management did address one of the flaws mentioned by the Requesters,
       namely an inconsistency about which hamlets in the village of Burughutu were to be
       included in the IPDP.326

3 11. As a result of its investigation, the Panel can confirm3" the Requester's claim that
       "[tlhe whole of chapters 4 to 8 [of the IPDPl are all repeated verbatim"328(emphasis
       in original) in the IPDPs of other subprojects. This includes the `various options for
       infrastructure support', which          obviously     have been made with             no particular
       reference to the East Parej villages. As the Requesterspointed out while this may be
       convenient, and cost effective, for the consultancy agency, it is hardly effective for
       searching for options for the tribal population. In light of this, the chapter in each
       IPDP that describes the "Felt Needs for             Development" is most odd. This chapter
       purports to describe what each individual community wanted. The text, however, is
       identical to that for the two CCL mines in Bihar and the one MCL mine in Orissa,
       all prepared by the same consultant.329

312. Compared to IPDPs prepared for other mines ,330the weakness and flaws of the Parej
       East IPDP stands out. One of the IPDPs, for example, gives a thorough description
       of local land use and use of forest products by the local tribals. The "Felt Needs"
       section begins by describing in detail the consultation process followed to obtain the
       views of the residents of each habitation. The needs, as prioritized by the residents,
       are then itemized for each community                with several dozen items in six major
       categories.

313. In Parej East, the population in each of the eleven hamlets ranges from 14 to 123
       families.331Each has its own unique composition (some hamlets are fully tribal,
       some only partly, some follow one faith, others another). The lPDP ignores this.
       The descriptions of each of the hamlets begin and end with the same qualitative

Inspection, supru note 6, Attachment 6 para. 6.2, CASS/JJM to the World Bank: Report on the East Parej
OCP, April 20, 1996; while the IPDP covers some hamlets also included in the RAP, it does not include
others. Only one hamlet of Buruguhtu is included yet the population statistics for that one hamlet include
the populations of the other two hamlets, but neither of these two are included in the map or in the
development activities. Two hamlets of Durukasmar are not included, or if so are included in the statistics
of the other hamlets.
327The Panel reviewed three 1995 IPDP plans prepared by ORG (CCL's Parej East and K.D. Hesalong,
and MCL's Jagannath). All follow the same template.

330When compared to, for example, the IPDPs prepared by the Agricultural Finance Corp (AFC) for the
NCL Dudhichua and Nigahi mines in Madhya Pradesh, to the Asian Information        Marketing and Social

       paragraph, and each of the plans end with very similar recommendations and the
       same total budget. This approach, flies in the face of the Coal India Ltd. policy cited
       above, and the Bank's OD 4.20 requirement that location-specific IPDPs should
       addressthe specific needs of each community.

       Parej East Village not subject to involuntary  resettlement but receives IPDP assistance.


314. The Parej East IPDP notes that most of the population is scheduled tribes and
       therefore landowners. It then explains that few of those who had lost land to make
       way for the mine had received compensatory jobs in CCL because their holdings
       were too sma11.332It adds that "[t]he tribals feel that they will remain deprived of
       CCL employment even in the future due to ... some reason or other" 333(emphasis
       added). But nothing in the IPDP addressesthis problem.

315. While the IPDP for Parej East notes the composition                     of each of the eleven
       communities in terms of STs (Scheduled Tribals) and SC's (Scheduled Castes),
       these groups as a whole are undifferentiated. Even though, the IPDP concluded that
       STs were more disadvantaged than SCs they are not treated in any distinct way in
       the IPDP.

316. In the Panel's view, as recognized by the ESRP, the Parej East IPDP should
       have been responsive to local needs. It was not. The Panel considers that
       Management       could have assessed a local NGO report on the IPDP prior to
       CSESMP       approval.   Especially     since it did not itself review the Parej East
       IPDP. Having failed to review the Parej East IPDP, Management                        could not
       have assessed whether it was in compliance                 with paragraph     18 of OD 4.20
       during     appraisal.  The Panel finds that Management               was not in compliance
       with paragraph       18 of OD 4.20 in the preparation            of the original    Parej East
       IPDP.

7.3.      Annual Implementation                 Plan

317. While the flaws in the Parej East IPDP stand out, they could have been corrected, at
       least in theory, since they were to be implemented                             through Annual        IPDP
       Implementation       Plans      developed in          consultation       with    the eleven        hamlets
       concerned.334This began in 1998.335

318. Later, however, a Bank supervision mission found generally, that the original IPDPs
       were much more than "indicative."               It found that CCL employees and the NGO
       engagedto develop annual village specific implementation plans considered that the
       original IPDP had actually defined the activities to be covered, and felt that very
       little alteration was allowed to reflect local village needs.

319. In October 1996, Coal India Ltd., with the Bank's approva1,336appointed the
       members of an independent Environmental and Social Review Panel (ESRP) to
       monitor the IPDPs and various action plans and "to assure that the objectives of the
       Operational Directives will be achieved." In its 1997 report, the ESRP noted that
       the Coal India Ltd.`s generic IPDP appearedto be fully consistent with the intent of
       OD 4.20, and it considered that the "progress made in the IPDP villages during the
       course of the ESMP will determine whether the intent of the Policy can be delivered
       at the project leve1."337

320. According to the ESRP, the source of implementation                              problems was that the
       original IPDPs were prepared by outside consultants in 1995 and, two years later,
       had to be implemented by Coal India Ltd's staff338and NGOs engaged for the
       purpose. In Parej East, CCL's              staff supported by the Xavier Institute (XISS)
       engaged in      March       1997, facilitated         the IPDP         implementation.        Both    were
       inexperienced and neither knew how the original plans had been developed. They
       could only check off tasks to be completed. 339XISS told the Panel that it was very
       difficult to change things significantly and that, in addition, they were faced with the
       problem of trying to operate within a 1995 budget that was based on an "indicative"
       plan.

321. During its interviews in Parej East, the Panel was able to confirm ESRP's finding
       that CCL treated the NGOs it had engaged like hired hands. They had to deliver,
       without room for critical comment, "plans and data at regular intervals for it's
       [GIL's]   reporting to the World Bank and a wide range of consultants engaged
       within ESMP." As the ESRP said, this "further moved the program from one which

338Since it was not possible to recruit a social scientist to assist in the preparation of location-specific IPDP
quickly enough to maintain the timetable for implementation,      Coal India Ltd. trained its Welfare officers to
act as Community Development, Resettlement and Rehabilitation officers (CD/R&R officers). See

       was to be tailor made for         each local community, toward a more generic and less
       flexible format, which again made it easierfor [GIL's World Bank Project Division]
       to report on." Instead of the villagers being the NGO's clients, the client was now
       Coal India Ltd..340

322. It appears that experience did not result in much change. In its 2001 report, the
       ESRP observes that subsequentrevisions to the original IPDP `followed the lead of
       the first plan[s],     adding a little here, subtracting a little there, but essentially
       repeating the form       and substance of initial work plans, year-afi'er-year." And they
       conclude that "[wlhat was originally meant to be a series of location-specific plans,
       arrived at through stakeholder consultation, tailored to the local needs of villagers,
       quickly grew into a rigid, inflexible and largely unresponsive exercise. Its own lack
       of success was built right into the design, in the very genes of the project itself'341
       (emphasis added).

323. Management appears to concur, at least to a degree. In its 2001 Response, it stated
       that the "original      IPDP was primarily        intended to be indicative of the scale and
       range of activities'7342(emphasis added). At the same time, however, Management
       took the view that "social mitigation has achieved satisfactory results with regard to
       the implementation         of    the IPDPs. 343In addition,        Management thought that
       extension of the credit for a year would provide scope for strengthening the progress
       already achieved, "by further            supporting community based organizations              (the
       village working groups involved in IPDP implementation and women's self-help
       groups) to become sustainable and to enhance arrangements to maintain                            the
       community assetscreated under the IPDPs."~~~

324. In its review, the Panel found that each year entire sections of the annual IPDP for
       Parej East are repeated verbatim, including the one indicating a community's                   `felt
       needs." Each year there appears to be a "one              size fitall" plan for each of the 11
       communities, regardless of specific needs. The only difference from one hamlet to
       the next is the specific type of infrastructure cum construction project, where there
       are slight variations in costs (ranging from Rs30,OOOto 70,000.). The description of
       every hamlet begins with the same qualitative paragraph, and the plan ends with the
       same recommendations             (and the same costs) such as "Bleaching                  Powder
       Distribution, " ""Fruit Tree Distribution,"        "Dahlia Mandal," etc.

325. In 1999, the Bank supervision team criticized the annual IPDPs for not being linked
       to the original 1995 IPDPs, both in terms of budget and content.345However, the
       Bank's summary review of the 2000 IPDP implementation plan for Parej East found

       this fault corrected noting that it was a carefully prepared plan trying to linked with
       the original 1995 IPDP and 1998 & 1999 annual IPDPs.

326. In the Panel's view, OD 4.20 does not contemplate "indicative"                    IPDPs either as
       a substitute for, or as a near-rigid          template for, location-specific         IPDPs. In
       Parej East, an indicative         IPDP was the basis for the Annual             Implementation
       Plans, which turned out to be inflexible          and largely unresponsive exercises. In
       light of this, the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with OD
       4.20 in preparation      of the original IPDP for Parej East.


7.4.      Local Participation

327. Preparation of IPDPs is intended to be driven by the people. OD 4.20 sets out the
       prerequisites for successful indigenous peoples plans. The first and fundamental one
       is community participation. Paragraph 14(a) states that "[t]he key step in project
       design is the preparation of a culturally appropriate development plan based onfull
       consideration of the options preferred by the indigenous people aflected by the
       project." Paragraph 18 requires that at appraisal Bank staff appraisal teams "should
       be satisfied    that indigenous people have participated                 meaningfully      in   the
       development of the plan as described in para.l4(a) (also seepara. 15(d)."

328. In its Response, Management assertsthat the consultants who prepared the original
       IPDPs "utilizedfocus group discussions, participatory rural Appraisal, and in-depth
       interviews with the villagers to elicit information about community needs and get a
       general sense of the community's willingness to participate in the construction of
       assets and other activities such as training"346(emphasis added).

329. In May 1996, responding to criticism from international NGOs who represented the
       Requesters' views as well, Management assertedthat "[tlhe most extensive effort of
       consultation was undertaken during the preparation of theseplans ..."347

330. The Panel found no evidence of this in the case of the Parej East IPDP. An
       early   1997 Bank       supervision     mission    acknowledged        that    there had been
       virtually  no meaningful        participation   of indigenous people in preparation              of
       the IPDPs. "Only panchayat [village council] members and/or village elders had
       been consulted with only one meeting in each village."348Unlike the IPDPs for
       some other mines, the original           IPDP for Parej East does not describe any
       consultation or participation .34gDuring its field visit, the Panel confirmed a lack
       of consultation in the preparation of the original Parej East IPDP.

347Office Memo May 13, 1996, supru note 3, para. 6.
348March 1997 Aide Memoire, para. 14.
349The addenda which is a standard prepared form used for all 24 mines has the exact same phrase at the
beginning of each form stating that the IPDP was prepared using "techniques like Focus Group Discussion
and Participatory Rural Appraisal for evoking informal responses from the presidents."  The Panel is not
certain who supplied the form and language.


                                                                                                       80

331. In light of Management's                failure    to ensure meaningful           consultation     in the
       preparation      of the original Parej East IPDP, the Panel finds that, Management
       was not in compliance with paragraphs 14(a) and 18 of OD 4.20.

332. Paragraph 15(d) of OD 4.20 requires that the contents of an IPDP plan must include
       a "Strategy for Local Participation"             stating that: "Mechanisms should be devised
       and maintained for           participation      by indigenous people in decision making
       throughout project planning, implementation, and evaluation ... Traditional leaders
       ... should be brought into the planning process, with due concern for ensuring
       genuine representation of the indigenous population ..."

333. According to the Requesters, the preparation of the Parej East IPDP was flawed
       since the structures for community participation reflect a culture, where money
       power and caste status override democratic participatory functions.350

334. The Panel learned that the Community Development Council at Parej East was set
       up before XISS started work and does not contain representatives of the people. The
       Panel was informed that this was because CCL selected the people they wanted to
       participate. Membership of the Council has not changed since then.351

335. The boiler-plate (same for three different mines) section in the original Parej East
       IPDP statesthat villagers have in many caseslost faith in the Panchayats (or village
       councils), but in all its IPDPs the consultant noted that they must be improved and
       made trustworthy since they control large Government funds. The Panel, however,
       found no hint of ideas, or any suggestion of efforts made, to determine how the
       Panchayats might be made more "trustworthy."

336. In its Response, Management maintains that the village specific IPDPs are, in fact,
       developed through a participatory planning process involving the Village Working
       Group (VWG)          that represents different segments of the village population and
       contains both women and men.352As of July 1, 2001, according to Management, "...
       of the VWGs in Parej East, nearly 25% of all representatives are women, while two-
       thirds are from scheduled tribes."353

337. XISS informed the Panel it had gradually succeeded in organizing the VWGs,
       which are not now dominated by the elite, to participate in annual IPDP preparation,
       and the Panel was able to confirm this. In any event, whatever the role of the
       VWGs, Staff pointed out in 1999 that the NGOs engaged by Coal India Ltd. were to


350Supplement to Request, supvu note 22, para. 3(e), in Annex 2 of this Report.
351During a field visit, the Panel learned that, in one case, after XISS had criticized CCL in one of its
reports, CCL apparently withheld their payment for six months, which is a severe penalty for a poor NGO.
To avoid this kind of pressure to conform and behave, XISS felt that they should have continued to be paid
by Coal India Ltd. in Kolkata, rather than the local subsidiary, as was in the original agreement for their
services.

       formulate the annual IPDPs by consulting not just the VWGs but also the local
       communities.354Before approval of the CSESMP credit in 1996, Staff pointed out
       that Coal India Ltd. was taking a significant                   step in adopting a community
       development plan, which turned a traditional top-down approach into a bottom-up
       participatory one. This represented a big change in the way it had previously dealt
       with social mitigation issues.355In other words, it presumed a momentous shift in the
       institutional culture of Coal India Ltd. and its subsidiaries [, perhaps especially the
       CCL in Parej East].356

338. In 1997, Management told the Board of Executive Directors that "Even with
       increased mobilization of Coal India staRand the involvement of NGOs, experience
       in India and elsewhere shows that the community participation                        process will not
       produce tangible results immediately: some time will be needed before the process
       can befully internalized by all stakeholders and for it to take root in the day-to-day
       activities of project implementation at the village level."3i7

339. While some progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. During its visits
       to five of the eleven IPDP communities, the Panel observed that the content of the
       annual plans selected for a hamlet are still largely at the discretion of the CCL
       authorities. Sometimes villagers become aware of them only when they are being
       implemented. In two hamlets, for example, the Majhithan (the place of the ancestral
       spirit of the village headman) was given a face-lift, although there was no "felt
       need'    for it.

340. In the Panel's view, recent efforts by Management                           have resulted in some
       progress in addressing an enormous challenge. Not only does the challenge
       presume a massive shift in the institutional                  culture of the key implementing
       agents, who have other overriding                   priorities,  it also requires processes of
       participation       and involvement         that are new and strange to those who must

354"The outcome of the process with the community should include the methodology adopted and the
frequency ofconsultation."    1999 Annual Review, CSESMP IPDP Implementation           Plans.
355See also Project Files, October 7, 1996. The Bank social expert involved in the preparation of the project
later described some of the implications: "Previously community development was totally at the discretion
of the mine manager. People (local political leaders) would bring petitions forward,      and the mine
manager would decide what to give and what not to give. The IPDP attempts to address the needs of the
weaker sections of society (especially tribals and women), through a participatory     planning process at the
village level ... This is very new in the context of mine authorities and local communities, and cannot be
done by the present stafsof Coal India.     Thefacilitating NGOs are brought in to bring about this process
and relationship."
356In the same vein, the ESRP noted that "[i]ts hard to get people to sit down and look at what it is they
really need. To get at real needs takes time, consultation and participation."   And they consider that "JtJ&
chance for establishing a dialogue between CIL staff and villagers was missed" and so what should have
resulted in a "the major difference between the old `Community Development' approach and the IPDP
approaches to community development . .. largely did not materialize."
357XISS told the Panel that it initially took six months to establish even a bit of rapport with the
communities. At first, residents distrusted XISS perceiving them to be a part of CCL. XISS is now satisfied
with the level of participation in the preparation of IPDPs and believe it works pretty well because people
are not being displaced. The ESRP singles out and praises XISS, for continuing to do good high quality
work "under exceptionally dtficult     circumstances." See ESRP, 2001 Report, supra note 1433, p. 40.

         them.

 341. In Chapter 5 of the original IPDPs prepared by ORG, including that for Parej
         East, the community           development        strategy for all three mines in the two
         different States is described in the exact same terms. Although the strategy has
         evolved, it is not location           specific, nor is it sensitive to the composition,
         structure     and needs of the community.               In light of this, the Panel finds that
         Management is not in compliance with paragraph 15(d) of OD 4.20.


 7.5.      Dominance of Infrastructure                   Activities

 342. The Requesters maintain that, compared to losses through the impact of mining, the
         Parej East IPDP has provided trivial, or marginal facilities such as an unstaffed
         dispensary building, a road (which means little to people without vehicles), a water
         tank.358

 343. In its Response, Management comments that its planning of annual implementation
         plans is based on an open menu, where villagers can chose practically any type of
         development activity they find relevant for their community.                     They state that no
         dispensary buildings have been constructed in Parej East under the IPDP program.359

 344. At appraisal, Management's consultant criticized the five sample IPDPs for being
         heavy on infrastructure as opposed to interventions to increase incomes and
         productivity. He was also concerned about whether financial or other contributions
         expected from the people themselves were realistic in poor communities.360Then,
         shortly after the CSESMP became effective a staff member cautioned that "[t]he

 359See Management Comments 2002, supra         note 34, para. 47, in Annex 3 of this Report. Noting that civil
 works activities are implemented through community contracting by the VWG whenever technically
 feasible, Management refers the reader to Annex 6 of the Response which gives the status of IPDP
 activities in each of the eleven hamlets.
360Project Files, March 11, 1996, para. 6. "In the activity plans of all the mine specific IPDPs the emphasis
 in terms of the volume of activities and costs is on infrastructure and social assets like schools, clinics and
 roads rather than in measures which could contribute more directly to increased productivity and incomes.
In a situation where the potential beneficiaries are poor, where significant changes in their incomes as a
 result of project interventions are unlikely, where Government funding of operational and maintenance
costsfor    infrastructure and social assets created under the IPDPs is doubtful, it will be the beneficiaries at
more or less their present level of income, who will have to pay the expenses to ensure sustainability if it is
to be achieved."     See also September 1996 Notes for the Aide Memoire and BTO, at Annex 1, p. 2. In Coal
India Ltd.`s experience people had not maintained the physical assetsthey had provided.       So, as the same
staff member points out in September 1996, the issue of ensuring maintenance of assetscreated under the
IPDP was discussed at negotiations of the project and the agreed minutes state that "Coal India would
finance the construction offacilities  and community assets under the [IPDPs] and the [PAPS] only if a
satisfactorv agreement can be reached with the communities concerned about maintenance of these
facilities and assets. Coal India would make copies of these agreements available to the Association"
(emphasis added).

       Mission      would   strongly    advise against such a [predominance]                   of physical
       activities.`7361

 345. In its June 2001 report, however, the ESRP reported that while it was pleased to see
       that infrastructure development had received increasingly less emphasis as the
       CSESMP progressed, it noted that "it is infrastructure projects that remain first in
       the minds of Coal India Ltd. when showing off the achievements of the CSESMP to
       outsiders. Many still judge IPDP in light of this work.

 346. During its visits the Panel team found this to be the case in Parej East. The IPDPs
       have focused largely on projects for physical development of villages such as the
       construction of village roads, repair of wells, making of ponds for irrigation and the
       repair of a community hall. CCL informed the Panel that its plan was gradually to
       reduce expenditure on infrastructure and to raise it on skill development and
       capacity building.

 347. In its Response, Management points out that the VWGs can serve as contractors for
       civil works constructed under the plans.362As for implementation of projects, CCL
       initially  wanted to have the work done through their own contractors, but XISS
       argued that if the people built facilities themselves they would use and maintain
       them properly. After Coal India Ltd. intervened, the situation changed but the time
       lag before CCL pays the villagers for their work is a real problem for them.

 348. During      its investigation,    the Panel found that many of the IPDP activities in
       Parej East are disconnected, have little depth, are just marginal                     and, on the
       whole, do not reflect a real "felt" need. The Panel is concerned that there has
       been no concentration          on long-term     projects such as literacy and numeracy
       classes, maternal and child health, and self help groups.

 349. Although very late, it is encouraging to note that the 2002 IPDP implementation
       plans consists exclusively          of self-help group capacity building              and income
       generation. The Panel would urge that Management take steps to ensure that this
       does in fact materialize. It also urges Management to ensure that the planned Post
       Project Audit determines whether Coal India Ltd. and CCL take steps to continue to
       improve relations with local civil society groups like CASS and to maintain and
       strengthen a participatory, bottom-up approach to preventing and ameliorating the
       environmental and social impacts of their mines on affected peoples, especially the
       most vulnerable, including the tribals.363




361See September 1996 Notes for the Aide Memoire and BTO, at Annex 1, p. 2.

363It appears that an assessment of the outcome of these development inputs in the different villages will
take place in 2002. Terms of Reference for the assessment were prepared in June 2001. The December
2001 Aide Memoire, para. 40, states that "All the annual IPDPs provide an exit strategy involving planning
for long-term maintenance of the community assets created under the 4.5 years of the IPDP
implementation,  and most also involve measures to strengthen CBOs such as VWGs and self-help groups."

350. The Requesters have one main environmental concern, "... concurrent backfilling,
       and preservation of top soil for the same" asking "Where are the top soil dumps?"364

351. Agriculture is only possible in a thin surface layer of weathered and chemically
       altered rock fragments enriched by biological action-commonly                 called top soil.
       Those dependent upon agriculture value it as an essential resource. Coal miners
       value more the seams of coal lying under the weathered surface layer and regard
       topsoil and overburden as a problem to be removed rather than as a valuable
       resource to be conserved. Nevertheless by careful removal of top soil ahead of
       mining operations and using it as the final layer of cover on areasbackfilled after
       mining it is possible to have both the open cast extraction of coal and the
       resumption of agriculture on reclaimed land as the mine is developed.

352. The Requesters raised the question of topsoil in relation to their concern about the
       restoration of the livelihoods        of villagers displaced in Parej East. From 1996
       onwards CASS repeatedly urged that mined land in Parej East be reclaimed for use
       by the PAPS.365The desirability of this course of action has also been stressedby the
       project's ESRP as well as the NGO Minewatch.                     In April 1997 CASS raised
       questions about the apparent lack of topsoil removal and the preparation of, and lack
       of public plans for land reclamation in Parej East. They suggestedthat "[slince land
       for land is not possible we suggest that after extraction of coal the land be returned
       to the people after reclamation ... The tribals are not oriented to a market economy
       so if the land is reclaimed by preserving the top soil it could be made useablefor
       agricultural purposes.`7366

353. Bank staff initially told CASS that the issue would have to be debated at national
       level because of land laws. 367Early in 1999, the Task Leader informed                     the
       Requesters that Coal India Ltd. had agreed to undertake land based income
       generation activities on reclaimed or unused 1and.368

8.1.      Land Reclamation and the Parej East EAP

354, As mitigation      of environmental matters is a primary purpose of the project, the
       CSESMP       Credit Agreement and Project Agreement clearly              spell out CCL's
       obligation in Parej East. Article II, Section 2.01 (b) of the Project Agreement states
       that "Coal India shall carry out the Environmental Action Plans ... in accordance
       with the provisions of such Plans, and to that end shall promptly              inform the
       Borrower     and the Association      of any material        deviation  in respect of    the
       implementation there" (emphasis added).

355. In the Sectoral Environmental Impact Assessment, the Five Year EAP for Parej East
       states that "[o]ut of a total of 114.8 million m3 it is proposed to dump only 11.4
       million m3 as external dump and the balance of 103.4 million m3 is to be usedfor
       backfilling the voids of decoaled pit."369The EAP stipulates that "the external dump
       is to be completed and reclaimed by the end of the seventh year of mining
       operation."370A table giving the breakup of the area of the leasehold occupied by
       facilities at the end of 2000 and post-mining stage at the end of 27 years of life is
       provided. After five years the pit backfill is listed in hectares as 0 and after 27 years
       as 122.4 ha.371

356. The Land reclamation plan for Parej East, prepared in accordance with Indian law,
       is in the 1992 EMP (this includes an EIA). The EMP view is that land reclamation
       may be defined as a process to restore the degraded land to productive, useful, non-
       polluting and aesthetic uses. Land reclamation does not mean Restoration which
       means to work the degraded land to pre-mining land use pattern. It goes on to
       describe the factors to be taken into account in considering different options. It says,
       that of the non-forest land to be taken by the quarry and overburden (OB) dumpsite,
       only 62ha is currently (1991) agricultural land. The plan proposed to reclaim the
       entire external dump. And, out of the 253ha of quarry area, only 122.4ha would be
       reclaimed and the balance 130.28ha would be left as a water body.

357. The assumed advantage was that, in the areawater is scarce, rivers are seasonal and
       rain fed. "In this situation creation of a water body will help the local population ...
       as source for   irrigation water, drinking water or for       industrial demand."372In the
       Panel's view this statement is not well founded. The 130ha water body would be
       tens of meters below the surrounding countryside and separated from it by the
       vertical rock-faces of the quarry. Considerable and ongoing costs would have to be
       incurred to pump water from the quarry to make it available for irrigation. And, as
       the water in the quarry will be in contact with residual coal and coal seams, it will
       be unsuitable for drinking unless treated. It is thus highly unlikely that the water

                                                                                                 87

       that collects in the void left by the coal mine will in fact be useful to the local
       community.

358. Of the land to be reclaimed, the EMP dismisses agricultural use becauseof the poor
       quality and lack of depth of the topsoil and lack of irrigation water. It was thought
       unsafe or inadvisable for agriculture to take place concurrently with            mining
       operations. So the EMP proposes utilization           of reclaimed land for plantation
       purposes because it could yield fodders, timber for construction, firewood and fruit
       for local population, and, in its view, would maintain the ecological balance.373The
       report then goes on to discuss the stages of land reclamation etc. The planned
       timetable is given for what is to be achieved by the 8th the 16th years and then after
       mining operations are over.374

359. As Parej East was not a new mine, environmental management pursuant to the 1995
       Coal India Ltd. policy was obviously not a part of the Parej East 1991 EMP design,
       planning and development.

360. In accordance with the time bound action plan in the EMP, the Parej East EAP for
       the CSESMP period indicates those actions to be completed between 1995-2000,
       which      it  includes.  It  states that the external dump         covering 34.9ha will
       accommodate 11.4 million of overburden. This was to be completed during the year
       2000. It required physical reclamation to start from the third year of mine operation
        1998 and to be followed by biological reclamation. As per the stipulation of
       Ministry of Environment and Forests, it required the sloping face to 28 degrees.The
       entire external dump was to be reclaimed by the seventh year. After this, the
       backfilled     area is to be developed by both physical and biological reclamation.
       Finally,     the EAP states that "[i]t   is proposed to remove the top soil from    the
       quarry and overburden dump site and conserve it for re-use during the biological
       reclamation stage."37i


8.1.1. Implementation         of the Parej East EAP

361. On backfilling       of the decoaled pits required by the EAP, Bank staff informed the
       Panel that in February 2002, the supervision mission observed that backfilling was
       occurring in the decoaled parts of the mine quarry.376

362. On topsoil removal, Management's comments377reflect the reports of the supervision
       consultant @CL) on whom Bank staff relied for environmental implementation
       information on the 25 mines. Under the header "Start Implementation Scheme of
       Soil Storage & Spreading for Biological reclamation, " DCL reported in December
       2000 and March 2001 that some trial removal of topsoil was conducted in April and

        May 1998. Then from November 1999 to January 2000 topsoil had been removed
        by dozer. In July 2000 topsoil removed from the northern edge of the quarry had
        been spread on the southern end of the internal dump (back-filled mine quarry). 378
        DCL's January 2002 reports that topsoil removal from the area at the West Bokara
        boundary end was recovered by EKG shovel in June 2001 then notes that this
        activity is to be resumed after the OB dump position is decided and some top bench
        operation starts.379

363. As far as storage of top-soil goes, the staff informed the Panel that the 1998 study
        undertaken to determine the suitability      of top soils used in overburden dump
        reclamation found that the layer of top soil in some of the mines was quite thin and
        consequently quite difficult to segregateand collect. 38oThe Panel observes that this
        was noted in the Parej East 1991 EMP. In its 2002 comments Management states
        that "[t]he layer of top soil on the areas that are being excavatedfor mining is quite
        thin, and the top soil is currently being spread immediately on back-filled internal
        dumps."381The Panel was not shown nor did it observe any topsoil conservation
        during its visit to the Parej East Open Pit.

364. On vegetation of external and internal dumps, the DCL reports note that there is no
        item for plantation of the internal dump in the EAP but that "internal and external
        dump plantation are now treated together."382In July 2001 DCL indicates that 5.2ha
        of OB dump was re-vegetated in 1995, seven hectares in 1998, that no OB dump
        area was available for plantation in the 1999 and 2000 monsoon and that there was
       no proposal for the 2001 monsoon.383Although                 requested at the site, no
       documentation        or information   on the five-year    CSESMP         mine reclamation
       program      was ever provided to the Panel team. The DCL reports indicate that
       monthly inspection of the OB dumps occur, that the old OB dump appears stable
       and as far as reclamation goes, it is vegetated although there are a few small bare
       patches on the slope. Stone pack wall was done from July - October 2000. DCL
       reports the work as given in the EAP as comp1eted.384The Panel team observed
       portions of OB slopes devoid of vegetation, and noted that the rehabilitated dumps
       had all been re-vegetated some years previously. Mine staff, not able to identify the
       species being used for re-vegetation, informed the Panel that the Forest Department
       provided the tree species that were used for stabilization.

365. Staff informed the Panel that the 1998 Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) soil
       study identified the need to improve the training of environmental officers and
       recommended a strengthening of staffing at the mine level with staff trained in the
       relevant subjects. CASS raised this issue in 1997, noting that Coal India Ltd.

       promised to implement a program within                18 months.385The Panel found little
       evidence that      mine     level staff    had training      and knowledge           of soils and
       reclamation    activities at the Parej East site. Mine rehabilitation               appears to be
       handled as a separate matter to mine planning and operation and staff were
       unable to provide the Panel with evidence that the eventual configuration                       and
       rehabilitation    of mined areas were being planned.386

366. The AFC study also recommended the involvement of project affected people and
       inhabitants of nearby villages as laborers in the reclamation work and in utilization
       of reclaimed land for income generation activities. The Bank endorsed these views.
       Extensive efforts by the Bank to persuade CCL to undertake such activities are
       described in the income restoration section of this report.


8.2.       Observations       of the Environmental            and Social Review Panel

367. The Panel draws attention to some general observations made by the ESRP, an
       independent panel appointed under paragraph 13 of OD 4.01. "The commitment to
       reclamation of mined land in GIL's Environmental Policy is clear and unambiguous.
       The policy includes a commitment to: progressive reclamation to achieve a post
       mine    landform     and use consistent with            the EMP;     maximizing        backfilling;
       preservation and ye-useof top soi1."387

368. However, the Panel notes that following                the ESRP's May 2000 site visit they
       concluded that "[i]mproving        reclamation of mined land in the future is not explicitly
       covered within the ESMP. It is an issue, however, which we believe is fundamental
       to GIL's future environmental and social performance ... At present: virtually                   no
       eflort is being made to reclaim mined land so that a productive end use is possible;
       all the top soil resources of the mined land are being destroyed through burial in
       overburden dumps; none of the mined land is being returned to the community."
       And stated that "[tlhis situation is not sustainable in the long run ... We have seen
       little evidence of any fundamental change in attitude to overburden management
       and reclamation since our first visit in 1997."388This status was confirmed in the
       ESRP final report.

369. The Panel also observes that the ESRP, in complete agreement with the Requesters,
       argue persistently throughout their reports for return of mined land to displaced
       PAPS. Recognizing it was not required under the CSESMP they conclude that
       "[w]hat    is now needed is a fresh              start to reclamation        planning     and its
       implementation in all of GIL's open cast projects, based on a genuine commitment

      by CIL to returning productive agricultural land to the community being displaced
      by the expansion of open cast activities."389

370. The Panel also notes that if annual production at Parej East were two million                  tons
      per annum, it would be required, under the Coal India Ltd. policy, to produce an
      annual operating plan that would address land reclamation.390But production at
      Parej East is short of this with an output of 1.75 million tons per annum.

371. The SAR outlines the limitations of land reclamation standards: "Beyond standard
      statements in the environmental clearance that the ultimate slopes of overburden
      should be maintained at a maximum of 28 degrees, topsoil shall be conserved for
      reclamation use, and land reclamation shall be carried out `to make it compatible
      with the pre-mining land use pattern', there are no quantitative [standards] that
      define successful reclamation. Presently, reclamation focuses on wood plantations.
      It must be noted that the present system - where Coal India must pay the cost of
      acquiring private lands, fund compensatory reforestation for lost forest lands, carry
      out reclamation and, after all this, surrender the land back to the Government at no
      cost - provides no incentive at all, at present coal prices, to the company to do
      much more than carry out revegetation."391

372. During site visits, CCL's Senior Mine Management told the Panel that CCL had no
      intention to reclaiming the mined areas for post-mining use. Two reasons were
      given. On one occasion, Senior Mine Management claimed that reclamation was not
      required by the laws of India and wouldn't happen until those laws were changed.
      On another occasion, Mine Management claimed that when mining activities were
      over the land had to be returned to the Government without                        any financial
      compensation. Therefore there was no financial incentive for CCL to increase its
      production costs by engaging in land reclamation

373. The IMC criticize the present mine planning as not comparable with modem
      methods of mine planning and "mitigates                 against eflective reclamation         and
      productive ye-use of land." IMC notes that all land reclamation is returned to
      forestry even in predominantly agricultural areas where the presence of good soils
      would allow the return of land to agricultural use. "This would also have the social
      benefits by increasing the amount of land available for           resettlement and providing
      employment opportunities of a kind familiar             to rural communities." Noting that
      current practice uses limited backfilling to ground level and leaves large voids at the
      end of mining, IMC recommends that for planning new mines Coal India Ltd.
      explore the possibility      of utilizing    the available backfill     to maximize     the area
      restored to productive land uses even if land is reclaimed to lower levels.392

374. The Panel notes that the pressing need for reclaimed land in Parej East was not
       recognized in the EMP for this mine. Having been prepared in 1991, before the
       CSESMP, the EMP was not designed to meet Coal India Ltd.`s 1995 Environmental
       Policy end use objectives.

375. On the basis of the foregoing, the Panel notes that despite persistent efforts by
       NGO's and the ESRP, the reclamation                of mined land to a situation that would
       allow tribals to reuse land taken for mining, has not happened. Management
       must have been aware of the lack of action on reclamation                 at least since the
       1997 report of the ESRP quoted above, findings that were repeated in their
       2000 and 2001 reports, also quoted above. And it must also have been aware of
       CCL's     position that it had no intention          of reclaiming   mined areas for post-
       mining    use. At the same time, this does not constitute a formal                 violation    of
       Annex C of OD 4.01 as far as land reclamation in Parej East is concerned.393

376. As reclamation        was included in the Coal India Ltd. Environmental                Policy for
       new    mines,    the Panel fully         agrees with      and supports    the ESRP        view:
       "`Improving reclamation of mined land in the future .. . is an issue ... fundamental
       to GIL's future environmental and social performance."

377. The Panel also notes and supports the recommendations                   made by the IMC in
       the Report commissioned by Coal India Ltd. entitled Strengthening                    Social and
       Environmental      Management Capacity. This study formed part of the CSESMP
       and the Panel thus deems its recommendations                 to be of particular     relevance.
       The first     recommendation394 is that each subsidiary             of Coal India       Ltd.   be
       required to prepare and implement              an Environmental     Management        Strategy.
       The second advises that Coal India Ltd. improves planning                   systems for new
       mines, with particular       reference to land use issues and reinstatement of mined
       areas to agricultural      use.395In the view of the Panel, the implementation            of the
       IMC    recommendations         is vital. In addition,      because present legal conditions
       prevent     the transfer      of   land    acquired     under   the   CBA    Act,    the   IMC
       recommends       that Coal India        Ltd. should lobby the Government             to amend
       existing legislation to allow for the eventual transfer of reclaimed land.

8.3.     Water Quality Management                   at Parej East

378. The Requesters have a number of complaints about water quality monitoring
      commitments: "These shortcoming in implementation stand in spite of thefollowing
      commitments to review,"396and they quote the SAR that says "the aim of these
      reviews was to ensure that the coal companies complied with Indian environmental
      legislation and rules ..."397

379. Bank Management explains that "[mlonthly                  environmental monitoring reports are
      submitted by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI)                      on air
      quality, water quality, and noise level. The monitoring results are firther            reviewed
      on a quarterly basis by the supervision consultant, DCL, and by the Bank during
      each supervision mission. The reports for the quarter ending September 30, 2001
      were reviewed by DCL in their report for the quarter ending December 31, 2001.
     Analysis of drinking water samples indicated that there [were] no bacteria present
      and all other parameters were in accordance with IS 10500 standards ... All three
      Bank assisted projects in CCL were seen to have valid consent letters from the State
      Pollution Control Board during the visit of the supervision consultant, and were
      seen to have submitted the Environmental Management Plan compliance letters to
      the regional oflice of the Ministry of Environment and Forests in time."398CCL do
      therefore appear to be in compliance with Indian environmental legislation and
      rules. However, the Panel is obliged to point out that the CMPDI,                     in whose
      laboratories the analyses are made and from where the monthly environmental
      monitoring reports emanate is, like CCL, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited.

380. The Panel nevertheless notes that the SAR specified detailed mitigation measures
      that were required at Parej East. These measures and the Panel's observations
      during their site visits to the Parej East Open Pit mine are as follows:

    l   No release of untreated           water. The Panel noted that systems have been
        implemented to prevent the release of untreated mine water and effluent from
        the maintenance yard. According to the ESRP, all effluent discharges from
        CSESMP mines meet the required standards except during the Monsoon
        season.399

    l   Recycling and reuse to be maximized. The Panel noted that systems have been
        implemented to recycle and reuse mine water and cleaned effluent water from
        the maintenance yard. According to the ESRP, all CSESMP projects were
        treating workshop effluent to the required standard.

    l   Quarterly    monitoring       of groundwater          levels and quality.     The Panel was
        shown standard analyses of ground water quality for the host-community well
        and the hand pump in the Pindra resettlement location. Also for the newly dug
        well at Prem Nagar. These analyses had been undertaken quarterly by the Coal
        India Ltd. subsidiary, Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, based in

          Ranchi, and indicated satisfactory water quality. No water analyses for the new
          wells dug in Pindra village for the new settlers were provided. No evidence of
          monitoring of ground water levels of any village wells was furnished. Details of
          DCL's quarterly water quality measurements for October 2000, January 2001
          and March 2001 were made available to the Panel. There it is recorded that in
          December     2000 and March          2001 all water quality         parameters, except
          manganese levels, were within permissible limits. No coliforms were reported
          from any samples.

     l    Water quality     kits to be provided         at each mine site. The environmental
          officer of the Parej East OCP reported that they were not equipped to undertake
          water analyses and that testing was undertaken by the CMPDI. The quarterly
          DCL reports make no mention of the need for water sampling kits.

381. Groundwater        level at Lupuntandi.         The Requesters complain that the Company
       "wants to build a bore well for the employees colony in Lupuntandi, which will
       afSect the water level of the tribal village."400 Management comments that the
        "employees colony in Lupuntandi" refers to the colony which houses staff from the
        mines of Parej East, Tapin North, and the Kedla Washery of Bokaro Coalfields on
        land acquired in the nineteen eighties. Management states further, "[a] tube well to
       supplement the water supply for the colony was drilled in mid 2000 inside the mine
        colony. The tube well has a depth of 100 meters and will yield about 3.5 liter per
       second when operational. Hydro-geological              studies undertaken as part of the
       preparation for    the establishment of the tube well do not indicate any adverse
        impacts on the groundwater          table of    the surrounding villages    .... including
       Lupuntandi which is located about 1.5km away from the well site. The tube well,
       which is not funded under the CSESMP credit, will not have any negative impact on
       the groundwater table of the surrounding villages." No evidence of monitoring of
       ground water levels of village wells was furnished to the Panel. The quarterly DCL
       Reports make no reference to the monitoring of water levels in wells. It was noted
       by the Panel that, although sunk, the Lupuntandi tube well, which is in close
       proximity to the recently dug Prem Nagar resettlement site well, has fortunately not
       been fitted with a pump and is not in operation.

382. Sewage treatment in the CCL employee's colony. The Requesters complain that
       "sewage from      the [CCL]      employees colony is discharged into the fields          of
       Lupuntandi."401 The quarterly DCL            reports indicate that the domestic effluent
       treatment plant was completed in December 2000 and was running under trial load
       in March 2002. Parej East OCP staff showed the Panel a modern and efficiently
       operating sewage treatment facility in the mine employees colony. On the other
       hand, the Prem Nagar resettlers showed the Panel a mal-functioning sewage pump
       station close to their site. Here raw sewage was overflowing and being prevented
       from contaminating agricultural land by a hand-constructed earth berm erected by
       the villagers.

383. In its Response, Management explains that the domestic effluent treatment plant in
     the mine colony has been funded under the CSESMP Credit. It serves 688 families
     in the colony. "The domestic efJZuenttreatment plant replaced the previous disposal
     of sewage through badly maintained septic tanks, and has thus removed the threat
     of pollution of the ground water table that was posed by these septic tanks. The
     treated water from the domestic efluent treatment plant is released into a soak pit
     lined with concrete and situated inside the mine colony. The CSESMP team
     observed limited over-low from the soak pit into a small valley leading down to the
     Bokaro River"402

384. The Panel believes that careful monitoring           of the domestic sewerage treatment
     facility serving the CCL employees' mine colony is required                   to ensure that
     malfunctioning   equipment does not lead to raw sewage leaking into the three
     rain fed agricultural    plots - cultivated      by tribals    under claimed customary
     rights - and causing a health hazard.

                           9. Disclosure of Information

385. The Requesters make a number of complaints about disclosure of information. BP
        17.50 on disclosure of information and OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment are
       clear about what information should be provided to affected people and local NGOs.
       OD 4.01 states that "it is necessary that the borrower provide relevant information
       prior to consultations," in order to allow "meaningful consultation to take place
       between the borrower and afSected groups and local NGOS."~O~In addition, the
       policy requires that "information       should be provided in a timely manner and in a
       form that is meaningful for, and accessible to, the groups being consulted."404

386. According to OD 4.01, a summary of the project description, its objectives and its
       potential effects should be provided for initial consultations. Once the EA report has
       been prepared, "a summary of its conclusions in a form            and language meaningful to
       the groups being consulted        should also be provided. In addition, before Project
       appraisal,405the "borrower should make the EA report available at some public
       place accessible to affected groups and local                   NGOs for       their   review and
       comment."406As to the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), the BP states that "Bank
       sta# encourages Governments" to make those plans available to local parties who
       will be affected by its implementation, and to other interested groups including local
       NGOS.~O~

387. BP 17.50 refers only to the timely disclosure of the EA. However, an internal
       Memorandum, established that, for purposes of disclosure, this also applies to
       resettlement plans and the indigenous people development plans.4o8

388. The Bank's         policy   on disclosure of information            makes the point          that the
       dissemination of information "to local groups aficted             by projects supported by the
       Bank, [including] non-governmental organizations ... is essential for                 the efSective
       implementation and sustainability of the projects."4W The policy states "there is a
       presumption in favor of disclosure."41o

9.1.      Disclosure of EIA, RAPS and IPDPs

389. Prior to appraisal, the GO1 and Management agreed to deposit copies of the Sectoral
       Environmental       Impact Assessment (SEIA),               the RAPS, the IPDPs, and relevant
       technical documentation, in the Bank's Public Information Centers in Washington
       and New Delhi.411The Project Information Document (PID) was updated and sent to
       the Bank's Information Center (PIC) in Washington on December 13, 1995.412

390. Early in 1996, before the CSESMP credit was granted, the Requesters also asked,
       inter alia, for "Schedules of PAPS by name and household head"; "Land Acquisition
       Schedules as per sec. 5 of the RAP" and "Compensation Payment schedules."413
       CASS requested that "copies of all notifications" be made available in the District
       Collector Office, in order to allow PAPS to register their grievances in a timely
       manner.414In the Requesters' view, the following information should also have been

            projects;

       l    The cost-benefit analysis of the project.416

391. In April 1996, also before the CSESMP credit was granted, the Berne Declaration,
       an international NGO, took up the issue. Pointing out that "[i]t is relatively easyfor
       international NGOs to get access to project related documents," it asked the Bank:
       "What is being done to provide local NGOs with the same ease of access to
       information?`417 In response, the Bank said that the EMPS, RAPS, and IPDPs, as
       well as the Coal India Ltd. R&R policy, and the baseline surveys, translated into
       local languages, were all available to interested parties at subsidiary headquarters.418

        The Berne Declaration repeated its request again in September 1996, and February
        1997 and, on each occasion, Management stated that the PICs had been established
        at the mine sites and that the all information, including the ESRP reports (as soon as
        was available), either was or would be placed in the PICS.~~~

392. Based on its interviews, the Panel found no evidence that the SEIA together with the
        Parej East EAP, the original RAP and IPDP were made publicly available to PAPS
        and local NGOs in Parej East prior to approval of the CSESMP. The Panel notes
        that the appraisal mission took place in December 1995. Shortly after appraisal, the
        second attachment to the Request for Inspection shows CASS asking CCL for a
        copy of the RAP, not for the first time.420Finally, CASS obtained an "unofficial"
        photocopy from a CCL office. Later, CASS obtained the Parej East IPDP from the
        Bank Information Center, a Washington-based NG0.421

393. The       Panel    found   no evidence        that   the Sectoral      Environmental       Impact
        Assessment, which contained the Parej East five-year Environmental                      Action
        Plan, was made L6availableat some public place" in Parej East "accessible to
       affected groups and local NGOs for their review and comment."

394. Based on its review of the documentation               and interviews, the Panel notes that
        while Management        ensured that the SEIA and the Parej East EAP and RAP
        were placed in the Bank's PICs in Washington and New Delhi before appraisal,
        it failed to ensure that the reports were available in Parej East at a public place
        accessible to affected groups and local NGOs for their review and comment,
        not even a Summary of their conclusions "in a form and language meaningful to
       the groups being consulted," as required by OD 4.Ol/BP 17.50. In light of this,
       the Panel finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 21 of
        OD 4.01 and paragraph 12 of BP 17.50 in respect of disclosure.

       future lies with the Project Oficials,           not with the PAPs,"~~~CASS repeatedly
       demanded, from early 1996, that all information related to the CSESMP project be
       made available to the people, and that the "contact person between CCL and the
       PAPS must genuinely represent the PAPS and must not be those who previously held

       positions    of domination       over them."423In April          1996, CASS          asked for an
       information office within easy accessof the PAPS, or NGOs representing them, so
       they could have easy accessto detailed information.424

396. In November 1995, the PID stated that Coal India Ltd. was establishing PICs at its
       headquarters and at the subsidiaries. According to the PID, the public could easily
       accessthe Resettlement and Rehabilitation policy in local languages at the Centers,
       as well as documentation and information related to the Sectoral EA, including,
       inter alia, the EMPs, the EAPs the RAPS and the Coal India Ltd. corporate IPDP.425

397. From an examination of the records available, it appearsthat the first mention of a
       PIC in Parej East is in February 1997 when Staff reported that one was installed in
       the office of the Parej East R&R officer. Staff also reported that it was agreed that
       the office photocopier could be used to issue photocopies of the RAPS, IPDPs, etc.
       "(for a costfee) upon request by PAPS, NGOs and other interested parties."426Given
       that years have past, the Panel is unable to ascertain whether the documents cited in
       the PID were placed at the Parej East PIC when it was first set up.

398. In its Response, Management states that Public Information Centers have been
       established in all 25 mines covered by the CSESMP,                        including     Parej East.
       Management explains that the PIC in Parej East "is located in the same building as
       the ofice      of the Community Development/R&R                 Officer    ... and is generally
       accessible on a daily basis."427The Response provides a list of documents currently
       available at the Parej East PCI.

399. However, the Requesters' position was that "[tlhe                  information provided [in the
       Public Information Center] is rather inadequate, many more documents should be
       available.428

400. In response to CASS's request to obtain a copy of the Bank's Midterm Review
       Report and of the Environmental             and Social Review Panel (ESRP) Reports,429
       Management explains that "the release of communication between the Bank and
       GIL, such as the midterm review report and those by the [ESRP], funded under the
       IDA credit could only be released at the discretion of CIL,"43o(emphasis added).

401. As to the treatment of the PAPS at the Public Information Center, the Requesters
       assert that "[rlequests are commonly met by `not available at the moment, come
       another time `."431In its Response, Management explains the good relationship they
       observed between the CD/R&R officer and the PAPS.

402. The Panel's visit to the Public Information Center indicated that it is more a
       repository of selected formal documents than a Center that seeks to disseminate
       information to affected people. The Panel found that not all documents pertaining to
       the Project are available. A copy of the 1995 Sectoral Environmental                           Report
       together with the Environmental Action Plan for Parej East was not available to the
       Panel team, and earlier versions (1994 to 1999) of the RAP or IPDP were also not
       available.432

403. Documents may only be consulted when the supervisory staff are present and no
       provision is made for documents to be studied in private or photo-copied. The Panel
       observed that, despite the low levels of literacy among PAPS, all information in the
       Center is in technical written documents. The Panel was surprised to see no
       pamphlets, or simplified informational materials, or sketches, photographs or visual
       materials to depict the Project, its sequence, and effect on people. The staff of the
       Center indicated, in response to a question, that they had not and do not give
       popular talks to help affected villagers understand what is being proposed for the
       Project.

404. In addition to selected formal Project documents, the Center holds registers of all
       the public meetings pertaining to the Project that have been held, as well as written
       staff notes (headed `minutes', but which are not verified or authenticated by those
       who attended the meetings). Some notes are written in English but most are in
       Hindi. Lists of the persons attending the meetings constituted the bulk of the
       entries.433

405. A third form of documentation held in the Center is a register of grievances. Perusal
       of the entries recorded in English suggested that this register appears more like a
       record of visitors: full details of complainants are recorded but the nature of the
       grievance as well as proposed actions are sketchy.

406. In terms of accessibility of the Center, and availability of Project Officers towards
       the PAPS, during its visit the Panel noted that the Center is located in the same room
       as the office of the R&R officer. Clearly, to be present at all times during office

432Other than the mine plan no drawings were available showing planned rehabilitation and landscaping of
either the over burden dumps or the eventual pit. No document on the physical reclamation plan for the
Parej East OCP is available.
433Despite the important role they play as custodians of State land, the Forestry Department's name did not
appear in any of the lists perused, in response to Panel team questioning the center's staff confirmed that
the Forestry Department was not regarded as an essential role player and did not attend meetings pertaining
to the project.


                                                                                                         101

     hours to supply information is an additional responsibility that can often conflict
     with his principal duties.

407. Unfortunately, there was a change in attitude when the Panel team was joined by a
     member of the NGO requesting inspection. The Panel observed a certain level of
     aggression and arrogance and the questions posed were dismissed curtly and with
     disdain. The tone and mood of this part of the meeting, with an NGO present, was
     hostile and unpleasant. Based on its own observations, the Panel team is concerned
     about the reaction there might be towards tribal people attempting to obtain
     information from the Center.

408. In 2002, it is obviously not possible to verify what precise documents were or
     were not available in the Parej East Center in 1996/97. In the Panel's view,
     however, the location of the Center in the office of the R&R        Officer, in the
     gated   CCL     mine    Headquarters'    compound,     does nothing   to  facilitate
     information    being provided    `... in a timely manner and in a form      that is
     meaningful for, and accessible to, the groups being consulted," as required by
     paragraph    21 of OD 4.01. On the contrary,       for poor, vulnerable   and now
     dependent people, it is clearly      intimidating  to approach  an office in that
     location, let alone walk in and freely request information,    register complaints
     and engage in dialogue. In addition,      the information  being provided in 2001
     was largely technical and inaccessible to project affected people and without
     summaries    "... of its conclusions in a form    and language meaningful    to the
    groups being consulted,"      as required    by OD 4.01. Management      could and
     should have been aware of this.

409. In light of this, the Panel finds Management not in compliance with paragraph
     21 of OD 4.01 and paragraph 12 of BP 17.50.




                                                                                      102

                                       10. Consultations


410. Paragraph 19 of OD 4.01 sets out requirements for consultations as follows: "The
       Bank expects the borrowers to take the views of afSectedgroups and local NGOs
      fully  into account in project design and implementation and in particular                          the
      preparation of EAs."

411. The Requesters, both in their Request for Inspection, in prior communications to the
       Bank, and in subsequent communications to the Panel, allege lack of consultation
       with the PAPS in both project preparation and implementation. This they consider as
       the underlying reason for the fundamental flaws in original CSESMP plans and in
       the failures during implementation. 434In addition, the Requesters complain that the
       Bank has not reacted to their complaints.

412. In its Response, Management assertsthat consultations have been held with "both
       PAPS and NGOs during the course of project preparation and implementation."435
       As far as project preparation goes, the Panel notes that the November 1995 PID
       stated that all required consultations for the Sectoral Environmental                        Impact
       Assessment (SEIA), Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS) and Indigenous People
       Development Plans (IPDPs) have taken place. In its Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
       for the CSESMP, Management maintained that "the most significant contribution
       that arose out of the Association's             [IDA]    involvement with this project is the
       extensive use of       the consultative process with project-aflected people in the
      preparation of various action plans."436

413. This chapter will examine consultations with PAPS in Parej East on the preparation
       of the SEIA and the EAP as well as consultations on both the preparation and
      implementation       of the RAP for Parej East. Finally                 the chapter will      discuss
      consultations with local NGOs. Consultation on, and the participation process for,
      the IPDP for Parej East has been discussed in Chapter 7 on the IPDP.

10.1. Environmental               Assessment and Environmental         Action Plan

414. Paragraph 20 of OD 4.01 specifies that "consultations should occur at least at the
     ,following two stages of [the] EA process (a) shortly after the EA category has been
      assigned, and (b) once a draft EA has beenprepared."

415. The Requesters assert that the PAPS in Parej East were not consulted on the
      preparation of the SEIA or the EAP for Parej East, noting that the PAPS "have an
      interest in a full and proper assessment and mitigation of the environmental risks
      associated with this project."437

416. In its Response, Management assertsthat consultations required by OD 4.01 were
      held on the draft SEZA and EAPs for the 25 mines and that the latter were finalized
      after considering         the suggestions and recommendations      made during    these


417. What became quickly apparent to the Panel when looking at the Bank's records was
      that consultation was not mandatory under Indian environmental regulations. Coal
      India Ltd. reminded Management of this in January 1995. Access for inspection of,
      and public display of, a project's environmental documents was all that was
      required.439

418. This led to a debate in the Bank about how to deal with Coal India Ltd.`s view of
      consultations on the draft SEIA and EAPs. During the debate an interesting table
      was prepared setting out the options discussed, ranging from adopting the Coal
      India Ltd. approach, i.e. "no consultations, only disclosure of information,"        to
      insisting    on the requirements of OD 4.01, along with           the advantages and
      disadvantages of each. Two of the more interesting disadvantages of adopting the
      Coal India Ltd. approach were "[plossible criticism by NGO that the Bank does not
     follow its own ODs," and that "an inspection panel may be enacted." It appears that
      the issue was resolved at the May 1995 Loan Committee meeting when the Vice
      President and General Counsel demanded strict compliance with the OD, stressing
      that the Bank must be satisfied that "the process of            consultation had to be
      adequately documented."440

419. Management statesthat a workshop on the EA was held in Kolkata in May 1995, in
      which      Parej East PAPS were represented by NGOs who participated. The
      Requesters maintain that the NGOs at the workshop were not from the Parej East
      area and could not possibly represent the PAPS there.441The Panel confirms that one
      NGO representative was from the H.D. Hesalong mine but that there was no NGO
      from Parej East. In response to NGOs' questions on why the May 1995 workshop

       was organized in Kolkata and not in the project areas where more project affected
       people could attend, Management responded that while               "[c]onsultations   with
       project-a#ected people take place primarily         at the mine sites ... The logistics to
       organize these workshops at 25 mines would beformidable."442

420. The "draft" EA is dated May 1995. During interviews at Parej East, the Panel was
       told that a meeting had been held at Parej East in July 1995 with a core of pre-
       selected PAPS. The Panel was also told that it was not a two way process.
       Information was simply delivered.

421. In response to questions from international NGOs and the Requesters, Management
       responded that "[i]n preparing these [EAPs], Coal India has made an efsort to
       consult with all project-affected people, their representatives and local NGOS."~~~
       And that "[a]t each of the mines included under the project, mine managers &J
       meetings with project-afSected people in which they explained the program of
       mitigating actions that would be undertaken in the course of implementation of
       Environmental Action Plans'7444(emphasis added). Thus the July 1995 meeting in
       Parej    East was, as the Panel was told,             an information     meeting.  While
       information     meetings may he a preliminary         to "informed"  consultations, they
       are not consultations.

422. The SAR describes the scope and process of consultations that had taken place
       during preparation.44sThe Panel notes that the SAR lists the subsidiaries where
       meetings or consultations took place. CCL was not one of them.446

423. Later, the independent ESRP found that there was a general lack of ownership of
       EAPs at the Project level. It stated that: "Although CZL has indicated to the [ESRP]
       that the EAPs were developed in consultation with the OfSicers at the Project level,
       it is abundantly clear that the process of consultation that was followed was not
       eflective, and the resulting EAP were eflectively the product of a strongly top-down,
       centralized approach. This centralized command and control model was mirrored in
       the way the ESMP was supervised and monitored by the WBPD [World Bank
       Project Dept. of CZL] during its implementation."441

424. The      Panel    finds  no evidence of, and no documentation              of, meaningful
       consultations     on the Sectoral         Environmental    Impact  Assessment and the
       Environmental       Action   Plan with the PAPS or local NGOs in Parej East, as
       required    under OD 4.01. Moreover,            from the debate that took place in the
       Bank on Coal India Ltd.`s approach, it is clear that Management was aware of
       this in early 1995.

425. In light of this, the Panel finds that Management             was not in compliance with
       paragraph      20 of OD 4.01 concerning           consultations   in Parej       East on the
       preparation     of the Sectoral Environmental       Impact Assessment and the Parej
       East Environmental          Action Plan.


10.2. Preparation            of Resettlement Action Plan

426. Paragraph 8 of OD 4.30 states that the "involvement of involuntary resettlers and
       hosts in planning prior to the move is critical. Initial        resistance to the idea of
       involuntary resettlement is to be expected. To obtain cooperation, participation and
       feedback, the affected hosts and resettlers need to be systematically informed and
       consulted during preparation of the resettlement plan about their options and rights
       ... these steps can be taken directly or through formal and informal leaders and
       representatives." Coal India Ltd.`s policy states that once the baseline survey is
       done, "the RAP will beformulated in consultation with the PAPS ..."448

427. In its Response, Management says that the nine NGOs engaged to carry out
       "Baseline Surveys of the affected populations in the 14 mines with land acquisition,
       conducted an extensive house to house census with a structured questionnaire to
       elicit the current socio-economic status of the affected people and receive input on
       each individual's preferred means of economic rehabilitation           if jobs in the mines
       were not available." The original RAPS were prepared on the basis of this.449

428. The Baseline Survey for Parej East was prepared in mid1994 by the XISS, and the
       RAP shortly after, in August 1994, by CMPDI, consultants to CCL.

429. Management correctly indicates that the PAPS were interviewed by XISS during the
       conduct of the Baseline Survey in Parej East. Prepared about a month after the
       Baseline Survey, CMPDI,           through the RAP, states that CCL maintained close
       liaison with the PAPS during preparation of the RAP, and that they were "associated
       with" preparation of the land schedule, the schedule for compensation for land and
       other immovable properties, formulation of the scheme for the resettlement site,
       including site selection, and identification of rehabilitation schemes for PAPs.~~OOn
       the other hand, according to the Baseline Survey, 95 percent of PAPS did not even
       know where the Pindra resettlement site was. Yet, in the RAP, CMPDI claims that
       the site was mutually acceptable to all the PAPs.~~' Based on a review of the
       records and interviews          in the field, the Panel found no evidence to indicate

       that, apart from       being interviewed        for the Baseline Survey, the PAPS were
       consulted in the preparation of the Parej East RAP itself.452

430. OD 4.30 paragraph 9 sates that "[h]ost communities and local governments should
       be informed and consulted." The RAP does not indicate that there were any
       consultations with the host community on how the then anticipated settlement of
       257 PAPS in the adjacent site at Pindra would impact on them or their economic
      base. Nor does it indicate their attitude towards sharing the forest with a huge influx
       of outsiders.453During its investigation,          the Panel confirmed       that there were, in
      fact, no consultations with the host community               even during the Baseline Survey
      phase.

431. Management itself acknowledged that the consultation process had been imperfect
      when, in mid-1997, it had to report to the Board on the status of implementation of
      the CSESMP prior to negotiations for the CSRP. In general, Management admitted
      that "[t]he lack of meanin&d         consultations between Coal India and its subsidiaries
      with project aflected people and other stakeholders has lead to several difficult
      situations." Management cited one of the Parej East problems, stating that it resulted
      from this: `At Parej East coal mine of the Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), a conflict
      developed between CCL and project-afSected people which necessitated police and
      court interventions. Proiect-affected people refused to move from the land acquired
      by CCL because they were not consulted on the location and site design for the
      resettlement village" 454(emphasis added).

432. The Panel recognizes that Management                    ensured that the PAPS in Parej East
      were interviewed during the process of the Baseline Survey preparation                     and, to
      the extent that this provided inputs for the RAP, finds that Management was in
      compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.

433. But, beyond these interviews,             there is nothing to indicate that the PAPS in
      Parej East were "systematically informed and consulted during preparation of the
       resettlement plan about their options and rights." In light of this, the Panel finds
      that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.

434. The evidence is clear that the host community                 for the Pindra resettlement site
      was not consulted during project preparation                  and, in light of this, the Panel
      finds that Management was not in compliance with paragraph 9 of OD 4.30.




452The Parej East RAP was prepared by CCLs' design and planning consultant, the same consultant who
surveyed and prepared the plan for the resettlement site.

10.3. Implementation                 of Resettlement Action Plan

435. In its Response, Management lists 54 meetings that project authorities held, between
       April 1995 and May 2001, with Parej East PAPS and provides detailed information
       on those meetings.455Management claims that the consultations held after the RAP
       was prepared were also "used as a forum by CCL to disseminate project related
       information        such as CZL's         R&R      Policy,   infrastructure        development of the
       resettlement site, and the commencement of a survey to determine appropriate
        income generation option."456 (emphasis added). The Panel notes that                                  these
        consultations should have concerned the Parej East RAP that laid out the plan
        and entitlements for Parej East R&R, not the Coal India Ltd. R&R policy.

436. Management reports positive outcomes of the early consultations. "One of the
        outcomes of these consultations was that PAPS were able to choose their plot in the
        resettlement site and the self-employment training option which appealed to them.
       Additionally,      a committee was constituted to assess the claims of damage due to
       blasting. Continued dialogue betweenproject officials and aflected persons brought
       about an increase in the resettlement plot sizefrom the 100 sq. meters provided for
        under GIL's R&R Policy to 200 sq. meters. Other consultations led to the selection
       of the Prem Nagar resettlement site at the request of the PAFs from Turi Tola ..."451

437. In reaction, the Requesters consider it a "misrepresentation"                           to imply that the
       consultations held were to "discuss the issues raised by the PAPS." They say the
       meetings       "did   not    move beyond giving             information        about,     and      stressing
        implementation of GIL's R&R policy which they had to follow."458

438. Lack of "meaningful consultation" in Parej East during early implementation was
       noted by the ESRP. The ESRP reported their 1997 observations on the Turi Tola
       PAPS' resistance to relocation. They said that project officials had never sat down
       with the people in their hamlet to discuss the situation. In order to resolve the
       problem, the ESRP recommended that CCL officials change their approach and also
       involve CASS to help.459




455Management Response 2001, supra note 13, para. 33. According to Management topics inclused "(i)
increase in plot size and allotment of sites by caste group; (ii) damage of homes due to blasting; (iii)
Environmental Assessment; (iv) land compensation; (v) mine jobs; and (vi) income generation."

458CASS to Inspection Panel, December 10, 2001. More specifically about the outcomes claimed by
Management, in paragraph 34 of its Response, CASS states that "[i]t is true Prem Nagar was granted as an
alternative resettlement site, but it is a misrepresentation to say that this is the `result of consultation'; it
was a result of agreement reached in Hazaribag civil court; `Claims of damage due to blasting' was not the
result of `consultations', but of the PAPSfiling a case to the Director General of Mines Safety (papers of
which are on record); `Increase in the size of resettlement plot. ' True there was an increase to 200 sq. m.,
but as the PAPSwere requesting 400 sq. m. it is misrepresentation to imply that consultations brought
satisfactory results."

                                                                                                               108

439. Systematic consultation with the PAPS began towards mid-1997 when formulation
       of the annual RAP implementation plan was delegated by Coal India Ltd. to the
       NGO (XISS), which was to facilitate PAP participation in the process. The Panel
       was told that, at first, PAPS resisted communication with XISS perceiving them to
       represent CCL. XISS overcame this, to some extent, by using an innovative way of
       engaging those to be displaced. The ESRP praised this approach and recommended
       that CCL should document it and have it applied in other mines.46o

440. The Panel notes that, after the RAP was prepared, consultation with PAPS. and
       PAP participation       in the resettlement process, was to he undertaken     entirely
       through     the implementing        NGO, hut also observes that in Parej East the
       implementing       NGO, XISS, set up an office in Parej East only in July 1997.
       During the three years that elapsed since the RAP had been prepared there is
       scant     evidence    of   consultations      on planning   for displacement,  except
       occasionally at the insistence of CASS. The Panel finds, however, that once
       XISS began work, there was systematic consultation             and involvement  of the
       PAPS, on behalf of CCL, and therefore finds Management in compliance with
       paragraph 8 of OD 4.30.


10.4. Consultation           with Parej East NGOs

441. The Requesters assert that their right to participation and consultation, during the
       project preparation and implementation, "was efSectiveZydenied ..."461They maintain
       that they received `polite and pro- active responses" to their letters, "but in time
       came to realize that these were only serving to wall paper failures on ground which
       were not being addressed."462

442. In its 2001 Response, Management contends that the supervision team had
       "significant interaction with a number of local and international NGOs" throughout
       the Project Preparation and Implementation.          It claims that, `from early 1996
       frequent communication began between the supervision team and CASS."463

443. As for consultation with local NGOs during preparation of the Parej East RAP,
       CCL's consultant stated that there were no [relevant] NGOs in Parej East for them
       to consult with. It should be noted that CASS appears to have begun to voice
       concerns for the PAPS from Turi Tola and Borwa Tola, in 1996, about a year after
       the RAP was prepared. It voiced its concerns directly to the project authorities and
       the Bank in its February and April 1996 reports that were delivered before approval
       of the CSESMP in May 1996.

444. The Panel found that, in 1996, Management did not consider that it was the Bank's
       responsibility to listen directly to local NGOs or PAPs.~~~However, the records
       show that Management did respond to the international NGOs, which had actually
       taken up and raised the complaints made by CASS and other Indian NGOs. In its
       response to a letter from a group of international NGOs in 1996, Management
       admitted that it had ignored CASS's suggestions during Project Preparation on the
       grounds that "[i]t       is Coal India's     concern to consult with the project-affected
       people, their representative and NGOs directly. Coal India informed us that they
       consulted extensively with the St. Xavier Institute [XISS]."465

445. When a Bank staff social scientist from the New Delhi office visited in April 1997
       he was concerned to discover that CASS letters to the Bank and project authorities,
       during the previous six months, had been ignored. In May 1997, Washington Bank
       staff  agreed to         ensure consultation       with   local    NGOs      on   the   CSESMP
       Implementation      Note before submitting         it to the Executive Directors. In fact,
       however, the Parej East NGOs received just two days notice for the consultation
       meeting in New Delhi and, given such short notice, it was physically impossible for
       them to arrange to attend. Following this event, the international NGOs questioned
       Management's credibility and addressed the issue to the Bank President, claiming
       that "the pressure to rapidly approve the CSRP undermines attempts to consult the
       Indian NGO community."466The President response explained that the process of
       local NGO consultation was satisfied through consulting the NGOs who had been
       employed to facilitate the CSESMP implementation and formulate annual RAPS and
       IPDPs.~" In the case of Parej East, therefore, Management was satisfied by the fact
       that XISS had been consulted.

446. The Panel notes Management's               view that consultation       with local NGOs was to
       he undertaken exclusively with the implementing                NGOs, but also observes that
       in Parej East the implementing            NGO, XISS (employed only in March                  1997),
       was located in Ranchi, and could not be considered a local NGO until it set up
       an office in Parej East only in July 1997. It is evident therefore that, prior to
       mid 1997, any consultation            the borrower      may have had with XISS did not
       constitute consultation with a local Parej East NGO. It is also worth noting that
       since XISS was contracted by CCL it was accountable to the subsidiary                           that
       employed it. In the Panel's view, it is at best not clear how this arrangement
       could serve to discharge Management's               obligation to ensure consultation with
       local NGOs acting on behalf of the PAPS, rather than on behalf of CCL. At
       worst, it places the implementing            NGO in a serious conflict          of interest, the
       results of which the Panel itself had an opportunity             to witness.

447. The Panel notes, however, that Bank staff did meet with CASS in the field at
     least once in 1996 and twice in 1997. Beginning in early 1998 and through to
     February  2000, the supervision team did, after consultation  with Coal India
     Ltd., systematically respond to CASS letters, and met with the NGO several
     times in the field to discuss issues. However, this ended in March   2000 and
    since then, the Panel understands there has been no communication      between
     the Bank and CASS.

448. The Panel therefore finds that, before 1998 and after 2000, Management    did
    not ensure that the views of `local NGOs" in Parej East were taken "fully into
    account in the project design and implementation" as suggested by paragraph 19
    of OD 4.01, in particular   with regard to implementation  of the RAP. In this
    respect, Management was not in compliance with paragraph 19 of OD 4.01.

449. OD 13.05 on Bank supervision notes that "[plroject Supervision is one of the Bank's
       most important activities." The main purposes of the policy are "(a) to ensure that
       the borrower implements the project with due diligence ... and in conformity with
       the loan agreement; (b) to identify problems promptly                    as they arise during
       implementation and help the borrower resolve them, and to modify as necessary the
       project concept and design as the project evolves during implementation or as
       circumstances change .... (c) to take timely action to cancel a project if its
       continuation is no longer justified , particularly        if it can no longer be expected to
       achieve the desired development objectives .... (e) to use the experience gained to
       improve the design of future projects, sector and country strategies, and policies
       ..."468OD 13.05 adds that the Bank carries out these supervision activities by, inter
       alia, studying periodic reports and correspondence from project authorities, and by
       visiting the borrowers and the project sites.

450. OD       4.30   paragraph 31        on    involuntary   resettlement       takes supervision      of
       implementation       very    seriously.    Recognizing      that   sporadic      supervision    in
       implementation      could jeopardize the success of resettlement, it                   states that
       "[rlesettlement    components should be supervised throughout implementation."
       Likewise, OD 4.20 paragraph 19 specifies that the site visits conducted by Task
       Managers and specialists are essential. It further stipulates that "[mlid term andfinal
       evaluations should assess progress and recommend corrective                        actions when
       necessary."

451. The Requesters, allege that "[tlhe Bank has failed to adequately supervise the
       CSESMP project as guaranteed when it undertook theproject."469

452. In its Response, Management maintains that it conducted an intense supervision
       effort. It provides supporting data, including a list of the supervision missions
       undertaken (in Annex 2). It also provides an Annex (No. 3) showing "ZssuesRaised
       [with CCL] in Supervision Missions in Parej East." According to the Response,
       supervision missions visited the Parej East mine 18 times from 1996 through June
       2001.470Management points out that, in addition to Bank supervision missions, a
       Project    Implementation      and Monitoring       Consultant firm,        consisting     of  two
       environmentalists and two social scientists, has been supervising all project mines
       on a quarterly basis, and that, since April           1997, an Environmental           and Social
       Review Panel (ESRP), comprised of two Indian and two international experts, has

       been providing        an independent assessment of Coal India Ltd.`s                     policies and
       performance regarding environmental and social mitigation. Their visits are listed in
       Annex 4.471

453. Paragraphs 42 through 47 of OD 13.05 provide the basic requirements necessary for
       establishing and conducting sound supervision planning. A detailed supervision plan
       is included in the Staff Appraisal Report.


11.1. The Supervision Consultant

454. OD       13.05, para. 4(c), provides that the country departments should "where
       appropriate, engage local agencies to help carry out supervision." The SAR points
       out that the Project is complex with 25 mines, some of which are as big as normal
       Bank projects in terms of investment, widely spread over 11 coalfields in five States
       in the east central part of India. For this reason, the SAR notes that "it is evident that
       the Bank's supervision mission will not be able to visit all the subprojects even once
       a year, even larger projects cannot be regularly covered."472In light of this, a local
       consultancy company was engaged to supervise all the project mines at least once
       every quarter. Visits from the Consultant began in April                  1997 after this, the firm
       visited each mine four times a year as a supplement to Bank supervision missions.473

455. The supervision consultant is especially important in this case since the reports of
       their quarterly mine visits provided the basis for the supervision activity the Bank
       must carry out pursuant to its own policies. The Bank found the supervision
       consultant's environmental reporting adequate, but in February 1998, after two
       supervision consultant's reports, the Bank supervision mission reported that it was
       not satisfied with the consultant's reporting on social mitigation. At the time of the
       mid-term review in February 1999, the Bank was still not satisfied with the social
       consultant's     performance stating that "there has been a consistent lack of
       professional supervision by the consultant of its social scientists. This needs to be
       provided immediately. Alternatively, a replacement for the consultant providing the
       social science inputs for the Supervision Consultant's team should be found."474
       Apparently, the performance improved since the Management Response points out
       that "[o]ver time, as the consultant developed its capacity, the reporting has become
       a useful tool for Bank Missions."475 Supervision of the project's environmental
       aspects was done almost exclusively by one Bank expert who told the Panel that,

social issues relating to a particular subsidiary.

     given the huge scale of the CSESMP, he relied completely on the supervision
     consultant reports.

456. In the Panel's view, it is most unfortunate         that Management did not act on the
     unsatisfactory    nature of the supervision          consultant's    reports  on the social
     aspects of the Project before February 1999. By that time, over three years had
     passed since the local        NGOs     in Parej      East had begun to submit         their
     complaints   about lack of consultation. As the Panel reported earlier, it found
     no evidence of consultation on the preparation of the SEIA and the IZAP, which
     deals with matters that have a fundamental             impact on the future well being of
     those being forced to resettle. The Panel would also note that the ESBP reports
     should have alerted Management            to a number of problems as early as April
     1997, two years before it concluded that its supervision consultant's               reports
     were unsatisfactory.

457. In light of this, the Panel finds that, prior to February           1999, Management was
     not in compliance with OD 13.05 on Bank supervision on Parej East.


11.2. Bank Supervision Missions

458. The SAR stated that "in order to make this pioneering project successful, the Bank
     will  have to allocate more stafs resources and consultants than is usually
     budgeted."476At that time, it was estimated that 11 supervision missions would be
     needed between July 1996 and June 2001. In fact, as Management points out, it
     undertook 21 supervision missions during that period, with each of the 25 mines
     being visited once a year. In the case of Parej East, it undertook 18 missions, an
     average of six per year. This is highly unusual in Bank supervision. According to
     the Management, the resources allocated have been "considerably                  above the
     average" for South Asia."' It is thus clear that supervision of the CSESMP in Parej
     East has been regular and represents an intense supervision effort in terms of
     resources allocated and numbers of visits. In part, because of the inadequacy of
     the supervision     consultant's    reports,    the supervision      team's   knowledge  of
     ground    realities was limited,     and for that reason, their          efforts to resolve
     problems had virtually     no impact on the ground.

459. OD 4.30 paragraph 31 requires that Bank supervision missions be staffed with
     "requisite social, economic and technical expertise," and OD 4.20 requires that
     provisions requiring appropriate anthropological, legal and technical skills in Bank
     supervision    missions  during    project     implementation      should be included    in
     supervision planning. The supervision schedule in the SAR provides for this.

460. The original Task Manager during project preparation was an engineer from the
     Bank's Asia energy unit. The first Task Manager for implementation                   of the


476CSESMP SAR, supru note 2, Annex 3.2, Project Implementation, para. 66.
477See Management Response 2001, supra note 13, para. 26-27.


                                                                                            114

      CSESMP was an urban planner with expertise in resettlement but reporting to
      Energy Unit. From February 1998 onwards, however, when implementation of the
      CSESMP actually started, and before the CSRP loan became effective, the Task
      Manager for the CSESMP was an anthropologist who was familiar with the Project
      since he had been on a number of supervision missions. In addition, "[t]o ~XWZ
      autonomy of the CSESMP in relation to the CSRP" his reporting function was
      changed from the Energy Unit to the Social Development Unit, "with a supervision
      budget independent of CSRP."478

461. A 1994 Bank paper on Resettlement Supervision points out that the primary
      objective of resettlement supervision is to ensure that activities and programs are
      being implemented in a way that meets the objectives set by Bank policies.
      However, the paper also indicates that, in responding to resettlement issues, in the
      past, country directors have been mainly driven by the pulls and pressure of the
      moment (e.g. a crisis in implementation or queries from the Board), rather than by
      specific project requirements. In addition, according to the Bank paper, the
      participation   of resettlement specialists in the supervision "has been not only
      inadequate, but also haphazard, inconstant and impelled by extraneous reasons."479
      The paper adds that the supervision of the resettlement activities is difficult              and
      complex becauseof "the `externality' or the ill integrated status of resettlement as a
      project component on the one hand, and, the social and political dimensions of the
      resettlement activity on the other. The externality of resettlement influences the way
      Bank sta&f perceive resettlement (as a hindrance to the implementation of the
      project, as something opposed to their primary interests in the project) and allocate
      time and resources for       its supervision. The social and political          dimensions of
      resettlement introduce a great degree of             unpredictability    and fluidity     to the
      resettlement process, which conventional supervision strategies based on measure
      and control find hard to deal with."

462. In this case, from February 1998 onwards, the Panel considers that the usual
      competing demands and conflicts with the investment project were minimized since
      supervision    was   separately budgeted for          and managed, for           most    of   the
      implementation, by a qualified Task Leader. Unlike past Bank projects that saw
      frequent changes of supervision specialists or consultants, the Task Leader also
      drew on the help of the same consistent core of Bank social scientist specialists with
      the appropriate skills as needed. These same skills are needed for supervision under
      OD 4.20. In addition, the supervision teams had solid support from the Country
      Director. His and the team's worst fear was that when the investment loan was
      cancelled, Coal India Ltd. would then cancel the CSESMP. The fact that this did not
      happen, and that progress improved, may reflect the fact that, however late, the
      commitment      of Coal India Ltd.`s      Senior Management to compliance with the
      Bank's ODs increased - something that the Bank-wide reviews on resettlement had
      often cited as a lacking. One of the problems about Parej East is that the

1995, para. 4(c).


                                                                                                   115

       commitment of CCL's Senior Management was not, and did not become, nearly as
       evident. In addition, the CSESMP in Parej East was affected by an unusual event
       outside the control of the Bank or CCL. Towards the end of the project (August
       ZOOO),the state of Bihar was split in two, and the Parej East sub-project found itself
       in the new stateof Jharkand.

463. It is also important to note that, in February 1998, the new supervision team
       inherited a sub-project in Parej East designed some years before, albeit with the
       assistance and approval of the Bank: (RAPS in 1994, IPDPs and EAPs in 1995,
       performance indicators in 1996 and, during implementation, with further evaluation
       benchmarks added in 1997 in the form of CSRP cross-conditionalities). As the
       Panel pointed out earlier, the original              RAP and IPDP for Parej East were
       fundamentally flawed (such as lack of consultation, which made implementation
       more than problematic in Parej East). No amount or quality of Bank supervision
       could reverse these flaws. There is evidence, nonetheless, that, however late, they
       tried to correct a number of serious substantive problems raised by the Requesters.

464. Performance         Indicators.    Table 3.2.6 of the SAR lists, as is customary, the
       performance indicators and benchmarks that were to be used to monitor                         the
       implementation      of the CSESMP.           Before Board consideration of the CSRP
       international NGOs questioned the usefulness of these indicators. They believed that
       performance indicators should measure not just formal `inputs' of the CSESMP
       implementation, but the actual `output' on the ground. To their credit, the Panel
      notes that staff invited them to submit their suggestions for `output' performance
      indicators that the Bank could adopt as part of its supervision. They did so on June
       12, 1997 - just after the CSESMP implementation                   "Note" had been sent to the
      Executive Directors.480When Management responded it indicated that some of the
      NGO suggestions had already been translated into conditionalities to be established
      between the CSESMP and CSRP, while others were difficult                         to translate into
      measurable indicators         but where feasible a measurable indicator                 would   be
      established.481

465. Implementation of the CSESMP started only at the end of 1997, a few weeks before
      the new Task Leader and supervision arrangements were in place. By the time the
      CSRP was approved in September 1997, the Bank had acknowledged that "results
      on the ground havefailed to materialize jii~lly."~~~So before the CSRP could become
      effective, certain conditions set out in Schedule 9 to the Loan Agreement, had to be
      met. Completion of these output indicators, or time bound social and environmental
      activities,     therefore,    became       the   basis    for     measurement       of   CSESMP
      implementation. They were tracked by every Bank supervision mission and also by
      the independent ESRP.

466. In its Response, Management states that "[a]s re.ected                       in the Mission       aide
      memoires and Management Letters, the project supervision has strived for                            a
      realistic assessment of the problems faced by the project, and has tried to facilitate
      solutions that promoted improved implementation                     and compliance with Bank
      policies. Particular      emphasis has been given to economic rehabilitation                    ..."483
      Judging from the Back to Office Memoranda, Aide-Memoires, other mission reports
      and documents since 1998, Management has not hesitated to be frank about
      problems and difficulties       encountered. It has also proposed solutions and worked
      with    the borrower to find ways of achieving them, and, to the extent that
      Management can, to follow-up. In the Panel's view, based on this evidence, the
      supervision team generally made a significant                 effort to overcome some of the
      problems stemming from the flawed RAP and IPDP for Parej East.

467. The most fundamental issue the post-1998 supervision mission had to confront was
      the risk that non-farm based income generation schemes in Parej East would
      probably fail, causing yet further harm to the PAPS. Faced with this, the current
      Task Leader recommended that Coal India Ltd. adopt a land-based income
      generation strategy. Unfortunately, CCL pulled out of the scheme. Noting the
      success of the one pilot in operation in another mine, the supervision team
      recommended its immediate adoption in other subsidiaries. This, of course, has not,
      and will not, help the PAPS in Parej East.

468. Two other problems that are causing the PAPS serious hardship are (a) the lack of
      title or long term leases to house plots on resettlement sites; and (b) lack of
      compensation for land under customary tenure. Both of these problems were
      initially raised by CASS and both were missed in Parej East by Management during
      project preparation. In July 1997, however, they resulted in an agreement to correct
      promptly, as reflected a Supplementary Letter to the CSRP Loan Agreement. Every
      supervision Aide Memoire and Management Letter from this point on pointed to
      these problems and stressedthat they had to be resolved before the mid-term review.
      As required by OD 13.05 the Task Leader in addition asked the Bank's Legal
      Counsel for the project to visit India in October 1998 to follow up on the two issues.
      As of February 2002, the PAPS in Parej East have not obtained title or a long-lease
      issue to their house plots. In addition, many tribal PAPS are still waiting to receive
      land compensation.

469. From the outset, the Requesters have complained about the Coal India Ltd. R&R
      policy. Beginning in late 1997, the ESRP recommended revisions to this policy. A
      revised policy was submitted to the Bank in August 2000 and it was discussed
      during the October 2000 mission. While one of Management's recommendations
      was incorporated,484the policy has not been accepted because it still fails to give
      unmarried sons, at 18 years and over, a plot in the resettlement sites, and it fails to


483Management Response 2001, supru     note 13, para. 29.
484That land losers and their dependents above 18 years who are not entitled to a mine job or the newly
introduced cash compensation in lieu of a mine job will be entitled to income restoration assistance.


                                                                                                        117

     increase the minimum plot size per family to provide room for a second generation,
     as required under OD 4.30.

470. The Panel recognizes that since early 1998 the supervision          team has made
     significant  efforts to address the outstanding problems in Parej East. In this
     regard,    the Panel has been impressed       by the Team's      frank  and honest
     assessments in their supervision reports.

471. The Team's      endeavors have been significant.    Unfortunately,    however, the
     results on the ground in Parej East have been mixed. This stems in part from
     the faulty   design of the RAP and IPDP as well as from           a serious lack of
     advance planning during the project preparation       phase. It also stems in part
     from some problems involving complex matters of Indian national and/or state
     legislation that arose during implementation    and have been difficult  to resolve,
     and the lead up to and results of the creation of the new State of Jharkand.

472. Coal India Ltd.`s Senior Management told the Panel that a major outcome of
     the CSESMP, due largely to the dedication of the Task Leader, was a change in
     their attitude and approach towards the need to address social issues created
     by mine development       and exploitation. In the Panel's view, however, it will
     take much more time, strong leadership, satisfactory and timely internal and
     external measures, the employment        of appropriate  expertise and, probably,
     significant  changes in career incentives for the new approach to filter down to
     those at the mine level in Parej East. By analogy with changes in the World
     Bank culture    concerning social issues since CSESMP        preparation  began in
     1991, and particularly     during the past five years, this is not an impossible
     challenge, but does take time.

473. It is clear that rehabilitation has not yet been completed successfully in Parej
     East and the outcome of some major issues, such as income restoration, is still
     in doubt. It is also clear that the current supervision team inherited many of
     these problems because of the fundamentally      flawed preparatory    phase. Since
     its establishment, the current supervision team has generally made a significant
     effort to overcome the major problems outstanding and, short of suspending or
     canceling the Credit, doing its best to translate its efforts into outcomes on the
     ground. In light of this, the Panel finds that since 1998 Management      has been
     in compliance with OD 13.05.


11.3. Independent Review Panel

474. Management viewed the CSESMP as environmentally contentious. In such cases,
    paragraph 13 of OD 4.01 requires that implementation should be supervised and
    guided by an independent panel of experts. Because Management considered the
    environmental and social aspects as "strongly interdependent" it recommended one




                                                                                     118

       Panel to cover both areas.485The Panel was to "... make periodic reviews of the
        implementations   of   GIL's     social   and environmental       mitigation policies to
        recommend measures, if required, for eflective and successful implementation of
       RAPS, IPDPs and EAPs. The Panel will also recommend measures to effectively
       deal with social and environmental issues in the development and operations of coal
       mines consistent with local laws & regulations and the World Bank's Operational
       Directives 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30."486

475. The ESRP visited Parej East three times. The first was in October-November 1997
       for a couple of days. The second was in May 1999487for about one day, and the third
       in early 2001.488The ESRP issued five reports, which were reviewed by Bank
        supervision teams. ESRP reporting on specific social issues in Parej East was
       largely confined to a report on the resistance to relocation in 1997. On that occasion,
       it recommended489that documentation of resettlement in Parej East should be
       prepared by an independent "consultant/NGO (CASS or XZSS management)" as a
       case study so other subsidiaries and Coal India Ltd. can understand lessons learned.
       Unfortunately, this has not yet been done but, in the Panel's view, it should be.

Part Five: The Future after the CSESMP

                     12. The Future after the CSESMP

476. Paragraph 31 of OD 4.30 on involuntary                 resettlement closes with a practical
      thought: "Complete recovery from resettlement can be protracted and can oj?en
     make it necessary to continue Bank supervision until well afier populations have
     been relocated, sometimes even after the project has closed."

477. It is evident that rehabilitation envisaged by the CSESMP, and required by OD 4.30
      has not been completed successfully in Parej East, with the result that PAPS
      continue to suffer harm. In the past, the Bank has continued to supervise or
      monitor RAP issues after closure of a project, and the Panel understands that
      this will happen in this case.

478. A major continuing problem is the failure of income restoration. The Panel
     understands that Coal India Ltd. is to undertake a census of PAP incomes in
     preparation for the CSESMP Implementation Completion Report. In the meantime,
      according to the 2002 Management Response, CCL has agreed to give follow-up
      assistance to the PAPS in Parej East that continue to suffer loss of income.4go
     Because of the inadequacy of the income restoration programs, some of them have
     been forced to spend whatever remains of their compensation simply to survive.
     This is an extremely urgent matter. It should not happen in a Bank-financed
     project. Steps should he taken to ensure compensation of these PAPS, not only
     because they have spent their             original     compensation      for   their    assets on
     survival,    but also for the losses and harm suffered due to delays in restoring
     their income potential.

479. The annual IPDP's for 2002, including that for Parej East contain an exit strategy
     involving planning for long-term maintenance of community assets created during
     the past four and a half years of IPDP implementation, and most (including Parej
     East) involve measures to strengthen community based organizations such as the
     Village     Working      Groups   and self-help        groups.491This      will    need careful
     monitoring.

480. In November 2000, the IMC submitted, a time-bound action plan for enhancement
     of Coal India Ltd.`s capacity to deal with social and environmental mitigation
     "beyond the 25 Bank supported mines and beyond the project closing date."492The
     latest Supervision Aide Memoire reports that Coal India Ltd. has formed "high level
     strategy groups both at headquarters and in all subsidiaries, drafted subsidiary
     action plans,      and authorized staff as responsible for              the handling        of the
     environmental and social mitigation throughout the company." It is also reported


490See Management Comments 2002, supra note 34, para. 13, in Annex 3 of this Report.
491See December 2001 Aide Memoire, para. 40.
492The latest Bank supervision Aide Memoire points out that based on IMC's report on Strengthening of
CIL Social and Environmental Management Capability.


                                                                                                   121

     that CCL have 57 social staff, six of whom are trained, and 134 environmental staff,
      seven of whom are trained.

48 1. In the Panel's view, it is vital that, in line with paragraph 31 of OD 4.30, the
     Bank take steps to continue to supervise the implementation       of the CSESMP
     after the Credit has formally    closed, and the Panel notes with satisfaction the
     Bank's intention to do so. This should include post-implementation     monitoring
     and an audit to determine the effectiveness of the social mitigation   measures, in
     particular those designed to enable PAPS quickly to regain their former income
     levels and family well-being.

482. In relation to this, the Panel notes Management's     satisfaction with the success
     of the Independent Monitoring      Committee composed of three Indian nationals
     of high repute, in the context of follow-up        and independent   assessment of
     resettlement issues in the NTPC Singrauli      Loan. In the Panel's view, it would
     be useful to consider a similar mechanism for Parej East.

CSESMP team during a mission to GIL headquarters in Kolkata and the Parej East mine from
February 4 to 14,2002, and this note provides the Panel with additional evidence that the Bank
is in compliance with all relevant policies and procedures related to the design and
implementation of the above referenced project. The issues and concerns in these
communications deal exclusively with actions carried out under the Coal Sector Environmental
and Social Mitigation Project (CSESMP).

1.1     resettlement    impacts on hamlets of Baraghatu village:      CASS writes that "Yillnge
        Burughutu has some hamlets      which were included in the original RAP. Subsequently
        they were removedfrom RAP as it was decided not to displace them, but only t&e their
        rice fields and land. Thus during the term of the ESMP they were then included in
        IPiIP.   Now, in the latter part of 2001, survey is being donefor their displacement,
        Local govt officials have told thepeople to bring their papers@    verilficntion. This

        prqject is over, they m-e brozlght out into the open. F/e suggest tdzata tJzorougJz
        investigation has to be done with regard to the hamlets of Burughutu village. "

4.      Unlike a typical infrastructure project where all land acquisition required for the project
takes place within the project period, the open cast coal mines operated by CIL involve land
acquisition throughout the life of a particular mine, and this may significantly exceed the
duration of the CSESMP. This is also the casewith regard to the Parej East mine, where mining
may continue for another 20 years or so. While CIL has adopted a corporate policy on
resettlement and rehabilitation that is applicable to all land acquisition carried out by CIL, the
obligations relating to resettlement and rehabilitation, as set out in the SAR, are limited to the
projected caseload of PAPS created by land acquisition for mine expansion during the project
period. In Parej East, as in other mines under the CSESMP, the actual mine expansion and the
extent of associated land acquisition has turned out to be lower than what was projected during
project preparation.

5.      In Parej East, the revenue village of Baraghatu (Burughutu) comprises two hamlets,
namely Agaria and Facodih (Baraghatu proper). While the Facodih hamlet is located inside the
mine leasehold boundary, neither the original mine expansion plan (see attached Map 2), on
which the 1994 RAF is based, nor the revised plan (seeMap2) require resettlement of this
hamlet. It was, therefore, included in the CSESMF as an IFDF village.       The relocation of the
Agaria hamlet, originally proposed to take place in 2008, seven years after the project closing
date. Under the revised mine expansion plan, relocation is now expected to take place in 2010
(eight years beyond the revised CSESMP closing date of June 30,2002). It is expected that
preparations for resettlement will be carried out in accordance with GIL's Corporate R&R
Policy, which complies with the Bank's OD 4.30.

6.      As indicated in the revised mine expansion plan, relocation of the households in the
Agaria hamlet will not take place until approximately eight years from now. Accordingly, CCL
has not undertaken, nor plans to undertake surveys and house measurements to prepare for
resettlement for approximately seven years. Inquiries made by the CSESMF team found, that
the surveys referred to in the communication from CASS were neither conducted by CCL staff
nor intended to prepare for displacement. They were those carried out by the govermnent of the
newly created Jharkand state aspart of a state-wide updating of the old revenue records from
1909. The Circle Office of the Jharkand state government conducted these surveys in the Mandu
Block (to which the revenue village of Baraghatu belongs) in November, 2001. The villagers
interviewed by the CSESMP team seemedto be well aware of the purpose of these surveys

1.2     Income restoration:     CASS writes that "The fact is that the PAPS have been now
deprived of their former economic szlrvival base, andfor an alarming large number of them, tltis
has NOT been replaced. In theface of the lengthy response of Management, this fact still stands
clenrly. Para 76 of Management responseindicates that 67.7% of those who completed training
(what % of all PAPS?) have been able to establish income. We ask to see explicit identity of
these PAPS, with the means and amount of claimed income. "

7.      Para 76 of the Management Responseof July 19,2001, extensively covers the issue of
income restoration for all EPAPs under the CSESMF, and in Parej East speciticaily.        The figure
given for EPAFs who are earning an income based on the training they received, is 45.7O/`u,not
the 67.7% stated by CASS. Of the EPAFs in Farej East, who have completed training by the end


                                                   4

of 2000,37% are earning an income basedon the training received (for further information on
income restoration, see section 2.1).

8.      The figure of 65.7% of EPAPs with incomes based on training includes EPAPs from the
13 other mines with land acquisition under the project.  To reveal the identities and/or the
incomes of these EPAPs to CASS would be a violation of their rights to confidentiality, and
would require their explicit consent. The same rationale applies to the EPAPs of Parej East
whether they are tribal or non-tribal. The Bank will, however, make available to the Inspection
Panel any and all information they require in the course of their investigation.

2.       comments   on issues raised in communication    dated January 11,2OK?

2.1 Issue 1: Regain former standard of living:      CASS writes that "three years after
    displacement the people of Turi Tola and Borwo Tola have not regained their former
    standard of living, generally have not beengiven jobs or replacement land, and the self-
    employment opportunities ' have come to nothing."

9.      The process of land acquisition and subsequentrelocation of the PAPS has been phased,
and has taken place in accordancewith mine advancement. The villagers of Turi Tola were
originally displaced by the TATA owned West Bokaro mine before the start of the CSESMP.
Under the CSESMP, one Turi Tola family relocated in February 1998, while the remaining eight
families relocated in May 1998. The residents of Borwa Tola relocated between December 1999
and January 2000, and the residents of Sunugutu and Jogwa Tola relocated in October 2000 and
March 2001, respectively.

10.     Analysis of inflation adjusted income data for Parej East from the April 2001 census,
shows that for the 236 EPAPs (out of the total caseload of 480 EPAPs), who had two or more
data points from which their incomes could be compared, 64% have increased their incomes,
20% have maintained their pre-project incomes, while 16% have experienced a decreasein their
reported incomes. Among the 79 EPAPs from the tribal population (out of a total of 152), who
had two or more data points from which their incomes could be compared, 58% have increased
their reported incomes, 25% have maintained their pre-project incomes, while 16% have
experienced a decreasedin their reported incomes.

Il.     The inflation adjusted average individual monthly incomes of EPAPs increased 27.6%,
from Rs. 1,013 to Rs. 1,293 between 1997 and 2001. In addition, the number of individual
EPAPs with incomes in excessof Rs. 4,000 per month has nearly doubled. At the same time, the
number of PAPS reporting incomes below Rs. 1,000 per month has decreasedfrom 61% in 1997
to 56% in 2001.

                       Average Monthly    Household Income (Rs.) in Parej East:

12.     The inflation adjusted average monthly income of all EPAP households also increasedby
27.6%, from Rs. 2,180 to Rs. 2,783 between 1997 and 2001. Between 1994 and 2001, the
average monthly household income increased significantly by approximately 70%. Among non-
tribal PAPS, the percentage of households with incomes in excess of Rs. 2,000 per month
increased from 43% in 1997 to 68% in 2001. Among tribal EPAPs, during the same period, the
percentage of households with incomes in excess of Rs. 2,000 per month increased from 40% in
1997 to 58% in 2001.

13.     In Parej East the Annual RAP for 2002 targets EPAPs who have experienced an income
decrease,and provides those who are interested, with training and follow-up assistanceregarding
the necessaryinvestments and market linkages to enable them to earn an income from the
training. A follow-up censusis being undertaken in March-April           2002, to enable further analysis
of the status of income restoration achieved during the project period.' The results of this census
will be independently verified by a consultant.


2.2     Issue   2: Jobs in the company:       CASS writes that only 14 PAPS have received jobs in
        the company and quotes Coal India's (CIL) R&R Policy as follows, "Jobs will be given
        to eligible landless PAPS on a preferential basis when outside recruitment becomes
        necessary." CASS quotes an undated earlier version of the Parej East Resettlement
        Action plan as follows: "To the extent new employment opportunities get created in the
        Project in unskilled or semi-skilled categories, these shall be reserved entirely for the
        land ousteefamilies "

14.     In accordance with Coal India's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy (R&R), CCL's
employment records for Parej East indicate that they have provided 9* jobs during the project
period to PAPS who have either lost 3 acresof non-irrigated land or two acres of irrigated land.
Additionally, in accordance with GIL's corporate policy, CIL has informed the CSESMP team
that no non-PAPS have been hired for any unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in CCL during the life
of the CSESMP.

2.3     Issue 3:                   ctsrs: CASS writes that "the fact is that while nfew -PAPS
       find daily wage employment arouPzdthe mine, the majority are not able to do so. They
        are living off their compensation money given for building their houses. There is no
        substantiation of contractors giving jobs to them. Where it is given, it is temporav and
        casual work"

15.     Jobs with contractors for unskilled laborers are by definition temporary and casual work.
However, this does not mean that this form of employment does not involve a significant number
of PAPS, nor that CCL has not made an effort to link PAPS to available jobs with contractors.

16.     Coal loading is one type of contractual work where many PAPS earn an income as casual
laborers. At the coal loading dump at the Parej East mine, the loading of coal trucks is carried
out by labor gangs (dangal) comprising 15 male and female laborers. There are 3 1 labor gangs
engaged at the Parej East coal dump. Of these, seven are composed of PAPS. A committee
composed of local leaders from the villages supplying labor has devised a system for the
allocation of trucks to labor gangs. The committee has employed 35 supervisors (munshi) of
which 20 are from Parej village and 15 from Duru village, who is responsible for allocating the
trucks to labor gangs. These supervisors arepaid a daily wage of Rs 50 by the truck owners.
Under this system, trucks to be loaded are allocated on rotation to both PAP and non-PAP labor
gangs. 10% of all trucks arereserved for PAPS, and the PAP labor gangs participate in the
allocation of the balance on equal terms with non-PAP labor gangs. A labor gang earns Rs 1,400
per truck (about Rs 90 per laborer). Normally a labor gang will get to load only one truck in a
day. This is a year round activity, and the number of trucks to be loaded vary. During January
2002, a total of 193 trucks were loaded at the dump.

17.     In addition, the following project related employment opportunities have also occurred
during the project period:

        To accommodate the expansion of the Parej East mine, the road through the area is being
        diverted to near the Duru village. The work started in August 2001, and is expected
        completed in October 2002. The entire casual labor force of 40 laborers consists of
        PAPS, who receive the State of Jharkand minimum daily wage of Rs 58.

    0   Under the CSESMP, a domestic effluent treatment plant was constructed for the Parej
        East mine colony. The construction took about one year, and during this period 35 PAPS
        were employed as casual laborers. PAPS have also been engagedin plantation work
        undertaken in the Parej East mine.

    0   In addition, CCL has made an agreement with the contractors who execute civil works
        contracts for the mine to employ PAPS as casual laborers. Finally, PAPS are also
        engagedby CCL as casual laborers to assist the PAFs who arerelocating with the
        dismantling of their houses and salvaging of Suilding materials.

18.     Thus, project related casual labor opportunities exist, and have been capitalized on by
interested PAPS. CCL is not in a position to require the State Attthorities to withhold the
compensation money on the grounds that it should be released only for purchase of replacement
land or other productive investments Earlier suggestions made by the Bank to CCL to deposit
house compensation in a joint CCL account with the PAPS, to be released upon initiation OC


                                                  8

construction by the PAP were rejected on the grounds that this would infringe on the individual
rights of the PAPS and would be very difficult to manage. . However, the facilitating NGO,
which interacts with the PAPS on a regular basis, has been guiding the PAPS to use their
compensation for productive investments. The survey of PAP's income restoration efforts in
March, 2002 will review this issue in further detail and take appropriate measures, if necessary.

2.4           e 4:   e~l~c~rnen~ land and c~rn~~~~~~~o~~CASS writes that "wherens WB QD
        4.30 says `The Bank encourages landfor land approaches `, this land replacement option
        has not beenpursued, the amount for land compensation precludes buying replacement
         land, [and] many have gone and built houses on plots of land of their relatives, but have
        no supporting agricultural land'

19.      GIL's R&R Policy states that "PAPS will ident@+andpurchase land with assistancefiom
the subsidiary".   The PAPS were informed of this option when the R&R Policy was issued in
April 1994, but CCL has not received requests for such assistance. Compensation for affected
land is paid at its replacement value. To date, a total of 44 purchases of replacement land have
been made by PAFs comprising a total of 97 EPAPs. Not all PAFs are in a position to purchase
replacement land since not all PAFs owned agricultural land when they were displaced by land
acquisition. Such PAFs have only received compensation for their house and the land on which
this house was built. PAPS who opt for a site development grant of Rs 50,000 in lieu of a plot of
land, may choose to settle with relatives or explore other alternatives.

2.5     Issue 5: Self-employment     schemes: CASS writes that 66aftersuitable lapse of time"
                                                                         a
         self-employment schemes have failed to restore incomes. "The afforestation work that
         was offered was toofar away. Basket making is not sustainable because GIL rejects or
        does not pay for the baskets. There is a lot ofpressure on CCL from big contractors, in
         theface of which the products of the PAPS cannot compete, they cut in the Pnarketof
        favored clients"

20.     The implication of the above assertion is that the participants in the self-employment
schemes shouid have restored their incomes by now, aithough other parts of the suppiementary
list of questions recognize that income restoration is a long-term process. Income restoration

                                                  9

requires not only adequatetraining but also follow up support to enable the PAPS to use the
training received.

21.      Of the 240 EPAPs that have completed training in various skills between 1998 and
200 7, 89 are earning an income from the training received. As in the annual RAP for 2001, the
focus of the annual RAP for 2002 is therefore to provide follow-up assistance comprising
investment assistance,infrastructure, additional training, and assistancein establishing market
linkages for the EPAPs who have been trained, but who have not been able to establish an
income basedon the training received. A total of 60 EPAPs (26 males an 34 females) have
expressedan interest in receiving such follow-up assistance.

22.     Afforestation   work:  Following up on a suggestion by CASS, CCL organized a meeting
between CASS, EPAPs and XISS, the facilitating NGO in the areaon December 15, 1999. As
requested by CASS in this meeting, CCL changed their contract with the Forest Department to
provide for weekly payments for daily labor instead of the normal monthly payments (at the
State established minimum wage of Rs 58 per day). Although CCL invited CASS to facilitate
the involvement of the women's cooperative in the plantation work, they did not receive this
assistancefrom CASS. Since all planned plantation work on vacant land within the Parej East
leasehold had been completed in 199'7and 1998, the work offered by CCL was located in the
Tapin block, about 6 km from Parej East. Transport to this areais readily available at the cost of
Rs 2 each way on the numerous private vehicles plying in the area.

23.     Cane basket manufacture:       All 10,000 cane baskets for use in underground mining
stipulated in the original contract between CCL and the EPAPs in the Prem Nagar resettlement
site have been manufactured by the EPAPs, and they have received payment from CCL. A new
contract with the EPAPs to manufacture another 10,000 baskets is currently under preparation.
Under the first contract, about 10% of the baskets were rejected since they were either too small
or due to other quality problems. The materials in these baskets were reused in the manufacture
of new baskets that conformed to the quality requirements.

24.     Competition    from big contractors:   The relevant trade in this connection is the cane
basket making by the Turi Tola villagers in Prem Nagar, which has not in any way been curtailed
by competition from bigger contractors. The problems and delays that have affected the cane
basket manufacture stems from a variety of reasons,principal among which have been delays in
procuring quality cane from Assam, and irregular production by a section of the EPAPs. Some
EPAPs have also abandonedmanufacturing of baskets in favor of different types of casual labor
including coal loading.

2.6     Issue 6: Training for self-employment:      CASS writes that "no training facility/ center
        as such exists as CCL has institzlted in other mines (e.g, Ashoka Pro,`ect). Any such
        trainiEgprograms    have been of very short duration and havefailed to achieve the
        purpose of upgrading of skills for employment. The training programs have mostly not
        been linked to specific income restoration. Carpet weaving is being done by Muslim
        women"

25.     There is no training center for income generation for project affected people under
Ashoka, CCL. To conduct skills training in the 14 mines under CSESMP where self-
emploxymentoptions are offered to the EPAPs, CIL has chosen to focus on the delivery of
training through contracting external agencies rather than investing in the establishment and

                                                 10

operation of training centers. The types of skills training provided by the agencies selected, were
based on the initial market surveys and options selected by EPAPs. Thus, all training programs
have been linked to specific income generation options, and as the examples below demonstrate,
the duration of the training is related to the complexity of the skills to be imparted.

26.     Carpet weaving training has been open to all interested EPAPs. A total of 65 women
have received training in carpet weaving, and of these 30 are Muslim while 35 are Hindu or
tribal. Since the original market linkage through the Chotanagpur Craft Development Society
has proved problematic as the society has failed to provide quality raw materials on time and to
pay for finished products on a regular basis, CCL is now assisting the women to form a
cooperative. This cooperative will be associatedwith the Marketing Extension Service Center in
Ranchi. As carpet producers, they may then also be able to draw on the Tribal Cooperative
Development Corporation in Ranchi, which assistscooperatives that have been in operation for
at least a year, have savings of Rs. 5,000 and maintain proper accounts (see claim under Issue 6
regarding the Tribal Cooperative Development Corporation).

2.7     Issue 7: Subsistence allowance:       CASS statesthat GIL's R&R Policy "mentions a
        subsistence allowance BUT it is not known that any such subsistence allowaizce is being
        given to PAPS eligible for it; at a rate of Rs. 300per month (below thepoverty line) it
        fails to achieve any purpose ofprovicling subsistence assistance,.thepeople don `t seem to
        know about claiming it. "

27.     Paragraph 14 of GIL's R&R Policy refers to rehabilitation in the form of a subsistence
aliowance or lump sum grant for the purpose of productive investment (Package D). In order to
be eligible for Package D, the PAP must be an individual from whom land is acquired (this
includes tribals cultivating land under customary rights), the amount of land acquired must be
less than 2 acres,the PAP must not have income from other sourcesthat exceedsRs. 12,000 per
year, and none of the other options should be available to the PAP. GIL's R&R Policy does not
prescribe any specific amount for the subsistenceallowance.

28.     To date, no PAP has received a subsistenceallowance becausethe eligibility           criteria  have
not been met. GIL's R&R Policy, translated into the local language, is available to all PAPS at
the Public Information Center/CD R&R Office. It describes the eligibility criteria for receiving
the stbsistence ailowance.

         Issue 8: Vulnerable groups: CASS writes that "the people of Turi Tola are landless
         tribals, [and] had eviction notices registered against them. They still do not have their
         incomes restored to its former level"

29.      The eight households of the Turi Tola hamlet (who are not tribals but Scheduled Caste
people) were displaced by the TATA owned West Bokara mine bordering Parej East before the
start of the CSESMP. They settled as squatters inside the Parej East leasehold boundary, where
the advance of mining necessitatedtheir resettlement in May 1998. It has not been possible to
establish whether any eviction notices had been issued due to their squatting inside the Parej East
leasehold. In any case' when resettled, they were given the same entitlements to compensation
and rehabilitation as all other EPAPs in Parej East. One family' which lost agricultural land, also
received a mine job in lieu of compensation for the land lost in addition to the house
compensation. Following intermediation by CASS, the Turi Tola villagers selected the Prem
Nagar resettlement site as a preferred alternative to the Pindra site. A reputed community
development agency (CRADLE) was engagedby CCL to assist the Turi Tola PAPS to develop
the manufacture of cane baskets as an avenue for income restoration (seealso the response to
Issue 2.5 above).


2.9      Issue 9: Women:         CASS contends that although GIL's R&R Policy mentions that
          "Special attempts will be made to ensure that women will be given adequate access to
         income generating opportunities.. .,.no such preference has be given; apart from Bilaso
         Devi no women have been given employment; no specific income generating
         opportunities have been madefor women apart from piggery training and carpet
         weaving. "

30.      CCL's employment records indicate that 2 women who had lost 3 acres of non-irrigated
land or 2 acres of irrigated land received mine jobs, in accordance with the resettlement policy.

31.        RAPS have been prepared on an annual basis, each following consultations with PAPS
on the different self-employment opportunities available to them. An average of 388 PAPS have
been consulted individually each year, with an average of 105 PAPS opting for training
annually.3 In Parej East, a total of 147 women have completed training' of their own choice, in
pig raising, goat farming, poultry, leaf plate making, cane basket making, sewing, bee keeping,
and carpet weaving. Women account for 61% of those who have completed training to date. As
part of the 2002 RAP for Parej East, a total of 34 women who have completed training will
receive follow-up assistancewith increasing their incomes through exposure trips, linkages with
craft societies, enhancement of marketing skills, and seminars.

2.10     IssuelO: Health:        The information presented by CASS implies that `"thefollowing
         deaths of displacedpeople have occurred" as a result of relocation under the project' and
         cites Footnote 12 of the World Bank's OD 4.30 which notes that "Health care services
         may be important during and after relocation to prevent increases in morbidity.. .."




3        The number excludes PAPS who are already employed by CCL, West Bokaro Mine, and similar public
enterprises. In addition, this rmmber includes PAPs who were re-consulted after not opting for txaining in 1999.

32.       CASS states that a total of 21 people, who range in age from 2 months to 60 years, have
died since 1998 in Turi Tola, Borwa Tola, Sunugutu, Jogwa Tola, and Agaria Tola." CASS
intimates that the causesof death, including accidents, TB, malaria, and alcoholism are in some
way project related and would not otherwise be prevalent. As suggestedby health data from two
recent sources, the 1998-99 Bihar National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2)5 and The Myth of
the Healthy Tribal,6 published by Ranchi University, the health related issues raised by CASS
are a result of a variety of economic, political and social factors, which pre-date the project, and
have neither been causednor exacerbatedby the CSESMP.

33.       The general health status in India is disturbingly low, with low life-expectancy, high rates
of child and infant mortality, poor immunization coverage, and the prevalence of preventable
diseasessuch as tuberculosis and diarrhea, despite the availability of low cost treatments. In
terms of vaccine-preventable deaths and disabilities, India's share of total incidence is the
highest in the developing world. The Health Modernity Survey (HMS) identifies poverty,
illiteracy, ignorance, and government failure as the combined causeof low health status in India,
which is in turn, a major impediment to human capital development.

34.       In the NFHS-2, published by the International Institute for Population Sciences, a total of
1,642 households were surveyed in Jharkand, including the areasof Hazaribagh, Ranchi, and
Sigbhum.7 The results of the survey indicate that the rates of infant mortality and under-five
mortality in Jharkband are 71.1 and 96.3 per 1,000 births, respectively. The survey further
indicates that within the two weeks prior to the survey, a significant proportion of tribal children
under 3 had suffered from acute respiratory infection (24.9%), fever (31.4O/,),and diarrhea
(19.3%).

35.       A further discussion of tribal health status in the area from AK. Singh, et al. of Ranchi
University is given in an excerpt here:

          "PLEASE closeyour eyesandthink of anaveragetribal personin thenative habitat.The
          mental image,most likely, will be of a healthy,strong,carefreeman with a flute on his
          lips, andof a woman,with flowers in herhair, dancinghappily on the wild beatsof the
          drum. This stereotypeof atribal, held by most Indians, alas,is ahollow romantic myth.

          This myth hasbeenexposedby the grim factsof a Health Modernity Survey8sponsored
         by the Indian Council of Medical Researchin two rural blocks,Kanke andNamkum, of

East mine. The latest mine plans indicate that this village is unlikely to be displaced for another 12 to 15 years.

Chotanagpur, Bihar".   Ranchi University.    Report on the Indian Council of Medical Research Task Force Health
Modernity Education Project.
         The household response rate was 98.7%. The survey also interviewed 1,614 women members of these
8households, achieving a 95.4% response rate.
          "Health Modernity    has been defined as scientifically correct information, -_.
                                                                                       ~Wudes and behaviour in
relation to physical and mental health, family pianning and childcare, personai hygiene and environmental sanitation
and such other issues which are essential pre-requisites for healthy living and, therefore, for human and social
development.    A Health Modernity Scale, in the form of an interview-schedule,     was administered on 991 tribals
(male and female) in to rural blocks of Ranchi district in South Bihar. Their health status was also measured
through health indicators, such as living conditions and food habits, age at marriage of women, fertility and family

                                                             13

         Ranchi district in Chotanagpur     region of Bihar.. . . . .Contrary  to popular notion,  a large
         number   of the rural tribals are afflicted by illness and physical     disability."

36.      The results   of the Health Modernity Survey (HMS) of 991 tribal men and women, in
Ranchi district, provide for some means of general comparison with the tribal population under
the CSESMP." In terms of overall health status,the HMS concludes that the tribal population is
generally unhealthy, 29% of families reported illness at the time of the survey, less than 8% of
children received immunizations, two-thirds of the children under five were malnourished, and
the consumption of both tobacco and alcohol was high.

37.      In Parej East, there are five persons in the average family, while the tribal population
surveyed as part of the HMS noted the size of the average family was seven, living in only
approximately two rooms The two strongest correlates of health, illiteracy and poverty, are also
discussed in the HMS. The results of the survey indicate that the level of illiteracy among the
tribal population is 81%. In contrast, the baseline survey of 1994 indicates that the level of
illiteracy among the tribal population was a significantly lower at 41%. As there is also a strong
correlation between literacy and income, it should not be surprising that 87% of the tribals in the
HMS reported incomes of less than Rs. 400 per month, while only 21%" of the PAPS under the
CSESMP were below this level. Seethe responseto Issue 1 above for information regarding
income restoration among the tribal population in Parej East.

2.11     Issue 11: Tribal Communities:              Responsesareprovided below to each of the specific
         issues raised by CASS:

2.11.1 "The Banjari Puja Stan (sacred grove) of Borwo Tola has been destroyed, itspriest
         Kartik Pahan died not long after. The Manji than (sacredpuja place) of Borwo Tola has
         been destroyed. Demolition of thesesarnas is clear violation of the villagers fundamental
         right to practice religion under Article 25 of the Constitution of India "

38.      The Banjari Puja Stan was a tree worshipped by one family. According to CCL, its
sacred status was disputed by fellow villagers. An agreed compensation amount was paid to the
owner to cover the costs of re-establishing the altar and conducting the necessary rituals to
consecrate the new place of worship             The PAFs of Borwa Tola were resettled between
December 1999 and January 2000. According to CCL, Martik Pahan died at the age of 60 in
June 1999. At that time, no houses or any other property had been taken into possession and
demolished.

39.      The Manji than was a stone platform or altar on which Hindu rituals were conducted by
one family.    An agreed compensation amount was paid to the owner to cover the costs of re-
establishing the altar and conducting the necessaryrituals to consecratethe new place of
worship. Relocation of a tribal sarna or place for Hindupuja                 rituals can be undertaken if the
necessaryrituals are performed. In both of the instances mentioned by CASS, agreementswere



size, immunization  and malnutrition  in under-five children, and death and disabihties. The tribal community smdiec
pd very low health status and Health Modernity."     AK. Singh, et al. (1997)
         Tribals account for approximately 60% of the population in Ranchi District. A.K. Singh, et al. 2997.
10       This percentage inchtdes both tribal PAPSwith reported incomes of less than Rs. 400 per month and those
who did not report income in April 200 1, regardless of reason. Ifviewed     only in terms of the PAPSwho reported
income, only 3 earned less than Rs. 400 per month.

reached with the individuals owning the sacredplaces regarding the compensation costs required
to pay for the rituals associatedwith their relocation.

2.11.2 `"The resettlement site replacement worship places are replaced by other sacredplaces
        not of tribal tradition (Pindra)"

40.     This statement presumably refers to the shifting of a sauna (sacred grove) which was also
dealt with in the previous Management Responseof July 19,200l (para 89). The relocation of
this particular sarna to the Pindra resettlement site was planned under the annual RAP of 2001
based on an agreed amount of Rs 29,000 to cover the associated rituals. Subsequently, the PAPS
demanded an increased amount of Rs 40,000, which was agreed by CCL. In the meantime, the
resettlers in Pindra have established another sacred site and consecratedit with the appropriate
rituals. The PAPS in Pindra are of the opinion that the shifting of the sarna may bring
misfortune, and are therefore opposedto it being shifted. This is a dispute among tribals, which
will have to be settled among themselves. When the issue has been resolved, the CCL is
committed to pay the agreedcompensation to cover the rituals associatedwith the relocation of
the sarna.

2.11.3 `"The tribal graveyard of Parej has beensurrounded by high OB dumps, is inaccessible,
         and has had to be abandoned"

41.      The graveyard in question is bordered by the external overburden (OB) dump of Parej
East. The OB dump was established in 1995 before the start of the CSESMP, and is thus not
attributable to a project related impact. However, the layout of the OB dump, leaves a passageto
the graveyard as is indicated on the mine land use plan from 1994 (seeMap 2). No dumping has
been undertaken on this OB dump since 1998. The CSESMP team visited the graveyard on
February 8,2002, and established that it is accessible on foot along a path through the passage
indicated on the mine land use plan.

2.11.4 "The Co wants to build a bore wellfor the employees colony in Lupuntandi, which will
         affect the water level of tribal village"

42.      The "employees colony in Lupuntandi" refer t,othe colony which houses staff from the
mines of Parej East, Tapin North, and the Kedla Washery of Bokaro Coalfields on land acquired
in the nineteen eighties. A tube well to supplement the water supply for the colony was drilled in
mid 2000 inside the mine colony. The tube well has a depth of 100 meters and will yield about
3.5 liter per second when operational. Hydro-geological studies undertaken aspart of the
preparation for the establishment of the tube well do not indicate any adverse impacls on the
groundwater table of the surrounding villages, including Lupuntandi which is located about 1.5
km away from the well site.

43.      Near the tube well, and inside the mine colony, are five small fields on which viilagers
grow rain fed crops. The villagers c&iv&kg                these fields claim them as Ghair Mazurwa Khas
land (GMK),"      and since the claims have not been settled by District authorities, CCL has not
interfered with the continued cultivation of this land within the mine colony.            On April 10,2000,
CCL, requested the District authorities to clarify the ownership, but the matter is still pending;


II       Ghair Mazurwa Khas (GMK) land was previously held by large landowners (zamindars), but was afier
independence either transferred to the cultivators or to the state.

                                                           15

44.     The tube well, which is not funded under the CSESMP credit, will not have any negative
impact on the groundwater table of the surrounding villages. Moreover, there is no link between
the tube well and the land acquisition under CSESMP since the land for the colony was acquired
nearly twenty years ago.

2.11.5 "Sewagefrom the employees colony is discharged into thefields of Lupuntandi tribals"

45.     A domestic effluent treatment plant in the mine colony has been funded under the
CSESMP Credit. It was commissioned in December 2000 and serves 688 families in the colony.
The domestic effluent treatment plant replaced the previous disposal of sewage through badly
maintained septic tanks, and has thus removed the threat of pollution of the ground water table
that was posed by these septic tanks.

46.     The treated water from the domestic effluent treatment plant is released into a soak pit
lined with concrete and situated inside the mine colony. The CSESMP team observed limited
overflow from the soak pit into a small valley leading down to the Bokaro River. The three rain-
fed agricultural plots in this valley have the same unresolved ownership status as the fields near
the tube well discussed above. The water quality of the treated effluent water from the domestic
effluent treatment plant is monitored on a regular basis by CMPDI, and test results for BOD and
TSS for November and December are fully in compliance with the standards established by the
Government of India. l2 The Bank has recommended that arrangements should be made for
restricted use of the treated effluent water from domestic treatment plants.i3 Such use could
include irrigation of selected types of crops, and other vegetation. In the colony for Parej East,
Tapin North, and the Kedla Washery, it is planned to use treated effluent water from the
domestic effluent treatment plant in mobile water sprinklers for dust suppression on mine haul
roads.


2.11.6 "The IPDP program has provided mere marginal facilities such as unstuffed dispensary
         building, road (which mean little to people without vehicles), water tank, all of which are
        of no value face toface with the mining impact"

47.     The IPDP program, which covers 11 villages, is based on participatory planning of
annual implementation plans based on an open menu, where villagers can chose practically any
type of development activity they find relevant for their community.           No dispensary buildings
have been constructed under the IPDP program. Access roads were constructed or repaired in
ten villages. The reason stated by villagers for wanting roads to be constructed or repaired was
that this would facilitate the transport of seriously ill people to hospitals or clinics for treatment.
In addition, such roads provide accessto public transportation, Which in turn improves accessto
markets, labor opportunities, and public services. See Annex 1 for the IPDP activities
undertaken between 1998 and,2001.




I2      BGD for November 2001 is 7.2, and for December 2001 is 6. TSS is 44 for both November and December
2001. The permissible limit for BGD is 30, and for TSS it is 100.
13       See aide memoires from supervision mission from May 29 to June 15, 2001 (para 52), and from supervision
mission From November 27 to December 6, 2001 (para 51).

2.11.7 "Thepeople are not being shaftedas a unit. Some have gone to live in the colonies, some
        have gone off to live elsewhere"

48.     Where the PAFs select to stay is based on their own choice. The PAFs have a choice
between a plot in the Pindra resettlement site and a site development grant of Rs. 50,000 instead
of a plot in the resettlement site. This grant is in addition to the compensation for their house
plot. Thus, PAFs have the option to chose whether they want to move as a unit to the
resettlement site, move as a unit to a location elsewhere (as some have done), or settle
individually away from members of their old village.

2.11.8 "In the resettlement colony, tribals are living with others who dominate them socially and
        culturally"

49.     All the residents in the Pindra resettlement site are tribals from Borwa Tola, and all the
residents in Prem Nagar are scheduled caste from Turi Tola. There doesnot seem to be any
issue of social or cultural dominance by non-tribals in Pindra.

2.12    Issue 12: Land held under traditional          rights:  CASS writes that `"In Durukasmar
        village as well as other similar villages, compensation is being paid only for Raiyati land
        and notfor other lands such as the Ghar Mazarua land which are being tilled by the
        villagers since a number of years, and all theselands are ignored while providing for
        compensation. The PAPS have made innumerable attempts to have their traditional
        rights registered, but it was bureaucratic indtfference which prevented themfrom having
        it registered. Now there is consistent andfirm refusal to acknowledge their traditional
        rights. GOI says it is not their policy, but in other ways they adjust according to the WY3
        demands"

50.     GIL's R&R Policy states that "tribals cultivating land under traditional rights" should be
recognized as units of entitlement. Under Indian law, the PAPS must establish that they have a
valid claim to the land, before compensation is paid for such land. Claims to rights in land
cultivated under customary tenure are examined on a case-by-casebasis by the District
authorities. For recognized claims, the compensation amount is calculated in the same manner as
for tenancy land.i4 During 2000, the District authorities have in Parej East conducted field
camps to authenticate PAP claims to GMK land (Ghair Mazurva Khas) in the Parej and Duru
village areas. For Parej village, 8.17 ha out of 59.5 ha of GMK land has been authenticated in
favor of 11 PAPS, while 13 have had their claims rejected regarding 8.89 ha. Claims regarding
the balance of 42.44 ha are yet to be settled. For Duru village, authentication of claims regarding
107 ha have been completed by the state authorities, but a final settlement has been delayed by
the transition to the new state government.

51.     The CSESMP team has monitored the status of land authentication during every
supervision mission, and has repeatedly requested CCL to facilitate that the processing of these
claims is expedited.15 CCL has attempted this through repeated requests to the Jharkand state
authorities to expedite the verification of the claims. During previous visits to Parej East, the
supervision team has requested that *CCL and XISS assist PAPS in assembling evidence for their

claims, and that the decisions are ma.dein a transparent manner. l6 During the mission in
February 2002, the Bank received assurancesfrom CIL and CCL, that they would henceforth
assist PAPS claiming rights in GMK land to provide the necessary documentation for
authentication review by the state authorities.

2.13      Issue 13: Common property resources: CASS writes that `"The Base Line Economic
          Survey and the Impact Assessmentfails to mention (a) the right of commoners or the
          common property resources which are a vital source of income for the villagers andfor
          which no compensation s given, and (b) that the villages in Parej East are thus multiply
          affected by other surrounding mines, and whereas CCL claims it is only taking part of the
          village lands, the rest of the village lands is being taken by other mines"

52.       The census of PAPS, which comprises the baseline survey and impact assessmentin the
Resettlement Action Plan of 1994 does list "forest collection" and "forest products" as a source
of income for those EPAPs, who dependedon this for part of their livelihood.                      However, in.an
environment where the forest cover had already been depleted by decadesof mining predating
the start of the CSESMP, the collection of forest produce was only a supplementary activity to
the casual wage labor or agriculture, which constituted the primary sources of income for tribal
and non-tribal households alike. This is also reflected in the census and socioeconomic surveys
of PAPs.`7

53.       Selection of the resettlement sites to compensate loss of villages has been made in
consultation with the PAPS. The location of the main resettlement site - Pindra - is right next to
the main road through the area,on the slope of a valley with accessto both grazing and
collection of forest produce. The Prem Nagar site for the 8 PAFs from Turi Tola was selected in
direct consultation, and with the consent of the PAFs, and is located next to the Parej East mine
colony with immediate accessto a forest area. Thus, the choice of both resettlement sites does
addressthe issue of accessto common property resources such as forest and grazing land.

54.       During its visit to Parej East in early February 2002, the CSESMP team had discussions
with PAPS in Pindra and Prem Nagar regarding use of and accessto the nearby forest areas. In
both Pindra and Prem Nagar, people stated that they have accessto forest land for collection of
firewood and forest produce, and for grazing of domestic animals (mainly goats and pigs)
without any opposition from neighboring "host" communities.`*

55.       The CSESMP has been designed to mitigate impacts deriving from the investments in
specific mines under the CSRP. Mitigation of land acquisition impacts causedby non-Bank
funded investments in non-CSESMP mines arenot an obligation of the CSESMP. However, if a
PAP residing within the leasehold boundary of one of the CSESMP mines loses land to another
mine, this is considered a consolidated loss in terms of provision of mine jobs. In addition, all


i6        The facilitating NGO, XISS has assisted two EPAP brothers from Bcrwa Tola in obtaining a "succession
certificate" to prove that they were rightful inheritors of their father's claim to GMK land. See para 47 in
supervision mission aide memoire from mission February 28 to March 15, 2000.

1s        Firewood is collected primarily for use in the production of soft coke coal, which is the primary source of
domestic fuel, and which is also produced for sale. Other forest produce may include the mahua flower (nsed as an
ingredient in food preparation and for country liquor), bamboo shots (for domestic consumpCon or sale), rugra (a
fungus which is collected for sale), leafs for leaf plate manufacture, and aparticular root (gethi kanda) used as an
emergency food and as pig feed.

EPAPs residing within the leasehold boundary of a CSESMP mine are entitled to self-

located within a one kilometer radius around a CSESMP mine, but not affected by land
acquisition from this mine - are affected by land acquisition from a non-CSESMP mine, the
villagers can chose income generation activities to be part of the annual IPDPs.

                             sation for land: CASS writes that "compensation has beengiven
        only for Raiyati land and that not at replacement rates. In fact some of the villagers have
        already filed applications in the coal tribunal in the Civil Court Ranchi for enhancement
        of compensation as in many other villages higher compensation has beenpaid'

56.     The Management Response to the Inspection Panel dated July 19,2001, contains an
account of compensation for tenancy (Raiyati) land (para 62 to 66, and Annex 4), which
documents that land compensation is at replacement rates. As explained above under Issue 12,
the compensation amount for recognized claims to GMK land is calculated in the same manner
as for tenancy land. The CSESMP team is not aware of any information that would support the
argument that land compensation amounts have been higher in "other villages" . If more specific
information is made available, the team would review this during its next mission, and discuss it
with the project authorities.

57.     The fact that 43 caseshave been filed by PAPS with the Tribunal for an increase of land
compensation, and that the Tribunal has settled 16 casesin favor of the PAPS with an increase of
the awards, does not, by itself prove that the compensation amounts provided have been below
replacement value. What this does demonstrate, however, is that a functioning grievance redress
mechanism is in place, which does not discriminate against the PAPS.

2.15    Issue 15: Compensation for houses: CASS writes that "the fact is that the homestead
        compensation is being given at the depreciated value of the homestead, which
        compensation makes it impossible for the PAPS to build new houses with it. This is
        totally arbitra y since the houseswill be demolished and the villagers will be expected to
        construct houseswith the depleted construction value which is being provided"

58.     The compensation for houses is calculated on the basis of the current Schedule of Rates
for Chotanagpur Division from 2000. As shown in Annex 8 of the Management Response to the
Inspection Panel dated July 19, 2001, the value of the building is depreciated at 1.6% per year,
and a price escalation of 5% per year since the year of the Schedule of Rates is added. This price
escalation has been increased to 10% per year from January 1,200l.      If a house was constructed
prior to notification under the Coal Bearing Areas Act in 1983, an additional solatium of 30% is
added. The owner of a house is entitled to salvage whatever he or shemay want to use for
construction of a replacement house, and the mine assists in dismantling the old house and
transporting the salvaged materials to the new site. The valtte of the salvaged materials would
equal or exceed the depreciation deducted from the compensation payable.

2.16    Issue 16: Resettlement site housing: Responses are provided below to each of the
        specific issues raised by CASS:

2.16.1 "the allowedplot of land of 200 sq.m ,-makes second generation growth impossible, and
        this is much smaller than the houses thepeople already had and is afall in their standard
        of living"

                                                  19

59.     GIL's R&R Policy provides for a resettlement plot of 100 sq.m per family, and the plots
provided in Parej East are therefore twice the size prescribed in the policy. In the case of
extended families living together in one house, each married son will receive a separateplot. Of
the 16 PAFs residing in the Pindra resettlement site, 6 were married sons, who lived in joint
families before shifting and, therefore, received a separateplot.

60.     During its visit to Parej East in early February 2002, the CSESMP team made a
comparison between houses in the Pindra resettlement site and the house that the same PAF had
owned in Borwa Tola. The size (measured along the outer walls) of a small sample of randomly
chosen houses in the resettlement site was compared with information from the house
compensation assessment. In three out of four cases,the replacement house in the resettlement
site was found to be larger than the former house in the village of origin.`"            Moreover, houses in
the resettlement site are of better quality since they are constructed of bricks with mud mortar,
while houses in the original village had mud walls. In both locations, the houses had tile roofs.

216.2 "The smallplot of land makes vegetable garden and domestic animal rearing impossible,
        both of which have been an economic mainstay for thepeople in the old site"

61.     During its visit to Parej East in early February 2002, the CSESMP team found that five
PAFs had vegetable gardenson their plots in the Pindra resettlement site. Other PAFs had
chosen to use the space on the site not occupied by their house to produce soft coke coal.
Domestic animals were kept by most of the PAFs (12 families). The animals consisted mostly of
goats and pigs, and two families had cattle.

2.16.3 "As of the date of this submission, many PAPS are still residing in pathetic condition on a
        tempora y basis in the company quarters and barracks"

62.     There are sevenPAFs from Borwa Tola residing in barracks next to the Parej East mine
office, and five PAFs from Turi Tola residing in quarters normally used by mine workers in the
mine colony. All of thesePAFs have received plots in either the Pindra or the Prem Nagar
resettlement sites. At the time of resettlement, all requested temporary residence in quarters
provided by the mine until they had constructed houses on their plots in the resettlement sites.
None have constructed new houses, and all refuse to move out of their present habitations.
During its visit to Parej East in early February 2002, the CSESMP team learned, that the PAFs
living in barracks next to the Parej East mine office were not interested in shifting to the
resettlement site, since many male and female PAPS were now earning an income from different
forms of casual labor related to the mine and mine colony. One PAP had even built his own
house within the compound where the barracks were located.

2.16.4 "Rndra isfurther away from casual labor opportunities"

63.     The distance from the Pindra resett!ement site to casual labor opportunities such asthe
Parej East coal loading dump by the road from Charhi to Ghatto is roughly the same as was the
case with Borwa Tola, namely 1.5 to 2 km (seeMap 1).


19      Four houses were compared as follows:     (i) old house: 68.5 sq.m; new house 225 sq.m; (ii) old house: 25.6
sq.m; new house 35 sq.m; (iii) old house: 30.5 sq.m; new house 55 sq.m; (iv) old house: 71.3 sq.m; new house 50
sq.m.

2.16.5 "The Coal India Policy as implemented in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa have spectjied
         400 sq.m [for a plot in a resettlement site] as reported in the Staff Appraisal Report"

 64.     The Madhya Pradesh Package of 1991 and the Orissa Package of 1989 provided plots in
resettlement sites of 400 sq.m. Both were supersededby GIL's current R&R Policy of April,
 1994, which sets out to "`streamline the different resettlement and rehabilitation practices being
followed by the subsidiaries and to mod@ these in n way that allows subsidiaries to deal more
 effectively with resettlement and rehabilitation issues". However, as is the casewith the Parej
East mine, all other subsidiaries provide resettlement plots that are larger than the 100 sq.m.
 defined by the policy.2o

 2.17    Issue 17: Resettlement site land titles: CASS writes that `"the displacees are not being
         given legally recognized title to theplots. It is absolutely essentialfor an effective
         rehabilitation that legal ownership title beprovided to the villagers. The Co has taken
         the land lesefor 30 years [as per their agreement with the Government] and say they
         cannot give legal right, so what happens to thepeople after that? Pattas have beengiven
         which have no legal value, as tfto delude the PAPS"

   5.    A response was provided on this issue in para 57 of the Management Response to the
 Inspection Panel dated July 19,200l.         The provision of titles or long-term leasesto plots in
 resettlement sites was committed to by CIL and MoC during the CSRP negotiations in July 1997,
 and is recorded in the Minutes of Negotiation. Apatta format for long-term renewable leases
proposed by CIL was forwarded to MoC on March 30, 1999. The Law Ministry has
 communicated to CIL that the issuing ofpattas can be considered on a case-by-casebasis for
particular resettlement sites. Specific case applications have been submitted by CCL, NCL and
 SECL by May 2001 to the Law Ministry, but a response from the ministry is pending. Although
 this specific issue has not adversely affected the resettlement process, the Bank has raised this
 issue during every supervision mission with both the CIL and the Government of India. During
 the supervision mission in February 2002, the Ministry of Coal informed the CSESMP team, that
 it expects that a solution can be found and will follow up on the matter with the Law Ministry.

 2.18    Issue 18: Resettlement site services: Responses areprovided below to each of the
 specific issues raised by CASS:

 2.18.1 `"thefact is that while infrastructure facilities)         have been/are being taken up, there has
         been reftisal to undertake theproviding of servicesfor the same, and efforts, tfany to
         involve local governing bodies to provide such services have produced no results"

 66.     CIL has the position that while it should furnish the buildings for services such as schools
 and clinics in the resettlement sites, it is the responsibility of the concerned state authorities to
manage and fund the operation. At Pindra, a school building with five class rooms has been
 constructed, and CCL has repeatedly been requesting the state authorities to provide teachers,but
without result. More recently, CCL took action to arrangethat the school in Parej village be
 continued in the school building provided in the Pindra resettlement site, but at the insistence of


20       Plot sizes vary depending on the availability of land and the number of PAFs to be resettled. The largest
plots are provided in Belpahar, MCL, and are 400 sq.m, while Jagannath, MCL, provides plots of 200 sq.m. In the
SECL mines of Gevra and Dipka the plot sizes are 240 sq,m, and in Kusmnda they are 150 sq.m.

                                                          21

CASS; the school was instead shifted by the state authorities to Lower Rarisom village in March
2001.

67.     During its visit to Parej East in early February 2002, the CSESMP team visited the school
in Lower Barisom village, which has a predominantly tribal population of Santhals. The
headmistress informed the team, that the same four teacherswho taught when the school was in
Parej village are teaching at the new location. The school continues to have classes from first to
seventh grade. However, due to the fairly remote location of the school in Lower Barisom
village, school attendancehas dropped from the 350 pupils, who attended in Parej village, to 102
pupils. After establishing the school in this remote location, only four of the original pupils from
Parej village are now attending the school.

68.      Children from the Pindra resettlement site attend different schools in the vicinity of the
site. A total of 29 children (13 boys and 16 girls) from the Pindra resettlement site are enrolled
in four different schools.21

2.18.2 ""Thedisplacees, with the loss of their land and their customary rights to jungle and trees
         (Sec. 81(n) Chotanagpur TenancyAct 1908) lose their traditional source of domestic fuel
         and usufructs. Being given no legal right to coal supplies like the Company employees,
         they have to resort to illegal acquisition of coal supplies, which makes them vulnerable to
        police action, and in this wny the original inhabitants of the area become criminalized by
         the coming of the mining, This violates the principle of fformer standard of living n'

69.      The response above to Issue 13 regarding common property resources has clarified, that
the PAPS in both the Pindra and Prem Nagar resettlement sites have accessto forest land for
grazing, and for collection of firewood and various forest produce. The coal ration for CCL
workers is an employment entitlement, not a social welfare benefit. However, CCL has never
initiated any police action against the local population to prevent people from collecting coal for
domestic use or for small-scale commercial soft coke coal production. The manufacture, storage,
and transport of commercial soft coke coal by the villagers (including the PAPS) is done openly,
and is clearly visible to any visitor to the area. If this activity was subject to a substantial threat
of police action, one would expect that it would be conducted somewhat more clandestinely.

2.19     Issue 19: Potable water: CASS writes that "The Pindrapeople used the host
         community well, the 2 wells and one hand-pu.mpdo notprovidepotable                  water"

70.      In the Pindra resettlement site, the 16 PAPS have accessto one hand pump and three dug
wells. One of the dug wells is located right next to the resettlement site, and the PAPS have full
accessto use the well with the consent of the owner of the land on which the well is located.

71.      Water quality testing results from December 2001 show that the water in two of the dug
wells arewithin the limits set by the Bureau of Indian Standards,while one dug well has
Manganese above the limit (0.73 against a limit of 0.1). Water from this well is only used for
washing of utensils and bathing. The water from the hand pump has a high iron content, and is
therefore only used for washing of utensils and bathing.



21       These schools include the state government school in Tapin, the DAY school in Tapin, a private schooi,
and an English medium school operated by the Parej East mine.

72.     In the Prem Nagar resettlement site, the PAFs have accessto one dug well and a water
storage tank supplied from the mine colony. Water quality testing results from December 2001
show that the water in the dug well is within the limits set by the Bureau of Indian Standards.

        Issue 20: Participatory    planning:     Responsesare provided below to each of the specific
        issues raised by CASS:

2.20.1 "`thepeoples `participatory     committees are notfunctioning      as representative ofthe
        people, because democratic procedures have not been used in their selection"

73.     Selection of PAP representatives for the committees related to resettlement and
rehabilitation activities at Parej East is always done by the PAPS themselves. Village meetings
(Gram Sabha) are called, and the assembled villagers are requested to select their representatives
for the committees. At present there are 3 committees at Parej East dealing with resettlement
and rehabilitation. These are:

        0   A Coordination Committee with four PAP representatives. Two are STs (one of
            which is female), one is Muslim, and one is Scheduled Caste.
        o   A Monitoring Committee with three PAP representatives. Two are STs (one of which
            is female), one is Scheduled Caste.
        e   A Grievance Redress Committee with 11 PAP representatives. Of these, three are
             STs, three are Muslim, and five are SCs.

74.     Implementation of the annual IPDPs is based on participatory planning involving Village
Working Groups (VWGs) nominated by the villagers. The representation of different social
groups (STs, SCs etc) in the VWGs reflect the population composition of the IPDP villages (see
Annex 2 for details).

2.20.2 "when the people'of Borwo Tola were evicted, an armedpolice and security force of
        about 150persons werefound to be necessary"

75.     The resettlement of Borwa Tola has been the subject of a previous complaint by CASS
(letter of January 4, ZOOO),to which the Bank responded on February 8,200O after an
investigation in Parej East by the CSESMP team of the issues raised in the complaint. The
Bank's responseto CASS concluded that "the examination by the Bank of the circumstances
surrounding the relocation of the Borwa Tola villagers has notfound compelling evidence that
this event was carried out in contravention ofIndian law, GIL's corporate R&R Policy, or the
Bank's OD 4.30 on Involuntary resettlement." Further examination of the matter took place
during a supervision mission from February 28 to March 15,`2000, and the CSESMP team
concluded, that while the account submitted by CASS did not present a correct picture of the
events surrounding the relocation, there were nevertheless a number of measures that should be
taken by CCL to facilitate future relocation and which would help improve relations with the
PAPs.22 The CSESMP team conveyed their findings to CASS in a meeting on March 3,200O.

2.20.3 "thepeople have repeatedly again and again go to the PO ofjce (2-3 knzjfor any needs
        (water supply problems, employment problems, compensation problems, fuel problems),

          where they receive little attention. Requestsare commonly met by `not available at the
          moment, come another time"'

76.       Both the Project Officer (mine manager) and the CD/R&R officer are located in the same
compound next to each other, and both contest the allegation that they arenot available to the
PAPS when they visit their offices. Moreover, both the CD/R&R officer and the staff of the
facilitating NGO regularly visit the villages and the resettlement sites, and are on such occasions
approachedby the PAPS who have raised concerns. During its visit to Parej East in early
February 2002, the CSESMP team observed the CD/R&R officer and the staff of the facilitating
NGO interacting with the PAPS, and noted that they knew each PAP by name and were
conversant with their respective circumstances and problems.

220.4 "when people visit the Public Information Centre the register is not made available for
          recording their requests. Recording of information is not permitted'

77.       During its visit to Parej East in early February 2002, the CSESMP team examined the
Grievance Register, where 67 complaints were registered (17 by STs, 29 by SCs, and 21 by other
groups). Most of the complaints concerned the accuracy of house measurements, the valuation
of house compensation, drinking water supply, assistanceto shift salvaged house construction
materials, andjobs as compensation for loss of land.

78.       A visitors' register is maintained at the Public Information Center, which records 220
visits (69 by STs, 62 by SCs, and 89 by other groups). Most visitors request information on
valuation of their house and land compensation, income restoration options, and payment
arrangements and delays regarding IPDP activities. According to CCL, such information is
provided to the visitors based on the requestsreceived.

2.20.5 "The information provided [in the Public Information Center] is rather inadequate, many
          more documents should be available. (Detailed Project Report, Schedules ofproject
          affectedpersons containing theirfull assetsto be acquired in kind and number and actual
          compensation being given, detailed outlines of trainingprogrammes              and economic
          rehabilitation projects, cost benefit analysis of the project, quarterly and annual
          environment reports sent to the State Pollution Control Board, permission from the
          Central Government to mine in forest areas and the conditions under which the same has
          beengranted)"

79.       The following documents are available in the Center: (i) GIL's R&R Policf3;             (ii) a
printout of the databaseof EPAPs (which records assetsto be acquired); (iii) a list of PAFs; (iv)
the annual RAP and Income Restoration Plans (which include training plans and economic
rehabilitation measures); (v) the annual IPDPs; (vi) application form for income restoration
assistance;(vii) a specimen of a house compensation assessment;(viii) the EMP, (ix) the
grievance register; and (x) a register of visitors. The Staff Appraisal Report is available upon
request. The Bank would have no objection if CCL would make available the additional reports
being requestedby the EPAPs.

2.21    Issue 21: ~re~~~i~g the people for the mining:             CASS writes that "the fact is there is
        no such preparation to ease the transition. Even such basicpreparation as literacy
        projects have not been started among thepeople to be displaced'

80.     The facilitating NGO, XISS has since it was recruited in March 1997 undertaken the
following activities to prepare for the resettlement and economic rehabilitation of the PAPS:

        a    Rapport building through house-to-housevisits in Parej and Duru villages;
        @ Information campaign to inform the PAPS about GIL's R&R Policy through
             distribution of a Hindi version of the policy and small group meetings to explain the
             policy and rules regarding entitlements and compensation;
        a    Verification and updating in October 1997 of the 1994 census of PAPS. This also
             entailed visits to every PAP in the affected villages;
        0    Verification of PAPS claiming to have been left out when the census was updated in
             1997;
        0    Mobilization of EPAPs for self-employment training through information
             dissemination and meetings.

81.     While there have been no plans to provide adult literacy training to the PAPS, this activity
would have been positively considered, if it had ever been requestedby a group of PAPS.
However, this has not happened, and plans to conduct non-formal education under the IPDP
program in four villages during 2001 had to be abandoned due to lack of interest.24

2.22    Issue 22: Eligibility:     Responsesare provided below to eachof the specific issuesraised
        by CASS:

2.22.1 "there is no evidence of taking individuals as the unit of entitlement"

82.     Economic rehabilitation assistancethrough support for self-employment is an individual
entitlement that applies to all male and female PAPS who where 18 years or older at the time of
the verification and updating of the censusof PAPS in October 1997.

2.22.2 `"married women are not getting, widows are included with their sons"

83.     Compensation for lost assetsis paid to the owner whether male or female, and is not
distributed among the different family members. Where female headed households have lost
assetsto land acquisition, the compensation has been paid to the female household head. Thus,
16 widows have received compensation for houses.2'

2.22.3 "the age of 18years is taken as cut-off date as of1997, which means that youngfamilies
       formed a$er that date and before displacement either have no separate plot on which to
        build and live, or have-to live together with their kins on their plot.        This is violation of a
        basic human right and eligibility should befixed at the date ofPactual displacement"



24      The four villages for which non-formal education was plarxed under the annual iPDPs for 2001 were
Earison Lower, Barison Upper, Facodih (-4garia), and Ulhara Zamunia.
        The widows who have received house compensation comprise two from Turi Tola, ten from Borwa Tola,
two from Muslim Tola, and two from Sunu Ghutu.

                                                       25

84.     A cut-off date is required in all resettlement plans, and is normally determined by the date
of the census of PAPS and their losses. The updating in October 1997 of the 1994 census of
PAPS was done at the suggestion of the Bank. GIL's policy of providing separatehouse plots to
those above 18 years of age at the time of the 1997 cut-off date exceedsthe requirement of at
least restoring the standard of living of the PAPS. While the Bank has earlier suggestedthat a
new updating of the census should be considered, CIL insists that the 1997 cut-off date is
maintained.

85.     In nearly all mines under the CSESMP, including Parej East, the actual mine expansion
and the extent of land acquisition required for this expansion has turned out to be lower than
projected during project preparation. As a result, the actual number of PAPS affected during the
project period is lower than originally projected. The Bank has again suggestedan updating of
the census to assessthe actual number of PAPS that have been affected by land acquisition
during the project period (June 16, 1996 to June30,2002) against the caseload that was
estimated during project preparation on the basis of too optimistic mine expansion plans.


2.23    Issue 23: Identity cards: CASS maintains that "The ID cardsfail to mention junior
        family members who, on achieving majority age, will not begiven identity cards and
        hence their identity as members of displacedfamilies    can never be co@rmed.     They
        further fail to mention details of acquired land"

86.     The picture ID card was designed to provide an tool to enablea PAP to document his or
her identity as a PAP as well as his or her entitlement category under GIL's R&R Policy.
Information on other family members is not relevant for this purpose. Such information is
available in the census of PAPS, which lists all members of each PAF with their name and age at
the time the census was conducted.

87.     Each identity card lists on one side the identification number of the EPAP, his or her
name, father'shusband's name, caste, and village name. On the other side of the card is listed
the nature of loss caused by land acquisition (land, house, land & house), and whether the person

2.24    Issue 24: Environment:       CASS asks"where are the top soil dumps?"

88.     The location of the top soil dump is indicated on Map 2. Top soil recovered from the
northern edge of the quarry has been spreadon the southern end of the internal dump (back-filled
mine quarry) in July 2000. The layer of top soil on the areasthat arebeing excavated for mining
is quite thin, and the top soil is currently being spread immediately on back-filled internal
dumps.

2.25    Issue 25: Additional     Comments:     Responses are provided below to each of the specific
        issues raised by CASS. "These shortcoming in implementation stand in spite of the
       following    commitments to review: "

89.      Monthly environmental monitoring reports are submitted by the Central Mine Planning
and Design Institute (CMPDI) on air quality, water quality, and noise level. The monitoring
results are further reviewed on a quarterly basis by the supervision consultant, DCL, and by the
Bank during each supervision mission. The reports for the quarter ending September 30,200l
were reviewed by DCL in their report for the quarter ending December 31,200l.        Analysis of
drinking water samples indicated that there was no bacteria present and all other parameters were
in accordancewith IS 10500 standards. All 44 noise level reading taken during the quarter
ending September 30,200l were less than the prescribed limit values. Regarding air quality, 11
of the 114 air samples taken throughout CCL during the quarter ending September 30,200l had
higher than 200 pg/m3 SPM value. All three Bank assistedprojects in CCL were seento have
valid consent letters from the State Pollution Control Board during the visit of the supervision
consultant, and were seento have submitted the Environmental Management Plan compliance
letters to the regional office of the Ministry of Environment and Forests in time.

2.25.2 "Coal India has agreed to review with the Association, by June 30 1997, a program
         satisfactory to the Association, to strengthen its environmental management capacity and
         to implement theprogram over thefollowing 18 months. "

90.      The institutional strengthening plan to improve Coal India's environmental and social
mitigation capacity has experienced significant delays. The consultant hired to undertake the
study started work in February 2000, and the Bank attended a workshop with CIL that was
organized by the consultant in October, 2000 to discuss the draft final report. Based on the
recommendations of the study and after discussion with the Bank, CIL has developed an action
plan to strengthen its capacity on a company-wide level. The action plan is under
implementation, and further technical assistancehas beenprocured to develop implementation
manuals, training curricula, and conduct training of CIL staff. GIL's agreement with the Bank to
fund the activities in the action plan that will extend beyond the project closing date is a strong
indication of their commitment to the company wide implementation of the study's findings.

2.25.3 "`Implementation of this policy in the communities surrounding the 2.5selected mines
         would bepilot effort. It would allow Coal India to gain experience, in particular in the
         use of NGOs, with the implementation of this policy.    Coal India would be expectedto
         apply the lessons learned from this pilot effort in other communities. Coal India has
         agreed to review with the Association, by December 31, 1997, the lessons learnedfrom
         the implementation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans and the Indigenous Peoples
         Development Plans in the selected 25 mines. "

91.      Annual RAPS and IPDPs are prepared by CIL and reviewed and cleared by the Bank.
Lessons learned from eachprevious year of implementation are incorporated into the following
year's plans.

2.25.4 "Coal India has agreed to appoint a panel of social and environmental experts by
         October 31, 1996 that will monitor the implementation ofthe various action plans. "
                                                                   J

2.25.5 "Coal India has agreed to provide the Association with quarterly progress reports in a
        standardformat that would track thephysical implementation of the various project
        components,procurement and disbursement, These reports would also quantify and
        compare progress with agreedperformance indicators and highlight any emerging
        problems and constraints. Theprincipal aim ofthe quarterly reports is to provide the
        Association with a clear indication whether a spectjic mine is in full compliance with the
        agreed implementation ... ...In addition, coal India has agreed to prepare a Midterm
        Review ofproject progress not later than December 31, 1998. "

93.     Coal India has submitted quarterly progress reports to the Bank in every quarter. The
Midterm Review was carried out in February 1999.

225.6 a) "A main supervision mission annually...

        theperiodic review.. .the consultant team would visit each mine at least once during each
        quarter. "

94.     At the time the SAR was written, two supervision missions were planned each year, for a
total of 11 supervision missions by the project closing date. As Annex 2 of the Management
Response of July 19,2001, indicates, Bank supervision mission have been significantly more
frequent. At the time the Management Responsewas written, the Bank had carried out 21
supervision mission. Since that time, two addition supervision missions have been carried out by
the Bank, for a current total of 23 missions.

95.     Development Consultants Limited (DCL) in Kolkata was hired for the project monitoring
consultancy. DCL's core team consists of two PhD environmentalists, and two PhD social
scientists, who have made approximately 20 visits to each mine as a supplement to Bank
supervision missions. The details of their visits, through January 2001, are given in Annex 4 of
the Management Response of July 19,200l.

2.26    Issue 26: Roster of PAPS: As part of their second application to the Inspection Panel,
        CASS has submitted a list of PAPS , dated June 2001, with the heading:

                                          "Parej - Turi Tola
    Entitled Persons According to Coal India ClassiJcation Village: Parej; Tola: Sunughutu
         Category A(iii) Land i- Homestead        Category B(ii) Tribals on Forest Produce"


96.     Coal India's R&R Policy establishesthe categories of persons affected by the project in
Para 10 A and B. Category A(iii) includes land owners (including authenticated government
land) from who land and their homestead are acquired. Category B (ii) includes those who are
landless and tllose who are tribals dependent on forest produce. GIL's R&R Policy also includes
an entitlement framework which defines the types of compensation and entitlement options
available to each category of PAP.

97.     However, in assessingthe eligibility of the PAPS for whom C-ASSis claiming
entitlement, one must apply a fundamental aspect of the R&R Policy found in Para 10, which
statesthat, " ...adult individuals are the unit of entitlement. " The list submitted by CASS

                                                   28

indicates that there are 167 persons for whom they are claiming entitlements. However, 90 of
the individuals on that list are currently children, or were under the age of 18 at the cut off date
in 1997, and as they are not adults, they do not constitute an independent unit of entitlement.
Moreover, CASS has indicated that 24 of the remaining 77 persons on the list have relocated to
alternate sites, 2 have died, and 11 who were not included in any previously mentioned category
have a pension, a job with TISCO, or with CCL. After applying the criteria established in GIL's
   &R Policy to all 167 persons on the list submitted by CASS, only 40 could actually be entitled
to economic rehabilitation assistanceunder the CSESMP.

98.         The names of the 40 individuals, identified as eligible in the CASS list, were cross-
checked with the EPAP databaseand their statusis given in Annex 3. The results, combining the
information from CASS with the census data in the EPAP database,indicate that of these 40
individuals, 11 could not be definitively identified based on the name/spelling given by CASS.
Among the remaining 29 individuals (including those who also have family members employed
either by CCL or TISCO, and/or stated in the 2000 census that they were not interested in
training), 26 reported that they had some type of earned income, either to CASS or during the
census:
