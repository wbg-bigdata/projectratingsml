CHILE
SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SlllMARY
Borrower:    Republic of Chile (Ministry of Public Works)
Amount:      US$224 million equivalent.
Terms:       Repayable over 17  years,  including  5  years  of grace, at Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Executing
Agency:       Roads Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works (Vialidad).
Objectives:  The main  objective  of  the  proposed  project  is  to continue to
support the Government's careful financial management through
increasingly  efficient  execution  of   its  road  investment  and
maintenance program. A second objective is the eitablishment of an
effectively functioning road maintenance and pavement management
organization. Specifically, the proposed project would help the
Government to: (i) continue  to  strengthen the capability of MOP's
Roads Directorate through a more focused training program; (ii)
complete the effort to reach normal maintenance levels through a
distribution  of  funds   balanced   between  road  investment  and
maintenance; (i'i) reestablish a functional local road maintenance
system with improved technical execution; (iv) further improve
Vialidad's  competence   in   the   economic   evaluation  of  road
construction and maintenance activities; (v) resolve the major
traffic congestion problems through a select program of doubled
roadways; (vi) rehabilitate some of the main road bridges of the
country; and (vii) assist the Government in external resource
mobilization for guaranteed project implementation.
Description: The proposed project consists of Vialidad's 1990-93 four-year
program  of  road  expenditures,   including:  (i)  investmetit  for
construction, upgrading, and consultant services (39Z of base
costs); (ii) periodic, and routine maintenance, minor equipment
purchases, and consulting services for supervision, studies and
training (56?); and (iii) administration of Vialidad's increased
responsibility for maintenance and rehabilitation (5?).
Benefits:    Social benefits include  reductior  in  vehicle  operating costs by
increasing  the  transport  efficiency   of  roads  and  employment
generation, to which the Government attaches a high priority.
Further benefits would acc-ue to the economy through reduced _-ture
investments and rehabilitation needs.
Rate of
Return:      The internal rate of return is about 50 percent.
Risks:       There are few  inherent  risks  associated  with the im.plementation
capacity of the Roads Directorate, since it proved to be an
exemplary institution in this  reg%rd  under ongoing road projects;
moreover, counterpart funds have already been partially agreed as a
part of the Government's three-year rolling program.   Even from an
environmental point of view there is little risk as the program is
mainly for maintenance of  existing  roads.    The 156 km of double
direction highway will be built on already expropriated right of
way parallel to the existing road, hence little lasting social
impact. The main risk would arise from unforeseen circumstances
related to the change of Government after the presidential election
of December 1989, but the build-in annual reviaw of next year's
program shiould circumvent that problem.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01     The backbone of the entire Chilean transport system is Route Five,
a section of the Longitudinal  Road  that  runs from the Peruvian border iz
the north to Quellon on the island of Chiloe in the south. Between Iquique
and Puerto Montt, Route Five is paralleled by rail. The transport system
also consists of a rather dense string of ports, which can be used for
national and international shipping, as well as a series of airports for
local and  international  traffic.    Road  transport  represents about two
thirds of domestic freight, railways carry one-fifth; coastal shipping and
oil pipelines combined carry  about  one-tenth;   and air transport handles
less than 12. Some 95% of international trade in tons is sea-borne (some
90% of exports and about 80Z of imports by value). Passenger traffic is
mainly by bus, although there is some rail service.
(i)     Roads
1.02     The road network covers about  79,000  km, of which some 10,000 km
(about 13Z) are paved either wit'i cement concrete (3,470 km) or with
asphalt (Table 1.1). Because of the country's long and narrow shape, the
network is dominated by three major stretches of north-south road (almost
5,000 km in total): the Longitudinal Road, from the First to the Tenth
Region; the Austral Road, between Puerto Varas, north of Puerto Montt in
the Tenth Region and Villa O'Higgins (at the foot of the impenetrable
perma-frost area of the Eleventh Region); and road No. 9 from Paso Baguales
on the Argentine border north of Torres del Paine to Fuerte Bulnes, south
of Punta Arenas (Table 1.2).    The longitudinal road suffered from neglect
while  the  Santiago   subway   was   built   and  needed  almost  complete
reconstruction in the late seventies and throughout the eighties. This
mammoth job is now nearing completion.
1.03     Some 6,000 km of longitudinal and major transversal roads comprise
Chile's National Roads ("A" roads), which, with the Regional Roads ('B' and
"C' roads), constitute the Basic Network of some 23,000 km (Table 1.1 and
IBRD Map 21370).   The  country  also  has  some  56,000  km of Local Roads
(24,000 km of "D" roads and 32,000 km of "E" roads). The latter receive
only rudimentary maintenance.
1.04     Annual  average  daily  traffic  (AADT)  measured  at  major  toll
stations on the National Roads fluctuates between 2,000 and 9,000 vehicles
except in the extremities  of  the  country  (Table  1.3).   It grew yearly
between 2.42 and 18.3% in the 1978-88 period, except for declines by 3.4%,
112 and 3.8X, respectively, during the depression of 1982 and 1983 and in
1985. In the last two years, 1987 and 1988, annual traffic increase has
been above 13%. The share of passenger cars in traffic increased until it
reached 68% in 1983, whereas the share of trucks decreased. Since 1982 the
share of trucks, particularly with three or more axles, increased as a
result of the increased share of trucking and in spite of the growing size
of trucks (Table 1.3).



- 2 -
1.05     Road fuel prices are generally adequate in Chile, espt-.ally since
diesel taxes were increased during the implementation of the ongoing road
project (Loan 2584-CH). A US gallon of regular gasoline costs US$1.19 and
a gallon of diesel US$1.07 (Table 1.4). Fuel consumption by road vekicles
increased only at an average rate of 2.2% per year since 1970 after
registering an average decrease of 4.9Z in 1972-75 and in 1982-85 (Table
1.5).
1 36     The registered, motorized road-vehicle fleet, which increased very
rapidly in the late sixties and continued to increase through the
seventies, is now growing more  slowly.   It reached about 987,500 vehicles
in 1988, or about 79 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, versus about half that
many in 1976 (Table 1.6).
1.07     There are no fundamental deficiencies  in the current structure of
road user charges in Chile (Table 1.7).   Total revenues from taxes on road
transport are (over US$600 million equivalent per year in the 1980s)
between two and three times road expenditures (some US$225 million
equivalent per year) but there is some justifiable cross-subsidization
between private cars and trucks and the Government would like to improve
its already good system of road user charges to reflect significant changes
in prices and to use it as a means to decrease congestion and discourage
axle overload. (para 1.08). N1TT prepared an outline terms of reference for
a "Study to Update Road User Charges" which can be found in Annex 1. At
negotiations it was agreed that the National Energy Commission would manage
this study for Vialidad and the study would have to be completed by
September 30, 1990. New TOR will have to be agreed upon..
1.08     In  the  early  1980's  the   Government  of  Chile  introduced  a
sophisticated system of weighing-in-motion, that considerably reduced truck
overloading in the country to less than 0.5' of vehicles at fixed stations.
In certain forestry areas mobile scales detect up to 102 of violations of
the low, i1-ton axle load limit. The Government agreed in December 1988 to
study budgetary requirements to improve the enforcement of vehicle axle
load limits in these areas. Results of the study can be found in Annex 2.
At negotiations it was agreed that the problem can be tackled with
available resources and that the study results can be further implemented.
(ii) Railways
1.09     Although railways are a declining subsector, Chile has about 8,900
km of track providing service to the general public, of which about 4,340
km are broad 1.676 meter gauge (mainly the Railway south and west of
Santiago).   The rest,  mainly  in  the  north,  is narrow one meter gauge.
About 1,900 km are electrified in the south (including Santiago-Valparaiso
and part of Santiago-San Antonio) and about 700 km are continuous-welded
(3antiago to  the  south).    Commercial  goods  rail  traffic (including a
substantial amount of captive private mining traffic) decreased from about
18.5 million tons and an average distance of 123 km in 1980 to 16.9 million
tons over an average distance of about 152 km in i986 (2.6 versus 2.3
billion ton-km).
1.10     In   the   early   1970s,   the   Chilean  Railways--overdesigned,
overstaffed, and unable to eliminate uneconomic lines or to set adequate
rates--were  covering  less  than   half  their  total  expenditures,  with



-3
Government subsidies reaching over US$100 million in certain years. Since
then, the railways have taken a set of measures to improve their efficiency
and to eliminate deficits.   The successfully implemented measures include:
(i) phasing out some uneconomic nonproductiv? services; (ii) reduction of
the labor force and rationalization of its use (from 27,000 to 7,000);
(iii) technological improvements, mainly elimination of steam locomotion;
(iv) substantial tariff increases; and (v) introduction of some track
maintenance of the network and equipment by private contractors. The
amount and modality of the latter two measures would have to be reviewed,
however, to guarantee lasting effect.
1.11     The Government should continue  its  efforts  to  (i) create a new
"Sociedad Anonima" under CORFO (Corporacion de Fomento) to take over and
operate EFE's economic lines and services; (ii) divest uneconomic lines and
peripheral assets and pay EFE's debt and rehabilitation with some of the
proceeds; (iii) selectively increase tariffs and eliminate Government
tariff approval and replace  it  by  periodic monitoring and sanctioniusg if
necessary; (iv) sign a contract with EFE or CORFO and specify that if t_.e
Government would require EFE to perform unprofitable services; these
services will be paid for; and (v) drop or privatize services, such as most
operations in the North and suburban rail services, and review private
maintenance procedures on the basis of improved cost-accounting.
(iii) Seaports, Airports and Pipelines
1.12     Chile has mote than  10,000  km  of  coastline   with more than 70
cargo port installations. The ten major Chilean general cargo seaports are
state-owned and are run by the Empresa Portuaria de Chile (EMPORCHI); the
remainder are specialized (minerals and petroleum) and private general
cargo ports. The mix of public and private ports aims at encouraging port
efficiency through competition among ports, within ports, and among
terminal operators. A major attempt at defining port policy was first made
in 1981: (i) Law 18036 of September 1981 established norms for port
workers, abolishing the protected port workers register and introducing
three daily shifts of seven hours instead of the previous two eight-hour
shifts; (ii) Law 18042 of October 1981, which was intended to establish a
National Ports Corporation (CNP) for the purpose of transforming the ten
existing EMPORCHI ports into individual public companies (Sociedades
Anonimas)--the law also expressly ordered port authorities to leave the
handling, transportation and storage of goods to the private sector; and
(iii) Law 18040 of December 1981, modifying the Customs Ordinance to
simplify port  procedures.    As  a  result  of  the  changes, productivity
increased substantially, costs declined and congestion was eliminated, but
the transformation of the ten EMPORCHI ports into private companies was
..ever implemented.
1.13     Apart from earthquake  damage  reconstruction  and  repairs in San
Antonio and Valparaiso, future investments in Chilean ports will mainly be
for  the  changeover   to   new   methods   of   goods  handling,  such  as
containerization, which is proceeding at a rapid rate (some 900,000 tons in
1988 versus some 700,000  tons  in  1984).    Only the rapidly growing wood
exports from southern Chile may require new facilities.
1.14     Chile has an adequate network of airports, of which three are used
for  international  flights.    Major   expansion  plans  of  the  Santiago



- 4 -
International Airport, of dubious economic justification at this stage,
have been postponed and should not be undertaken until financing appears
attractive to the private sector.
1.15     The  Chilean  Government  gives  all  foreign  and  local shipping
companies access to Chilean ports.   The  country has a number of privately
owned oceangoing shipping companies and one state-owned company, EMPREMAR.
Government subsidies are limited to designated coastal routes.
1.16     Chile's 622-km network of pipelines, which extends from the Concon
refinery north of Valparaiso to Concepcion, belongs to the Sociedad
Nacional de Oleoductos (SONACOL), a recently privatized company, partially
owned by the Empresa Nacional de Petroleo (ENAP). The pipelines transport
mainly gasoline, diesel, snd liquified pet.oleum gas (LPG), but also many
other petroleum products in lesser quantities (some three million cubic
meters per month in total).
B. Institutional Framework
1.17     Transport policymaking in  Chile  is  officially  the  task of the
Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MTT); however, the Ministry
of Public Works (MOP) does road planning and was until port construction
was moved from DOP to EMPORCHI, in charge of all transport infrastructure
works (except urban streets). MOP also is responsible for collecting road
tolls and implementing the vehicle weight-limit program, the latter two
activities being closely coordinated with the Police Force (Carabineros).
The Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU) bears responsibility for the
urban road network everywhere but in a central section of the city of
Santiago. The National Planning Office (ODEPLAN) has published a broad,
non-quantitative, socioeconomic program for 1981-89 and updates a rolling
three-year plan every year.   It also determines whether proposed transport
investments are justified according to its guidelines, and whether they fit
into the broader planning framework.
1.18     MOP and  especially  the  Roads  Directorate  (Vialidad) underwent
considerable restructuring in the wake of the strongly market-oriented
transport strategy pursued by the Government. Policy changes included: (i)
liberalizing access to the road transport industry; (ii) eliminating as
much as possible transport sector subsidies; (iii) charging private air,
land, and sea transport for the use of public infrastructure facilities;
(iv) permitting each transport mode to set its own tariffs, design its
services, and develop its own poliLies; and (v) considering all transport
modes equal for purposes of  taxation.    The effect on Vialidad included a
substant'al reduction in staff and extensive contracting for services
formerly performed by force account.   Currently, all road construction and
most road maintenance are done by contract; also, while 8Z of Vialidad's
expenditures are for force-account works, even these are partly executed by
contract labor.
1.19     As supply of transport services  increased and prices decreased in
real terms, the Government realized some success in implementing its
,iverall  liberalization  strategy;       however,   the  efficiency  of  the
competitive system suffered because supply of services increased beyond
demand. Subsequently, the Bank was asked to assist in identifying the
major obstacles to a more efficient transport system. Two studies were



firnanced under Loan 2297-CH: one entitled "Institutional and Economic
Efficiency of the Chilean Transport System" (executed by consultants under
the direction of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean or ECLAC) and another entitled "Intermodal Transport Study of the
Corridor Santiago-ports of the Fifth Region" (executed by consultants). A
Bank review of the land transport issues confirmed tbe recommendation of
the consultants that there is a need for a better transport information
system. Traffic (or demand) projections also are required to ascertain
needed fleet, size, and type. To do this adequately, there is need for a
regular: (i) estimate of transport infrastructure demand and an analysis of
alternative supplies; (ii)  participation  of  private  sector in decisionE
affecting the sector; (iii) publication of information to promote market
transparency; (iv) monitorinIg of cost recovery system from transport
infrastructure; (v) routine review and update of regulations; and (vi)
assurance that proposed changes are disseminated effectively.
1.20     During  project   appraisal,   the   Minister   of  Transport  and
Telecommunications (KTT) asked the Bank for help in studying the modalities
of creating a Transport  Institute  which  would  have involved the private
sector in the publicaticn and study of transport data and eventually in the
study and implementation of sound transport policies in Chile and other
Latin American countries. The Bank agreed to finance such a study under
Loan 2297-CH; however during negotiations the Government proposed to limit
the scope of the study to determine the procedures involved in establishing
a  well-functioning  transport  information   system  for  the  purpose  of
publishing transport data on a regular basis.   TOR will be drawn up by the
MTT and agreed with the Bank and the National Statistical Institute.
Outline TOR can be found in Annex 3.
C. Experience with Previous Bank Lending
1.21     The Bank has assisted Chile  in  the  road  sector since 1961.  To
date five loans and a credit, totaling about US$359 million, plus a US$150
million guarantee for the outer years  of a private-sector B loan have been
granted.  Bank  operations  focused  on:  (i)  constructing, upgrading, and
rehabilitating some 3,000 km of roads, periodic maintenance for another
3,000 km, preparing feasibility and final engineering studies for more than
2,000 additional kn.; and (ii)  developing road maintenance capacity through
direct technical assistance as  well  as  provision  of funds for procuring
maintenance and road research equipment.
1.22      The objectives  of  the  first  two  projects--for  which Project
Completion Reports (PCRs) and Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) were
issued in 1979 and 1980, respectively--were not fully realized due to: (i)
the effects of major changes in the economic, political, and social
structure of the country; (ii) insufficient funds for recurrent road
expenditures; and (iii) rampant inflation.   The latest PPAR drew attention
to  the  need   for   selective   organization   strengthening,  which  was
subsequently addressed in the First and Second Highway Reconstruction
Projects.
1.23     With the First  Highway  Reconstruction  Project (Loan 1927-CH for
US$42 million in April 1981), a very constructive era in Bank relations
with Chile began. The main objective of the project was the reconstruction
of about 250 km of Route Five, mainly south of Santiago (IDB was



recon3tructing  another 500  km).    The  January  5, 1987 PCR stressed the
projezt's timely and cost  effective  execution  and commended Vialidad for
its management of the project and its development of modurn planning
methods. Compliance with the loan covenants concerning implementation of
axle load limit regulations and improvement of road mainitenance was
excellent. All planned weigh stations are in operation and axle load limit
violations have been reduced from about 102 of all trucks in 1982 to less
than 0.5Z fron 1985 on.   Several large private enterprises installad their
own weighing stations.
1.24     The Second Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 2297-CH for US$128
million in August 1983) was approved to help HOP to continue the
reconstruction of 435 km of Route Five, north of Santiago, and the
reconstruction and widening of about 411 km of main transversal roads. It
also helped MOP to start a major road maintenance effort of the Basic
Network by financing regravelling, surface dressing and overlays of about
1,400 km of major roads; construction and rehabilitation of some 100
bridges (including 60 km of access roads); and acquisition of road
maintenance equipment.
1.25     Lower than expected project costs  occurred due to the competitive
construction market and the strength of the US dollar in relation to the
Chilean peso. This permitted the Bank in 1984 and 1985 to expand loan
financing to two emergency programs.    The first financed a US$5.6-million
reconstruction program of roads damaged by the 1984 floods. The second
financed repair and reconstruction programs for infrastructure damaged or
destroyed by the March 5, 1985 earthquake. This included a US$12.2 million
program for roads and bridges and a US$15.5 million program for emergency
civil works, equipment procurement, and studies related to repair and
reconstruction of the ports of Valparaiso and San Antonio, as well as
rehabilitation of diesel locomotives for the State Railway and EMPORCHI,
the Port Authority. Scarcity of counterpart funds during the years 1984
through 1986 and the execution of the additional works have delayed project
completion by more than a year to December 31, 1989. By June 30, 1989
disbursements had reached 972 and the loan was fully committed. Quality of
works has been excellent, and the revised implementation schedules and
original loan covenants have been complied with fully.
1.26     The First Road Sector Project  Loan  2589-CH for US$140 milliLn in
October 1985, accompanied by a US$300 million private banks B-loan, of
which the Bank guaranteed the outet. US$150 million) partially financed
MOP's 1986-89 Roads Investment and Maintenance Programs, including: (i)
construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation and upgrading of roads and
bridges; (ii) routine, periodic, and deferred maintenance of the basic and
local road netwc ks; and (iii) technical assistance for coordination of the
project, feasibility, engineering and special studies; works supervision;
and training. The remainder of the program was financed by IDB, supplier
credits and the Government.
1.27     Under  this  project,  Vialidad  fundamentally  strengtnened  road
maintenance administration and implementation capacity at its headquarters
and in the regions.   It  also  increased  the  size of the maintained road
network from some 23,000 km to 47,000 km and is strengthening, in
collaboration with the municipalities, the maintenance of the remaining
32,000 km (Table 1.1). The maintenance budget was increased from less than



US$48 million in 1985 to more than US$113 million in 1988 (Table 1.8).
Vialidad complied with agreed targets for routine and periodic maintenance
and has established a well functioning informati-n and cost-accounting
system comprising all cost factors, including equipment ownership costs.
lt also has carried out a detailed survey of road network conditions using
the sophisticated deflection and roughness measurement equipment procured
under Loan 2297-CH. This effort, coupled with the pavement monitoring and
management study, has provided an excellent base for establishing a
Pavement  Management  System.    The  training  component  has  been highly
successful, even exceeding agreed targets. By June 30, 1989 disbursements
reached 88Z, with expectation that the project will be substantially
completed on schedule by December 31, 1989.
D. Issues in the Road Sector
1.28     The issues this project addresses  are:  (i) the necessary further
steps toward effectively functioning modern road maintenance and pavement
management organization with  adequate  technical  execution capacity; (ii)
the assurance of adequate budget to execute the maintenance and management
task on the whole network and of a balance between maintenance and
investment in that budget; and (iii) the elimination of seasonal traffic
congestion, particularly that which hampers efficient production and
evacuation of crops and products. There are no other major issues. Chile
has met major policy and project-related conditions under previous projects
or during preparation of the proposed project. Bidding documents used in
previous loans have been revised to conform to updated Bank Guidelines.
(i) Road Maintenance and Pavement Management Organization
1.29     Under previous projects Chile  has been successful in establishing
an effectively functioning modern  road maintenance and pavement management
organization with an adequate technical execution capacity; however,
further effort is necessary. In particular: (i, the training program needs
to be further improved and expanded and directed to better technical
execution of road maintenance tasks and workshop activities; and (ii) the
planning staff need to be better prepared to establish priorities and
supervise ongoing works. The latter may involve equipping regional staff
with adequate mini-computers to carry out the economic and pavement
analysis in the regiona. At the insistence of the Ministry of Finance the
training  program   was   thoroughly   reviewed   before  negotiations  and
streamlined wherever possible without eliminating essential elements. At
negotiations it was agreed to carry out under the project a single study,
managed by ODEPLAN, on the past experience with training and on the
implementation of the agreed upon 1990-93 training program. It was also
agreed that the post-evaluation of this program could be financed under
possible future projects.    Annex  4  of  this  report  details the agreed
training program 1990-93 (para 3.01).
(ii) Adequate and Balanced Budget for Whole Network
(a) Adequate BuAget
1.30     The lasting impact of  the  major  efforts the Government of Chile
has made under past projects--(i) to gradually assure an adequate budget to
execute the road maintenance and pavement management task on the whole road



- 8 -
network and (ii) achieve a balance between maintenance and investment in
that budget--will depend on the conviction of decisionmakers at all levels
in Vialidad that the procedures used to establish budget priorities--
nationally and within the ministry and the directorate--are sound and the
best currently available. Based on past rudimentary analysis and confirmed
now with the HDM  analysis  for  this  projecL,  the current overall budget
constraints, imposed by circumstances and IMF conditionality, do not allow
the Government to maintain the  network  optimally.  Priority therefore has
been Aiven to preserving the (highly capital intensive) main paved network.
The Gcvernment also has agreed to let the budget of Vialidad grow more
rapidly than average towards the optimal  level.   An annual budget of some
US$300 million in constant 1988 dollars net of debt service should remain
Vialidad's target. Given the known constraints and the known priorities,
the Government has committed itself to a budget of almost US$230 million
for Vialidad by 1996 (Table 1.10). Priorities therefore should constantly
be reviewed to ensure that any circumstances that would allow increased
budget allocations for roads are not passed up.
(b) Balance between Maintenance and Investment
1.31     Road investment and to a  lesser  degree road  maintenance efforts
in constant terms declined temporarily from the levels reached in 1982
mainly because of country economic problems, declining goods traffic, and
rapid devaluation of the peso relative to the dollar. However, since 1986
maintenance expenditures   have  substantially  increased  (Table 1.8).  Of
average annual expenditures in the sector, US$51 million was spent for road
maintenance between 1982 and 1985 compared to US$96 million in 1986-88, or
26Z versus 541, respectively.   Over the four-year implementation period of
the ongoing First Road Sector Project (1986-89), this average is expected
to reach US$100 million or 56% of total expenditures, US$114 million (56Z)
over 1990-93 (the proposed project), and US$127 million on average (56Z)
betNween 1994 and 1997 (Table 1.9).   The latter figures remain low and will
be reviewed with the next  administration.   To prevent the reappearance of
the former bias toward new construction at the expense of maintenance and
rehabilitation, agreement was reached on the size and composition of the
10-year (1988-97) roads program (Table 1.10).
(iii, Seasonal Congestion on the Road Network
1.32     Chile's economy  depends  on  efficient  export  of  its products,
particularly copper,  wood  and  fruit.    The  perishable  nature of fruit
requires that road quality be good and that reasonable speeds can be
achieved to minimize damage and to maintain the cold chain needed to get
the fruit to the market.   Grapes  often  ripen only in late March and must
leave Chile no later than April 5 to reach the major US market before it is
closed to Chilean grape imports (arcund April 20). Though there remains a
shortage of funds for road maintenance, a carefully selected program of 156
km of doubled basic network roadways has therefore been included in the
project (paras. 2.36-7); IDB is financing a program to improve particularly
productive  secondary  roads--and   has   already  financed  roadways  that
circumvent congested cities.



II. THE PROJECT
A.       Project Origin
2.01     During transport  sector  work  and  the  appraisal  of an ongoing
highway reconstruction project (Loan 2297-CH of 1983), the Bank identified
several major issuer, including the need for execution of maintenance on
the  basic  road  network  by   private  coitractors  and  the  uncertainty
surrounding the intended execution and financing of local road maintenance
by the municipalities. A study was subsequently commissioned to prepare a
plan of action and to find adequate financing to maintain both these
networks. The Government and MOP concluded that the municipalities did not
have equipment, personnel, or funds to perform adequate maintenance of
local roads, nor would they soon be able to acquire the necessary means and
consequently, Vialidad's efforts should not only be directed at proper
maintenance of the basic network, but also at finding ways to maintain the
local network  better.    Adequate  maintenance  of  the  basic network was
addressed under the Second Highway Reconstruction Project and under the
First Road Sector Project.
2.02     To address the local network problem, Vialidad started in mid-1983
a pilot rural road maintenance program in three southern provinces to
determine  the  extent  of   possible   voluntary  contributions  from  the
municipalities for the execution of  these  programs.  Based on the resultq
of the pilot program, and in agreement with the Ministries of Interior and
Finance, Vialidad has now assumed full responsibility for most of the road
network.    The  municipalities  still  are  expected  to  collaborate with
Vialidad on easily accessible roads of mainly local use. As a first step,
under Loan 2589-CH, Vialidad prepared a program for the rehabilitation and
maintenance of the Primary Local Network (24,000 km), including a lump sum
of money for spot repairs on the remaining, infrequently traveled, 32,000
km of local network (Secondary Local Network), especially when traffic
flows become seriously impeded.
2.03     In December 1986, Vialidad presented a program for the maintenance
of the Secondary Rural Road Network.    The main objective was to achieve a
minimal  maintenance  level  of   this  network,  consisting  basically  of
reshaping the gravel road surfaces once a year with a motor grader and
cleaning the shoulders and ditches to permit normal transit when dry.
Implementation has been satisfactory to date with joint financing by
selected municipalities at US$2.6 million per year. Vialidad would further
expand this program under  the  proposed  project.    Under the IDB program
3,900  km  of  paved  and  8,000   km  of  unpaved  feeder  roads  will  be
rehabilitated and/or upgraded.
B. Project Rationale
2.04     The proposed Second Road Sector Project is an integral part of the
Bank's macroeconomic and sectoral assistance strategy for Chile, which
includes optimization of expenditures in infrastructure maintenance and
rehabilitation. It is in line with the Government's stated overall policy
objective of increased efficiency in the delivery of public services.
Despite large and efficiently made annual expenditures, the national road
network is still not optimally maintained and large amounts of potential
benefits remain uncaptured, particularly on the local road network.



- 10 -
Although MOP has made an incredible effort to implement an efficient
program with very limited resources, it now looks to the Bank for further
help in improving the efficiency and size of its program. The Bank has
been a motivator for modernization and rationalization for an already very
competent  group  of  professionals.        The  Bank's  Highway  Design  and
Maintenance Standards Model (HDM Model) has been a catalyst around which
Vialidad's modernization efforts have been deployed. It has made Vialidad
aware of what is happening elsewhere in the world and given its staff ar.
incentive to mike a better contribution to the road network of the country
and to the pr.fession worldwide.   In cooperation with the Bank, contractor
executed maintenance and the rules and procedures of contracting have been
improved. (Road pavement research has been strengthened and given special
direction because of the HDM and pavement management framework.) The Bank
will continue to play an important role while gains are being consolidated
and until sufficient budgetary allocations have been achieved to capture
most of the potential benefits for road users, even on the local network.
Whereas Chile's Planning Office has been able to achieve project analysis
on a case-by- case basis, it lacks optimization calculations for the
program as a whole, which is now starting to spill over from Vialidad to
ODEPLAN via the Bank's HDM model divulgement effort, supported by the
project.
C. Project Objectives
2.05     The main objective  of  the  preposed  project  is  to continue to
support the Government's careful financial m9nagement through increasingly
efficient execution of its road investment and maintenance program. A
second objective is the establishment of an effectively functioning road
maintenance  and  pavement  management  organization.    Specifically,  the
proposed project would help the Government to: (i) continue to strengthen
the capability of MOP's Roads Directorate through a more focused training
program; (ii) complete the effort to reach normal maintenance levels
through a distribution of funds balanced between road investment and
maintenance; (iii) reestablish a functional local road maintenance system
with improved technical execution; (iv) further improve the Directorate's
and ODEPLAN's competence in the economic evaluation of road construction
and maintenance activities; (v) resolve the major traffic congestion
problems through a select program of dual carriageways; (vi) rehabilitate
the main road bridges of the country; and (vii) assist the Government in
external resource mobilization for guaranteed project implementation.
D. Project Scope and Description
2.06     The  project  comprises  Vialidad's  1990-93  Road  Investment and
Maintenance Program (Tables  1.10  and  2.1).    The  rationale for a four,
rather than a three year program, is  that   (i) a four year revolving span
is the period successfully used so far by Vialidad for the medium range
planning of operations and budgeting, (ii) the 156 km four lane program
will have a four-year implementation period, bccause of some important
bridges to be constructed, and (iii) there is a precedent, the program of
the first sector project was turned, after appraisal, from a three to a
four year program, which will be successfully completed in four years (less
than average disbursement periods for loans in the region according to the
Bank's  disbursement  curve).       The   program  comprises  components  for
investments and maintenance as well as administration, although part of
administration  is  now  incorporated   in   the  consulting  and  training



- 11 -
activities. A nominal amount for equipment purchases appears under the
maintenance component.
(a) Investment
2.07     The investment components  (39Z  of  base cost) include conslltant
services  and  civil  works  (construction  and  upgrading).   Construction
consists of execution of some 156 km of two extra lanes to double existing
roadways in designated heavily-traveled road sections (Table 2.2 part A and
IBRD maps 21371-21373), replacement or reconstruction of thirteen major
bridges, all over 40 years old, (Table 2.2 part B). constructing of
bypasses and urban overpasses in major cities, and completion of the
Austral Road program (financed by IDB). Upgrading consists of a program of
paving primary gravel roads over which travel more than 300 vehicles per
day (also financed by IDB, para 2.17).
(b) Maintenance
2.08     The maintenance components (562 of  base cost) include civil works
for periodic and routine maintenance, nominal equipment purchases, and
consultant services and training.
2.09     The  periodic  maintenance  component  (392  of  base  cost) would
include: (i) resealing of surface treatments or overlays of both roadways
and shoulders; (ii) regravelling and paving of unpaved surfaces; and
(iii) repair of drainage and river-training structures, including bridges.
In the past most surface treatment and overlay operations were handled
under deferred maintenance. Under the proposed project, however, they will
be integrated into the periodic maintenance program.
2.10     Routine maintenance  (15%  of  base  cost)  of  the  Basic Network
(22,965 km) and of the  Primary  Local  Network  (24,227 km)  incluJes more
than 40 well defined maintenance activities, the most important ones being:
(i) patching and sealing joints and cracks on roads paved with cement
concrete or bituminous concrete; (ii) grading and spot regraveling of
unpaved roads; (iii) clearing and maintenance of drainage ditches and their
structures; (iv) maintenance of bridges and river-training structures; (e)
maintenance of road signs and markings, tunnels, weighing and toll
stations; and (f) snow removal on specific mountain roads. The routine
maintenance responsibilities for the remaining 31,939 km of the network
(Secondary  Local   Network)   will   be   shared   by   Vialidad  and  the
municipalities.
2.11     Given the increased reliance on contracting for maintenance works,
the equipment component (0.2X of base cost) would include only nominal
re:placement of road maintenance equipment, since under two ongoing road
projects Vialidad has already modernized its equipment fleet.
2.12     The consulting components of investment and maintenance (less than
32 of base cost) comprise about 12,800 man-months of professional services
for: (i) engineering, coordination and supervision of major civil works for
the proposed prosJct and feasibility and engineering studies to prepare a
possible future project; (ii) economic studies related to the transport
sector; (iii) training; and (iv) continuation of long-range pavement
evaluation and design studies begun under the Second Highway Reconstruction
Project (Loan  2297-CH)  and  a  'tudy  to  adopt  HDM-PC  to hand2e cement
concrete roads (Table 2.3).



- 12 -
2.13     The training component  (less  than  0.1%  of  base cost) has been
formulated to overcome the problems described in paragraph 1.29 above. It
will consist of the implementation of a series of coordinated measures to
continue upgrading the maintenance capability of Vialidad, inclu-ding: (i)
training of about 3,385 professionals, technicians and administrative
eir.oloyees, emphasizing management training in planning, organization and
implementation of the road maintenance  system  in a cost effective manner;
(ii)  improving  the  quality   of   the  training  offered  for  managers,
professionals,  skilled  workers,   foremen  and  administrative  personnel
through upgrading 40 instructors, providing 19 staff-months of foreign and
local consultant services in specific technical subjects, study visits
abroad for 45 Vialidad managers and professionals, upgrading teaching
materials and implementing evaluations and cost-benefit studies; (iii)
developing a policy framework for and institutionalizing the coordination
of training activities. Details of the training program are presented in
Annex 4.
(c) Administration
2.14     Administrative expenditures (less  than  5%  of  base cost) comprise
wages  and  salaries  of   Vialidad   personnel  working  on  investment  and
maintenance  as  well  as  other  overhead  expenditures  for  materials  and
services. They do not include direct expenditures for consultants, which are
distributed among investments and maintenance expenditures.
E. Project Cost
2.15     The total project cost, including  (some US$180 million) (about 202)
for identifiable taxes and duties , and some US$90 million in price
contingencies, amounts to US$907 million with a total foreign exchange
component (FEC) of some US$509 million (56%). Price contingencies have been
determined on the basis of estimated price increases of 3% for 1989 and 1990,
and 42 for 1991-93, similar to those for Loans 3028-CH and 3030-CH. The
project cost summary is shown below and in Tables 1.10 and 2.1.
2.16     The cost  estimates  for  investment  in  civil  works  are based on
quantity estimates and current unit prices, and are considered reasonable
under the standards proposed and the expected traffic. The civil works cost
estimates related to maintenance are based on MOP cost accounting (for
operations by force account) and by contract in the regions. The cost for
services is based oti MOP experience in contracting for engineering and
supervision services in similar programs. The cost of the training component
was estimated by detailed costing of all elements (Annex 4, Table 1).
Detailed estimates of the cost of doubled roadways and bridges and consulting
services can be found in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. To estimate the FEC of civil
works, MOP has developed a computer program that establishes the FEC for each
construction  or  maintenance  item  and   calculates  the  FEC  for  typical
operations or  programs.    The  FEC  for  consulting  services was estimated
assuming that contracts would normally be awarded to local firms, with a
limited participation of foreign consultants. For goods to be procured under
the program, the FEC has been estimated at 73%, based on the CIF prices at
port of entry into Chile and payment by MOP of 152 import duties, 2Z customs
clearance and port costs, and 16% sales tax. Because of the sectoral nature,
as well as the four-year length of the program, no physical contingencies
have been provided.

F. Financing Plan
2.17     The project will be financed  by  the Government in cooperation with
the Bank, IDB,  and  the  Export  Import  Bank  of  Japan  whose untied joint
financing of the program has been requested and appraised. The Bank would be
financing 25Z of the project cost and IDB 92 (US$85 million). EximBank of
Japan would be expected to finance jointly 177 (US$150 million) and the
Government of Chile the remainder, including US$50 million of foreign
exchange (see summary below and  p.  iv).   The Bank's Procurement Guidelines
would be expected to apply to all joint financing.

G. Organization and Execution
2.18     Execution of the  project  would  be  the  responsibility of MOP's
Roads Directorate (Vialidad). MOP and Vialidad's organizational charts are
attached (Charts 1 and 2).    Vialidad comprises mainly the Departments for
Studies,  Construction,   Bridges,   Urban   Roads,   Training  Structures,
Laboratory,   Maintenance   Operations,    and    Administration.         This
organizational structure is adequate for the execution of the project
(Annex 5).
2.19     Vialidad has a central and regional staff of about 4,000, of which
some 150 are engineers and an additional 50 other types of professionals.
Government policy has been to keep Vialidad's staff small, to execute the
majority of work by contract, and to hire consultants or (temporary)
contract workers to handle work overflows, hence the use of large amounts
of local consultants at very low cost (Table 2.3).
2.20     Execution of the maintenance elements  of the project would be the
responsibility of the Maintenance Department, which was reorganized and
strengthened  under  the  First  Road   Sector  Loan  (Loan  2589-CH),  and
particularly   its   Execution   subdepartment,   which   has  successfully
implemented Loan 2589-CH. Actual execution of the maintenance works would
be the responsibility of Vialidad's 13 regional offices, closely monitored
by the Maintenance Department, which  would centralize project accounts and
financial  control.    Execution  of  the  doubled  highways  would  be the
responsibility of the Project Unit within the Construction Department,
which has successfully implemented Loans 1927-CH and 2297-CH.
2.21     The  detailed  1990  program  was  officially  agreed  upon during
negotiations.  The  detailed  program  for  each  successive  year would be
developed by the Government in accordance with agreed procedures and
adjusted annually on the basis of current information, results of research
and road condition measurements, and experience gained by executing the
previous year's program. (Annex 6).
2.22     Summary information on  the  technical  and economic evaluation of
major subprojects included in the investment and maintenance program will
be prepared by Vialidad  following  guidelines  prepared by ODEPLAN and the
Bank. The summary forms contain information on the rationale for the
proposed works, definition of the design standards, the alternatives
considered, the costs, and the results of the economic evaluation. This
information will be reviewed by the Bank in the course of the semi-annual
review meetings (para. 2.35).
H.       Procurement
2.23     The  following  table  summarizes  the  procurement  arrangements.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) between prequalified bidders would
be used for all civil works contracts in excess of US$5 million, totalling
about US$130 million or approximately 15% of civil works and for equipment
purchases  of  over   US$300,000.        Local   Competitive  Bidding  (LCB),
satisfactory to the Bank, would be used for investment in and maintenance
of civil works, costing US$5.0 million or less each, for a total of US$627
million (72Z of civil works), and for procurement of miscellaneous



- 15 -
maintenance equipment (para 2.11). In all cases, LCB procedures for civil
works and goods are open to foreign bidders. Joint financing would follow
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.

2.1 for details).
2/   Total cost of training is US$0.8 million.
a/   Routine maintenance executed by force account.
2.24     About 60Z of routine  maintenance  works, representing about US$70
million (8Z of civil works procurement) would be executed by force account,
comprising those op3rations for which Vialidad's cost accounting system has
determined that force account is more economic than contracting. All
procurement of consultant services would be done in accordance with Bank
guidelines  and  procedures.    Training  activities  will  be  executed by
contract  with  outside   training   agencies   or   by  Vialidad  training
specialists.
2.25     The relatively small amount of ICB results from the fact that most
of the procurement is for maintenance works scattered throughout the
country and spread over a four-year period. Chile's experience with Bank
and IDB financed investments in road rehabilitation and construction in the
last five years (over US$500 million) shows that the local contracting
industry has ample capacity to execute such works at costs below the
international market; also, foreign firms have shown little interest in
participating in ICB for contracts of even greater value than those
anticipated under the proposed project.   When they have participated, they
have not been the lowest bidders.



- 16 -
2.26     The Bank has a  long  and  excellent  experience with MOP's tender
procedures. Moreover, a complete new set of ICB bidding documents for
works have been discussed since early 1988 and were agreed at negotiations.
Prior review and approval by the Bank will be required for procurement
documents and contracts for (i) all subprojects to be tendered through ICB
procedures; (ii) the first three subprojects to be tendered through LZB
procedures; (iii) goods procurement for amounts above US$300,000; and (iv)
all consulting services consultant contracts over US$200,000 and the first
three to be procured regardless of their cost.
2.27     All subprojects not subject to  p.iot  review by the Bank would be
tendered by MOP, once declared eligible, and the contracts would be awarded
by MOP, subject to  ex-post  review  by  the  Bank.    The time allowed for
preparation of bids would be 45 days for tenders having an estimated cost
above US$5 million equivalent, 30 days for tenders between US$0.5 and US$5
million, and 15 days for smaller maintenance contracts.
I. Disbursements
2.28     The execution  of  the  extensive  road  maintenance program would
require disbursements against a large number of small contracts and against
some routine maintenance works carried out by force account. The total
volume of individual disbursement operations would seriously strain MOP and
the Bank's capabilities to handle them in the traditional ways. MOP's
contracting and payment procedures have proven adequate, as has its
capacity for swift and effective project execution; thus, simple and quick
disbursement procedures will continue to be employed. Monthly expenditure
statements for the execution of components of the agreed maintenance
program would  be  the  basis  of  withdrawal  applications.    The monthly
statements would comprise expenditures for works executed by contract and
for routine maintenance executed  by  force  account.   The latter would be
determined by multiplying the real physical production measurement with the
unit cost for each operation, to be updated on a routine basis. The
preparation of the monthly expenditure statements and the monitoring work
would be carried out by Vialidad's Maintenance Department, with appropriate
consultant assistance financed under the loan. Supporting documentation
would not be submitted to the Bank; instead, it would be retained by MOP
and made available for review during project supervision missions and
audits. These arrangements were confirmed at negotiations
2.29     The Government of Chile and the Bank would propose to the Japanese
Eximbank that loan disbursements would be made jointly against the civil
works component of Vialidad's program not financed by IDB. The Bank would
alone finance the foreign cost of other smaller components. The following
disbursement percentages would be used initially for the categories
identified as eligible for withdrawal from the Special Account (para 2.32):
(a)  322 of total expenditures  for  civil  works for the dual carriage
roadways and bridges program and for upgrading of designated
heavily-travelled gravel roads to surface-dressed and standards,
and for civil works under the maintenance program;
(b) 70% of total expenditures for locally procured iLems or 100X of
foreign expenditures for directly imported goods and the same for
consultant services and training expenditures except training
abroad; and



- 17 -
(c) 1002 of total expenditures for tLaining fellowship abroad.
The proceeds of US$150 million cofinancing would be disbursed over the
first three years of the program at the same rate of 32X of the cost of
civil works as in the case of the Bank loan (Table 2.4). In the fourth
year the Government would take over the financing of that portion of the
civil works cost if no further cofinancing can be found or the project may
have to be redefined.
2.30     The First Highway Reconstruction  Project  in Chile (Loan 1927-CH)
was fully disbursed within six months after the original Closing Date of
December 31, 1984. The ongoing Second Highway Reconstruction Project Loan
(2297-CH) is expected to be fully disbursed one and a half years after the
original completion date, because of the inclusion of additional emergency
works in the project scope.    The  ongoing First Road Sector Project (Loan
2589-CH) is expected to be fully disbursed within its four-year execution
period. Therefore, it can be assumed th'at full disbursement of the
proposed  project  would  be   achieved within  the  programmed  four-year
execution period (Table 2.5).   Standard  profiles  prepared by the Bank in
the LAC region indicate that a seven-year period is required to obtain full
disbursement of a standard project  loan,  but  this is not appropriate for
the proposed sector project.    No  provisions  have been made for quantity
contingencies and preparations for timely initiation of project exerution
are well advanced. Given that the best period for road work execution in
Chile is between September and March, and given that it would be more
practical to finance discrete contracts completely from the same loan, and
to ensure an even cash flow, it was agreed that some contracts under the
proposed project could start as early as September 1989 and therefore would
need retroactive financing in an amount up to US$7.0 million.
2.31     Rates of return for the  maintenance  program will be greater than
those of investments. If, therefore, less than the required financing were
to be available during implementation, the maintenance program would
reasonably get priority over  new  investments.   This was confirmed during
negotiations.
J.  Accounts and Auditing
2.32     To reduce the interval during  which  MOP would finance the Bank's
and the proposed cofinancer or cofinancer's share of project costs out of
its own resources,  the  Government  could  request  the  Bank and eventual
cofinancer(s) to make advance payments from the loan accounts into Special
Accounts (to be opened in US dollars in the Central Bank), which would be
available for reimbursing MOP for the Bank and cofinancer(s)' shares of the
project cost. The Bank's Special Account funds would not exceed US$19
million and special accounts jointly would  not exceed US$35 million or the
amount required for about four months of project execution.
2.33     The Bank would require that an independent auditor-  (i) audit all
loan accounts and expenditure categories for exactness and for efficiency;
(ii) consistently apply  procedures  and  methods  satisfactory to the Bank
that conform to generally accepted auditing standards; (iii) carry out its
auditing work in a timely manner (annual reports would be presented no
later than four months after the end of each calendar year); and (iv)
render an impartial judgment in its auditing role. The Contraloria General



- 18 -
de la Republica de Chile has under past road sector loans satisfactorily
fulfilled this function and the Bank has indicated during negotiations that
it would consider Contraloria General de la Republica as independent
auditors as long as the 'ontraloria: (i) consistently applies procedures
and method- that  conform  to  generally  accepted auditing standards; (ii)
carries out its auditing work in a timely manner; and (iii) maintains in
its auditing operation the independent character required.
K. Monitoring of the Project
2.34     With regard  to  project  monitoring,  Vialidad  would continue to
prepare quarterly reports for the Bank, provide information on road
expenditures, especially pertaining to its maintenance and investment
budget, including a breakdown by expenditure category and by force account
and contract  (Annex  6).    Force-account  expenditures  should be further
broken down by cost components; unit costs by force account and by contract
should be compared; and productivity of force-account operations should be
assessed. Additionally, road lengths maintained, and assessed maintenance
levels, should be documented along with compliance with agreed project
implementation targets, status of selection and execution of deferred
maintenance subproiects, and general  evaluation  of road network condition
and of  the  maintenance  programs.    The  disbursement  schedule would be
reviewed and recommendations for eventual program modifications should be
made in quarterly reports. The quarterly reports will also include updated
versions of all major tables included in the appraisal report.
2.35     To monitor progress toward  the  objectives  of the Sector Project
effectively, it was agreed at negotiations that the Government will at a
minimum meet with representatives of the Bank biannually to discuss and
agree on the following:
(a) During the first semester of each year, review the results of the
previous year's program including:
- summary of financial implementation of the road investment and
maintenance programs;
-  state of vompletion of road works in the investment program;
- state of completion of the maintenance program and compliance
with physical targets;
- implementation of txAe training component;
- use of consulting services;
- economic evaluation of subprojects included in the investment
and in the maintenance programs;
- audit reports and consolidation of disbursements against actual
expenditures;
- comparison of projected and actual loan disbursements; and
- lessons learned during implementation.



- 19 -
(b) During the second semester of each year, review execution of the
program for the current year and the program for the next year on
the basis of lessons learned, including:
-  road expenditures and  execution  of  works  euring the current
year;
- compliance with physical targets;
- updated medium-term road investment program and objectives;
- proposed investment and maintenance budget;
- status of selection of Bank-financed subprejects;
-  budget of funds for consulting services and training;
-  road  condition  inventories  and  review  of  the  maintenance
program; and
-  review of the proposed disbursement schedule.
L. Economic Evaluation
2.36     The main element of the economic analysis for the proposed project
was performed, partly in Washington, by Chilean staff of Vialidad, with the
Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model, Version Three for
Personal Computers (HDM III-PC), on the Chilean National Road Network of
75,661 km excluding the 3,470 km of cement concrete roads. A separate
analysis was performed for the program of 156 km of doubled roadways and
bridges, because the HDM model assumes free traffic flow conditions, which
is obviously not the case for roads and bridges that need to be doubled to
eliminate congestion. This analysis was performed with the assistance of
an expert of the Australian Road Research Laboratory and financing of the
Australian Trust Fund.    At  negotiations  it was  agreed  that the Roads
Directorate and ODEPLAN would jointly carry out a study to improve the
evaluation methodology of dual carriageway roads (Annex 7, Exhibit 1).
2.37     The internal rate of return (IRR) of maintenance operations on the
3,470 km of cement concrete roads was estimated by the mission as was the
IRR on another small, less important bridge program and on a river training
structures program. Rate of return calculations of individual works to
determine the order of priority of these works will be done year by year.
Finally, the IRR of the Inter-American Development Bank Programs for the
Austral Road, Urban Roads and Productive Secondary Roads were calculated by
IDB.   Small  programs  for  consulting  services  and  training, equipment
procurement and administration of the program were assigned rates of return
consistent with Bank experience in other projects. The IRR on the complete
program is expected to be some 50? and the Net Present Value (NPV) US$1.282
million, which is about the same as the expenditure outlay of the 1990-1993
program. A summary of NPV, IRR and financial outlays for the program
follows. Details are in Annex 7.

M. Project Risks
2.38     There  are  no  major   risks   affecting  the  proposed  project.
Vialidad's performance under the last three projects has been good. Loan
1927-CH was completed on schedule; physical execution of works for Loan
2297-CH and 2589-CH is  on  target.    There  may be some uncertainty about



- 21 -
availability of counterpart funds and the capacity of Vialidad to execute
planned works and contracts at current staff levels. Staff capacity for
implementation will be monitored  closely.    ln  the matter of counter.,art
ftnding, the Government attaches high priority to project implementation in
the framework of its broader social objective of employment generation. In
fact, the Government has already included project funds in its current
three-year plan and has officiFl1y agreed to provide the resources needed
for planned expenditures, as outlined in Table 1.10 or as modified in
agreement with the Bank.   This  arrangement was confirmed at negotiations.
Even from an environmental point of view there is little risk as the
program is mainly for maintenance of existing roads. The 156 km of double
direction highways will be built on already expropriated right of way
parallel to the existing road, hence little lasting negative social impact.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
3.01     Before negotiations,  an  agreement  in  substance  of  the Budget
Office of the Finance Ministry regarding the content and implementation
cost of the training program was sought and obtained (para 1.29).
3.02     During negotiations, formal agreement was reached on the following
issues:
(a)  execution of a Road User Charges Actualization Study and follow up
actions recommended (para. 1.07);
(b)  improvement in axle load limit enforcement (para. 1.08);
(c)  execution of  a  study  to  determine  the  procedures involved in
establishing a well-functioning transport information system for
the purpose of publishing transport data on a regular basis (para.
1.20);
(d)  study the effectiveness  of  the  past  and  implementation of the
agreed upon new training program (para. 1.29);
(e)  size and composition of the 1989-97 Roads Program (para. 1.31);
(f)  the detailed roads program for 1990, including list of maintenance
works financed under other loans (para. 2.21);
(g)  bidding documents for ICB (para. 2.26);
(h)  tender packaging and scheduling (para. 2.27);
(i)  modalities of disbursement applications (para. 2.28);
(j)  disbursement percentages (para. 2.29);
(k)  priority of maintenance over investments (para. 2.31);
(1)  special account arrangements (para. 2.32);



- 22 -
(m)  auditing arrangements (para. 2.33);
(n) scope of reporting requirements (para. 2.34 and 2.35); and
(o) provision of resources needed for planned expenditures (para
2.38).
3.03     There are no conditions of effectiveness for the proposed loan.
3.04     Subject to the above, the proposed project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$224 million, with a term of 17 years, including a grace
period of 5 years, at the standard variable interest rate.

SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
ESTUDIO DE PROCEDIMIFNTOS NECESARIOS PARA ESTABLECER
UN SISTEMA DE INFJRMACION PARA EL SECTOR TRANSPORTE
Esquema de Terminos de Referencia
1. Introducci6n
En general, el actual sistema de informaci6n sobre el sector transporte
- SIT, no satisface los requerimientos de las instituciones oficiales
vinculadas a este sector, ni de los agentes privados y tampoco de los
mismos  usuarios  de  los  medio  de  transporte.    Las  estadisticas  son
incompletas y poco  confiables,  ya  que  acusan inconsistencias cuando una
misma informaci6n es generada por fuentes distintas.
Los subsectores que mas problemas presentan en este sentido son el
transporte automotor por carretera,  el  transporte  urbano y el transporte
maritimo, aunque en el  ferroviario,  aereo  y  ductos tambien se considera
necesario realizar un diagn6stico exhaustivo para evaluar sus posibles
deficiencias y formular las recomendaciones para mejorar sus informaciones.
En lo que se refiere al sector transporte en su conjunto, es necesario
revisar los procedimientos para obtener su valor agregado, las inversiones
p4blicas y privadas y el empleo.   La mayor parte de estas informaciones se
publican en forma conjunta con el sector comunicaciones.
Teniendo en cuenta los datos  disponibles en la actualidad es imposible
determinar la distribuci6n modal, tanto de la carga como de los pasajeros,
debido al  desconocimiento  de  los  flujos  correspondientes al transporte
automotor por carretera y a la poca confiabilidad de las estadisticas del
movimiento de cabotaje.
Uno de los problemas que con mayor severidad afacta al sector es el que
se refiere a la institucionalidad y legalidad del actual sistema de
informaciones.  No  existe  una  normativa que determine responsabilidades,
defina los procedimientos para generar y procesar los datos y que obligue a
su transferencia regular entre las instituciones y usuarios individuales.

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 3
Diversos organismos, tanto nacionales como internacionales, coinciden
en manifestar que el actual sistema de informacion sobre el sector
transporte es inadecuado.  Los  andlisis desarrollados durante la ejecuci6n
de diversos estudios confirman la existencia de una situaci6n critica en
este campo. 1
Cabe hacer notar que con este estudio no se pretende crear nuevas
instituciones ni tampoco  concentrar  en  el  Ministerio  de Transportes la
responsabilidad  de  todas  las  funciones   inherentes  a  un  sistema  de
informaciones.
Lo que si se busca con el estudio es que una vez terminado Oste,
se obtenga un producto que permita iniciar la implantaci6n de acciones
tecnicas, administrativas y legales que hagan viable su funcionamiento.
2. Objetivo General del Estudio
Definir, diseflar y evaluar tecnica y econ6micamente un sistema de
informaci6n sobre el transporte, incluyendo a todos y cada uno de los
medios que lo componen.
3. Objetivos Especificos del Estudio
a.   Identificar, cuantificar y calificar a los usuarios del sistema de
informaci6n.
b.   Identificar, cuantificar  y  calificar  las  funciones  actuales y
potenciales  que  Ilevan  a  cabo   los  usuarios  en  relaci6n  a
transporte.
c.   Identificar, cuantificar y calificar  las informaciones que apoyan
a las funciones de cada usuario, con indicaci6n de sus fuentes,
sean  Ostas  primarias   a   secundarias;  los  procedimientos  de
recolecci6n (publicaciones, fichas, encuestas, investigaciones
especiales   a   registros    computacionales);    su   grado   de
procesamiento;  periodicidad  y   uso;   y   tamaflo,  ubicaci6n  y
caracteristicas de los compiladores y subcompiladores.
d.   Definir los componentes del  sistema  y sus interrelaciones, tales
como las fuentes generadoras, los compiladores o procesadores y
los usuarios, para cada item o grupos de itemes de que se
componene las informaciones seleccionadas.
e.   Formular un marco instituclonal y legal que incluya a las unidades
o  entidades   responcables   de   la  generaci6n,  procesamiento,
distribuci6n y publicaci6n de las informaciones, ademas de las
normas  legales  y   reglamentarias   que   se  precisen  para  su

SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Training
A. Obiectives.
1.       The major objectives of the project's training component ares
a) to strengthen the performance capabilities of Vialidad's staff;
b) to improve further the quality of the training;
c) to upgrade Vialidad's training organization; and
d) to consolidate training efforts succetisfully started under the
First Road Sector Project.
B. Description of the Training Program.
2.       Performance strengthening will be  geared to managers and professionals
(level  A),  supervisors  and  administrative  personnel,  including secretaries
(level B) and foremen and helpers including mechanics and equipment operators
(level C).   The  program  for  managers  and  professionals  will emphasize (i)
plannlng  and  engineering  of  roads;   (ii)  road  construction  and  pavement
techniques, execution and supervision; (iii) bridge design and construction;
(iv)  road  maintenance  planning,  execution  and  supervision;  and  (v)  soil
mechanics and hydrology. The middle level and administrative program will be
quality and production oriented and the C level courses will be purely
technical. For a complete list of courses at all levels see Exhibit 1.
3.       To  improve  the  quality  of  training  (i)  instructors  (in specific
technical subjects with the help of consultants) and (ii) teaching materials
will be upgraded, and the costs and benefits of training will be carefully
evaluated. Vialidad's training organization will De reviewed critically and if
necessary the current training policies will be revised, and the current
training units capacity in planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of
the progrars will be improved.
4.       Training efforts initiated under the  First Road Sector Project will be
consolidated by confirming the importance of training as a key factor to
increase productivity as well as evaluating the results derived from training
courses in the different personnel levels and categories (Exhibit II). After
the project, Vialidad will have a sound training organization capable of
maintaining Vialidad as a leading institution in the region. Preliminary plans
are being discussed between Vialidad and the U.S. Highway Administration to
offer some of the Chilean training courses with Chilean instructors at U.S.
locations for Spanish speaking technicians and road supervisors in state,
country, and city road maintenance and construction agencies.

Annex 4
Page 2 of 23
5.       The US$800,000 program (less  than  0.12  of  Vialidad's budge- for the
period) consists of five major expenditure groups, which will be described in
detail below: implementation of the internal and external training courses,
administration of the program, consultant services for general support of the
unit and for evaluation studies, civil works to improve the training facilities
and procurement of training aids, and study visits abroad (Annex 1, Table 1).
Annual expenditures will range between US$193,000 and US$217,000 representing
0.09 to 0.112 of Vialidad's annual budget.(Annex 1, Table 2).
C. Implementation of the Training Courses.
6.       The training courses  for  the  period  1990-1993  aim at improving the
performance capabilities of about 3,385 people, representing about 752 of the
total Vialidad personnel.    Because  some  will  participate  in  more than one
course, the total number of participants will be 3,480 (some 870 per year)
(Table 3). About 900 participants will be trained in courses organized by
Vialidad's own instructors and executed in its own facilities,1 the rest will
be trained under agreements with local institutions and universities2 (Table
4). However, in all cases, course content will be defined by Vialidad's
technical specialists under the supervision of the training unit.
7.       The cost of execution of  the  training programs includes: (i) per diem
and transportation for about 1,060 participants (260 in internal courses and 800
in external training) (Table 5); (ii) per diem and transportation for 51
instructors (Table 6); (iii) training material for 45 internal courses; (iv)
contract cost of 164 external courses to be procured at training institutions
and universities within the country (Table 7).
D. Administration of the Training Program.
8.       Vialidad's  Training  Unit  will  be  responsible  for:  (i)  p.anning,
coordinating, and monitoring the training program; (ii) establishin- agreement
with external training agencies; and (iii) evaluating the results of the
training programs. To facilitate Vialidad's coordinating activities with the
regions, meetings would be organized once a year to discuss the training plan
and implementation problems.   The  participants  in  these meetings will be the
Training Unit Director, the National and Regional Coordinators and the Regional
Training Committee Head as well as Vialidad's Regional Directors. To facilitate
the planning and organization of the training courses as well as to solve
implementation problems, the Technical Training personnel will keep close
contact with the regions through a program of supervision trip (some 54, see
Table 8).
1/ Internal courses are addressed mainly to middle level administrative
and technical personnel as well as to foremen and helpers. They are
geared to meet Vialidad's technical and administrative requirements.
2/ External courses will be contracted with external institutions. They
are mainly high level courses addressed to managers and engineers in
administrative techniques and in technological subjects, where the
universities and their research institutes can provide the best

Annex 4
Page 3 of 23
9.       The Vialidad Training Unit will select and organize courses to train 40
part-time instructors in pedagogical matters and training methodologies using
well known training institutions in Chile, and will develop occupational
analysis to define tbe training requirements which would be the basis for
preparation of syllabi and other didactic materials to be produced for the
different training courses.
E. Consultant Services.
10.      Local (14 staff/months) and  foreign consultants (5 staff/months) would
be hired to assist Vialidad in managing the program and in training the
professional staff in: (i) cement concrete pavement technology and behavior;
(ii) asphalt technology and behavior; (iii) road maintenance administration;
(iv) road maintenance planning; and (v) equipment maintenance and operation
(Table 9).      Vialidad  needs  this  assistance  to  (i)  upgrade  its current
procedures; (ii) improve its organization; (iii) increase its productivity;
(iv) prepare the correspondence guidelines for implementation of the proposed
changes at the technical and administrative levels; and (v) training its
personnel in the subjects mentioned above.
11.      The training program under  Loan  2589-CH,  of  which this program is a
continuation, appears to have been  very  successful.   Judging from the data in
Table 10, there has been a dramatic productivity increase. To avoid rash or
unfounded conclusions and to assure that no money is wasted on unnecessary
financing, it is the Government's intention to study in detail the results of
the ongoing and the proposed training program.
12.      Using local consultants, Vialidad would carry  out, by the end of 1990,
a study (US$21,000) to evaluate the costs and benefits of the whole training
program (including 1986-1989 training program) and to measure the impact of the
training program on the productivity and efficiency of Vialidad staff working on
road and equipment maintenance.   The  measurements  for this study will be made
using  data  from  the  Highway   Designs  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM)  under
implementation. Terms of reference for these studies are available in the
project file. The consultants doing the impact studies will be disqualified for
any other assistance to the training unit.
F. Training Facilities and Procurement.
13.      Vialidad's classrooms in Santiago and  the Regions need to be remodeled
(US$4,000). Chairs, desks, blackboards, and cabinets also need to be provided
for which purpose US$8,000 has been included as part of the project expenditures
for training. A reconditioned old vehicle (US$1,000) equipped with audio-visual
training material and tools (US$12,000) will be used to provide on-the-job
training in subjects related to road equipment maintenance. A micro-computer
(US$2,500) will be purchased to be used in (i) planning and organization of the
annual training programs, (ii) selection of part_ ipants, (iii) updating
training  statistics,  and  (iv)   monitoring  the  training  program.  Printing
equipment (US$1,000) will be procured to reproduce teaching material for all
internal courses. Audio-visual equipment and video cassette courses (US$8,000)
will facilitate the training process by using modern m.aterial already prepared
for other countries (Table 11).

G. Study Visits Abroad.
14.      To expose professional staff of Vialidad to better systems developed in
other countries, training abroad through technical courses and seminars for 45
professionals will be  provided.    Courses  will  be  provided  for 20 Vialidad
professionals (5 p-r year) to study subjects related to road maintenance
planning and organization, soil mechanics, hydraulics, and hydrology lasting
three to six months. Most of these courses will permit participants to obtain a
post graduate certificate. A senior training manager will participate in a two-
month course for training managers organized by the International Labour
Organization in  Turin,  Itsly.    Participation  in  seminars  of  24  Vialidad
managers and high level professionals (6 per year) have also been included.
These  one  to  two   week   seminars   are  offered  by  several  international
organizations and countries to discuss the last development in subjects such as
asphalt  concrete  pavements,   surface   treatment,   equipment  selection  and
maintenance and road  construction  systems.    Trips  of  Vialidad officials to
international conferences and to Washington, D.C. for project negotiations and
discussions of implementation problems also have been included in this category.
Costs of the courses (US$7,357) and seminars (US$3,200) include per diem,
airfare, and insurance and registration fees, which have been estimated
according to standard costs (Table 12).
H. Costs.
15.      The basic  cost  of  the  training  component  is  estimated  at US$0.8
million, which represents annually US$44.3 per Vialidad employee, which is less
than a-third the Latin American average.    Direct unit cost per participant for
internal courses (excluding costs for consultant services, remodelling of
training facilities and procurement of goods) is US$44.2. Even when these costs
are reasonably allocated to the internal courses, their cost per participant
would not exceed that of external courses, which is US$85.4 per participant.
16.      External courses appear  to  be  more  expensive than courses organized
internally. However, one could argue that at least part of the consultant
services, remodeling of facilities and procurement of goods should be added to
the internal training costs, which would probably even out the cost per
participant. These costs cannot be totally included as direct costs because
consultant expenditures are oriented at improving the quality of the training
program; the costs of remodeling classrooms, additional furniture, tools and
audio-visual aids are not considered as operational costs for the purpose of
calculating the participant  cost.    They  remain  as  an investment for future
training programs.

SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Organization and Execution of the Road Maintenance Program
A. Background
1.       The planning and  control  of  road  maintenance has traditionally
been the responsibility of the Road Maintenance Department of MOP's Roads
Directorate (Vialidad) (Chart I). Road maintenance is executed by contract
or force account through Vialidad's 13 regional offices, each region
comprising two or three  provinces.    MOP's traditional responsibility for
the maintenance of the total rcad network (at present about 79,000 ki) was
reduced in the early 1980s to the Basic Network (at present about 22,758
km).  As  a  result  of  a  move  toward decentralization of administrative
services, the Government decided at that time to turn over responsibility
for the Local Road Network (about 56,500 km) to the municipalities.
However, this measure was never implemented, Vialidad never completely
relinquishing responsibility for the local network; instead it maintained
its local organizational structure and kept some of its personnel in place.
2.       Under  Loan  2582-CH,  Vialidad  resumed  responsibility  for  the
maintenance of the Primary Local  Network (24,227 km) and, in collaboration
with the Municipalities, undertook spot interventions on the remaining,
much less trafficked 31,937 km of the Secondary Local Network whenever
traffic flows became seriously impeded.   Vialidad was capable of absorbing
this expanded responsibility  because:    (a) maintenance expenditu..es have
been rising since 1983 and are  expected  to  reach US$1,300 per km in 1988
(routine and periodic maintenance of the basic and primary local network
only); (b) Vialidad strengthened its maintenance organization (paras. 3
through 6 below); (c) a high percentage of the expanded works program was
undertaken by contract (para. 3); and (d) Vialidad's staff and equipment
fleet throughout the country now is adequate for the requirements of the
expanded maintenance program (para. 5).
B. MOP's Road Maintenance Organization
3.       Continuing the  momentum  developed  under  the  First  and Second
Highway Reconstruction Projects (Loans 1927-CH and 2297-CH), Vialidad,
under the First Road Sector Project (Loan 2589-CH), upgraded further the
technical capacity of its maintenance staff and improved maintenance
administration remarkably. The Maintenance Department now is organized in
three subdepartments:



- 71 -
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3
(a)  Maintenance  Planning,  staffed  by  four  professionals  and
supporting  personnel;  this  subdepartment  carries  out the
preparation and  planning  of  the  ongoing  project  and the
preparation of the proposed project; it is also in charge of:
(i) continuous updating of the road condition inventory; (ii)
medium and long-term planning through the intensive use of
the HDM III model based on actual roughness and road
condition measurements in the field; (iii) estimates of work
quantities;  frequencies   of   operations   and   unit  cost
accounting; (iv) assignment of priorities; (v) estimates of
needed revernues; and (vi) programming of works.
(b) Execution, staffed by seven professionals and supporting
personnel; functions as the Project Unit for Loan 2589-CH, it
is also in charge of: (i) implementation of the program of
maintenance works; (ii) allocation of funds and resources;
(iii)  monitoring  of  the   program;  (iv)  development  and
application of a cost accounting system for force account
operations; (v) financial management of the maintenance
program; (vi) preparation of disbursement applications; and
(vii) coordination of training.
(c)  Services,  staffed   by   eight   mechanical   engineers  and
supporting  personnel;   in   charge   of:       (i)  equipment
administration; (ii) equipment and spare parts procurement;
and (iii) workshops and equipment repair.
Also,  Vialidad  intends   to   create   a   Standards  and  Specifications
subdepartment.
4.       Vialidad's 13 regional  offices  each  have: (i) an administration
department; (ii) a maintenance department with equipment and workshops in
charge of force account works; and (iii) a civil works contracts department
in charge of contracting with the private sector and supervising execution
of  contracts.    The  line   of  responsibilities  reaches  through  these
departments further down to  the  Provincial  Delegates.   Force account is
used only for routine maintenance and its share of routine maintenance has
been reduced from 70% in 1984 to 60% in 1988. All periodic and deferred
maintenance is carried out by contract.
5.       Vialidad's physical  infrastructure  (office buildings, warehouses
and workshops), its maintenance personnel and its equipment and vehicle
fleet, which have been streamlined and modernized under both ongoing
projects, are sufficient to cope with the demands of the expanded
maintenance program. Equipment availability and utilization have increased
substantially, reaching levels comparable  to those in developed countries.
Career maintenance staff  is  very  knowledgeable  and effective, and well-
aimed training programs have increased substantially its technical



- 72 -
ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 3
capacity. Vialidad also hires a substantial number of consultants to
perform engineering and supervision work.    Since  most of the increase in
maintenance works will be carried out by contract, no substantial renewal
nor expansion of the equipment fleet is needed over the next four years.
6.       Vialidad's organizational approach has  enabled  it to comply with
all the targets for routine and periodic maintenance. It is continuously
updating its road condition inventory relying on modern equipment for
deflection, skid-resistance and roughness measurement purchased under past
projects.    This,  coupled with  an  internationally  recognized pavement
monitoring and management capabilities has developed an excellent basis for
the establishment of a Pavement Management System. Vialidad already has
established a well functioning information system and an effective cost
accounting  system,  which  take   into  consideration  all  cost  factors,
including equipment ownership costs.   The training program, which includes
minimal but well-targeted training abroad, in-house training and training
in other local organizations, has been highly successful and has exceeded
all agreed targets.
7.       The proposed project would build on the above achievements.  It is
Vialidad's objective to expand the maintenance program to reach a level of
about two-thirds of total road expenditures, with periodic maintenance
representing 402 of total maintenance  expenditures.   For this purpose the
project would continue to expand the training program, complete the
pavement monitoring and management studies, strengthen the maintenance
planning capability, and consolidate the irventory, information, and cost
accounting systems while upgrading the computer applications.

CHILE
SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Economic Analysis
I. EVALUATION OF ROAD MAINTENANCE PROGRAM 1990-93
1.       All  major  elements  of  the  program  are  subject  to  economic
evaluation using a methodology developed by ODEPLAN, which has been
reviewed and found acceptable by  the  Bank.    The weakness of the ODEPLAN
system is that it does not include optimization calculations for the
program as a whole and always includes some shadow pricing for labor and
foreign exchange. Our analysis which is summarized below, concentrates on
optimization among subprojections with acceptable rate of return.
2.       The main element of the economic analysis for the proposed project
was performed by Chilean staff of Vialidad, partly in Washington, DC., with
the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (Version Three
for Personal Computers - HDM III-PC) on the Chilean National Road Network
of 75,661 km, exclt_aing the 3,470 km of cement concrete roads (Table 1 and
Exhibit 1) which cannot be analyzed by the HDM model as it does not yet
include functions  that  predict  the  deterioration  of  these  roads.   A
separate analysis had to be performed also for the program of 156 km of
dual carriageway roads and bridges, because the HDM model assumes free
traffic flow conditions, which is obviously not the case for roads and
bridges that need to be dualized to eliminate congestion. The congestion
analysis was performed with the assistance of a specialist from the
Australian Road Research Laboratory and under Australian Trust Fund
financing.
3.       The internal rate of return (IRR) of maintenance operations on the
3,470 km of cement concrete roads was estimated by the mission; so was the
economic return on another, small, less important bridge program and on a
river  training  structures  program.    Rate  of  return  calculations  of
individual works to determine the order of priority of these works will be
done  yearly.    Finally,  the   rates  of  return  of  the  Inter-American
Development Bank Programs for the Austral Road, Urban Roads and Productive
Secondary Roads were calculated by InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB).
Small programs for consulting services and training, equipment procurement
and administration of the program were assigned a nominal rate of return.
The IRR on the complete program is expected to be some 50Z and the Net
Present Value (NPV) US$1,282 million, which is about the same as the
expenditure outlay of the 1990-1993 program.   A summary table of financial
outlays for the program and their NPV and IRR can be found in the main text
page 20.

A.  HDM III Microcomputer Analysis
4.       For the economic evaluation of  the road network with free traffic
flow conditions, the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model
(HDM - PC) was used. This model predicts the life-cycle costs of different
road design and maintenance options, including different time staging
strategies, either for a given road project on a specific alignment or for
groups or links of an entire  road  network.   It estimates the total costs
for large numbers of alternative maintenance policies on a year-by-year
basis, and can thus be used to search for the alternative with the highest
net present value (NPV) at given discount rates, or the highest internal
rate of  return  (IRR).    The  objective  is,  thus,  to  search  out that
combination of maintenance policies which results in the minimum total
life-cycle costs to society, including the costs to road users, as well as
the costs borne  by  the  roads  authority.    Vehicle speeds and operating
costs, and road deterioration and maintenance costs, are internally
estimated by the model as a function of the road design and maintenance
standards, traffic volume and axle loads, and environmental conditions.
Maintenance and vehicle operating costs are first estimated in physical
quantities; then prices and unit costs, as specified by the user, are
applied to determine the total financial, economic and foreign exchange
cost.
5.       For the present program, the  model  was  used with respect to (i)
asphalt concrete, (ii) bituminous surface treated, (iii) gravel, and (iv)
natural gravel and earth surface  roads.    The  75,661 km road network was
divided up by zone (a distinction made essentially to capture climatic and
soil effects) and by surface type. Each of the groups so identified (i.e.,
four zones and four surface types) were further stratified by road
condition and traffic volume, as illustrated in Table 2 of this annex. The
cells in the overall matrices are identified as "links."
6.       The  input  data  for  the  analysis  of  this  project  were  not
estimated, as was the case for the First Road Sector Project, but developed
from  actual  measurements  in  the  field.    For  the  paved  roads,  the
classification of each link was based on a general road inventory, visual
condition assessments, and a detailed evaluation of pavements using
roughness  meters,  an  optical  perfilometer   and  a  deflectometer.    A
considerable eiFort also was made to develop an information system for
pavement management, including the design of software to handle the data
required for the HDM model such as geometry, surface type, base type,
pavement composition and strength; pavement cracking, rutting, raveling,
potholes  and  other   blemishes;   and   surface  roughness  and  pavement
deflection. For all gravel and earth roads, trafficability during the
whole year was used as one element of classification. For the engineered
gravel roads, surface condition was further assessed in terms of the
remaining thickness of gravel. The surface condition of unpaved roads
changes as a function of traffic and blading frequency, and is predicted by
the model on the basis of the characteristics of the materials constituting
the road.    The  quality  of  materials  was  assessed  by mechanical soil
testing, and the model was adjusted to account for the properties of local
or-v I

7.       Basic cost inputs were  developed  from experience under the First
Road Sector Project. For paved roais, this included unit costs for routine
maintenance, pothole patching, several kinds of surface dressings, overlays
in two thicknesses (5cm and 8cm) and typical rehabilitation on asphalt
concrete or surface treatment.    Similarly,  for unpaved roads, unit costs
for routine maintenance, blading with a motorgrader, spot regraveling and
full regraveling were developed from actual past expenditure figures both
by contract and force account (Table 3).
8.       The policy optimization was carried out first at the link level to
determine the optimum policy for a given set of conditions. In formulating
maintenance policy al'-rnatives for final evaluation, it was necessary,
therefore, first to test a wide range of maintenance options. For the sake
of computational efficiency, it was c3nsidered convenient to use the same
set of maintenance policy options for all the paved roads, and similarly
for unpaved roads.
9.       Table 4 of this annex  gives  a set of 24 maintenance alternatives
that were finally retained for each paved link after elimination of more
than 100 used in earlier runs.    As can be seen, maintenance operations on
paved roads, in addition to basic routine maintenance, may consist of any
combination of patching, resealing, overlay and pavement reconstruction,
and they can all be triggered at various levels of distress. The baseline
case (Base) consists of basic routine maintenance, reconstruction at high
level of roughness (International Roughness Index IRI of 8) and patching of
up to 80 square meters per kilometer and per year. This base case is then
compared with all 23 other policy combinations in the table to evaluate the
incremental benefits from increasing expenditures on maintenance. It is
worth noting that the analysis showed slurry seals to be a viable technical
alternative to surface dressing on the relatively lightly trafficked paved
roads of northern Chile, region which has a dry climate and excellent soil
conditions. Because of lack of experience with slurry seals, unit costs
used for the two alternatives are almost the same. Increased use of slurry
seals may prove to be cheaper than surface dressing, and hence enforce the
importance of this finding.
10.      Table 5 of this annex gives a set of 22 alternatives evaluated for
gravel ana earth  roads  respectively.    The  maintenance operations .o be
cons dered,  in  addition  to   routine   maintenance,  are  blading,  spot
regraveling and full regraveling.   The  baseline case here is nominal spot
.egraveling, plus grading every 12,000 vehicle passes and at least once a
year. There are, essentially, two sets of policy combJnations:
(a) Spot regraveling and blading at various frequencies, as a
function of vehicle passes, between 2,000 through 12,000.
(b) As (a) preceding, but also regraveling up to 15 or 20 cm of
new gravel  when  the  gravel  thickness  has  worn  down to a
nominal 5 cm.

11.      Five vehicie categories,  ranging  from  car  to heavy-trLck, were
used to represent the traffic composition in the analysis. Detailed
information on fuel type, gross vehicle mass, pay load, equivalent number
of axles per vehicle, normal vehicle service life, hours and kilometers
driven per year, and average number of passengers per vehicle was also
developed for each category.    Finally,  unit  costs of vehicle ownership,
maintenance and operation were developed (Table 6) in terms of financial,
economic and foreign exchange costs.
12.      Traffic volumes (Tables 7)  were obtained from routine observation
at toll stations and biannual counts covering the full classification
matrix. The annual traffic growtb rate was projected at 5Z for unpaved
roads and between 2.52 to 6.5Z for paved roads, depending on vehicle type.
13.      The maintenance alternatives were  evaluated  for each link on the
basis of (i) net present value (NPV) of eachi alternative when compared with
the baseline case at a discount rate of 12Z and (ii) the internal rate of
return (IRR). The analyses was carried out over a 15-year period. Under
no budgetary constraint, the optimum policy on each link is the one that
maximizes the NPV. (The discount rate of 12? represents the opportunity
cost of capital in Chile - a higher discount rate would change the optimum
policies toward less capital-intensive alternatives.)   The NPV and IRR for
all links are on file.   Table  8 sumnarizes the expenditures that would be
necessary under optimal maintenance conditions, pursuing the maximum NPV
criterion without budget constraints.   It  would lead to a program costing
US$1013 million and a NPV of US$924 million, which, though desirable, would
surpass the budget available (Exhibits 2 and 3).
B. Expenditure Budgeting Model
14.      To prune expenditures  down  to  an  acceptable  level, the Bank's
Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM) was used in conjunction with the HDM-III
model.  The EBM  uses  mathematical  programming to evaluate the trade-offs
between competing alternatives to maximize the objective function, NPV,
against the resource constraint, budgetary provision, for distinct periods
of time.
15.      Selected budget constrained  expenditures for different categories
of paved and unpaved roads and for different activities such as routine
maintenance, blading, etc. in selected periods, including 990-1993, can be
found in  Table  9  and  Exhibit  4.    A  sample  description  of Selected
Expenditures on Paved Bituminous Concrete Roads can be found in Tables 10
and 11 and for other surfaces in the project file. Constraints were only
appliEd to unpaved  roads  to  assure  full  protection of existing capital
intensive paved roads.  The rate  of  return  is 44! and NPV US$494 million
for an outlay of US$434 million in four years. To reach the optimal US$924
million NPV, US$579 million more would have to be invested with an average
IRR of 372, and this is impossible under current Chilean budget constraints
(Table 12 and Exhibits 2-3) and may not even be justifiable given
alternative uses for the available funds with high rates of return.

ANNEX 7

16.      The following steps were taken in using the EBM:
(a) For paved roads the optimal policies were selected, under
unconstrained  conditions,  because  of   the  low  level  of
expenditures required, the importance of the paved network to
the country, and the closeness between the proposed and
optimal budgets.
(b) For unpaved roads, because of the large difference between
the selected and the optimal unconstrained solutions it was
considered necessary to analyze the upgrading options using
the EBM, to verify the practical solution adopted previously
with simple economic and engineering judgment.
(c)  Three budget periods  were  considered: 1990-1993, 1994-1997,
and 1998-2004, the budgetary amounts needed for unpaved roads
for the three periods being US$362, 242 and 399 million,
respectively.
(d)  For each link to be  analyzed,  four policies [in addition to
the "do nothing" (null) alternative] were selected for
analysis, representing the options that would be the most
likely options to arrive at the overall optimum policy
different levels of resource availability.

II. EVALUATION OF FOUR-LANE DIVIDED HIGHWAY PROPOSALS
SUMMARY
1.   The program includes eight proposals for the construction of
dual carriageways on major two-lane highways, to create   fou:-
lane divided  highways.   In rost  cases  the  existing road  is
retatined  as  one   carriageway,   although   some   sections  of
reconstruction or new alignment are involved.
2.   The  existing  roads  generally  have  poor  road  surface
condition, and on some sections considerable 'side frictizn' fr'-
pedestrians. bus stops intersections, and roadside commercla.
activities.  This friction contributes to traffic rongestion and
safety problems.  The improvements do not entirely remove these
problems. but their effect is reduced on the duai carriageway
roods.
3.   The proposals have a total length of ;'.4 im, and * total
construction cost of 25600 million pesos (USS 104 million). as
summarised in Table 1.   Znternal rates of return are 16 to 40
percent'.  Average annual daily traffic (AADT) flows range from
4200 to 6700 vehiday: these would be more than doubled If
expressed as equivalent passenger car flows.  Bridge costs range
from 0 to 24 percent of individual project costs. and represent
about 12 percene of overall construction costs in Table I.
4.   The benefits of these projects consist primarily of savings
in vehicle operating costs  (typically about 50 %), travel, time
(40 %). and accidents (10). Operating cost savings arise 'almost
ent2rtly  from  1 pw-vod  road  vurf.e-  condition.  with  little
contribution from reduced congestion. Quantification of benefits
appears to be well supported by available data and past research
in Chile.
5.   Vialidad is sponsoring an ongoing program  of research  to
assist -n this type of evaluation, and the results should be
useful in annual reviews of this project. It is recommended that
this resoarch and the next annual review should give priority to:
Verification of predicted spood-flow relationships at each
site, using automated traffic classifiers and traffic
simulation.
Repeating the analysis using the IDM-Z11 model to provide
consistent vehicle operating predictions,  and  esting  tse
eftects of a -te..;.vo matntenance 0i4eies.
:ncorporating  the  site speed-flow  relationships  Into  the
modified HDM-111 model described  in World Bank Technical
Report 74. so that the complete evaluation can be carried
out using this model.

1.   ANALYSIS METHOD
6.   while the Highway Design and Maintenance Model HDM-11:
was used *xclusively in other evaluations for road funding,
the model does not currently consider traffic congestion, and
could not be used for the evaluation of socond carriageways.
The analyses conducted by Vialidad and consultants in Chile
therefore relied on the traditional benefit-cost analysis
procedures laid out in Vialidad2s Guide for the Evaluation of
Road Projects.  These make use of the vehicle operating cost
equations developed for Kenya in an earlier version of the HDM
model, HDK-U. with some Chilean paramoters.  The evaluations
also Made use of recent Chilean research on speed-flow
relationships, accident reductions and the valuation of travel
tiMe savings.  The evaluation of congestion effects makes u
of an hourly distribution of traffic flows throughout ea_h
year, so that traf'ic flows at different levels of congestion
can be analysed.
2.   PARANETER ESTNATIOM
7.   The  analysis  depends  strongly  on  the  estimation  and
prediction of three parameters: traffic flow, speed, and road
condition.
Traftic Parnamters
S.   Estimation of traffic flow, composition and future growth
is based on a comprehensive  analysis of available  traffic
count data and toll records.  Flows are highly seasonal, with
Substantial peaks for both recreational and agricultural
traffic in the summer  months.   CoMposition varies between
sites, with a typical mix of approximately:
55 % cars and utilities (pickups).
14 % light trucks,
20 % heavy trucks, and
11 % buses.
9.   Projected traffic  growth is  of the  order of  5 to  7
perCent with some variation between sites and vehicle classes;
thi esti  tes appear to be well supported by past trends and
economic projections.
SV4ed-Flow RelationshDi2
10.  Estimates of traffic speeds are largely based on a study
by Arenas (Evaluacion de una Segunda Calzada, San Fornando-
Chimbarongo. 1985) ot speed-flow relationships on two-lane
highways.   The effects  of terrain, road width, overtaking
sight distance, traffic composition and directional split were
accounted for using factors from the U.S. Highway Capacity
Manual  (1985).   Table  2 shows  a typical  example  of  the
resulting speed-flow relationships.
11. The values in Table 2 suggest an average speed reduction
for cars of about 50 km/h per LOOC veh/h increase in traffic

ANNEX 7
rage 24 of 34
volumo.  Comparable slopes for Western countr:es are of ::.e
order of 10 to 20 km/h per 1000 vehlh.  There are a number  :
factors contributing to this diffeence:
* The  high  proportion  of  trucks  and  buses  in  Chilean
traffic results .n greater traffic congestion and a
hi2her  equivalent' flow of passenger ear traffic.
Chilean traffic has a wider spread of free speeds for
each vehicle class, reflected in a higher standard
deviation of free speeds.   This is a result of driver
variations and a large number of very low-powered cars
and light trucks in the traffic stream.
The  busy  highways  considerod  in  this  analysis  had
considerable   roadside   'friction    from   bus   stops,
intersections, roadside stalls and other activities which
increased traffic congestion.
The roads under consideration have rougher road surfaces
and poorer shoulder condition than is typical for the
Western countries whore standard speed-flow relationships
were derived.
In short, traditional approaches to congestion reduction
improvements based on experience from more developed countries
cannot be directly translatod to Chile.
12. Attempts were made to confirm the predicted speeds,
through limited field data collection at low to medium traffic
volumes    and   discussion  with   Chilean  engineers   about
provailing conditions at higher volumes. These supported the
approximate   magnitude   of   the   predictions.         Further
verification was provided by a University of Chile research
project (Analisis Coaparativo de Metodologias de Evaluacion de
Proyoctoo Viales en Situaciones de Congestion. 1988) using
traffic simulation in comparison with observed and predicted
speed-flow relationships.
*o*A Condition
13. Road roughness is assumed to increase to quite high
levels both with and without tho proposed road improvement
projects. The effects on predicted savings in operating costs
are discussed further in Para 17. The benefit stream could be
sianificantly affected by alternative maintenance assumptions,
as discussed in Para 33.
3.  CONPoNrTS OY Tn  COmoNxC ANALYSZS
3.1 COSTS
14. Construction. costs vary depending upon how much of the
existing carriageway is retained as part of the final project.
From Table 1. average costa excluding bridges range from U'SS ^.:
to 0.7 million per kilometre. Costs are generally low because:



- 101 -
ANNEX 7
Page 25 of 34
Construction  is  almost  entirely   in  exist':r;  ::a 
reserves, so that little or no land acquis.t-t,n is
required;
Terrain is level or undulating;
Some initial earthworks and culverts have already been
completed as part of previous work at some sites.
15.  Iaintenance cost savings represent one to two percent of
overall benetits.
3.2 DINEFITS
16.  Typical breakdowns of the economic bonefits of selected
projects are shown in Table 3. This breakdown varies over the
life of the project, with vehicle oporating costs dominating
in the early years when flows are lowest and the now pavement
condition is at its best, and travel times dominating in the
latter years when the revirso effects apply.
17.  Vhicle- Oneratla  Costs are the largest single component
of project benefits in all cases.  The savings are largely a
result of changes in road condition, rather tha.n reduced
traffic congestion.  Table 4 shows that unit operating costs
for each vehicle type increase substantially with increasing
roughness, and increase slightly with increasin; v6hicle
speed.
18. The savings in vehicle operating costs are strongly
influenced by the assumed profile of road deterioration and
maintenance both with and 'without the project.   A typical
example is presented in Table 5.   Road roughness develops
quickly to high levels on unimproved road sections, and
gradually increases to high levels even on the improved roads
over the life of tho project. As a result, vehicle operating
cost savings reach a peak in the middle years of the
evaluation period, and decline in the later years.
19. Vehicle operating costs include fuel, tyres, oil, parts
and maintenance, as woll as standing and interes: charges.
Unit costs used in Chile are summarised in Attachment 1.
20.  Additional  fuel   is  consumed  in  congesteI  traffic
conditions due to the need for accelerations and decelerations
in response to varying travel speeds.   The number of speed
change cycles and the extra fuel required were estimated. as a
function of the hourly traffic volume.   Table 3 shows that
this extra cost saving represents about 1 or 2 percent of
overall benefits.
21. Travel_Time _Saviags were the second most important
benefit of the proposed road improvements.  Chilean data show
a hieih vehicle occupancy and a high proportion (around 70
percent) of travellers on paid work time, relative to more
developed countries.  T-ble 6 shows an approximate breakdown
by vehicle class, with valuations of 177 to 251 (USS 0.72 to

based on a rate of 1.35 times tho hourly wage !'r t:se 
work tims. and 0.25 times the average wage for non-worc:t;
travellers.
22. Accident Savings accounted tor about 10 percent of totas
benotits of the proposed projects. The estimates aro based on
research by Gonzales and Jofre (The 8c3nomic Appraisal of
Accidents for Rural load Projects:   The Chilean Case.  PTRC
1902).   This study found a 64 percent reduction in average
accident costs - from 338S to 1214 pesos (1)55 12a80 to 4.i0i
per million vehicle kilometres - arising frcm the cnvers.:n
of two-lane rural roads to four-lane divided roads.
23.  Otbr  2enj3t:a  not  considered  in  the  analysis  cou:4
include:
The value of goods in transit - especially important for
perishable and high-value goods; a particular issue in
Chile may be the value of fruit for export to the U.S.A.
at the and of the permitted export season.  This can be
addod to the value of s4ved time for goods-carrying
vehicles.
The value to the *conoamy of export-oriented  transport
cost savings.
24.  Sensitivit_  Analjses were carried out for each Veo:ec:.
considerzag the effects of 20 percent traffic reduction.  20
percent construction cost increase, and exclusion of acciden-
savings.   Internal rates  of return were reduced  in all o'
these sconarios. but were generally still high enough :t
Justify the projects.
4.   VURYU   DUVWnOHiW  OF ItALUAtfO W NTODS
25. The evaluation of congestion . reduction measures in
developing countries is not woll established, and requires
differeat approaches and models from those which have been
used  in  the  tore  developed  Western  countries.    Chilean
professionals   ia   Vialidad.   consultant   companies   and
universities have demonstrated a h4;h deogre of technical
skill and ability in this aroa. ana should be encouraged to
pursue this topic further. The following paragraphs suggest a
number ot areas in which the evaluation procedures could be
improved.
4.1 VUZV?Ca&Tou o UM UVALUAYZOW PARAINITUS
26. Speed-flow rolationships are an important componont of
the evaluations of congestion improvements, but are based on
limited data.  Automated traffic classifying recorders can be
used to colloct hourly data on traffic flows, and the average
speed and number of each vehicle class.   An advantage  zf
automatic equipment is that longer rocording periods can be
achieved, with more opportunity for capturing peak flow

conditions.  Some analysis is then required to ives::;ste :.e
effects of different levels of improvement, and to 4nders:ani
the effects of very slow or stoppinj and turning vehicles,
Traffic simulation can assist  in this process.   Speed-flow
relationships on different standards of four-lane road should
also be determined.
27. Variations in vehicle operating costs with speed should
be further investigated possibly by comparing the predictions
of 3DM-Xl  with the  currently-used 1DM-11 equations.   The
increasing effect of speeds in Table 4 suggest an increase in
vehicle operating costs with reduced congestion, even at low
traffic speeds.   This  is  unexpected,  and  deserves  closer
examination.   Any change in this relationship is likely to
lead to increased estimates of benefits for congestion
reduction projects.
28. The 64 percent accident cost reduction estimate in these
evaluations appears to be based on the best available data,
but could raise some skepticism among safety professionals,
especially since a number of hazards (uncontrolled access,
rough shoulders, roadside activities, intersections and median
crossings) still exist on some of the improved roads.
Attempts should be made to verify this estimate, or to include
additional safety works in the improvement proposals to ensure
that it will be achieved.
4.2 IUPROVED MOD3LLXNG CAPABILXTIUS
29.  The HDM-I!! model incorporates a number of major advances
over earlier prediction methods, especially in the areas of
road deterioration and maintenance, and free speed prediction.
The calibration and testing of the model for Chilean
conditions should lead to improved evaluation predictions.
The use of 3DB-111 ats. has the advantages of:
Consistency with other evaluations under this project:
Clearer presentation of assumptions and parameters;
Greater   freedom   to   test   alternative   improvement
strategies: and    t
Compatibility with the Bpenditure Budgetting Model
30. While the standard SDM model does not take account of
congested traffic conditions, a modified version of the model
was developed at the World Bank in 1986 (World Bank Technical
Paper No. 74).   This version is being considered in several
countries, but has not yet been used in practical evaluations.
Its application and testing in Chile would be most appropriate
at this stage, in view of the high level of technical skill
and evaluation experience, the likely collection of speed-flow
data (Para 26), and recent studies related to traffic
simulation and congestion. With the modified HDM model, local
speed-flow data can be input directly for each site and
proposed road standard.
31. Mcdelling should bo kept in perspective as an aid to
professional judgement and analysis, rather than a substitute.

4.3  CONSXD3RAZTON OF OTMER IMPROVENIN  ALTURNATIVES
.2. The problems  of  the  *xisting  roads  in  this  analysis
include  a  combination  of  poor  road  surfaces,  traffic
congestion and accidents. While the proposed projects address
all three problems, there are other options for treating thes.~
problems, either separately or in combination.   The analysis
could consider some of the following options:
Road surface improvements only;
Higher road maintenance standards - for the base case,
and both existing and new carriageways in proposed
projects;
Other congestion reduction treatments; and
Other safety treatments.
33. Greater attention to alternative maintenance strategies
is clearly warranted for these projects, where benefits are
largely  from  reduced  road  roughness  rather  than  reduced
congestion.   The high vehicle oporating cost savings in the
middle years of Table 5 suggost that higher maintenance
standards may well bo warranted.
34. The congestion problems on two-lane roads are partly'due
to roadside friction and poor road shoulder quality, as
discussed in para 11. The provision of access control, median
fencing, sealed shoulders, pedestrian paths and bus stops well
clear of the travelled lanes are examples of treatments which
could provide substantial congestion reduction, reflected in a
better spoed-flow relationship.   Changes  in pedestrian  and
driver behaviour may be required to achieve the full benefits
of thesi improvements. Some of these changes may be difficult
to achieve in the short term, but will be required in the
longer torn if capacity, safety and traffic performance are to
be maintained on the four-lane divided roads with increasing
traffic volumes.

CHILE
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR DUAL CARRIAGEWAY ROADS
OUTUNE TERMS OF REFERENCE
Introduction
The analytical models and procedures used by Vialidad for economic
evaluation of highway piejects do not adequately consider the effects of traffic
congestion and are not suitable for the evaluation of munlt-lane highway
facilities and intermediate measures to enhance road capacity. The speed-
flow relationships on two-lane highways in Chile suggest an average speed
reduction of about 50 km/hr. per 1000 veh/hr. increase In traffic volume.
Comparable figures for more developed countries are of the order of 10 to 20
km/hr. per 1000 veh/hr. The factors contributing to this difference are the high
proportion of trucks and buses In Chilean traffic; a wider spread of free speeds
because of low-powered vehicles and driver variations; considerable roadside
"friction" from bus stops, Intersections, roadside stalls and other activites that
inhibit the free tiow of traffic; and rougher road surfaces and poorer shoulder
conditions. Thus the traditional approaches to congestion reduction based on
the experience from more developed countries cannot be directly applied to
Chilean conditions.
Research Obiectives
The objective of the proposed research work Is to develop
approaches and analytical models for the evaluation of congestion reduction
measures on heavily-trafficked roads In Chile.
The research effort would be directed at:
(i) Verification of key evaluation Rarameters
o  Speed-flow relationships are an Important component of the
evaluation of congestion improvements.  Automated traffic
classifying recorders can be used to collect hourly data on traffic
flows, and the average speed and number of each vehicle class.
An advantage of autotnatic equipment Is that longer recording
periods can be achieved, with more opportunity for capturing
eak flow conditions.  Some analysis Is then required to
nvestigate the effects of different levels of improvement, and to
understand the effects of very slow or stopping and turning
vehicles. Traffic simulation can assist In this process. Speed-
flow relationships on different standards of four-lane roads
should also be determined to permit a comparison with
operating conditions on two-lane roads.

ANNEX 7
Exhibit 1, p. 2 of 2
Page 34 of 34
o  Variations  In  vehicle  operating  costs, particularly  fuel
consumption, with speed require further investigation as the
relationships currently used by Vialidad suqgest an increase in
vehicle operating costs with reduced congestion, even at low
traffic speeds.  This is unexpected, and deserves closer
examination. Any change In this relationship is likely to lead to
increased estimates of benefits for congestion reduction
projects.
o  This data can then be incorporated into the HDM-IlI model
(Item 11).
o  Validation of improved safety characteristics of dual carriageway
roads as compared to two-lane roads under similar terrain, traffic
and operating conditons.
(ii) Improved Modellina Capabilities
The HDM-111 model used for the evaluation of the Highway Sector
Project Incorporates a number of major advances over earlier prediction
methods, especially in the areas of road deterioration and maintenance, and
free speed predictIon. The calibration and testing of the model for Chilean
conditions should lead to Improved evaluation predictions. While the standard
HDM model does not take account of congested traffic conditions, a modified
version of the model was developed by the World Bank In 1986 (World Bank
Technical Paper No. 74). The application and testing of this version In Chile
would be most appropr ite at this stage, in view of the high level of technical
skill and evaluation experience, the proposed collection of speed-flow data,
and recent studies related to trafic simulation and congestion. With the
modified HDM model, local speed-flow data could be Input directly for each
project and proposed road standard.
(iti) Assessment of Improvement Alternatives
The congestion problems on two-lane roads are parnly due to
roadside friction and poor road shoulder quality. The provision of access
control, median fencing, sealed shoulders, pedestrian paths and bus stops
well clear of the travelled lanes are examples of treatments which would
provide substantial congestion reduction, reflected In a better speed-flow
relationship. Changes In pedestrian and driver behavior may be required to
achieve the full benefits of these Improvements. Some of these changes may
be difficult to achieve In the short term, but will be required In the longer term
if capacity, safety and traffic performance are to be maintained on the four-
lane divided roads with Increasing traffic volumes. At lower traffic volumes, an
assessment of alternative geometric standards and the use of
overtaking/climbing lanes with adequate shoulders may also be considered.
These lower cost alternatives (as compared to dual carriaoeway roads) need
further Investigation In terms of their applicability to traffic and terrain
conditions In Chile.
