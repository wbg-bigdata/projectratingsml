IMPLEMENTATION COMIPLETION REPORT
CHILE
SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
[Loan 3120-CHI
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Road Sector Project (Chile),
for which Loan 3120-CH in the amount of US$224 million equivalent was approved on September 28,
1989 and made effective on November 28, 1989.
The Loan was closed on June 22, 1994, eight days before the original Closing Date of June 30,
1994. For macro-economic reasons, The Government decided to reduce the share of Bank financing for
the project. As a result, US$44 million of unused funds were cancelled on June 22, 1994. The last
disbursement took place on March 31, 1994.  Cofinancing for the project was provided by the
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and by the Export-Import Bank of Japan (J-EXIM).
The ICR was prepared by Sergio Miquel, consultant LAIIU, and reviewed by Paul Meo, Chief,
LAIPS, Alfonso Sanchez, Senior Manager, OPRPR, and Orville Grimes, Projects Adviser, LA1DR.
The Borrower and Cofinanciers provided comments that are included as appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR started during the Bank's final completion mission, July 18, 1994. It is
based on materials in the project file. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing
its own evaluation of project preparation and execution. which was sent to the Bank by letter 11079 on
November 28. 1994.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
[LOAN 3120-CHI
Evaluation Summarv
Introduction
Prior to this Loan, the Bank had provided assistance to Chile's roads subsector since 1961,
through one credit and six loans totalling US$ 360 million. This long history can be divided into two
distinct phases.  The first four lending operations (1961-79) were characterized by implementation
difficulties, slow execution of works and cost overruns, while the last three projects (1980-1990) were
implemented effectively at significantly lower cost and in a timely manner, fully meeting their objectives.
OED's consolidated Performance Audit Report (PAR 12983) for these three projects (Highway
Reconstruction Project, Loan 1927-CH; Second Highway Reconstruction Project, Loan 2297-CH; and
Road Sector Project, Loan 2589-CH) concluded that these projects belong to the very best series of road
sector operations analyzed in recent years in terms of implementation quality and outcomes. and that they
are outstanding examples for other countries to follow.
Project Objectives
The main objective of the project was to support the Government's careful financial management
and efficient execution of the road investment and maintenance program of the Ministry of Public Works
(MOP). Specifically the project was to help the Government to: (i) strengthen the Road Directorate's
capability through training. (ii) establish an effectively functioning road maintenance and pavement
management organization; (iii) strengthen financing of road maintenance and its execution at all levels;
(iv) further improve the Borrower's competence in economic evaluation of road expenditures; (v) resolve
major traffic congestion problems through widening of main roadways and rehabilitation of main bridges;
and (vi) mobilize in external resources for project implementation.  These objectives remained
substantially unchanged during project implementation.
Based on the successful implementation of the previous loans, the Borrower and the Bank reached
clear and realistic agreements on financial arrangements. scope of technical assistance and studies,
programming of civil works and procurement, disbursement, reporting and monitoring procedures to
promote achievement of project objectives. Project design was coherent and simple. However, its
execution was highly complex, because of the great number of contracts involved (about 2,350), their
diverse nature, the geographic dispersion of the works, and participation of three co-financiers (para 3).
The project objeccives were in line-with the Government's macro-economic policy to foster economic
development and the export capacity of the country, and to increase the efficiency in the delivery of
public services. They were also well geared to promote further strengthening of the already high level
of development and efficiency attained by MOP's Road Directorate under previous Bank-financed
projects.



- iii -
Implementation Experience and Results
The project was highly successful in the achievement of its objectives (paras 4 to 15). It achieved
fully, and even surpassed, all objectives, particularly those related to institutional strengthening of, and
financial allocations to, the road subsector. Through the successful execution of the road widening and
bridge rehabilitation programs, it increased the capacity of the road network and decreased transport
costs, thus fostering the economic development and the export capacity of the country. Most importantly,
it succeeded in consolidating progress achieved in planning, managing, executing and monitoring road
maintenance, and introduced innovative procedures for the contracting of maintenance activities. It also
succeeded in strengthening the Road Directorate's environmental assessment capacity, and assisted in the
development of MOP's privatization policy. These achievements, as well as the Borrower's proven
commitment to the project objectives, suggest that the sustainability of this project will be highly
satisfactory.
The Government was able to increase the financing of the 1990-1993 Road Investment and
Maintenance Program by 18% (from US$907 million to US$1,074 million), which allowed an increase
in works actually executed. Simultaneously the Government improved the relation of maintenance
expenditures to total expenditures, increasing maintenance financing by 25 %, while investment financing
remained constant, thus reflecting its strong commitment to enhanced maintenance of the road system
(para 7). Macro-economic external and internal factors affected the financial arrangements for project
implementation. Originally, the program was to be financed 24.7% by the Bank, 9.4% by IDB, 16.5%
by J-EXIM,and 49.4% by the Government. The economic crises of the late 1980s and IDB's interest
in increasing its participation in the financing of the program, motivated a change in the financial plan.
In 1991, IDB's participation was increased to 27.5% and the Government's decreased to 3 1.3%
(para 17).  The Chilean Government's sound macro-economic policies substantially increased the
availability of local funding during the early 1990s and promoted a replacement of foreign with local
funding. The application of this policy to the financing of the increased program resulted, by project
completion, in an accumulation of undisbursed balances of US$44 million in the Bank loan and of
US$102 million in the IDB loan. These amounts were canceled at the Government's request. The final
financial participation of all parties was: Bank 16.8%, IDB 13.7%, J-EXIM 14% and the Government
55.5%. (para 18). The Borrower completed execution of the expanded program within the time frame
agreed for the original program. However, the administrative costs of operating the program were
double the appraisal estimates (Table 8A), whereas maintenance increased by 25% and new capital
investment not at all. The increase in program costs was mostly due to the alignment of public salaries
with that of the private sector.  Furthermore, since maintenance requires proportionally higher
administrative costs, an increase in the maintenance program was responsible for the remaining increase
in the administrative cost.
There were no major changes in project scope or objectives, except for the following minor
adjustments made through loan amendments in 1990 and 1991: (i) establishment of a special exceptional
procedure for contracting emergency works; (ii) inclusion in the project description of feasibility and
engineering studies for port rehabilitation; and (iii) expansion of the training program to all MOP
Directorates (para 16).
The Bank's performance during preparation, appraisal and implementation of the project was
highly satisfactory and was performed with low staffing input. Full commitment to project objectives,
successful macro-economic performance, high effectiveness of the road administration. continuity and



- iv -
competence of its staff, and the satisfactory performance of consultants and contractors resulted overall
in highly satisfactory performance of the Borrower (paras 21 to 27).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
Project outcome was highly satisfactory (para 28). It not only achieved, but exceeded by a
substantial margin, all major objectives of an expanded original project scope. The strongly positive
economic indicators (NPVs and IERRs) estimated at appraisal were substantially maintained and exceeded
in some cases. All conditions have been met to warrant high sustainability of the project.
The Transport Infrastructure Project, Loan 3426-CH (US$71 million, approved on December 12,
1991) and signed January 21, 1992) is carrying out rehabilitation works of the ports of Valparaiso and
San Antonio, based on engineering studies prepared under Loan 3120-CH (para. 29). The Third Road
Sector Project, Loan 3833-CH, approved by the Board on December 22, 1994, confirms the
Government's commitment to the execution of a comprehensive 1995-1998 Road Investment and
Maintenance Program, including the expansion and strengthening of all policies and subprograms
implemented under the First and Second Road Sector Projects, Loans 2589-CH and 3120-CH. All
technical, financial and institutional arrangements required for effective project operation are in place,
as well as all managerial and staffing resources. No follow-up sector project will be required. However,
the Bank could continue its assistance in the road subsector through Bank guarantees to support the
Government's investment/concession program, or through a small loan geared to further development of
the road safety program.
The main lesson for future projects is that their successful implementation will require:
3     strong commitment by the Government, sector institutions and beneficiaries;
*     coherent and flexible project design, based on relevancy and feasibility of project
components;
*     well-defined and uniform financial, institutional and procurement arrangements applying
to the entire program, including externally funded projects;
*     clear definition of specific performance targets for individual project objectives;
*     favorable macro-economic conditions; and
*     adequate agreements with co-financiers, particularly on harmonization of procurement
practices.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
[LOAN 3120-CHI
PART I PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.     The main objective of the project was to continue to support the Government's careful financial
management through increasingly efficient execution of MOP's road investment and maintenance
program. Specifically the project was to help the Government to: (i) continue to strengthen the capability
of MOP's Road Directorate through a more focused training program; (ii) establish an effectively
functioning road maintenance and pavement management organization; (iii) complete the effort to reach
normal maintenance levels through a distribution of funds balanced between road investment and
maintenance; (iv) reestablish a functional local road maintenance system with improved technical
execution; (v) further improve the Directorate's and ODEPLAN's (National Planning Office) competence
in the economic evaluation of road construction and maintenance activities; (vi) resolve the major traffic
congestion problems through a program of dual roadways; (vii) rehabilitate the main road bridges of the
country; and (viii) assist the Government in external resource mobilization for guaranteed project
implementation.
2.     These objectives reflected clear and realistic agreements reached between the Borrower and the
Bank based on the successful implementation of the First Road Sector Project, Loan 2589-CH (PCR.
11962 dated June 10. 1993; PAR 12983 dated April 21, 1994). They were in line with the Government's
macro-economic policy, supported by the Bank's countrv assistance strategy, to foster economic
development and the export capacity of the country, and to increase the efficiency in the delivery of
public services. These objectives remained substantially unchanged during project implementation.
3.     The project design, entailing technical assistance, institutional strengthening, and execution of
studies and civil works, was coherent and simple. However, its administration was highly complex for
the Borrower because of the great number of contracts involved ( 122 for technical assistance, 212 for
studies and 2.006 for civil works), their diverse nature, the geographic dispersion of the works, and the
participation of three co-financiers. Project implementation was not affected by the radical change of
Government which occurred at an early stage (March 1990), and was easily adjusted to minor changes
of project concepts introduced by the new authorities at a later stage.
B.    Achievement of Objectives
4.     Macroeconomic policies. Through the execution of well designed sub-programs for (i) dualization
of main roadways, (ii) paving of gravel roads, (iii) rehabilitation and construction of major bridges, and
(ivx enhanced maintenance of the road systemn the project increased the capacity of the road network and
decreased transport costs. thus supporting econormic development and the export capacity of the country.
The achievement of this objective was indirectly defined by operational indicators (Table 6) and by the



economic indicators (Table 9) agreed at appraisal. Between 1989 and 1993 the Chilean economy
experienced a substantial increase, as demonstrated by the following rates of increase: vehicle fleet 33%,
average traffic at toll stations 37%, value of exports 15% and value of imports 62%.
5.     The objective of increasing the efficiency in the delivery of public services was formulated in a
general manner and was not quantified. In the first year of project implementation special indicators to
measure the Road Directorate efficiency were developed, without at that time setting specific targets.
These indicators were monitored, fine-tuned, and audited by Contraloria (the Government's Central
Comptroller Office) every year, until reaching for 1993 the indicative values shown in Table SA, which
document the high level of efficiency attained by the Road Directorate in the administration of the road
subsector under the project. This achievement constitutes a model for other MOP Directorates and other
Governmnent agencies.
6.     Transport sector policies. Although the project did not reflect clearly defined sector objectives,
it included three studies on general transport matters (Table 7A), which were successfully executed and
contributed to further strengthening the transport sector. In October 1990 the project description was
expanded to include execution of studies for port rehabilitation. These studies assisted in the preparation
and start-up of the Transport Infrastructure Project, Loan 3426-CH.  In addition, during project
implementation, MOP developed and started to implement a policy to foster private sector investment in
infrastructure, particularly in roads, through preparation of Built-Operate-Transfer (BOT) schemes. The
technical assistance given by the project's supervision missions and the financing under the project of
feasibility and engineering studies required for the preparation of some of these BOT schemes for roads,
contributed to the initial development of this privatization policy, which will be further expanded under
the Third Road Sector Project (Loan 3833-CH).
7.     Financial obiectives. The objective of supporting the Government's careful financial management
of a well-balanced four-year road investment and maintenance program was fully achieved and even
exceeded. The Government was able to increase the financing targets by 18% (from US$907 million to
USS1,074 million, Table 8B), which allowed a higher increase in works actually executed (Table 6).
Simultaneously the Government improved the relationship between maintenance expenditures and total
expenditures, increasing maintenance financing by 25 %, while investment financing remained constant
(Table 8A), thus reflecting its strong commitment to enhanced maintenance of the road system. The
doubling of administration expenditures was caused mainly by a long overdue increase of MOP's salaries
to bring them more in line with those of the private sector.
8.     The objective of assisting in the mobilization of foreign resources for project implementation was
also fully achieved. The Bank helped the Government obtain from the Export-Import Bank of Japan (J-
EXIM) a loan (Loan 1.402.200-CH) in an amount equivalent to US$150 million, which was signed on
March 5, 1990. On March 18. 1991, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) increased its
participation in the financing of the project from the US$85 million initially committed to US$249 million
by canceling the undisbursed balance of an old loan and signing the new Loan 613/OC-CH for US$150.9
million (Table 8B).
9.     Institutional development. The objectives for further institutional development of the Road
Directorate were amply achieved. The Road Directorate's training program was substantially expanded,
doubling the number of courses and increasing the number of participants by more than 30% (Table SB).
In 1991 the program was further expanded to include all MOP personnel, and new subjects were added
to the curriculum. In total. the number of courses increased by 342%, the number of participants by



- 3 -
259 % and the number of professionals receiving training abroad by 208 %. The unit costs per course and
per trainee decreased slightly. The impact of this training program for managers, professionals,
administrative personnel, and foremen, mechanics, operators and laborers was substantial: it assisted in
the modernization of the Road Directorate's management and administrative procedures, strengthened the
performance capability of its staff, and provided training in new technologies.
10.   The objectives of establishing an effectively functioning road maintenance and pavement
management organization and a functional local road maintenance system with improved technical
execution were also substantially achieved. The road maintenance system introduced under the First Road
Sector Project (Loan 2589-CH) was consolidated, became fully operational and was expanded by the
introduction of "global " maintenance contracts, an innovative practice of contracting out road maintenance
projects to private contractors under area-wide contracts at the provincial or sub-provincial level. This
practice frees Government resources that can be applied to improving the maintenance level of low-traffic
local roads. A comprehensive pavement management system that had been eight years in preparation was
implemented under the project, and was complemented by the introduction of a geographic information
system.
11.   The Road Directorate's competence in the economic evaluation of road construction and
maintenance activities was further enhanced by the intensive use of the Bank's Highway Design and
Maintenance Model, Version 3 for Personal Computers (HDM-III), for project evaluation and program
planning purposes, and the introduction of other more sophisticated models for evaluation of congested
roads for preparation of the road widening program. MIDEPLAN (Ministry of National Planning),
successor of ODEPLAN (National Planning Office), also adopted the HDM-III model as its standard tool
for road planning and evaluation.
12.   Physical objectives.  The objectives set at appraisal for solving traffic congestion problems
through construction of dual roadways and rehabilitation of main road bridges, as well as all other
physical targets, were exceeded by substantial margins (Table 6).
13.   Economic results. The economic analysis to confirm net present values (NPV) and internal
economic rates of return (IERR) established at appraisal, carried out with the Bank's HDM-III model by
a group of Chilean consultants and civil servants, is documented in the Government's project completion
report (November 1994). This report confirms the validity of the high economic indicators estimated at
appraisal for the investment components. Representative samples were selected for the three investment
components (Table 9A). In the construction of dual roadways, the 18% reduction in the economic cost,
coupled with a 13% increase in traffic forecasts, resulted in a 271 % increase of the NPV and in a 94%
increase of the IERR estimated at a discount rate of 12%. In the upgrading component, the economic
cost was 2% higher and the traffic about 12% lower, resulting in a 23% percent lower, but still
satisfactory, NPV; the IERR remained unchanged at about 23 %. In the bridge rehabilitation component,
the 32% increase in economic cost and the substantial decrease of heavy traffic (despite a substantial
increase of light traffic), determined a 20% reduction of the NPV (which still amounts to 43 times the
economic cost), while the IERR stayed above 100%.
14.   The economic analysis of the four-year road maintenance program (Table 9B) shows that although
the level of expenditures for some sub-programs changed drastically, the relation between NPV and
economic cost increased substantially and the IERR remained at similar, highly satisfactory levels. The
maintenance programs for asphalt concrete roads and surface treated roads increased by 22% and 100%
respectively, the corresponding NPV increased by 68 % and 178 %, while the IERR decreased slightly for



both programs, because they expanded by including lower priority roads and operations yielding lower
IERRs. A 38 % reduction of the gravel roads maintenance program reduced the NPV by 15 %, while the
IERR remained unchanged at the high estimated level of 42 %. The initially modest earth roads
maintenance program was increased by 815%, which increased its NPV by 152% and maintained the
IERR above 50%. Overall, the economic cost of the maintenance program was 4% lower, the NPV 34%
higher and the IERR 5% lower, but still at the highly satisfactory level of 42%. The ratio between NPV
and economic cost increased from 1.5 to 2.
15. These positive results of the economic confirmation analysis are complemented by a relatively small
improvement in the condition of the road network as shown in Table 9C. The percentage of paved roads
in good conditions increased from 47% to 56%, while roads in fair condition decreased from 40% to
24% and roads in poor condition increased from 13% to 20%. The percentage of gravel and earth roads
in good condition increased from 6% to 8%, roads in fair condition increased from 31 % to 57%, while
roads in poor condition were drastically reduced from 63% to 35%. A faster improvement in road
network conditions would have required higher budgetary allocations for maintenance. as has been
consistently shown in all HDM-III analyses of the network performed in the past eight years.
C.    Major Factors Affecting the Project
16.    There were no major changes in project scope or objectives. However, the following minor
adjustments were made through loan amendments in 1990 and 1991: (i) establishment of a special
exceptional procedure for contracting emergency works, up to an amount of US$5 million, later expanded
to USS8 million; (ii) inclusion in the project description of feasibility and engineering studies for port
rehabilitation; and (iii) expansion of the training program to all MOP Directorates.
17.    Several external and internal factors affected the financing of the project. The need to follow
deflationary fiscal policies in 1990, the first year of the new Administration, compelled the new
Government to seek additional external financing. At that time IDB was interested in reestablishing its
traditional level of participation in the financing of the road subsector in Chile. which had been
diminished and limited by the launching of the 1990-1993 Road Investment and Maintenance program
with joint financing by J-EXIM and the Bank. Extended negotiations of all parties involved led to the
signing on March 18, 1991, of IDB Loan 613/OC-CH for US$246 million (including USS26 million in
fees and interest), coupled with the cancellation of the undisbursed balance of an old loan. This
transaction increased IDB participation in the financing of the program from 9.4% to 27.5%, replacing
Government financing and reducing its participation from 49.4% to 31.3% (Table 8B).
18.    During project implementation, the Chilean economy experienced a remarkable expansion,
bringing an unexpectedly strong flow of foreign currency into the country.  These developments
motivated the Government to take several strong measures to reduce foreign inflows which where
encouraging domestic inflation. Simultaneously, the Government successfully carried out a reform of the
internal revenue system, which substantially increased the availability of local funding. In accordance
with its policy of strict control of Government expenditures, the administration decided not to increase
its overall expenditures, but to replace foreign with local financing. The application of this macro-
economic policy to the project during its last two years of implementation resulted in an accumulation
of an undisbursed loan balance of US$43.8 million, which was canceled, at the Government's request,
on June 22, 1994. For the same reasons, in mid-1994 the Government also canceled the unused balance
from the IDB Loan 613/OC-CH, amounting to US$102 million. Since at the same time the program
was expanded 18 % (para 7), the financial participation of the international lending institutions diminished



substantially (the Bank's from 24.7% to 16.8%, IDB's from 27.5%  to 15.7%, J-EXIM's from 16.5%
to 14%), while the Government increased its financial participation from 31.3% to 54.2%.
19.    All internal factors of the implementing agency favorably affected project implementation.
Management was highly effective, staff capability and continuity were remarkable, and cost variations
were extremely low. Procurement was handled efficiently in accordance with Banik Guidelines, although
two cases of major procurement problems affected project implementation (Table 12): (i) delays in a
continuous flow of LCB procurement of civil works during 1991 because of the need for LCB bidding
documents to accommodate the different thresholds between ICB and LCB procedures required by IDB
when it started joint financing of the project; and (ii) Contraloria's rejection of MOP's award of two civil
works contracts (USS$1 million) to the lowest evaluated bidder, which motivated withdrawal of both
contracts from the project without cancellation of funds, and review of the wording of some paragraphs
of the IKB bidding documents. The program was completed exactly on schedule, the monitoring of
project implementation was highly efficient, and the evaluation was performed in a professional manner.
D.    Project Sustainability
20.    Continued substantial strengthening of the Road Directorate's capacity for planning, managing,
executing and monitoring road maintenance and investment programs, as well as its proven commitment
to project objectives, augur a satisfactory sustainability of this project. The sustainability is further
enhanced by the increasing awareness of the need to allocate adequate financing to the road subsector
among government authorities, in particular in Congress and in the NMinistry of Finance, which has
resulted in a doubling of the road budget between 1990 and 1994. A further 22% budgetary increase
prograrmmed until 1998, in addition to the availability of new private funding resources through the
implementation of the BOT concessions program, will further strengthen the project's sustainability.
Finally, the substantial strengthening of the Road Directorate's capacity for environmental assessment and
monitoring achieved under the project guarantees environmentally correct selection, execution and
maintenance of road works, which contributes significantly to project sustainability. All these factors
ensuring project sustainability will be supported and further expanded under the recently approved Third
Road Sector Project, Loan 3833-CH.
E.    Bank Performance
21.    Proiect Identification and Preparation: Highly satisfactory. During the implementation of the
First Road Sector Project (Loan 2589-CH) the Bank continued its dialogue with the Borrower on Further
development of the jointly agreed strategy for the road subsector in Chile. Building on the positive
experiences gained, the Bank effectively assisted the Borrower in the preparation of all technical,
economic and institutional aspects of the new project. Particular attention was given by the Bank to the
securing of adequate co-financing by J-EXIM.
22.    Proiect Appraisal: Highlv.satisfactory. Project appraisal properly identified all key arrangements
needed for successful project completion. The appraisal mission was staffed with diversified skills
appropriate to the task. It strengthened even further the Borrower's commitment to the project objectives.
and improved on the long-standing agreements with the Borrower for satisfactory implementation and
monitoring of the project. The project design was kept simple and flexible despite the large size of the
program. Project risks were correctly assessed as extremely low. The complex financial package was
adequately arranged. an adequate implementation plan was developed. and appropriate performance



- 6 -
indicators agreed. The Bank's participation in J-EXIM's separate project appraisal was fundamental in
securing adequate financing for project execution.
23.    Supervision: Highly satisfactorv. The remarkable continuity of Bank staff involved in project
preparation, appraisal and supervision elicited constructive dialogue and support between Bank and MOP
staff. Project implementation was monitored closely by the Bank, drawing attention to potential
difficulties in a timely fashion, and contributing in a flexible, helpful and efficient manner to extensions
of the project concept, such as the Borrower's requirement of emergency assistance, performance of
special studies for the ports subsector, extension of the training program, development of MOP's
privatization strategy, and introduction of innovative contracting systems for road maintenance. Given
the amount of the loan disbursements (US$180 million), total staff input from identification to loan
closure (130 staff-weeks) was extremely low, compared with inputs for road projects in other developing
countries
F.     Borrower Performance
24.    Preparation of the Proiect: Highlv satisfactorv. Fully committed to the project objectives, the
Borrower took all necessary actions for project preparation in an efficient and timely manner. All
technical, financial, economic and institutional aspects were thoroughly prepared by Government staff
without assistance from foreign consultants. Special mention should be given to the in-house performance
of the comprehensive economic analysis of the road rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance program
using the Bank's HDM-III Model, as well as of the road widening program using more sophisticated
models that take traffic congestion into account.
25.    Project Implementation:  Highlv satisfactorv. The Government's successful macroeconomic
performance (para. 18) was a main factor ensuring continuity and satisfactory financing of project
implementation.    Close  collaboration  between  MOP  and  the  Ministry  of Transport and
Telecommunications (MTT) ensured the effective implementation of the relatively small sectoral
component of the project (para. 6). The remarkable institutional strength of the Roads Directorate,
further strengthened and expanded under the project, permitted an efficient management of a road
program doubled in size without staffing increases. The high effectiveness of the roads administration
is documented by the administrative efficiency indicators shown in Table 5A. The performance of the
Road Directorate in project execution was of a high standard, mainly due to the continuity, competence
and strong motivation of high, medium, and lower-level staff. MOP management and staff demonstrated
commendable creativity and perseverance in the preparation and execution of innovative additions to the
project contents.
26.    Both local and foreign contractors performed in a highly satisfactory manner. Most works were
completed according to schedule with first-rate standards. Only a few of the smaller local contractors
failed to perform  satisfactorily.  However, in those cases MOP took appropriate action to ensure
satisfactory completion of the works. All studies (207 engineering studies, three special studies on the
transport sector, one on training and another on environmental strengthening, Table 7A) were
satisfactorily completed, predominantly by local consultants. Technical assistance of outstanding quality
and effectiveness was rendered by local consultants through 107 contracts for civil works supervision and
15 contracts for institutional strengthening. project coordination, and pavement research and management
(Table 7B). This extensive technical assistance program contributed fundamentally to the good quality
of engineering studies and work execution, flawless contracting, superb coordination of all project
components and effective project monitoring.



27.    Compliance with Loan Covenants; Highly satisfactory. The Borrower complied satisfactorily
and in a timely fashion with all loan covenants (Table 10). Markedly improved relations between MOP
and the Ministry of Finance ensured timely availability of funding. The close working relationships
between Contraloria and the Road Directorate allowed competent and timely preparation of annual
financial and technical audit reports.  Two major procurement problems (para 19) were handled
efficiently. Management of the project accounts and disbursements was exemplary. Comprehensive
quarterly progress reports were submitted on time. Implementation of studies and technical assistance
was remarkable (para 26).
G.    Assessment of Outcome
28.    Overall rating: Highly satisfactory. As discussed in the previous paragraphs, the project not only
achieved but exceeded by a substantial margin all major objectives and expanded the original project
scope. The high economic indicators (NPVs and IERRs) estimated at appraisal were substantially
maintained and exceeded in some cases. All conditions have been met to warrant high sustainability of
the project.
H.    Future Operations
29.    The Transport Infrastructure Project, Loan 3426-CH (US$71 million, approved December 12,
1991 and signed January 21, 1992) is carrying out rehabilitation works of the ports of Valparaiso and San
Antonio, based on engineering studies prepared under Loan 3120-CH. These works will consolidate and
expand the emergency rehabilitation carried out in both ports after the March 1985 earthquake with
emergency financing made available under the Second Highway Reconstruction Project, Loan 2297-CH.
The Transport Infrastructure Project is also supporting the Government's efforts to improve access to both
above-mentioned ports and to the cluster of ports in the Concepci6n area. Moreover, it is assisting the
Government in the development of policies and actions to expand privatization of port activities in Chile.
This project is part of a ten-year involvement of the Bank in the Chilean port subsector.
30.    To continue their primary and close collaboration in the road subsector, the Borrower and the
Bank in January 1994 agreed to initiate the implementation of a Third Road Sector Project, which was
appraised in March 1993. However, given the sufficient availability of local funding (para 18), the
Government decided to finance the 1994 Road Investment and Maintenance Program entirely with own
resources, and to leave the decision about the contracting of the loan to the new Government that took
office in March 1994. During a July 1994 post-appraisal mission the Borrower informed the Bank that
it had decided to substantially reduce foreign financing of its 1995-1998 Road Investment and
Maintenance Program, using only Bank financing without parallel financing from other institutions. It
was agreed that the US$2 billion 1995-1998 program would receive only US$120 million financing from
the Bank.
31.    The Third Road Sector Project, Loan 3833-CH. negotiated in early November 1994 and approved
by the Board on December 22, 1994, confirms the Government's commitment to the execution of a
comprehensive 1995-1998 Road Investment and Maintenance Program (Table 13), and to further
expansion and strengthening of all policies and subprograms implemented under the First and Second
Road Sector Projects (Loans 2589-CH and 3120-CH). The Bank's modest financial contribution (6% of
project cost)* will support only specific key subcomponents of the 1,-95-1998 Roads Program: (i)
regulatory. feasibility and engineering studies for road concessions:    road safety infrastructure,
equipment and consulting services; (iii) further expansion of the "global" maintenance contracting system;



- 8 -
(iv) procurement of state-of-the-art equipment for the modernization of the vehicle weighing and toll
collection systems; (v) further strengthening of environrnental assessment and risk prevention capability;
and (vi) continuation of the training program.
32.    All technical, financial and institutional arrangements required for effective project operation are
in place. as well as all managerial and staffing resources. Project monitoring and evaluation will be based
on performance indicators similar to those listed in Tables 5. 6 and 9, and will require a relatively small
Bank input. Given the maturity achieved by the Borrower in project financing and implementation, no
follow-up sector projects will be required. However, the Bank could continue its assistance in the road
subsector through Bank guarantees to support the Government's investment/concession program, or
through a small loan geared to further development of the road safety program. A future impact
evaluation by OED could be envisaged after completion of the Transport Infrastructure Project, Loan
3426-Ch and the Third Road Sector Project, Loan 3833-CH.
I.     Key Lessons Learned
33.    The excellent project results are attributable to several factors:
(a)    favorable macroeconomic conditons;
(b)    strong  and exemplary  conmmitment by  the Government, sector institutions and
beneficiaries,
(C)    consistent and flexible project design, based on relevance and feasibility of project
components,
(d)    effective Borrower-Bank relationships and quality and continuity of Bank project staff;
and
(e)    willingness of the Borrower to explore and develop new financial, administrative and
technical methodologies.
34.    Joint co-financing agreements with J-EXIM worked very well; however, joint co-financing with
IDB caused disruption in the extensive LCB bidding of civil works (para 19). This case clearly shows
the need to use parallel co-finanicing with IDB. as long as there is no complete agreement on bidding
procedures and thresholds between both Banks.

I .      In 1991 maintenance expenditures included upgrading costs, which in 1993 were included as investments.
2.      In 1991 the training program for the road Directory's personnel was expanded to include all MOP personnel. The original
training curriculum, which included training in planning, project administration. cost accounting, soil mechanics. testing of materials,
modern road and bridge construction techniques, pavement design and contruction, maintenance planning and monitoring, maintenance
operations, equipment management. risk prevention, human relations and English was vastly expanded. A great number of courses were
added covering computer traininig and programming, environmental assesment atid report writing.

Re: CHILE-Loan 3120-. ml        tation Completion Report
Dear Mr. de Franco,
We received your letter dated August 3, 1995, asking us conunents about your final
report on the captioned project.
First of all, we are very pleased to be informed that the project has implemented fairly
successfully and really appreciate the effort your staff made for the good implementation of
the project.
In terms of the report, we have a general impression that it is well organized,
provided with clear and sufficient explanations and supported by concrete statistics.
Moreover, we are happy that there can be found some good evaluation for the co-financing
with our bank.
However, let us mention about some points that are not clear to us, as follows;
(para.3, line 4)  In this paragraph, there are expression that " project execution was complex
because of participation of three co-financiers." We are afraid that this expression may give a
impression that co-financing in this project did not work or worked not effectively. We think
this is not true and this does not coincide your evaluation for the co-financing with our bank



explained in para.34. In the same reason, the last line of the page v of the Evaluation
Summary needs more explanation to clarify whether there was an adequate agreements with
co-financiers on procurement matters in this project or not. This phrase may be misleading
also.
(para.8, line 3)  The expression "(Loan 1,402,200) " is not clear. It is difficult to know
what this number stands for.
(para.8, line 7)    In Table 8B, the actual foreign costs of JEXIM have increased from the
appraisal estimate foreign costs of JEXIM 0.9 million dollars. How do you explain that ? In
our bank, it is understood that the total disbursement did not exceed US$ 150.0 million as it
is the US$ facility ceiling amount under our Loan Agreement.
(para. 13, Line 7)   The number "374" should be "271" in this case ?
(para.20, line 9)   More detailed explanation about the substantial strengthening of the Road
Directorate's capacity for environmental assessment and monitoring is recommended.
We are looking forward to receiving the final version of the Completion Report and
hope to continue the cooperation with you in the future.
Sincerely yours,
Kazuro Shisido
Director, Division I
