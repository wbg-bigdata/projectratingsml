MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT ECUIVALENT TO USS26.0 MILLION
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria in an amount equivalent to US$26.0
million is submitted for approval. The loan would support Aloeria's efforts to
strengthen its institutional capacity to implement its ongoing program of
economic and social reform. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including
5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.          Background.   The genesis of Algeria's economic problems and the
Government's comprehensive program to address them are fully described in the
Report of the Presidernt for an Economic Reform Support Loan which was approved
by the Board in August, 1989 (Report No. P-5114-AL, paras. 2-19). As that report
indicates, the country is currently in the midst of a wide-ranging reform aimed
at extricating the economy from the web of centralized decision-making and
control.   The objectives are to shift emphasis to market signals, greater
autonomy for public enterprises, an enhanced role for the private sector,
establishment of a sound financial system, and the pursuit of macroeconomic
policies that engender strong and stable growth while maintaining domestic and
external balance.
3.          The Government is convinced that the success of the economic reform
is critically dependent on an institutional structure that can ensure adequate
implementation of the reform measures. Discussions with the Government during
1989 brought to light a series of institutional shortcomings in the planning,
organization, and general management capabilities of the Ministry of Economy
(MOE) and the Central Bank (BCA), the core agencies responsible for executing
the economic reform program.   Absence of adequate auditing and accounting
capabilities, serious staffing deficiencies, and inadequate information and
office technology svstems are some of the key factors constraining the two
institutions from assuming their significantly new responsibilities. After years
of lax budgetary planning procedures and more or less automatic access to
financing from the Central Bank and the financial sector, the MOE is now expected
to tighten budgetary planning and expenditure control procedures and to increase
the efficiency of its resource mobilization.   Similarly, the BCA has had no
tradition of independence from the Treasury.   It was not entrusted with the
conduct of monetary policy or even the monitoring of monetary trends. Moreover,
low priority was given to BCA's supervision of commercial banks and to the
management of credit policy, as BCA had no system of tracking the distribution
of credit or the cost of funds to final borrowers.   Now that most public
enterprises have become autonomous, the need to conduct thorough audits of
enterprise accounts is pressing to allow adequate monitoring of their
performance.  Finally, during the preparation of the Economic Reform Support
Loan, a number of areas were identified for more detailed studies to guide the
next stages of reform. The need to implement these studies and to strengthen
the core ministries and agencies led the Government of Algeria to request
institutional assistance in the form of a loan for a Technical Assistance
Project.



4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the proposed
project reflects the broad-based contribution that it has been asked to make to
Algeria's economic reform efforts. This project closely complements the policy
analysis and advice t'.at is the focus of the recently approved Economic Reform
Support Loan. Strengthening the capabilities of the core economic agencies in
Algeria, improving the quality of information that goes into decision-making,
and developing tools that can be used to evaluate better the effectiveness oi
policy measures will go a long way toward ensuring better implementation of the
economic programs supported by the Bank and the IMF.  In this respect, the
proposed loan will finance some computer equipment, related software, and the
needed training for the implementation of the IMF technical assistance proposals
in the area of tax administration and budgetary systems.   The Government's
request for technical assistance reflects an awareness that the Bank is uniquely
positioned to help design and support a program of institutional strengthening
to complement the reform measures, and to coordinate technical assistance from
other sources.  In the Board discussion of the Economic Reform Support Loan,
there was strong support for speedy preparation of a parallel technical
assistance project.
5.          Project Objectives.  The overnll objectives of the project are to
facilitate implementation of the economic reform measures and to initiate the
strengthening of the planning and management capabilities of government agencies
involved in the reform process.   The project aims at:   (a) upgrading key
managerial, technical and administrative skills in the MOE and the BCA;
(b) strengthening the skills of the staff of the country's seven banks, to
prepare them for their new role in the decentralized environment; (c) upgrading
the auditing capabilities within the country and initiating comprehensive audits
of 20-30 enterprises on a pilot basis; (d) supporting improvements in the area
of foreign liability management, both in terms of strengtnening debt reporting
capabilities and assisting the country in exploring innovative ways of reducing
the burden of debt-service; and (e) improving the efficiency of day-to-day
operations of the MOE and BCA, through simplification and computerization of
routine procedures and supporting the IMF's efforts to strengthen tax
administration.
6.          Proiect Descrigtion.  The project encompasses assistance in three
areas:
(i)   Technical assistance to the MOE:   this component stems from the
rapidly evolving nature of the Ministry, which implies a growing need
for better budgetary planning and expenditure control procedures and
for increased efficiency in resource mobilization.  The proposed
component, part of a longer-term strengthening program, would
initiate improvements in the following critical areas: implement
a training program for the different directorates of the MOE;
simplify and modernize the management procedures, and computerize
operations as needed; and prepare (in the form of planning and
purchase of urgently needed equipment) the first phase of cadastral
surveys, which are a high priority in view of the changes in the



areas of tax reform, reform of local finance, and transfer of public
land to private hands.
(ii)  Technical assistance to financial sector agencies: this component,
part of a larger Bank program under preparation for strengthening
the financial sector, consists of technical assistance to the Central
Bank of Algeria to enable it to assume its new responsibilities for
managing, implementing and monitoring monetary and credit policies,
supervising the newly autonomized banks, and to improve the
management of foreign resources; to provide audit training and audits
of selected public enterprises; and to provide training for staff
of the seven recently autonomized banks, to enable them to operate
more efficientlv in the new decentralized environment.
(iii) Technical assistance for undertaking a limited number of studies
required for the effective implementation of the Economic Reform
Program in the next two years. These studies, covering areas where
information is lacking and where analysis is needed to design and
implement the next phase of reform, consist of the following:  a
study of ways to promote non-traditional exports; a study to advise
on the next phases of the liberalization of the price system; a study
of ways to better utilize the funds of insurance companies; a study
to examine the incidence of consumer subsidies, for targeting them
better to reduce the burden of the reform on the most vulnerable
groups in the society; a statistical survey to measure living
standards; and finally, studies pertaining, inter-alia, to various
aspects of local government development such as fiscal resources,
accounting, land management and organisation of local public
services.
7.          Actions Agreed upon.   During negotiations,  final agreement was
reached on the terms of reference for the various studies and other components
and on the timetable for the key activities. In addition, agreement was reached
on the following actions: (a) the Directorate for External Economic Relations
(DREE) will have overall responsibility for the project; (b) the directorate
mentioned in (a) will be strengthened as needed to be able to assume the
responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of the project, including the
preparation of quarterly progress reports for the Project Management Group and
the Bank; (c) no later than June 30, 1990, and at least once a year thereafter,
the Bank and the Government will carry out a joint review of the project
implementation; (d) the Center for Research and Development (CRD), with
appropriate statutes and means, will be responsible for the audit componant;
(e) no later than June 30, 1990, 20-30 public enterprises will e selected for
the audit exercise; (f) the appointment of the Director of CRD will be a
condition for disbursement of that component; (g) the Admin.kcrator of the Inter-
Bank Training Organization (SIBF), responsible for the banking training
component, will be selected no later than September 30, 1990; (h) the signature
of the SIBF subsidiary loan agreement will be a condition of effectiveness; and
(i) on-lending arrangements for the project component not pertaining to MOE and
BCA were also clarified.



8.          Benefits. No matter how well-conceived economic reforms are, their
benefits cannot be fully derived without a sufficiently strong institutional
structure to implement them.  The proposed project would: (a) strengthen the
capabilities cif the two main economic agencies, namely MOE and BCA, to cope
better with their new functions through training of their staff, improving their
ability to process in a timely fashion the data vital to economic decision-
making, and ensuring adequate monitoring of the economy, while at the same time
smoothing the transition toward a decentralized economic management structure;
(b) help to prepare staff of the newly autonomous banks to operate in a more
market-oriented environment; (c) initiate development of the hitherto neglected
auditing and accounting functions to ensure that public enterprise autonomy is
not divorced from their accountability to the state as the main shareholder; and
(d) enable the Government, through the studies agreed upon, to identify and
design the next phases of economic reform.
9.          Risks.   Typically in projects of this type, the large number of
beneficiaries and varied composition of the project suggest a risk stemming from
the difficulty of ensuring sustained project implementation through proper
coordination. However, in this project this risk has been minimized in a number
of ways: (a) in agreement with the Government, the size of the project has been
deliberately kept moderate, with emphasis on items of prime urgency and with an
option for a follow-up operation of this type if deemed necessary and feasible;
(b) while there are many proiect beneficiaries, the number of interloctitnrs fnr
the activities is limited, and their functions and responsibilities have been
clearly defined; (c) the formalization of the Project Management Group, headed
by the Director for External Economic Relations of the MOE and supported by
adequate staff to handle the day-to-day aspects of the project, should facilitate
project implementation; and (d) the project lays substantial emphasis on staff
training. Finally, officials and staff in the various agencies have expressed
great interest in the project. They have been actively involved in the design
of project activities, definition of the monitoring procedures, and formulation
of the terms of reference for the studies to be financed by the project.
10.         Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

TECHNICAL hNN
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.           Discussions with the Government of Algeria in the context of
preparation of the Economic Reform Support Loan, as well as other ongoing Bank
work, have brought to light a number of institutional weaknesses in the policy
design, implementation and monitoring capabilities in various key economic
agencies. Staffing deficiencies, particularly in specialized skill areas, are
widespread.   Information systems are often inadequate,  given the lack of
appropriate technology and the cumbersome nature of current procedures. No less
problematic is the lack of adequate control mechanisms, a result of the limited
auditing capabilities within the country.   Serious lags in the reporting of
monetary data complicate the Central Bank's newly assumed task of implementing
and monitoring the effects of monetary and credit policies.   Moreover, the
insufficiently developed technical standards in the banking profession could make
it difficult for banks to play a more active role in resource mobilization and
in improving the efficiency of resource allocation. Weaknesses in these areas
represent major constraints on the ability of key ministries and institutions
to implement adequately fiscal, monetary, trade, pricing and sectoral policies
as envisaged in the Government's reform program.
2.          The  project  encompasses  technical  assistance  in  three  areas:
technical assistance to the Ministry of Economy (MOE), technical assistance to
other agencies, and the financing of, and provision of support for carrying out
studies.
Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Economy
3.          The MOE is the focus of a major part of the technical assistance
program proposed by this project. This stems from the rapidly evolving nature
of the Ministry and the new, dynamic role it is called upon to play. After years
of lax budgetary planning procedures, more or less automatic access to financing
from the Central Bank and the financial sector, negligence of key services such
as cadastre, and shortcomings in budgetary management and expenditure control
that have resulted in a significant build-up of arrears in the public sector,
the MOE is now expected to tighten budgetary planning and expenditure control
procedures and to increase the efficiency of its resource mobilization
capabilities.   The program proposed here, part *f a larger program being
undertaken by the MOE, is designed as the first phase in supporting the process
of adjustment. It includes the following critical areas:
4.          Mi) Training. The purpose of this component is to ensure that the
Ministry's personnel can assume the new functions which are being assigned to
them in the context of a reorganized MOE.  A study was carried out by the
Algerian authorities in the latter part of 1988 to evaluate existing MOE
personnel.  It was found that nearly 75% of the staff had an education level
equivalent or inferior to the secondary level, and that there was urgent need
to retiain some 15,600 (nearly 70% of total) of them.



- 11 -
5.          The training program has been designed to take into consideration
the recommendations of that study. The first phase will entail the training of
trainers for the program and the implementation of the training cycles (starting
with the selection of candidates); for this, 4.5 man-months of TA will be needed
to develop curriculum modules, participate in the training of trainers and
evaluate their results (cost: $67,000, plus $94,000 in local trainers' costs).
The first phase will also entail the provision of equipment needed for
implementing and managing the training program, for documentation, for outfitting
training centers and for transportation of trainees, at a total cost of $477,000
(of which $338,000 will be foreign costs).  Finally, the initial phase will
entail the financing of a study to supplement the one already carried out to
define precisely needs in human and other resources, recommend priorities for
training and to complete the implementation plan of the MOE's training program
(total cost: $560,C00, of which $435,000 will be foreign costs).
6.          The second phase will entail the upgrading of MOE person:iel's skills,
as well as the implementation of the training program to improve the technical
skills of some 7,600 MOE employees.   The program should ensure that MOE
personnel's skills in areas such as public finance, administrative law, civil
and commercial law, accounting and public accounting are upgraded, and
supplemented by the requisite technical support skills to design and establish
new organizational systems. This phase is exp.cted to cost about $600,000 of
which $425,000 is in foreign exchange.
7.          (ii)  Computerization.      An  equally  pressing  task  is  the
computerization of MOE operations, which is essential to improve economic
and financial management in the Ministry. This will be achieved through
(a) simplification and modernization of management procedures;
(b) rationalization of information requirements; (c) development of enhanced
management information systems; and (d) expansion of the Ministry's capability
in automating information processing. Overall responsibility for this component
has been assigned to an Informatics Working Group comprising representatives of
the various directorates in the Ministry. The proposed computerization strategy
has two phases.
8.          The first phase of the program concentrates on high priority items
which are urgently needed. It consists of expanding the computing capacity of
the Tax Directorate. It also includes the setting up of fourteen sites in the
Wilaya of Algiers, to serve as pilot sites for the computerization of the MOE's
operations.    Six  of  these  sites  (for  which  the  Entreprise  Nationale
d'Organisation et d'Information, ENORI, has responsibility) are devoted to tax
collectiou and records.  The remaining eight sites (for which the Entreprise
Nationale des Systems Informatiques, ENSI, is responsible) concentrate on other
services of thM Ministry, namely budgetary planning and expenditure control.
The proposed project would provide technical assistance to the MOE staff in
designing a generalized computerization strategy, based on the experience in
training, system coordination and applicability of software to the problems on
hand, for the eventual computerization of all MOE operations on a nation-wide
basis.



- 12 -
9.          The second phase of the program would cover three specific areas:
the first consists of the development of a computerization master plan, including
strategy and action plans for the incremental computerization of priority
functional areas of the Ministry. The other two focus on improving resource
mobilization and public expenditure management. They would include defining (in
conjuction with the IMF) and computerizing a unique tax identification system,
introducing computerized tax simulation, audit and control mechanisms and an
enhanced public accounting system. This phase would also include Improvements,
through streamlining of procedures and the introduction of micro-computer
technology, of the external services of the Ministry.   It would also stress
system integration and internal compatibility, parallel training of personnel
in the operation and maintenance of equipment and software, and flexibility of
system design to take into account the evolving role of MOE.
10.         The proposed project  will  finance  the foreign  exchange  costs
($5.5 million) of this component, which includes the purchase of equipment ($2.4
million), technical assistance for the master plan ($0.3 million), maintenance
and supplies ($1.6 million), software development ($0.5 million) and training
($0.7 million).
11.         (iii) National Cadastre. Cadastral coverage of the country is a high
priority for the foreseeable future, given the changes anticipated in the areas
of tax reform and the decentralization of a sizeable part of the financial
management to the local level. A reliable base for tax purposes is, therefore,
a pre-requisite. Moreover, in the agricultural sector, with the dismantling of
the cooperatives and the redistribution of land to private hands, the adeqaate
recording of the new plots and users requires an appropriate information system,
in the form of a national cadastre. Such a cadastre exists in a very rudimentary
form at the moment.
12.         The Government has, therefore, decided to develop such a cadastre
and, for this purpose, has created a specialized autonomous body, the Agence
Nationale du Cadastre (ANC). A decision, however, needs to be taken on the type
of cadastre that should be developed. At the same time, measures need to be
taken to ensure that ANG will have available (a) the necessary photographic
documents that will provide the physical basis for the cadastre, and (b) a
minimum of equipment to start making a full use of the above documents.
13.         In the above context, and as a first phase (total cost $1.9 million,
of which $1.4 milllion is in foreign exchange) of the development of the
cadastre, the project will finance:
(i)   a study to help the Ministry of Economy and ANC decide on the
type of cadastre the country should be equipped with;
(ii) the purchase of an additional "restituter" (to produce detailed
maps from orthophotoplans); and



- 13 -
(iii) the purchase of various implements to help ANC carry out
physical on-site controls.
Technical Assistance to Financial Sector Agencies
14.         (iM  SupDort to the Central Bank.  BCA is expected to play a major
role in the reform process that is currently unfolding, as it in now responsible
for the implementation of monetary policy, as well as the supervision of the
banking system, which has been given primary responsibility for introducing
financial discipline in the economy. In view of the passive role of the BCA in
the past, the Alge%ian authorities deemed it essential to formulate a realistic
short-term development plan of action for it through 1990.
15.         A review of BCA's organization and activities reveals that the BCA
is generally staffed with competent managers, so that the expansion of the BCA's
human resources can largely draw on existing ones, and training programs can be
used to refine and better focus the skills of current and new personnel. The
five main areas where TA is deemed essential are: (a) the reform of the banks'
accounting system to allow BCA to monitor monetary trends as well as the
performance of financial institutions (estimated cost: $350,000); (b) training
programs for most departments of BCA, to supplemant that undertaken under the
banking training component (see below) by providing training to 200 to 300 senior
staff, middle managers or university recruits in the areas of money market
management,  management  of  foreign  assets,  foreign  resources  management,
rediscounting, setting up a centralized risk evaluation scheme (Centrale des
Risques), check clearing, coordination of the activities of BCA's network of
offices, etc. A consultant would be used by the Personnel Department (cost:
$40,000) to define training needs and identify sources of training, and trainirg
programs would be developed to cover priority needs in the Credit Department
($290,000), the Research Department ($350,000), and the Foreign Department
($270,000); (c) supporting improvements in the area of foreign resources
management in terms of strengthening debt reporting capabilities and assisting
in the training of selected staff of BCA, banks and some enterprises in risk
management strategies aimed at reducing the debt-service burden of external
borrowing; (d) computerization and information systems program, for which the
TA program will finance the cost of a consultant ($250,000) to evaluate needs
in this area and design an appropriate computerization scheme with BCA
management; and (e) miscellaneous equipment to meet the urgent computer needs
of the Foreign, Credit and Research Departments ($465,000). To this should be
added, the financing of equipment needed by the Cash Handling iepartment for
the counting of bills and the transport of cash (cost: $5.0 million).
16.         (ii) Banking Training.  Under the reform, banks will now be fully
responsible for mobilizing and allocating their resources. This will call for
skills that the staff of these institutions are poorly endowed with at present.
Training this staff in a number of activities, therefore, is critical. For this



- 14 -
purpose, the banks have created an autonomous training enterprise, the Soci6t6
Inter-Bancaire de Formation (SIBF), in which they are equal shareholders.
17.         SIBF operations will encompass three different types of training:
(i) remedial workshops, (ii) core courses, and (iii) specialized seminars.
Because of the overall shortage in the country of the banking skills sought, SIBF
will initially have a limited national training staff. The project, scheduled
to unfold over a 2.5 to 3 year period, will finance primarily foreign technical
services to upgrade the skills of the current staff of SIBF, train additional
staff for SIBF, and help implement the training programs adopted by that
enterprise.
18.         The project will  also  finance  the preparation of pedagogical
materials, including local case studies, and the purchase of equipment to deliver
training to the banks' staff. Over the project execution period, SIBF will be
operating in the buildings of INF (Institut National des Finances).
19.         Finally,  the project will finance  (i) technical assistance to
strengthen the SIBF, (ii) a study to design and help implement the reform of
professional training of high school graduates to enter the banking profession,
and (iii) the design and preparation of additional specialized seminars.
20.         Remedial  workshops  will  cover  basic  mathematics,  economics,
accounting, computer science and business law.  They will be carried out in
sessions of 4 to 6 weeks by national trainers, addressing groups of about 16
people. The total number of beneficiaries would be about 500. These workshops
will call for about 600 man-days of national trainers.
21.         Core  courses will  cover project appraisal,  management control
systems, operational and marketing organization. Each course will last a maximum
of 3 to 5 days, and will address groups of about 20 trainees.   The expected
number of beneficiaries is 400. These courses will call for about 300 man-days
of trainers; over the project implementation period, half of the trainers time
needed will be provided by foreign specialists.
22.         Specialized seminars will deal in depth with a number of topics,
including the four covered by core courses as well as others such as financial
planning, risk analysis and foreign trade financing. Seminars will last 5 to
10 days, depending on the topic, and will address groups of 12-14 trainees. Some
trainees, over time, may take several seminars. The total number of traineeships
provided would be about 350. This program will require about 500 man-days of
trainers (including preparation, follow-up of trainees and seminar evaluation)
of which about three-fourths will be provided by foreign specialists.
23.         The training of national trainers -about 50, in three groups- will
be done mostly in specialized centers abroad. Applied pedagogical sessions will
be administered in Algeria;   these will require approximately 30 man-days of
foreign specialists. The total cost of this component is estimated at about $3.5
million of which about $1.4 million is in foreign exchange.



- 15 -
24.         (iii) Audit Training.   An important aspect of the Government's
economic reform program is the delegation of greater autonomy to public
enterprises (Entreprises Publiques Economiques, EPE).   To make this change
operationally effective and to monitor its effectiveness, there will be a need
to know with greater accuracy the worth, at the outset as well as at later dates,
of the EPEs' assets and liabilities.
25.         This will call for radical improvements in accounting practices,
and for systematic independent audits. Because of the past orientation of the
country's economic management, the population of registered accountants and
professional auditors in Algeria is very small.   The development of the
accountancy/audit profession and proper accounting practices in the country is
the objective of the audit training component of the project, as well as that
of the pilot program of audits, presented in paras. 32-36.
26.         To address medium and long term needs, a study will be undertaken
under the project, to design a reform of the programs leading to lower
professional degrees in accounting.
27.         The immediate and major concern of the audit training component,
however, will be the delivery over the next 2.5 to 3 years, of some 400 external
auditors and about 1,000 internal auditors. Because of the magnitude of these
numbers, the project will focus on the training of trainers.  Also, because the
management culture in EPEs will only gradually evolve before the need to have
internal auditors is fully appreciated, the project will give a priority to the
training of external auditors.
28.         In the absence of an organized profession, the training of auditors
- over the project implementation period - will be the responsibility of INF
(Institut National des Finances).
29.         As in the case of the banking training, the audit training component
will include (a) the training of trainers, (b) the preparation of pedagogical
materials, (c) training sessions abroad for future trainers, (d) technical
assistance  to  run,  and  later  on  co-run,   the  training  of  future
accountants/auditors, and (e) the purchase of equipment to permit the delivery
of all the scheduled training.
30.         Approached as described above, the training of about 400 external
auditors will require the following mobilization of foreign specialists: about
100 man-days   to develop the training package,  60 man-days for training
(technically and pedagogically) about 25 trainers, and 76 man-weeks to run and
co-run the seminars themselves.
31.         Similarly, the training of about 1,000 internal auditors will require
the following mobilization of foreign experts: 55 man-days to develop a package
(which takes substantially from the previous package), 60 man-days to train about
40 trainers, and about 25 man-days to run/co-run seminars and to provide
complementary training to trainees, after they have developed some practical
experience back in their respective enterprises.   The total cost of this



- 16 -
component is estimated at about $3.7 million, of which $2.25 million is in
foreign exchange.
32.         (iv)    Pilot  Program  of Audits.    Investigations  by national
authorities, as well as by foreign specialists, of the present situation of EPEs
have established that the situation varies widely among enterprises, and no
estimate is really possible -at this stage- of the effort that should be
undertaken nationwide before the 400 EPEs are eventually audited.   These
investigations, however, have established that (a) frequently, audits will not
be possible before accounts are significantly straightened and cleaned up, and
(b) for the next 2.5 to 3 years , national capabilities and capacities to
undertake such exercises will fall very short of needs.
33.         As a result, a pilot program has been designed to clean up the
accounts of 20-30 selected EPEs to a level that would allow audits, and to launch
a program of audits of these EPEs.
34.         For each of the 20-30 identified EPEs, the pilot program will involve
the following sequence of activities:
(i)   carrying out a diagnosis of the accounting situation of the EPE;
(ii)  designing a detailed work program of audits based on the above
diagnosis;
(iii) carrying out the audits; and
(iv)  drawing  from  the  exercise,  conclusions  and  recommendations
(conventionally referred to as "lectre de commentaires") of the
potential usefulness for other EPEs, in their present or future
situation;
35.         Conclusions and recommendations from individual exercises will then
be brought together and aggregated in a manual to EPE managers to start acting
on a number of procedures and practices in their enterprises.
36.         It is difficult to estimate an average cost of the work to be carried
out on the 20-30 EPEs. Therefore,
(i)   terms  of  reference  (TORs)  have  been  prepared  for  foreign
accounting/audit companies, presenting the scope and sequence of
work sought;
(These TORs indicate that (a) these foreign companies will be
required to have on each of their team, two nationals recently
graduated from the audit training program, and (b) a condition of
the possible renewal of their contract will be the effectiveness of
their coaching of the nationals on their team.)



- 17 -
(ii)  a fund, amounting to US$4.1 million in foreign exchange, has been
set up to undertake the pilot program and to help CRD (see section
(iii) below) analyze about 20 EPEs yet to be autonomised and provide
support to the monitoring of the effect of the autonomisation; and
(iii) a special entity ("Centre de Recherche et D6veloppement", CRD) has
been set up under the Ministry of Economy to manage the above fund,
produce the manual and prepare the blueprint for the national program
mentioned earlier. The total cost of this component is estimated
at about $6.3 million.
Studies
37.         The four studies and a statistical survey to be financed under this
project, all agreed upon in the context of the Economic Reform Support Loan,
cover areas where information is lacking and where analysis could be useful in
the design and implementation of the next phase of reform. Terms of reference
for these have been discussed with the relevant Algerian authorities, and
agreement has been reached on all substantive issues.  The four studies are
expected to be completed during 1990, while the statistical survey will be
completed by September 1991.
38.         The first study relates to the liberalization of the price system.
The objectives of the study are to evaluate the extent of price controls and
their evolution over time, to estimate the real costs of controls, to evaluate
the potential impact of a removal of controls, and to formulate an action plan
for their phasing out. The study will comprise an examination of the current
system of price controls, study of factors  that could affect the decontrol
process, calculation of the cost of controls in terms of economic efficiency
lost, and recommendations on measures to liberalize prices.   The study will
require 180 man-days of consultants and have an estimated base cost of about
$150,000; physical and price contingencies for this and other studies were
estimated at 10-12X. The Directorate of Prices in MOE will have responsibility
for this study.
39.         The second study concerns incentives and institutional suRport for
non-traditional exports. Algeria's interest in this area stems from its heavy
dependence on hydrocarbons, which account for 97% of its export revenues. Major
macro policy distortions, including an overvalued exchange rate, are being
addressed in the context of the Government's economic reform program. There are
also, however, sectoral policy, infrastructural and institutional disincentives
to the promotion of non-traditional exports. The proposed study will entail
an analysis of agricultural, industrial and service markets to identify
exportables, a study of the current export support mechanisms and incentive
structure, their comparison with those existing in other countries, and
recommendations for stimulating non-traditional export growth. The study will
require 300 man-days of consultants and have an estimated base cost of $240,000.
The Directorate for Export Promotion in MOE will have responsibility for this
study.



- 18 -
40.         The third study deals with the utilization of the funds of insurance
companies. The objective of the study is to analyze the situation of insurance
companies, evaluate the supervisory framework in which they operate, evaluate
the possibility of involving them in financial markets, and make recommendations
about ways to bring this about. The study will include an examination of the
current situation of insurance companies, projections regarding the evolution
of their resources, and recommendations for reforms of regulations governing
their operations. The study will require 200 man-days of consultants and have
an estimated base cost of about $160,000. The Directorate for Insurance in the
MOE has the responsibility for this study.
41.         The fourth study will examine the incidence of consumer subsidies.
Its objectives are the determination of characteristics of population segments
benefitting from subsidies, and evaluation of ways in which the efficiency of
subsidy programs can be improved. The study will include the analysis of the
purported objectives of subsidy programs, the examination of the redistributive
impact of subsidies, and the evaluation of a strategy for improving targeting.
The study will require 300 man-days of consultants and have a base cost of about
$250,000. The National Planning Agency (CNP) has responsibility for this study.
42.         The statistical survey is designed to measure living standards
(LSMS). Its objective is to analyze, using intrasectoral comparative methods,
the causality between different policies and indicators of living standards.
The survey will require preparatory work such as the selection of a household
sample and the setting up of the apparatus for the survey (about three to six
months). The survey itself will require some 12 months, with 3 months for the
processing of results.  The study will have a total base cost of about $1.9
million,  including  $0.4 million  in  foreign  costs.    The  CNP  will  have
responsibility for it.
43.         Another $1.4 million has been included in the project to finance
studies related, inter alia, to local government development and in particular,
fiscal resources, local public accounting, land management, and reorganisation
of local public services.   First drafts of the terms of reference have been
discussed and are scheduled to be finalized in the next 2 to 3 months after the
Government has taken a position on its new orientations via a vis local
governments.
SECTION B: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
Management
44.         The Director for External Economic Relations (DREE) in the Ministry
of Economy (MOE) will have overall responsibility for the project. He will be
assisted by the Project Management Group (PMG) composed of representatives of
the various entities involved in the project.
45.         For  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  project  relating  to
implementing, monitoring and reporting, DREE will assemble a small team as



_ 19 _
necessary, by drawing from the staff of the sub-directorates under his
responsibility.
Monitoring and Reporting
46.         The PMG would approve the annual work program, together with the
related budget, and would review their implementation on a quartsrly basis to
coordinate project actions, review progress and take appropriate corrective
measures. During negotiation, agreement was reached on the program of work for
the first year of implementation, and on carrying out of an annual joint Bank-
Government review of the progress made and plans for the following year.
47.         The DREE and his project team will prepare quarterly status and
progress reports for the PMG and the Bank, based on reports submitted by agencies
responsible for each of the components.
Accounts and Audits
48.         Separate accounts will be kept for all expenditures made under the
project.   The DREE team will maintain records and accounts for all prrject
activities. The accounts and statements of expenditures will be audited annually
by external auditors acceptable to the Bank, and submitted no later than six
months after the close of the financial year.
Coordination with Other Agencies
49.         The IMF has recently provided the Government technical assistance
in reforming the tax administration and the budgetary system, and in the
strengthening of commercial bank supervision and control by the Central Bank.
The Bank staff have worked closely with the Fund staff, and the proposed project
will finance some computer equipment, related software and the needed training
for the implementation of the IMF proposals.
50.         The Bank staff have also been in close contact with the UNDP and the
French Ministry of Economy and Finance (Economic and Financial Cooperation
Division) to ensure adequate coordination and to avoid duplication. About $1.2
million has been made available by UNDP and UNIDO for technical assistance for
the MOE. The IMP would be executing agencv for the UNDP assistance program.
SECTION C: PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
Cost Estimates and Financing
51.         The total cost of the project is estimated at $41.0 million
equivalent, including approximately $2.2 million in taxes and duties.   The
foreign exchange cost is estimated at $27.3 million, representing 67X of the
total estimated costs. The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. The proposed loan of $26 million would finance 95X of the foreign
exchange cost of the project.



- 20 -
52.         The studies to prepare the implementation of the reform will be
carried out by individual specialists or specialized institutes and are estimated
to require 120 man-months at a total cost of about $3.0 million. The studies
on local government development are estimated to cost $1.2 million, and another
$0.2 million have been included in the project to finance studies related to the
implementation of the economic reform. The average man-month cost (based on the
individuals' fees, international travel and local allowances) is expected to be
about $25,000 per month. The total estimated cost also includes provision for
the cost of local travel and some other minor items.
53.         The training and advisory services will require 380 man-months of
consultant services and have an estimated total cost of $6.9 million.   The
average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees, international travel and
local subsistence, is expected to be about $18,000 per month. In addition to
these  personnel  costs,  the  contract  cost  includes  the  cost  of  local
transportation and other minor items.  The technical assistance for the pilot
audit program will require the services of specialists at a monthly man-month
cost ranging from $18,000 to $25,000.   The number of man-months of these
specialists cannot be specified because of the expected variety of situations
met in the 20-30 enterprises scheduled to benefit from this program and, as a
result, the important variations in the scope of the work to be carried out on
each of these enterprises. The total foreign exchange allowance for this program
is $4.1 million.
Procurement
54.         The breakdown of project expenditure by procurement method is shown
in Schedule B. The procurement arrangements will be as follows:
(a)   Consultant services:  The specialists for technical assistance, for
training (for staff in the banking sector, the audit/accounting
sector as well as HOE) and for studies to be financed under the
project would be recruited by the Government from among individual
consultants or consulting firms in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for use of consultants.   The TOR, list of firms or
institutions, and letters of invitation would be reviewed with the
Bank before inviting proposals.
(b)   Equipment:  Computer equipment grouped in lots totalling $300,000
or more would be procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB). Equipment grouped in lots under $300,000 would be procured
through shopping, requiring price quotations from a minimum of three
vendors. Total shopping would not exceed the ceiling of $2.2 million
equivalent, roughly lOZ of the total cost of procured goods.
Competitive bidding would be encouraged by grouping items together
whenever possible. Contracts awarded on the basis of ICB will be
subject to prior Bank review.



Disbutrsements
55.         The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of four years.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1993 (Closing Date)
and would be made against the following categories of expenditures (see
Schedule B-I): (a) consultant services - lOOX of expenditures; (b) equipment
and materials - lOOX of foreign expenditures and 55X of local expenditures.
56.         Schedule B-II shows the estimated schedule of disbursements, based
on the regional disbursement profile for similar projects.
57.         All disbursements would be fully documented,  except those for
payments against contracts of less than $100,000 equivalent, which would be made
against statements of expenditure. The documentation would be available for
review by the Bank's supervision missions. A Special Account for $2 million
equivalent will be established at the Central Bank.
