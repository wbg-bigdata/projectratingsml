Project
Description:        The project would assist with development ot the
Sriramasagar and Srisailam Right Branch Canal irrigation
schemes, located ia the poorest drought-prone areas ot
Andhra Pradesh. It would modernize and complete the
irrigation network in 165,000 ha, extend the irrigable
area by another 163,000 ha in Sriramzasagar, and develop a
greater part (65,000 out ot 77,000 ha) of Srisailam. The
main objective of the project is to increase agricultural
production and farmer's income in the command area ot both
schemes. This would require a number of complementary
activities, including (i) introduction of new plJanning and
design concepts; (ii) revisions in irrigation system
operation; (iii) improved management and maintenance
standards; and (iv) training of operation and maintenance
staff and contact farmers.
The project would be implemented over a seven-year period.
At full development it vould generate incresmental annual
production ot 395,000 tons of foodgrains, 218,000 tons of
cotton, 148,000 tons of groundnuts and other crops.
Numerous unquantifiable benefits would also accrue to the
two communities.
The risks ot the project are primarily associated with
the introduction of vater management concepts which are
new to the implementing agency. Another risk could be the
shortage of qualified staff, which may result in implemen-
tation deLays. However, all expected risks have been
taken into account in planning project implementation.

SECOND ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. BACKGROUND
Agriculture and Irrigation in India
1.01    With about 760 M inhabitants (mid-1985), India is the world's second
most populous country. The annual rate of population increase is about 2.2X.
Gross Domestic Product, now estimated at Rs 1,690,000 M (US$130,000 M)
(1983/84) and growing at about 4% annually, ranks eleventh in the world.
Annual income per capita (1983/84) is estimated at Rs 3380 (US$260). The
country has the largest single concentration of people in absolute poverty:
between 200 and 250 H. Over 90% of the poor are rural. Although the
industrial sector is large, sophisticated, and growing at a respectable rate,
agriculture still provides 69% of India's employment and accounts for 36% of
the GDP. Agricultural growth rate was 4.6% per annum during the 5th Plan
(1974-79) but only 2.0Z during the 6th Plan (1979-84), due to three years of
unfavorable monsoons.
1.02    At least three-fourths of India's agricultural growth since 1947
stems from the synergy of fertilizers, improved crop varieties and the
expanding irrigation. The irrigated area, now over 60 M hectares, is second
only to that of China. India is investing more in expanding irrigation than
any other country. Investments until quite recently tended to emphasize the
creation of irrigation potential: the building of dams, river diversions and
major canals. Recently, however, in a change strongly encouraged and
promoted by the Bank/IDA, there has been a welcome shift towards completing
and improving the system down to the level where only a small number of
farmers share the water (typically, to 8 ha units), rehabilitating and
upgrading systems constructed to the less exacting standards of the 1950s and
1960s and introducing water management systems and operations geared to the
reliability, timeliness and quality of water supply. While this shift is
clearly discernible, it needs further general support, which would be
achie-3d through training engineers and planners, to ensure general accept-
ance. An indication of the high and rising priority attached to the sector
is the share of Plan investments allocated: 8.6% in the 4th Plan (1969-74),
9.8% in the 5th Plan (1974-79), 10.6Z in the 6th Plan (1979-84), and 10Z in
the 7th Plan (1985-90).
The State of Andhra Pradesh
1.03    General.  Andhra Pradesh is India's fifth largest State (277,000 km2)
and fourth most populous (55 million). The State has a 1,000 km coastline on
the Bay of Bengal. Over 76% of the population is rural. Two of India's
largest rivers, the Godavari and the Krishna, cross the State, cre-ting large
deltas at their outlets. They and their major tributaries rise in the
Western Ghats, in Maharashtra and Karnataka.



-2-
1.04    Climate and SOil. The State lies on the fringe of the equatorial
zone, between latitude 120 37' and 190 54'.  It has three seasons:  the
monsoon (kharif, from late June to October) the cooler rabi (November Lo
February) which is dry except in the coastal areas which lie on the northern
limit of the northeast monsoon rainfall zone, and the hot, summer season
(March to about mid-June), which is mostly rainless. Since the average
coolest temperature is above 130 C, most tropical crops can be grown at all
times of the year.
1.05    The State has three regions:
(a) The Coastal Region, comprising largely the Godavari and Krishna
deltas. This is agriculturally the richest and best developed: the
soils are mainly alluviums and the richer bLack vertisols and red
alfisols. Rainfall is well in excess of 1,000 -n and subject to
cyclonic storms from the Bay of Bengal.
(b) The Telengana Region, north and west of the coastal zone. The soils
are mainly red al'isols and vertisols of lighter texture than in the
coastal region; rainfall is about 700-900 mm. Cyclonic stores tend
to affect this zone, but less frequently and with less severity than
the coast.
(c) The Rayalaseama Region, farthest from the coast, occupies the south-
western segment of the State. It is the least exposed to cyclonic
storms and therefore has the lowest rainfalL: between 550 and 750 mm
per anm:um. The soils are mostly black vertisols. It is the poorest
and least developed.
1.06    The Economy.  The economy of AP is predominantly agrarian:  agricul-
ture contributes about 50% of the State's income and employs about 70% of the
work force. Between 1970/71 and 1980/81, the rate of growth of the primary
sector, including agriculture, forestry and mining was 3.2% per annum (p.a.)
compared to an all-India average of 3.0%. The secondary sector: manufactur-
ing, construction, electricity, gas and water supply (222 of the State's
income), grew at 4.0% p.a., compared to the national average of 3.6%. The
tertiary sector, including transport, trade, finance and services (25% of
the State's income), grew at an annual rate of 7.0%, about the same as the
national average (6.9%). However, since tertiary sector activities started
from a relatively small base and are concentrated mostly in the urban areas,
their growth contributed only marginally to the welfare of the majority of
the population in the rural areas (77%). Overall, State income grew at an
annual rate of 3.8 % p.a., slightly above the national rate of 3.62. Per
capita income increased by 1.7% p.a. and was about equal to the national
average of Rs. 1,267. Since agriculture is the main activity and it has
close links to other sectors, economic progress is largely dependent on the
removal of constraints to further agricultural growth. Expanding and improv-
ing the irrigation sector will support irrigated agriculture; the undoubted
and only recently emerging potential improvements in rainfed agriculture
offer another avenue to increased production, especially in areas that either
because of topography, or because of shortage of water supplies, are unlikely
to be irrigated in the foreseeable future.



-3-
1.07    Agricultural Performance.  Between 1956/57 and 1981/82, rice produc-
tion grew by 6.65 x per annum in Telengana, 3.51% in Rayalaseama, and (from a
relatively high base) 1.72% in the Coastal region; in the State as a whole,
by 2.93%. The area under groundnuts grew in all three regions; areas under
other crops (sorghum, pearl millet) either decreased or increased only mar-
ginally. Increase in yields has contributed more to production than did area
expansion.
1.08    Irrigation Devylopment.  Water available for suIrface irrigation is
estimated at 77,500 Mm . The main sources are the Codavari and the Krishna
rivers (para 1.03) and their tributaries; others are the minor tanks and
groundwater. About 3.0 million ha are irrigated nut of a total cultivable
area of 11.3 million ha; the irrigation potential is estimated to be about
9.2 million ha. Irrigation hAs started over 100 years ago in the two river
deltas and the Tungabhadra river, a tributary of the Krishna (Kurnool-Cuddapah
project). During the past 35 years AP has invested heavily in irrigation.
In the Fifth (1974/75-1979/80) and Sixth (1979/80-1984/85) Plan periods,
irrigation investments accounted for 35Z and 27% of total development spend-
ings. Returns have not been satisfactory, because resources have been spread
over too many projects, resulting in long construction and gestation periods
and delayed benefits. Nor has a timely and reliable irrigation service,
conducive to good water management and sustained high production, been
provided by the projects; supporting services (agricultural research and
extension, and some of the inputs services) also needed improvement.
1.09    Bank Involvement in AP.  The Bank was involved in three irrigation
projects:
(a) Pochampad Irrigation, Cr. 268-IN, US$39 M, closed 12/79.
(b) Godavari Barrages, Cr. 532-IN, US$45 M, closed 6/81.
(c) AP Irrigation and Command Area Development Composite, Ln. 1251-IN,
US$145 M, closed 6/85.
1.10    The Pochampad Irrigation Project (see also para 2.05) supported works
to complete the Sriramasagar dam and develop part of the command area of the
Pochampad Project (now renamed Sriramasagar). It achieved most of its objec-
tives [Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) No 3499]. The Godavari
Barrage Project (PPAR No. 4000) supported the replacement of a century-old
weir by a modern barrage, to enable the diversions and the distribution
network in the Godavari delta to go on functioning. This was the first
project in which GOI has followed International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
rules for major civil works. Although the eventual contractors were Indian
firms, the audit concluded, and GOI agreed, that the competition engendered
by introducing ICB rules has contributed to improved standards and perfor-
mance specifications.
1.11    The AP I Project, when presented to the Board in 1976, was one of the
largest Bank-supported projects, and the largest irrigation project in India.
Its main objectives were to hasten the construction of the canal network and
thereby the utilization of water impounded in the Nagarjunasagar reservoir,
(live storage 5,800 Zm3, 205 TMC) and extend the water distribution network
beyond the irrigation outlet down to the farm. To minimize seepage losses,



-4-
for ease of management, and to achieve better water control, the project had
a major canal lining component.
1.12    Largely because of insufficient data on conveyance losses, which,
when systematically measured during project implementation, turned out to be
up to three times hither than advised by COAP, coupled with difficulties to
Limit rice growing and the cor.sequent excessive water use in parts of the
project area, the Nagarjunasagar component was extensively reformulated in
1979-80. Key components of the reformulation were:
(a)  the need to remodel many of the previously unlined canals;
(b)  considerably more lining of major canals, distributaries and minors
than originally envisaged;
(c)  reduction of project scope;
(d)  obtaining GOAP's commitment to a rigid water allocation system, to
enable irrigation of the project area; - subsequent improvements in
irrigation efficiency are expected to enabLe the entire area to be
adequately irrigated even after full upstream developments in the
Krishna, when water available to the project will be substantially
reduced; and
(e)  a comprehensive system of flow measurements, to refine further and
trace the utilization of water releases.
1.13    The AP I project closed in June 1985.  Its objectives were mostly,
- although not fully, - achieved. The lessons of the project were the need
for full main canal lining and a substantial rethinking of previous water
allocation and water delivery policies. The project enabled the introduction
of a water management plan in parts of the area. Its principal aim was to
rationalize the crop calendars by: Zi) retaining water in the dam for
pre-monsoon land preparation and early planting of rice; (ii) ensuring equi-
table water-sharing between farmers on all reaches of the main canals and
(iii) reducing operational losses by prevailing on farmers to carry out
operations on the same crops in the same block in a more concerted manner.
1.14    In addition to these three water-related projects, the State shares
in several ongoing or completed national projects that support the agricul-
tural sector. For the proposed project the National Agricultural Research
P-oject (NARP I; - Cr. 955-IN) and the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Extension
Project (Cr. 1219-IN, US$6 H) are of special importance. The latter aims to
introduce the Training and Visit (T&V) system of agricultural extension -
started in the commands of the AP I Project - over the entire State, under
the control of the Department of Agriculture. By now the extension service
is fully unified and covers the entire State (para 2.21). Other Bank Group
agricultural projects that have affected Andhra Pradesh's agricultural
development were ARDC (now named NABARD) general line of credit projects
which support lending for groundwater development and other on-farm invest-
ments, mostly to individual farmers.

II. THE PROJECT AREAS
A. History and Background
The Srisailam Right Branch CanaL (SRBC) Scheme
2.01    The idea of utilizing Krishna water to irrigate the drought-prone,
upper Pennar Basin in the Rayalaseama region of the State is more than 100
years old. The first attempt was the Kurnool-Cuddapah project (para 1.08),
which, through a system of multiple pickups from the Kundu, a tributary of
the Pennar, enabled progressive utilization of return flows. By now it
extends to about 100,000 ha.
2.02    The right bank of the Kundu, the venue of SRBC scheme, became poten-
tially irrigable only after the construction of the Srisailam Dam (IBRD Map
18843). This large (live storage 250 TMC, 7,075 Mm3) reservoir was designed
for power generation and as upstream balancing storage for the Nagarjunasagar
complex, the backwaters of which reach the toe of the Srisailam Dam. Even-
tually there would be 7 power turbines on the right flank and 9 reversible
turbines on the left flank, each of 110 NW capacity.
2.03    Notwithstanding this great power potential, it is GOAP's policy
decision that power generation will be subordinate to irrigation needs, with
the caveat that the highest feasible head of the water should be retained in
the reservoir to maximize power generation.
2.04    The need to skim water from the Srisailam Reservoir without passing
it through the power turbines, by tapping into the flank of the reservoir,
arose in the 1970s when it became clear that Madras City requires water from
the Krishna to ensure its long-term municipal and industrial requirements.
Accordingly, the three riparian States (Andhra Pradesh, Karnata a and
Maharashtra) allocated 5 TMC each, or a tocal of 15 TffC (425 Mm ), to lamil
Nadu (TN), expressly for industrial and municipal use in the city of Madras.
The Goverment of Tamil Nadu (GOTH) has undertaken to finance costs of con-
veying this water, over a period of about 3 months (i.e. out of peak monsoon
flows), from the Srisailam Reservoir to the AP/TN border. Once the cost of
transfer from the Krishna to the Pennar basin was thus covered, GOAP found it
economically feasible to draw water from the Madras canal at times when the
canal is not delivering water to the AP/TN border, to irrigate areas in its
poorest and most drought-prone Rayalaseama Region (para 1.05).
The S iramasagar Scheme (SRS)
2.05    The SRS scheme on the Godavari river was first considered in 1950;
construction of the dam began in 1963. The Bank Group's involvement started
in 1971, when it participated in what was then known as the Pochampad Project
(para 1.10). That credit supported works to complete the dam and to develop
a further 83,000 ha of the service area. Prior to Bank Group's involvement
the development of about 17,000 ha near the dam was financed by GOAP.
2.06    The Bank Group's involvement in SRS continued under the AP I Project
(para 1.11) which had a component to assist with the construction of field



- 6 -
channels, farm roads and land levelling, primarily in areas not covered by
the Pochampad Project. Recently, the COAP has completed (i) remaining works
on the Sriramasagar Dam to its full capacity of 3,170 Mm3 (112 TMC); (ii) a
canal on the left bank to link the Sriramasagar and Khaddam dams to irrigate
17,000 ha between the two (the Saraswathi Head component); (iii) the Laxmi
canal on the right bank of the Godavari; (iv) major works, but not all minor
distribution works, on the remaining 65,000 ha service area downstream of the
Pochampad Project; and (v) the Mannair Dam to impound 13.4 TMC (380 Mm3) of
water and act as a balancing reservoir for the system.
B. Project Areas
Location
2.07    The SRBC scheme is roughly rectangular in shape, (MAP IBRD 18843)
about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide, with a cultivable command area (CCA) of
77,000 ha. It slopes gently from the Mallamelai hills to the Kundu river.
2.08    The SRS scheme has total potential CCA of about 679,000 ha.  The
Sriramasagar Dam is situated near where the Godavari enters AP from
Maharashtra in the Telangana Region (Map IBRD 18842). The scheme consists of
the following parts:

Total                       679
When completed, the SRS and the Nagarjunasagar schemes would form a con-
tiguous irrigated area of about 1.5 M ha.



-7-
Climate
2.09    Rainfall averages about 700 mm in the SRBC area and about 930 m  in
the SRS area. Both are in the single-monsoon belt, although occasional
storms occur during the northeast monsoon (November to February). Tempera-
tures are fairly even throughout the yei.r except for the very hot season of
late March to early June. All crops suited to the zone can be grown between
June and March: rice; groundnuts; green, black and red gram; sorghum; maize;
pearl millet; cotton; and chillies. Chickpeas, a photo-sensitive crop for
diminishing daylight hours, can be grown only between November and March.
The salient climatic data are in Table 1.
Topography and Soils
2.10    Topography.  The SRBC area is fairly leveL, with gentle slopes and
little segmentation. The SRS area has several secqndary catchments and some
quite large seasonal rivers (locally known as vagu) on which there are cas-
cades of minor tanks (para 2.18).  There are also several granitic and basal-
tic outcrops, typical of the Deccan plateau, making for a broken topography.
2.11    Soils.  Practically the whoLe of the SRBC and some 60X of the SRS
area to be brought under irrigation by the present project are black ver-
tisols; the balance are red alfisols. The vertisols in the SRBC area are
heavier and deeper than in the SRS area. A typical vertisol cracks deeply
when dry, is self-mulching, and because of slow infiltration after heax'y rain
or irrigation, tends to have a perched watertable which makes it difficult to
cultivate after the first few showers. Therefore, most of the fields are
planted in late kharif, when the rainfall eases; the crop matures on residual
moisture. Sorghum and red gram (pigeon peas) respond best to this regime.
The red alfisols in both areas have sufficient depth to support all crops.
Profitable farming systems that effectively utilize year-round irrigation on
alfisols have been practised in the State for many years.
Population and Land Holdings
2.12    The combined population in the two scheme areas is about 1,140,000;
a density of about 120/kn2. The average holding size is 2.3 ha in the SRS
and 3.6 ha in the SRBC project areas (Table 2). The major settlement of the
SRBC area is Nandyal. Bananganapalle is a market center of importance.
2.13    Two major towns in the SRS are Warangal and Karimnagar.  Other cen-
ters of importance are Chalgal, Jagtial, Nizamabad (district HQ); all in the
area developed in earlier stages of the scheme.
Comummications
2.14    Nandyal is on a major branch of the Hyderabad-Bangalore meter-gauge
railway line, which connects it with the coastal region. A State highway
connects Nandyal, Kurnool, Cuddappah, Cuntur and Anantapur. Secondary roads
within the SRBC project area are few, but in fair condition: no point is more



than 10 km from an all-weather road. However, there is virtually no farm
road network. 1/
2.15    The SRS area has an extensive State and National highway network.  It
is served by meter-gauge and broad-gauge railway lines connecting to major
cities within and outside the Stare. An all-weather road network connects
the maior towns and most of the major villages to the State and National
highways. However, the farm road network is almost non-existent except in
the top 120,000 ha of the area, where it was developed under the Pochampad
project (para 1.10).
2.16    The canal service road network is poor, which makes supervision of
the system difficult. The consequences are poor maintenance of the dis-
tributaries and illegal diversions in their upper reaches with shortages at
the tail ends.
Present Development
2.17    Crops.  Table 3 shows the present cropping pattern and yields in the
project areas. Drought-resistant crops, such as sorghum and pulses,
predominate. Well water (para 2.19) is used for cotton, groundnuts, orchards
and rice. The high percentage of rabi sorghum, especially in SRBC command,
reflects the dominant farming system on the vertisols (para 2.11). Present
yields of unirrigated crops are above average for the State, reflecting
reasonably high farming standards.
2.18    Present Irrigation.  Irrigation in the SRBC area, and the SRS area
below the KMannair dam, is by tanks and wells:
Tanks                     Wells
No      Area ('000 ha)    No      Area ('000 ha)
SRBC              14            2.8 /a      1,200           2.4
SRS              385           48.0 /b      4,000           8.0
/a  3% of the Gross Commanded Area (GCA).
lb 17Z of GCA.
The proportion of the area served by tanks is higher in SRS than in SRBC
because of the larger proportion of non-commandable area in the GCA and the
more broken topography. The tanks are excluded from the project but would
benefit indirectly by increased recharge and return flows. The tank commands
irrigate mainly rice, sorghum and groundnuts in SRBC but only rice in SRS.
2.19    The dugwells, mostly electrified, typically command 2 ha to supple-
ment rainfall in the kharif. In the dry season they irrigate about 1 ha of
high-value crops: cotton, groundnuts, orchards and hybrid sorghum for seed.
Aquifer conditions allow 7-12 hours of pumping per day.
1/ The term "farm road" is used throughout this report to describe roads
between the fields and the farmers' homesteads in the villages. "Feeder
roads" connect the homesteads to all-weather roads.



2.20    Although some of the area between the Mannair Dam and Warangal has
been receiving surface water, development is partiaL and incomplete.
Upstream of the dam the major irrigation network is nearly completed on about
120,000 ha (except for lining of distributaries, minors and field channels)
and is under construction on a further 45,000 ha. Hlowever, because of the
design of the minors and field channels; deficient control structures, the
absence of lining apart from the main canal, lack of effective operational
control and unsuitable water regime, tail enders on the distributaries do iKOt
receive an adequate irrigation service while the lower-lying areas by the
head and middle reaches of the distributaries are getting waterlogged.
Agricultural Support
2.21    Extension.  As indicated (para 1.14), agricultural extension in the
State is supported by the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Extension Project (Cr.
1219-IN), which operates the Training and Visit (TAV) system. It is by now
under the sole control of the Department of Agriculture. Statewide, staffing
density averages one village extension officer (VEO) per 1,500 farmers.
Coverage in the parts of the project area not yet irrigated is below this
ratio; also, the quality of the service has been uneven. However, there is a
nucleus of agricultural officers and subject matter specialists in Warangal
and Nandyal who would form a solid base, under the State Extension Project,
for introducing an effective service. The extension service as staffed in
the upstream 165,000 ha of the SRS scheme is adequate. It faces a major task
in rapidly extending improved farming systems and technologies to meet the
demands of irrigated and rainfed farming in their zones.
2.22    Research.  Agricultural research is under the control of the Andhra
Pradesh Agricultural University (APAU) near Hyderabad. Assisted by the NARP
I Project (Cr 855-IN), it has recently expanded its Nandyal Research Station
to serve as a Zonal Research Station for Rayalaseama. A new station at
Jagtial (also supported by NARP I) will serve as the zonal station for Telan-
gana. Both are fully staffed and are about to initiate research programs to
serve their zones.
2.23    Input Services.  The seed, fertilizer and pesticide marketing system
in the project areas is well developed, as everywhere in the State. Fer-
tilizers are marketed mainly by the private sector; the Department of
Agriculture sells only about 10. Pesticide use is limited: cotton and to a
lesser extent rice are the main users. The sales points are usually the same
as for fertilizers. Experience throughout India shows that the vigorous
private sector does come in wherever opportunity offers.  Seed suppl;es for
hybrid sorghum, cotton, groundnuts and other crops are of good quality and on
the whole adequate.
2.24    The institutional credit organization follows the normal pattern for
India. There is an adequate network of primary cooperative credit societies;
commercial banks are weil represented in the villages. The cooperative
banks, which provide short and medium-term loans, have the State Cooperative
Bank as the State level apex bank. There appear to be an adequate network of
branch offices. The State Land Development Bank operates through branches
and affiliated offices in taluka (sub-district) headquarters; they handle
long- term credit (up to 15 years). Commercial banks are obligated to devote
about 15X of their resources to agricultural lending. However, there has
been a decline in their lending, in actual cash terms, over the last few



- 10 -
years.  Recovery levels of cooperative banks are presently about 75X of the
demand and statewide recovery performance of the SLDB in 1983-84 was about
9oz.
2.25    Marketing, Processing and Storage.  Marketing in the wholesale
markets is regulated under the Agricultural Produce Market Act (1965).
Facilities have matched the increasing production. Rice in excess of demand
within the State is procured by GOI agencies or bought by private traders.
Pulses and oilseeds (mainly groundnuts) find a ready market. Processing
facilities are adequate: rice husking is a wei. developed cottage and
large-scale industry and there are many high-capacity modern solvent plants
to procr-s groundnuts; their numbers are growing. Maize is processed into
starch; oil is extrated in plants situated in most large towns, including
Warangal. Cotton ginning facilities are adequate in the ORS area but not in
the SRBC area. However, as has happened in nearby Anantapur when cotton
growing has taken off, it is highly probable phat the private sector will
come in to provide the necessary ginning units. Storage facilities are
adequate: in the public sector, they are provided by the State V1arehousing
CorForation, the Central Warehousing Corporation and the State Marketing
Federation. Some cooperatives also have godowns. In addition, the mnny
private grain and produce merchants have their own stores.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.26    AP is in the midst of modernizing the planning, design, implementa-
tion and operation of development projects in the irrigation sector. The
process, which has been assisted by the Bank, changes old norms and prac-
tices. The most innovative part would be the introduction of improved system
operation procedures which will ensure reliable water supplies to farmers.
Past Bank involvement focussed more on improved design and construction
standards and to ensure properly phased project execution, with all com-
ponents being completed, as far as possible simultaneously. Strong Bank
support will now be particularly important in helping the State to take the
operational measures necessary to provide a reliable, predictable water
supply.
2.27    The project includes an appropriate mix of ongoing and new irrigation
development works which are top COAP irrigation development priorities and
adequate to spearhead modernization. In addition to its involvement in this
project, the Bank is also considering continued involvement in improving
water management in the Nagarjunasagar scheme (paras 1.11-1.13) under a
proposed Water Management Project. GOAP has decided to merge its Irrigation
and Command Area Development Departments, thus rationalizing the management
structure of the institutions dealing with irrigation (Chapter V). If all
the above plans are successfully implemented, by the end of the project
period GOAP would be well advanced in its efforts to modernize its irrigation
sector.
2.28    A further rationale for Bank involvement is the poverty-alleviation
aspect of the SEBC project. Rayalaseama is the State's poorest, most
drought-p_one region (para 1.05). The impact of irrigation would therefore
be greatest, as was the case with the Kurnool-Cuddappah project, and shown by
the impressive developments in the Tungabhadra Low-Level Canal command which



- 11 -
became a prosperous cotton and groundnut-producing area. The Bank's involve-
ment would enable the time taken to achieve full production in the scheme
areas to be considerably reduced from what would otherwise be the case.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope and Objectives
Pro lect Objective
3.01    The main objective of the project is to raise agricultural production
and farm incomes through the expansion of irrigated areas and the efficient
utilization of available water supplies. To achieve these objectives, the
project will assist with the further development of the SRS scheme; initiate
and complete the development of a greater part of the SRBC scheme; and intro-
duce improved design and operation principles as pre-conditions to a reliable
and equitable irrigation service. The Bank Group's involvement in the
project would extend over a seven-and-a-half-year period.
Summary of Project Components
3.02    The project would have the following components:
I.  Conveyance System Works
(a) SRBC Sub-project
1. SRB Canal from the Banakacherla Regulator to the Gorakallu Aqueduct;
2. The Corakallu Aqueduct;
3. SRB Canal beyond the Corakallu Aqueduct, for about 100 km
(b) SRS Sub-project
1. Upgrading and completion of conveyance works of the Kakatiya Canal
command between km 0-146;
2. Completion and new conveyance works of the Kakatiya Canal
command between km 146-267;
3. Excavation of the tail section of the Kakatiya Canal to
serve as an escape (km 267-284).
II. Components Common to Both Sub-projects
(a) block development of about 65,000 ha in the SRBC sub-project,
modernization of 165,000 ha and new development of 163,000 ha
in the SRS sub-project;
(b) feeder road network;
(c) water management (paras 6.11 to 6.27);
(d) equipment for project implementation, including telecommunications;



- 12 -
(e)  provision of training facilities and training of professional and
support staff required for project implementation; and training
of farmers (paras 6.20 to 6.25);
(f)  rehabilitation of and amenities for oustees from the Srisailam
and Mannair reservoir sites and other project works; and
(g)  monitoring and evaiuation, technical services; provisions for studies
and planning.
B. Detailed Features
The SRBC Sub-project 1/
3.03    SRB Canal up to the Aqueduct.  The SRB Canal which originates at the
Banakacherla Regulator will debouch into an aqueduct at km 50.22, to connect
to the service area. It would be nearly 12 m deep at the offtake point, to
draw a minimum of 750 cusecs (21 cumecs) when the Srisailam Reservoir is at
its expected level of 854 ft (260.3 m) at the end of the cropping season
(March). Excavation of about 10 km of this canal has already been awarded
and would not be financed by this project.
3.04    The CorakalLu Aqueduct will cross the Corakallu valley between km
50.22 and 53.46 (3.24 km), to reach the first block of the irrigation service
area.
3.05    The SRB Canal beyond the aqueduct (2,400 cusec capacity at its head
reach) would consist of two parts along the service area:
(a)  between km 53.46 and 112.73, it traverses gently rolling country,
without significant cuts or fills until the last few kilometers.
This section would command about 41,000 ha in 11 blocks, each served
by its own distributary;
(b) at km 112.73 the canal abuts on the Mallamelai hills, where two
tanks, with their independent catchments, command about 670 ha.
1/ GOAP has already began construction of works that are common to the
Madras water supply and the SRBC projects. These are:
(a)  a 3 km approach channel within the Srisailam Reservoir, to convey
water at an elevation of 854 ft (260.3 m) above MSL to the Pothired-
dypadu Regulator;
(b)  construction of the Pothireddypadu Regulator;
(c)  the "Deep Cut" - a canal ;6.34 km long and at places about 30 m deep,
to take water from the Krishna river to the Pennar Basin; and
(d)  the Banakacherla Regulator which divides the water between the Madras
canal, the SRBC and an escape into a seasonal tributary of the
Pennar.
These works would not be financed under the proposed project.



- 13 -
Provisions would be made to divert water from the SRBC in drought
years to stabilize their command areas.  This section of SRB Canal
would command about 24,000 ha and stop at km 153 under the project.
The last part of the SRB Canal and the balance of 16,000 ha would be
developed later.
The SRS Sub-project
3.06    The first section of the Kakatiya Canal (km 0-146) has a capacity
of 8,600 cusecs, extends from the Sriramasagar Dam to the Mannair Reservoir
and commands 165,000 ha, including the Pochampad Project area (para 1.10).
The banks of the main canal and its lining would be raised to enable peak
water requirements to be delivered for the entire command. AdditionaL struc-
tures would be provided to enable implementation of a more effective water
management system.
3.07    The Kakatiya Canal's second section (km 146-284), also with the
capacity of 8,600 cusecs at its head reach, originates at the Kannair Dam.
The Bank Group's involvement under the proposed project would focus on three
segments: 1/
(a)  the Mannair Dam to km 234, just beyond Warangal town, where lining
as well as construction of several distributary offtake structures
remain, to be completed;
(b)  km 234-267 where all earthwork contracts have been let and some of
the distributary offtakes and gates installed. Works not yet con-
tracted 2/, including lining, would be eligible for financing under
the project; and
(c)  km 267-284 where no work has started, but some contracts have been
let. This section would only be excavated in the present time-slice
to serve as an escape into the Akheru river. The project would
finance all remaining contracts.
Block Development and Upgrading
3.08    Each irrigation block (the unit served by a distributary) would
include the following works under the project: (i) the distributary and
minors; (ii) field channels leading to 8 ha units; (iii) farm roads (para
2.14); and (iv) drains. A collector drain from each block, with field drains
connected to it, would debouch into a main drain or river. The drains would
be designed tc. evacuate a 10-year intensity storm within 72 hours. Safety
would be ensured by escapes on the tail of each distributary.
3.09    In the Kakatiya command (km 0-146) upgrading the existing dis-
tributaries and minors, primarily by lining to the standards set by the
1, Contracts have been awarded for the excavation of 138 km, between Mannair
and the Akheru river.
2/ Between km 234-267 contracts for sections of some of the branch canals
and larger distributaries have been awarded and work has started, includ-
ing the last, at km 267 (D-17, CCA 61,000 ha).



- 14 -
project (para 3.24) IJ constructing additional conveyance channels as
required; and development of the irrigation blocks for 165,000 ha of net CCA
would be completed. The surface drainage system vould connect to the minor
tanks in the gross command area (para 2.18), thereby augmenting their vater
supply.
Feeder Road Network
3.10    Rural roads in the project area would be built or upgraded to stand-
ards established by GOAP which are satisfactory to the Bank Group. The
network density in both scheme areas would provide all-weather access to all
villages with a population of more than 1,000. No part of the irrigated area
would be more than 3 km from an all-weather road. The rural road network
would average about 4-5 inha of CCA newly bought under irrigation; experience
gained since the construction of the Pochampad and other projects suggests
that augmentation averaging 2 m|ha of CCA is required to provide adequate
communication facilities. Sample surveys show that the SRBC and SRS areas
would require a feeder road network of about 260 km and 900 km. Design
standards would be: (i) 3.5 a wide roads with a surfacing of waterbound
macadas; (ii) no black topping; and (iii) construction of hard passages
instead of bridges over seasonal streams. The subgrade design would be
according to requirements dictated by the traffic (typically 15 cm deep) and
the foundation according to California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values (a
worldwide standard accepted in India).
3.11    To ensure that planning, design and construction of the road com-
ponent can progress unhindered, an agreement has been reached vith GOAP that
by April 30, 1987, and thereafter by April 30 of every year, it would submit
to the Bank/IDA for review: (i) plans for the extent and location of the
road reserves to be acquired in the distributary commands scheduled for
development in the following construction season; and (ii) design specifica-
tions and cost of the roads to be constructed.
3.12    Cost estimates of civil works assume that contractors would provide
their own construction equipment. Equipment for operation and maintenance
during construction and for maintenance of farm and canal service roads would
be provided by the project and transfered to the O&N administration after
project completion. The Roads and Buildings Branch of PWD would maintain the
farm and feeder roads but not the canal service roads: these are part and
parcel of the canals. Computation equipment would be required for the design
office during the design phase and for subsequent operational control. Ten
16 bit microcomputers are included for this purpose. Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2
lists the items required.
Teleco  glcatiov8
3.13    A comprehensive telecommunication network would be provided in the
8RS area with substations at all major canal offtakes and other key points.
In addition, four vehicles operating in the command area vould be equipped
1/ Distributaries and minors were not lined under the Pochampad Project
(,ara 2.20).

with two-way radios. A simpler system would link key points in the SRBC
project area with the Banakacherla Regulator, the Pothireddypadu gates and
the main control room at the Srisailam Dam. Two of the inspection vehicles
would be equipped with radios. The radio frequencies to be used would be
determined in consultation with the telecommunication authorities of GOI. An
agreement has be(;n reached with GOI that it would allocate suitable radio
frequencies and promptly authorize the installation of the necessary equip-
ment.
Training and Training Facilities
3.14    Engineering Staff.  Pre-service and in-service training of engineers
in the design, construction and O&M of irrigation systems, operated according
to standards envisaged for this project, would take pLace in the Water and
Land Management Training and Research Institute (WALAMTARI) near Hyderabad.
The project would finance the cost of training and improvemetts to WALAM-
TARI's facilities. It is expected that during the project implementation
period over 1,000 engineers of various grades would be involved; all would
require in-service training and/or refresher courses.
3.15    Support Staff and Contact Farmers.  Training of sub-professional
irrigation staff and farmers would take place in training centers within the
project areas. One would be established in the SRBC area; three in the SRS
area. An additional center in the S'S area, partially built, would be com-
pleted. Each would have dormitory and resthouse accommodation, classrooms
and teachers' quarters. Canal Inspectors (CI), engineering technicians and
the Chairmen of Outlet and Minor Canal Committees (paras 6.21-6.26) would
undergo training to enable them to function effectively as technicians and
community leaders. Some of the contact farmers selected by the Agricultural
Extension Service would undergo routine training in on-farm water management
and distribution practices; other farmers would be brought in as time allows.
3.16    The principal orientation of the training courses for support staff
would be:
(a) Canal Inspectors' training would focus on canal operation and water
allocation principles established under the project within outlet and
minor canal commands;
(b) OC Chairmen would be trained in water allocation principles within
outlet commands, responsibilities for maintenance of common works,
their legal obligations and instruments to implement them; and
(c) Contact Farmers would be trained in improved irrigation practices,
field layouts and appropriate land preparation to minimize on-farm
water losses, legal rights and obligations associated with water use,
and administrative and management procedures of OCs.
Since the majority of the farmers are not in a position to leave their homes-
teads for several days, principally because of the routine demands of live-
stock, VEOs and the Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) dealing with irrigated
farming would also be trained to enable them to impart, and demonstrate to
farmers on their own land and under their own specific soil, topography and
water supply conditions, points of field layout and land preparation. Full
details of the syllabi and organization are in Annex 5. The project would
finance the operating costs of the training centers during the implementation

period; however, training activities would continue throughout tne life of
the project. An agreement has been reached vith GOAP that they would present
to the Bank/IDA for review training plans for engineering staff, support
staff, and Chairmen of the various farmer committees, and thereafter imple-
ment the agreed training plan.
Land Alienation
3.17    Land Required for Project Works.  Land acquisition for works financed
by the present project would only be for roads and canals. These are
generally seen to serve the community, rarely engender significant objection
and the land reqcired is readily acquired under vell-established procedures
of GOAP. No acquisition would imply the resettlement of villages and no
dwelling or storage structures built oa farmland would be affected.
3.18    The Srisailai. Reservoir.  The site of the reservoir was acquired
gradually from the occupants from 1974 onwards but was not finally flooded
until 1981. Consequently, some of the potential Project Affected Persons
(PAPs) to whom GOAP paid compensation in the 1970s, disregarded the threat of
flooding and have spent compensation monies while still in occupation of
their original houses and farms. Others found the compensation, which may
well have represented actual replacement costs in 1974, inadequate to buy
replacements in 1981. While GOAP has paid the PAPs additional compensation
to alleviate hardship caused by the delays and inadequate advance warning of
the proposed filling date of the reservoir, it recognizes that there is room
to provide additional relief and amenities.
3.19    The Nannair Dam and Reservoir.  The Mannair Dam, through which all
water reaching the area below khu 146 must pass, has been completed in 1985.
When eventually filled to full supply level, the reservoir will submerge 16
villages, 7,365 ha of land (including the village sites) and affect the
livelihood of 13,799 families or about 63,370 persons. At present, resettle-
ment is still in progress, providing an opportunity to organize it in a more
systematic way than has been done for Srisailam. Amenities can be made
available more promptly and, what can no longer be done for the PAPs of
Srisailam because of elapsed time and dispersal, vocational and rehabilita-
tion training can be organized.
3.20    To ensure assistance to the affected families GOAP would (a) for
Srisailm, conduct a survey in villages where most of the displaced families
have moved, to determine what additional social amenities, (e.g. schools,
clinics, drinking water supplies) are required to provide them with the same
amenities they enjoyed previously; (b) in addition, for uannair. they would:
(i) determine specific vocational training needs of affected families and
(ii) prepare a Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Program, with an
implementation schedule; (c) for persons directly affected by the project
(para 3.17) GOAP would also prepare a R & R program and a timetable for its
implementation, which would include either provisions for: (i) vocational
training; or (ii) irrigable land of comparable production potential to what
the PAP has held before acquisition, or (iii) stable employment, as preferred
by the PAP. An agreement has been reached with GOAP that they will resettle
and rehabilitate the PAPs in accordance with an action plan satisfactory to
the Bank/IDA; such plan would be based on paras 3.17-3.20 and Annex 7 of the
BAR. The program, along with the Action Plan covering the Srisailam and
Nannair sites, would be submitted to the IBRD/IDA for approval, as a condi-
tion of Loan/Credit effectiveness.

Monitorina and Evaluation: Technical Services: Studies and Planninz
3.21    The COAP has already upgraded its Project Preparation Cell (formerly
under a Superintending Engineer) to a Project Preparation and Monitori'g
(PPM) Unit, in charge of a Chief Engineer. Under the project, this Unit
would be expanded and put in charge of technical services and studies
required for effective project design (paras 3.22-23) and implementation.
PPM would, either within its own resources, or more probably by engaging
consultants, conduct and oversee a long-range investment options study to
identify the priorities for future irrigation development in the State. The
consultants would be either independent firms, Departments of Universities -
not necesarily based in AP - or a group of individuals engaged for the
purpose by PPM. Additional studies may well include, but not be confined to,
the folloving:
(i) irrigation development options (in Telengana and Rayalaseama), taking
medium as well as major projects into consideration;
(ii) institutional improvements that may appear necessary after the
merging of ID and the Irrigation Utilization and Command Area
Development Department (para 5.08);
(iii) an extensive study of the Coastal Region with a view of improving
irrigation and - more importantly - the drainage infrastructure
of the deltas and identifying agricultural development options and
research needs, further to improve production and crop diversifica-
tion in the area.
Appropriate provisions have been made to finance these studies under the
project. Organizational details are in paras 5.25 - 5.27.
Desiuin Criteria
3.22    Desi8zn PrinciRles.  Both systems would be designed to standards
satisfactory to the Bank/IDA which would enable water management that ensures
a reliable and equitable supply to all farmers in the project areas (paras
6.11-6.20). The components of the structured network JJ to be constructed
under the project, are:
(a) A main canal and branch canals, designed to be regulated to supply
distributaries in rotation, in 7-day cycles, to meet the demands of
the farmers'. cropping pattern within their allocation. Sufficient
cross regulation structures would be constructed to allow demand in
the distributaries to be met in any sequence. Ultimately, only
distributaries vould be supplied from the main and branch canals.
Canal capacity would be sufficient to meet the average computed peak
crop requirements.
J/ See proposed Guidelines for the Design and Operation of Structured Sys-
tems,. World Bank, October 1985.



- 18 -
(b) Distributaries, typically serving 2,000-6,000 ha, to run either full
on or off, serving minors through proportional distribution flumes or
modules. A measuring flume would be built near each distributary
head; there would be gates only at the head of the distributaries.
Capacity would be sufficient to meet peak crop requirements with
continuous flow. Regulation for less than peak irrigation require-
ments would be achieved by running the distributary intermittently.
(c)  Minors, serving groups of chaks, aggregated into 200-500 ha minor
service areas. The chaks would be supplied through proportional
distribution flumes. There would be no gates along the minors: they
would flow either full on or off, following the regime of the parent
distributary.
(d)  Chaks of modular size, corresponding to the estimated usable range of
farm stream size, depending on soil and topography. Field channels
within the chaks will serve 5-8 ha zones through simple on/off divi-
sion boxes. Flow at the chak head would be continuous while the
distributary is running; distribution to the 5-8 ha zones would be on
a warabundi schedule (para 6.18).
3.23    Conveyance losses would be accurately determined, in part by making
use of the extensive data collected in the AP I Project, and appropriate
allowances made for them in final designs. Expected losses in the dis-
tributary and minor systems will be aggregated and distributed so that every
chak outlet receives its design duty.  Losses in the chaks will be allowed
for by adjusting the warabundi schedules after actual field measurements of
losses so that every farmer receives an equal water duty. When eventually
the system is fully lined (para 3.24), the proportionality of the division
flumes will need adjustment.
3.24    Canal Lining.  Lining canals and field channels down to 8 ha groups
of fields not only reduces conveyance losses, but also, with proper water
allocation and management, reduces drainage needs and the risk of waterlog-
ging and possible salinity. More importantly, it makes for an easily
managable, responsive system. Further, as experience in other projects
shows, without adequate lining tailenders on distributaries and minors do not
get their share of water because of conveyance losses and uncontrollable,
illegal abstractions at the upper reaches, which cannot be balanced by
providing excess flows once the system is fully developed.  However, due to
budgetary constraints, lining of the minor system will have to be deferred
until the water saved is required to expand the command area.
3.25    Under the present project, only canals conveying more than 35 cusecs
would be lined. The following specifications have proved successful in other
projects on similar soils and similar operating regimes:
Hain Canal:      10 cm M100 grade in situ concrete (with 100 cm cohesive
non-swelling (CNS) backing if the canal passes through
black cotton (BC) soils)
Distributaries:  greater than 50 cusecs: 7.5 cm M100 grade in situ
concrete (with 100 cm CNS backing in BC soils)
25-50 cusecs: 7.0 c M1100 grade in situ concrete
(with 60 cm CNS backing in BC soils)



- 19-
In addition, all the following canals or canal sections would be lined:
(a)  upstream and downstream of structures, along embankments and around
curves to the extenc deemed necessary;
(b)  in areas of seepage rates more than 5 cfs/M ft2 (for field channels,
more than 2Z/100 m)
(c) in fills exceeding 30 cm, in pervious soils or in fractured rock;
(d) in stretches where the watertable is within 60 cm of the surface or
where, because of the nature of the terrain, natural drainage is
impeded.
3.26    Distributary Sizes and Commands.  A major 4esign parameter would be
the size of distributaries off the Kakatiya Canal. Several distributaries of
the Kakatiya Canal between km 0-146 carry only 4-5 cusecs and command as
little as 80 ha. For ease of control, a distributary should command not less
than about 1,000 ha, i.e. take a flow of about 25 cusecs. However, of the
44 distributaries that were originally designed to carry less than 25 cusecs,
37 are already built. COAP proposes to change the design of the remaining
7 to meet the principle outlined. They propose to proceed with combining as
many of the other 37 commands as possible during the implementation period of
this project but may find it expedient and cost effective to postpone some of
the proposed clubbing to a later stage. Accordingly, an agreement has been
reached with GOAP that, except as the Association shall otherwise agree, take
all such action as shall be necessary to ensure that each distributary linked
to the Kakatiya Canal between kilometers 146 and 267 shall carry no less than
25 cusecs of water and command an area no less than 1,000 hectares.
Construction Methods and Current Progress
3.27    Technology Used.  Present construction technology uses on
labor-intensive methods, which are suitable for most of the project works.
Excavation in rock is aided by blasting; there, and in deep cuts (e.g. parts
of the SRB Canal and the Kakatiya Canal) tipper trucks are mechanically
loaded. Elsewhere, tipper trucks are filled with headloads. Canal banks
would be compacted in layers by using sheeps' foot rollers. Portable mixers
would prepare all concrete for the structures.
3.28    Progress on the Madras Water Supply Canal.  Progress on components of
the Madras Water Supply canal, which would also carry water to the SRBC
project, in particular on the "Deep Cut" (para 2.04) is satisfactory.
According to the water supply agreement between the two States ("Agreement
entered into between the Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for
the Drawal of Water from River Krishna for Madras City Drinking Water
Supply") GOTN pay all costs directly attributable to conveying 15 TMC of
water in three months to the AP/TN border. This includes the cost of the
"Deep Cut" as it is designed and currently constructed. However, although
the risk of delay because of late payment or default by GOTN is minimal, an
agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would make provisions to finance
works on the Madras wate.r supply canal upstream of the Banakacherla
Regulator, and of the regulator itself, to the extent necessary to enable 19
TNC of water to be conveyed to the SRBC project area, starting on or before
September 30, 1987.



- 20 -
Status of Project Preparation
3.29    In the SRS scheme, GOAP is completing works above the Mannair Dam
and has started some of the major excavations below Mannair (paras
3.03-3.05). Detailed design work keeps up with contract awards and there
have been no delays. However, the time lag between the delivery of detailed
designs and the requirements of the contractors and site engineers has been
so narrow as to cause concern. Moreover, below the Mannair Dam, planning
focuses on works above the chak outlet and not on field channels and field
drains. In the SRBC scheme, the first 50 km of the canal have been designed
and some contracts awarded, but final detailed design of the 66 cross struc-
tures and bridges has not yet been completed. The distributiqn system has
only been designed in sample blocks, to establish costs.
3.30    To ensure the smooth progress of construction, GOAP has submitted
design and contracting packages, satisfactory to the Bank/IDA, that cover
all proposed works in the 1986-87 construction season. Plans and design
criteria to allow the temporary cultivation of rice, relying only on surface
water resources, has also been submitted and found satisfactory. However, to
ensure that design and contracting packages are always satisfactorily
prepared in good time before the beginning of the construction season, an
agreement has been reached with GOAP that it will submit detailed designs and
draft contract documents for all works proposed in both sub-projects by April
30, 1987, and thereafter by April 30 of each year for all work to be let to
contractors for execution during subsequent construction seasons.
3.31    To enable GOAP to meet this condition, all or part of the above
design and planning work may be contracted to a competent outside agency and
be part of the technical services and support component of the project (para
5.27).
Project Execution
3.32    In the past, major worke like dams and large canals tended to be
completed long before the distribution system; delay in full block develop-
ment, down to the 8 ha le-vel, was even longer. This unconcerted development
has been causing considerable delay in effectively utilizing irrigation
potential. Therefore, to shorten the time between incurring expenditure on
civil works and actually irrigating a block, an agreement has been reached
with GOAP that it would develop the distribution system, including the field
channels, concurrently with building the major canals.

IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
Project Cost Estimates
4.01    The estimated project costs over a seven-and-a-half-year period would
total US$475.8 M, including physical and price contingencies. This amount
includes foreign exchange cost of about US$76.4 M (16% of the total) and
about US$22.8 M (5% of the total) for taxes and duties. Estimated base cost
are given in January 1986 prices. Cost estimates are given in Table 4a to 4f
(details are in Annex 3) and summarized below:

4.02    Physical contingencies average 10%.  Price contingencies account for
over 222 of the total project cost. Local price contingencies are assumed to
be 7.0Z for 1986/87 - 1987/88, 7.5% for 1988/89, 7.7Z for 1989/95, 7.5% for
1990/91 and 4.5Z from 1991/93. Foreign price contingencies are assumed to be
7.0Z for 1986 and 1987, 7.5% for 1988, 7.7Z for 1989, 7.6% for 1990 and 4.5%
for 1991-93. Engineering and administration costs are estimated at 14Z of
construction cost.
Financing
4.03    The financing plan for the Droposed project costing US$ 451.1 M, net
of taxes and duties (US$ 22.8 M), is as follows:
US$ Million
GOI/GOAP           182.0
IBRD Loan          131.0
IDA Credit         140.0
Total         453.0
The proposed IBRD loan/IDA credit of US$ 271 M would finance about 602 of
total cost, net of taxes and duties, including the foreign exchange component
(US$ 76.2 M) and 52Z of the local cost. All GOI/GOAP expenditures would be
met by GOAP from its development budget, which includes a GOI contribution.



- 22 -
The IDA credit would be made to GOt on standard IDA terms, and the loan from
IBRD funds would be provided according to the standard IBRD terms.
4.04    An agreement has been reached with GOI that it will make the proceeds
of the credit/loan available to OOAP on standard terms and arrangements for
development assistance to the states. In addition, an understanding has been
reached with COAP that on April 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 1987
and thereafter by April 1 of each year, inform the Bank/IDA of the annual
budgetary allocations made for meeting, during the forthcoming fiscal year,
the financial needs derived from the implementation of the project, invest-
ment costs, O&M costs, administrative costs and other costs related to the
project.

4.06    Civil Works.  Construction works contracts under the project, includ-
ing contingencies, would cost approximately US$378.8 M (US$440.5 M less
US$61.7 M see footnote b/ above). Fourteen of the contracts costing
approximately US$252.3 N (or 66% of the irrigation works, costing US$378.7 M)
would be let through international competitive bidding (ICB). Eligible
domestic bidders would be afforded a preference of 7 1/2Z. Twenty-eight
other irrigation contracts, generally costing over US$1.0 M and all less than
US$6.0 M, with a total value of approximately US$78 N are large enough to be



- 23 -
shown in the procurement schedules (Tables 5a to 5g). However, because they
would cost less than US$6.0 M per contract, they are not large enough to be
of interest to foreign bidders and would be let through local competitive
bidding (LCB). The procurement schedules give detailed projections on how
and when the forty-two larger works are expected to be put to bid, started
and completed. The remaining works to be financed under the project, total-
ing approximately US$44 M, consist of: (i) on-farm development, small works
and buildings with individual valtues of less than US$1.0 M, scattered
throughout the project areas and let through LCB, and (ii) works that can
only be done by force account, approximately US$4.5 M, primarily required
for railway relocation and other works not readily contracted out.
4.07    Whenever practicable, all excavations, lining and structures in a
given segment of canal would be combined in one tender; such combinations
would be innovative in this project. This would produce efficiencies and
economies resulting from having only one main contractor in one area, which
would enable, for instance, utilizing spill from excavations to construct
embankments in the same unit.
4.08    Goods.  Equipment and vehicles, costing approximately US$4.3 M, would
be grouped in appropriate bidding packages and procured through ICB.
Qualified domestic manufacturers would receive a preference of 15% or the
equivalent of the import duty, whichever is lower. Light equipment and
smaller vehicles, estimated to cost US$1.3 M in total, are readily available
domestically at competitive prices, and will be procured through LCB.
Because of the need for service and spare parts facilities, considerable
advantages would be derived from procuring locally manufactured light equip-
ment and vehicles. The LCB procedures are satisfactory to the Bank.
Annex 3, Tables 1-3, shows details of procurement procedures to be adopted
for each type of equipment.
4.09    Procurement Review.  All procurement actions for works estimated to
cost more than US$0.5 M and goods estimated to cost over US$100,000 would be
subject to the Bank's prior review. This procedure would cover about 80% of
the value of the procurements. The balance of the contracts would be subject
to Bank's post-action review.
Disbursements
4.10    Disbursements under the loan/credit would be made against:
(a) civil works and buildings--65% of expenditures on main canals, dis-
tributary canals, minors, main drainage, roads and chak development
works (link drainage, field channels, field channel protection and
field drains);
(b) vehicles and equipment:
(i) directly imported--lOOZ of foreign expenditures;
(ii) locally manufactured--lOOZ of ex-factory costs; and
(iii) other locally procured--70Z.
(c) training, technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation --100x;
(d) rehabilitation --100Z.



- 24 -
4.12    Disbursement requests for civil works would be made against certifi-
cates of completion of units and statements of expenditure submitted by GOAP,
itemized by project component. Disbursements for chak development works
would be submitted together with a completion certificate duly signed by the
officer in charge of the contractors, stating that all works in the chak have
been completed in accordance with the agreed planning and design criteria.
Disbursements for payments of less than Rs 300,000 for works (including
departmental works) or Rs 150,000 for goods, training, adaptive and engineer-
ing research, on-farm development, monitoring and evaluation, the costs of
special surveys and rehabilitation services may be against statements of
expenditures. Documentation would be retained by GOAP, for inspection by the
Bank Group during review missions. Full documentation would be required for
all other disbursements.
4.13    The semiannual disbursement schedule and the proposed allocation of
the proceeds of the loan/credit are presented in Tables 6 and 7. The disbur-
sement profile is based on historical disbursement profiles for Indian
irrigation projects. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by
December 31, 1993.
Accounts and Audits
4.14    An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would:  (i) maintain
separate records and accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound
accounting principles and procedures consistently applied, its resources,
expenditures and operations related to the project; (ii) furnish to the
Bank/IDA copies of accounts and financial statements for each year, certified
as to their accuracy and authenticity by an independent auditor acceptable to
the Bank/IDA, not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year;
(iii) have accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank/IDA; (iv) furnish to the Bank/IDA
immediately following its finalization, the report of such audit in such
detail as the Bank/IDA shall reasonably request; (v) furnish to the Bank/IDA
any other information as it shall reasonably request; and (vi) enable repre-
sentatives of the Bank/IDA to examine all records pertaining to the Loan and
Credit.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Introduction
5.01    All surface irrigation projects in Andhra Pradesh are constructed by
the Irrigation Department (ID) which also operates and manages all but three
schemes. The Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development Department
(IU and CADD - referred to as CADD) is at present involved in three large
schemes: Nagarjunasagar, Sriramas&gar and Tungabhadra, where it is in charge
of operations below the chak outlet. In other schemes operation and manage-
meat beLow the outlet is done by farmers, assisted by the ID. The ID comes
under the State Minister of Irrigation; IU and CADD, since March 1985, under
the Minister of Agriculture.



- 25 -
The Irrigation Department- Present Organization
5.02    Senior Management.  The Irrigation Departmezv is headed by a
Secretary. Under him, the Chief Executive Officer and GOAP's principal
irrigation adviser is the Engineer-in-Chief to whom nine Chief Engineers (CE)
report directly, one of whom heads the Project Preparation and Monitoring
(PPK) Wing (Chart 1). The CE SRS is in charge of new constructions in his
scheme area and also operates and maintains its completed parts (Chart 5).
The CE Srisailam maintains the Srisailam Dam, is in charge of common works
of the Madras Canal comon to the water transfer (see footnote 11 on page
12) and the SRBC project (Chart 4). He will eventually control operations.
Both CEs have liaison with the administrations of project districts through
Special Collectors, who function independently of the District Collectors.
The CEs report directly to the Secretary of Irrigation on matters of policy.
Under the CEs, Deputy CEs act as senior staff officers. Each CE has a Design
and Quality Control Circle, headed by an SE. The SE Designs, under the
technical control of the CE (Central Design Organiz.tion), is responsible for
designs of all major works and structures.
5.03    Executive Management rests with SEs in the Circles.  The Circles
under CE SRS deal with dam operation, construction, construction combined
with operation anwz maintenance, or operation and maintenance only. The ID's
operation and maintenance (O&M) function ends at the chak outlet. The uni_
below the Circle is the Division, headed by an Executive Engineer (EE).
Whereas a Circle may have more than one funct:on (typically, construction as
well as O&M), a Division has only one. However, it is flexible and can
convert, for example, from construction to OEM. Typically, four to seven EEs
report to an SE, four Deputy EEs (in charge of Sub-Divisions) to the EE. A
Deputy EE has four Assistant Engineers (AE). In construction divisions the
AEs are on construction sites, supervising the accuracy and quality of the
contractors' work.
5.04    In O&M Divisions, the AE supervises a group of six Canal Inspectors
(CIs). Each CI is in charge of a group of six skilled laborers (laskars).
The workload of the AE and CI is determined by an administrative order.
The Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development Department (CADD)
5.05    Senior Management.  The Department is headed by a Secretary.  A CE
for Water Management, a SE for other works in the command areas, and the
Director of the Water and Land Management Training and Research Institute
(WALAMTARI) are his senior staff officers. Officers of middle management
rank coordinate the disciplines of cooperation, credit, statistics, and
on-farm and agricultural production development (Chart 2).
5.06    Operations Management. In the three schemes where CADD operate (para
5.01) there are Command Area Development Authorities (CADA) headed by an
Administrator (Chart 6). The Administrator's staff consists of officzrs on
deputation from line departments. CADA's function is to overcome constraints
to agricultural production and to coordinate the implementation of programs
formulated by the Command Area Development Board.
5.07    The Command Area Development Board deals with policy issues and is
chaired by the Minister of Agriculture. It consists of the Ministers of
Irrigation and Finance', the Chief Secretary, and all concerned Secretaries;



- 26 -
it meets four time,, a year.  The CADA Working Committee, which meets monthly,
is chaired by the Secretary, CADD and consists of the heads of departments in
the CADA area. Its main functions are coordination and dealing with issues
of a local nature, e.g. input supplies, marketing problems and water supplies
and allocations.
The Proposed Organization
5.08    Combining  D and CADD.  The duality of the ID and CADD organization
has proven less than satisfactory for effective project operation. There was
no single line of control of water deliveries, schedtuling and utilization
between headworks and chak outlets. Therefore, G(AP has decided to bring the
two departments under a single administrative controL, as is the case in many
other States. COAP has advised the Bank/IDA that it expects to complete all
necessary official steps to formalize the merger by April 1, 1986. It is
expected that the combined department would assign all tasks pertaining to
construction of irrigation projects to the Irrigation Wing and all tasks
concerning maintenance and operation of water delivery systems, water indent-
ing, water management, organization and guidance of water users' committees
and the coordination of farmer services not directly related to irrigation,
to the CAD and O&M Wing.
5.09    Following the establishing of a combined irrigation department, GOAP
intends to appoint a Merger Committee to determine exact allocation of
responsibilities between the newly established wings, lines of conmand, etc.
The Merger Committee would use consultants as required and visit other states
to learn from their experience. An allocation has been made in the cost
estimates to cover expenses likely to be incurred by this committee. Annex 6
gives full details of present and proposed organization.
Staffing Requirements and Qunctions under the Project
5.10    The present design and construction organization of the CEs heading
the two sub-projects would require strengthening to cope with the expected
workload. The SRBC sub-project would require, at its peak, a total of 327
engineers; the SRS 1,472. The proposed staff buildup is given in Tables 8a
and 8b. A training program would be required to prepare staff (in many cases
already serving) for their new, more exacting roles. Special emphasis would
be required to train design engineers, to create the capability that ensures
plans are prepared and reviewed well in advance of the time they are required
(para 3.30).  Table 16 outlines the type of training to be arranged for
irrigation engineers. An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would
(i) sanction and fill staff positions in accordance with an organizational
plan and staffing schedule established in consultations with the Bank/IDA;
(ii) train such staff to carry out effectively the project and to operate
and maintain project works according to accepted good engineering standards.
5.11    Routine O&M of the SRS system would be put under separate O&M
Circles. In accordance with GOAP norms (para 5.03), the upstream 165,000 ha
would be controlled by an O&M circle consisting of three Divisions. As the
area below the Mannair Dam is completed and passes out of the two-year com-
missioning period during which the Construction Circle is responsible for
maintenance, up to four more O&M Divisions would be required. Eventually,
three 05& Circles are envisaged: one would maintain, operate and control the
dams and have one or two O&M Divisions; the rest of the area would be divided
between the other two Circles which would have only OM duties. The feeder



- 27 -
roads would be maintained by the Roads and Buildings (R&B) Department of PID
(para 5.23).
Dam Safety
5.12    Pursuant to a resolution by the conference of State Ministers of
Irrigation in 1980, proposals have been submitted to GOAP for the formation
of a Dam Safety Panel, as well as a Dam Safety Cell. The Cell, in charge of
an Executive Engineer and under the operational control of the
Engineer-in-Chief, collects pertinent data on the behaviour of the dams (e.g.
seepages, piezometric pressures) which are available to the Dam Safety Panel
during their periodic inspection visits. The Panel, in accordance with GOI's
general guidelines, is responsible for monitoring aUl dams in the State. An
effective Dam Safety Panel is essential for public safety as well as for
reliable, safe irrigation and power generation. Therefore, an agreement has
been reached with GOAP that it would, by December 31, 1986 establish and
thereafter maintain the Dam Safety Panel with membership and terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank/IDA and cause it to inspect periodically
the Sriramasagar, Mannair and Srisailam dams in accordance with sound
engineering practices, to determine whether there are any deficiencies in
the condition of the structures or in the quality and adequacy of maintenance
or method of operation of the same which may endanger their safety. The Dam
Safety Panel would report to the Engineer-in-Chief and would have available
all the engineering disciplines required and recommended by CWC.
Agricultural Supporting Services
5.13    Agricultural Extension.  Under the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Exten-
sion Project (Cr. 1219-IN) agricultural extension is the sole responsibility
of the Department of Agriculture's (AD) Extension Wing (Chart 7). Agricul-
tural extension issues affecting the timely realization of project benefits
are (a) staffing densities in the project areas and (b) a senior technical
control organization dealing only with problems of irrigated agriculture.
Experience under the AP I Composite Project has shown that extension work is
more effective if irrigated areas are served by staff who specialize in the
problems of irrigated agriculture and if one Village Extension Officer (VEO)
is assigned to no more than about 800 farmers. Further, experience with
agricultural extension organizations in India and elsewhere shows that the
best results come if the staff in contact with farmers, their supervisors,
technical support and training officers are solely concerned with one type of
farming system: in case of this project, only with irrigated farming.
Therefore, the sub-projects would be organized into special extension areas
and, with the exception only of out-of-command pockets within the CCA of each
of the projects, these special areas will only have irrigated areas. Within
the special extension areas agricultural extension staff would be organized
on an outlet rather than a village basis, to ensure effective linkage with
Irrigation Department staff and farmers groups. They would be administered
under the organizational structure of the Department of Agriculture. Because
the special extension areas cut across district boundaries, the Subject
Matter Specialists (SMS) would be responsible to the Senior Joint Director of
the Zone under which the special areas fall. The SMS tend the monthly
workshops, thus assuring an effective research-extension linkage. Accord-
ingly, an agreement has been reached with GOAP that they would establish and,
thereafter, maintain an agricultural extension system in accordance with
organizational and staffing arrangements satisfactory to the Association,
which shall include: (i) two special agricultural extension units in the



- 28 -
right bank command within the SRS Sub-project area, to be established by
October 1, 1987; and (ii) one special agricultural extension unit in the SRBC
Sub-project area, to be established by October 1, 1988.
5.14    The GOAP at present is considering the reorganization of its
administrative structure, under which district administration would devolve
onto elected bodies and the districts would be subdivided into Mandals, which
would be smaller units than the present talukas; moreover, there may welL be
some adjustment to the present district boundaries. Since it is a basic
principle that the agricultural extension organization does not cut across
administrative boundaries, there may well have to be some minor reorganiza-
tion when the Mandal system is finally implemented.
5.15    Funding of the strengthened agricultural extension service would
continue under the ongoing extension project (para 5.13). Therefore, no
additional financial support would be required.
5.16    Agricultural Research.  The principal function of adaptive agricul-
tural research for project support would be to identify crops, cultural
practices and crop sequences that enable double cropping to the maximum
extent compatible with the amount and timing of water in the two project
areas.
5.17    Agricultural research in the State is directed by the Andhra Pradesh
Agricultural University (APAU) in Rajendranagar, near Hyderabad (para 2.22).
The first National Agricultural Research Project (NARP I) has financed the
establishment of zonal research stations in Nandyal and Jagtial. These
stations would be the field supervising bodies of the adaptive research
program. The Nardyal station has the land and soil types on which to imple-
ment a relevant research program. However, the Jagtial farm does not have
the space and sufficiently representative soils to fulfill the same function.
Therefore it would be necessary to establish at least two small substations
in the SRS area, one on vertisols (black) and one on alfisols (red), on which
junior research staff, supervised and directed from Jagtial, would implement
the program.
5.18    Much of the work in the proposed centers would focus on cultural
practices and land preparation, i.e. would involve research and investigation
of animal-drawn farm implements. Since most of the work required to serve
the needs of the project areas would be applicable to most of the Rayalaseama
and Telengana regions, the Agricultural Implement Research Center, adjoining
the APAU at Rajendranagar, shGuld play a key role in the program.
5.19    Funding of the work envisaged would be part of the All-India Agricul-
tural Research Program begun under NARP I, and continued under NARP II.
Accordingly, an agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would, by
December 31, 1986 cause the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University to submit
proposals to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for the estab-
lishment of suitable facilities in which to pursue an adaptive agricultural
research program to serve the needs of the project and also submit it to the
Bank/IDA for its comments; after taking into account these comments, finalize
and implement the program.



- 29 -
LandshapLng
5.20    Landshaping is an established part of irrigation development in AP.
Most landforming has been for rice and therefore the compartments are shaped
to zero slope. However, the need for longitudinal and cross slopes is recog-
nized and has been a standard feature of work done in earlier stages of the
non-rice areas in the SRS project. Farmers mostly shape their own land. The
State Agro-Industries Corporation (APAIC) also play a role, although most of
their work is on soil conservation in rainfed areas. Landshaping costs in
the SRS scheme are about Rs 3,000/ha; to date some 75,000 ha have been shaped
either by the farmers or by APAIC. Loans are available, irrespective whether
farmers do their own work or engage APAIC. Refinancing is proceeding
smoothly and only about 15-20Z of the farmers are not eligible for credit
because of earlier defaults.
5.21    APAIC has a fleet of over 140 bulldozers and an approved program to
purchase new units at the rate of 20 per annum during the Seventh 5-Year plan
(1985-1990). It also fabricates and sells metal ox-drawn scraperboards that
farmers require for their own landshaping. However, it does not have the
capability to survey, mark out and check fcr accuracy work done by the
farmers.
5.22    To ensure the availability of integrated landshaping plans, including
the proper siting and alignment of field drains, the ID would prepare com-
prehensive plans, in consultation with the farmers involved, to develop
entire outlet commands, including landshaping required for each field. It
would be essentz.& to ensure that farmers' landshaping effort is not imple-
mented in a manner that would interfere with effective drainage or irrigation
of adjoining fields. The staff necessary to perform this task would be
provided under the project.
Road Construction
5.23    Farm and feeder roads (para 3.10) would be constructed and maintained
by the Roads and Buildings (R&B) Division of GOAP's Public Works Department
(PWD). It has the capacity and organization to start survey and design work
immediately.  Work on farm roads would run concurrently with block develop-
ment in both sub-project areas.
5.24    Past maintenance of canal roads has been less than satisfactory.
This situation would be improved if their maintenance were to devolve on the
O&H Circles of the ID (para 5.11). The task would be integrated with routine
maintenance work on the cAnAls, as on the Gangetic plains.
Planning; Monitoring and Evaluation; Technical Services
5.25    Strong planning and monitoring units would be required at the head-
quarter level of the combined Irrigation and Command Area Department as well
as on the projects. While exact details of its specific functions would be
worked out by the Merger Committee (para 5.09), the present PPM Unit (para
5.02) will require considerable strengthening to fulfill its expected func-
tions and responsibilities. These would include, but not be confined to:
(a) all long-range planning of the irrigation sector in the State; (b)
monitoring quality control activities; (c) monitoring ongoing projects; and
(d) organizing and supervising special studies carried out on their behalf by
consultants. The Unit, headed by a Chief Engineer, would include engineers,



- 30 -
economists, sociologists, agriculturists and other professionals as necessary
to perform its functions. The PPM would monitor physical and financial
progress of project works, prepare reimbursement documentation to GOI and for
the Bank, and ensure that tendering and contracting procedures follow agreed
guidelines. Its initial task would be to conduct a benchmark survey to
record present socio-economic conditions in the project area. It would also:
(i) monitor system operation regarding timeliness of water deliveries,
according to the prearranged timetable, and losses in transit;
(ii) monitor groundwater levels, drainage conditions, the utilization of
existing wells and the rate of development of new wells;
(iii) collect crop data from local Revenue Offices in the CCA, irrespective
whether irrigated or not;
(iv) report changes in cropping patterns, crop selections, farming
intensities;
(v) assist in identifying factors that promote or slow down the introduc-
tion of beneficial chaniges in crop and cropping pattern, thereby
providing material for the adaptive agricultural research program;
(vi) evaluate the impact of project works, either in-house, or by con-
tracting out;
(vii)  commission, and supervise the execution of surveys to trace the
rehabilitation of persons resettled from the Mannair Reservoir site;
and
(viii)  prepare progress reports and the Project Completion Report.
The organization of the strengthened PPM unit is shown in Chart 3.
5.26    An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would:  (i) by
December 31, 1986 submit to Bank/IDA for comments a detailed list of func-
tions and staff strength of the PPM Unit; and plan for M&E activities und_
the project; (ii) by June 30, 1987 complete strengthening of the PPM; and
(iii) commencing January 1, 1987 and thereafter on January 1 of each year,
submit project progress reports in format and frequency agreed with the
Bank/IDA.
5.27    Because of the many innovative features of the proposed project,
principally in the field of design (paras 3.22-3.23) and water management
(paras 6.11-6.20) the ID would require the assistance of qualified consult-
ants with design and operation. The function of these consultants would
include, but not be confined to (i) general advice and collaboration, to
translate the principles of the structured network (para 3.22) into designs
and contract documents; (ii) defise operating rules, manuals and procedures
to provide, as far as possible, a reliable irrigation service based on
warabundi (para 6.10); (iii) to assist with studies to investigate the
desirability of integrating the operation of the minor tanks in the SRS
project (para 2.18) into the overall system; and (iv) to assist with inves-
tigating and planning further irrigation and drainage development in the
State. An agreement has been reached with GOAP tnat it would retain general
consultants, starting on November 1, 1986 to assist with final design and



- 31 -
documentation for constructing a structured system and to develop operating and
maintenance planes and from time to time/as required.to f.vdist the PPM with its
engineering preparation and planning tasks. Other consultants for X&E, rehabilita-
tion, studies and other activities would be engaged as required. All consultants
would be engaged in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Oualitv Control
5.28    Each CE has a Quality Control Circle.  While these Circles function ade-
quately, none of the engineers assigned to it had special training in quality
control and often does not remain long enough in the Circle to gain the requisite
experience. The Quality Control Circles would be strengthened by providing special
training to their engineers (para 3.14) and their monitoring tightened by the PPM
Wing (para 5.25). An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would take all
action necessary to ensure quality control by its departments and agencies
impler-- ing the project in respect of planning, design, construction, upgrading,
oper- u-i and maintenance of the works under the project.
Project Coordination
5.29    With the integration of ID and CADD, changes would be required in the
constitution and function of the Command Area Development Board (para 5.07), and
also the organization of the CADA Working Committee in the SRS sub-project. The
Co mittee vould review progress reports by the CE in charge of the scheme area,
monitor progreus of block development works and any other reports and statements
pertaining to project objectives. Its conclusions would serve as a guide for
future activities.
5.30    A similar Working Committee would be established for the SRBC sub-project,
where the SE whose Circle is engaged in the development of the service area would
be an ex-officio member. An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would, by
April 30, 1987, establish a Working Committee chaired by the Secretary CADD for the
SRBC sub-project with membership and functions agreed with the Rink/IDA.
VI. WATER MANAGENENT
Introduction
6.01    Due to the limited surface water resources of the Telangana and Rayalaseama
Regions, rice growing would severely limit the areas that can be irrigated from
surface sources. Therefore, it is GOAP's policy that all nev surface irrigation
projects in the two regions will be designed and operated to satisf7 the require-
ments of irrigated dry crops; potential rice growers would be required to provide
the additional water from their own wells. GQAP has further decided that surface
supplies over and above long-term allocations (para 6.06 and 6.09) will not be made
available to farmers, even as a temporary measure, during the development period of
new schemes jJ. This policy is based on lessons learned in the Nagarjunasagar
Project (para 1.12), where rice growing, temporarily permitted while the command
area Was being developed, has proved politically difficult to stop. Farmers have
taken more than their entitlement of water at the head reaches of the project to
sustain their rice and therefore water reaching the tail-enders vas less than their
fair share and inadequate for proper irrigated farming.
JI/ During the initial development period there is a surplus of water in most
schemes, as the reservoir is completed and irrigation starts before
development of the service area is completed.
L                                  .                           _






- 32 -
6.02    Improvements in the price and yields obtainable for maize, cotton and
groundnut give farmers added incentives to change to these crops. The higher
degree of skill required to grow irrigatd crops other than rice is becoming
more common and the trend is accelerating, particularly in the rabi season.
6.03    Localization.  Irrigated areas in AP are identified as "irrigated
wet" (IW) and "irrigated dry".  The procedure for this identification is
known as "localization".  The water duty I/is 40 ha and 16 ha in areas local-
ized as irrigated dry and IV respectively. In IW areas, all crops may be
grown but farmers grow mostly rice. In areas designated as irrigated dry,
--usually, but not always, the lighter soils,- rice and sugarcane are
specifically banned because farmers near the top reaches would prevent water
reaching downstream areas (para 6.01). Therefore, to ensure an equitable and
reliable water supply and to introduce the changes required in SRS to serve
all commandable lands to be irrigated, not only would it be necessary not to
localize new IW areas, but eventually to convert all existing IW into
irrigated dry lands. GOAP is aware of the problem and proposes that:
(a)  the new areas to be served from km 146-267, and eventually to km 284,
of the Kakatiya Canal be designated as irrigated dry, with a duty of
water at the chak outlet of about 1 cusec per 40 ha (to be derived
exogenously from the irrigation intensity based on the average design
cropping pattern and available water);
(b)  in presently irrigated areas, which are illegally taking more than
their share of water to grow rice, to throttle the flow to the
irrigated dry level as in (a) above; and
(c)  in the areas localized for IW, rice irrigation to continue only for a
limited period, after which the outlets would be throttled to
irrigated dry levels. In the interim, rice shutes would be provided,
eventually to be concreted up.
(d) supplies would typically be delivered intermittently (one week on-one
week off) except in peak planting seasons.
6.04    To ensure that the foregoing steps are taken in a systematic manner,
an agreement has been reached with GOAP that by October 1, 1986 it will
introduce and thereafter apply a water management plan in the SRS scheme
which would include a rotational water supply system, taking into account the
need for regulating irrigated dry crops. In doing so, rice growing will not
be possible using only surface water in the SRBC project and in parts of the
SRS project downstream of the Mannair Dam. However, farmers would be free to
grow rice if they supplement surface water from their own wells (para 6.29).
6.05    Regarding'the phasing out of rice growing on only surface supplies
(para 6.03[cJ), an understanding has been reached with GOAP that they would
proceed according to the following timetable:
(i) June 1986/June 1987 - Preparation of Action Plan giving details for
phasing out the designation of irrigated wet crops.
1/ The notional area served by a flow of I cusec.



- 33 -
(ii)  June 1987/June 1989 - Conversion of about 5,000 ha to irrigated dry
land.
(iii)  June 1989/June 1991 - Conversion of about 40,000 ha to irrigated dry
land.
(iv)  June 1991/June 1993 - Conversion of about 17,000 ha to irrigated dry
land.
While it may not be possible to meet the specified targets for conversion in
the periods stated because of the size of the units that have to be con-
verted, GOAP 's intention is to complete the process on the entire 62,000 ha
by the end of June 1993.
SRBC Water Balance
6.06    Supplies.  The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal Decision  of 1973 has
allocated to AP 800 TMC (22,640 Mm ) of the river's 75% dependable flow as
measured at the AP/Karnataka border. The Decision confines planned irriga-
tion development on the Krishna by the upstream riparians to be consistent
with the above allocation. However, the Decision allows AP to use all excess
flows until the year 2000, without creating a future right to such excess
flows. This allocation is augmented within the State by regeneration from
irrigation projects, estimated by the Tribunal as 11 TMC, but reduced by 5
TMC that AP (along with similar amounts from the two upstream riparians
Karnataka and Maharashtra) has surrendered to augment municipal and
industrial water supplies to Madras City (para 2.04). Out of its share, GOAP
has allocated 19 TMC (538 Mm3) to the SRBC project. Independent assessments
have confirmed the availability of this amount.
6.07    The cropping pattern expected to maximize returns to available water
requires supplies to be maintained until the end of March (Table 9a). Assum-
ing the Srisailam Reservoir will be operated as now planned, and given the
design parameters at the head reaches of the SRBC canal (para 3.03), the
assessments have confirmed that the required quantity of water can be drawn
until the end of March. An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it
would ensure that the SRBC project receives aL least 19 TMC (538 Y1m ) of
water between June 1 and March 31 in all years when inflows at the
AP/Karnataka border equal or exceed 800 TMC (22,640 Mm ); and
6.08    The Telugu Ganga Project.  With the construction of the Madras canal
that would deliver water to the AP/TN border, GOAP also initiated development
of a distribution system which would serve lands between the Banakacherla
Regulator (para 3.05) and the State border with TN. The Madras canal is
designed to deliver 15 TMC in about three months to Madras and could be used
to deliver water for other purposes outside this time period. Since GOAP is
entitled, under the Agreement, tc water entering the State over and above 800
TMC (para 6.06), it plans to use part of this water to supplement supplies in
the Pennar Basin for the Telugu Ganga Irrigation Project of about 150,000 ha.
However, construction of the project has not yet been approved by GOI. Since
any rabi irrigation in a proposed Telugu Ganga scheme must be available until
the end of ?.arch, the system would operate on the same schedule as specified
for the SRBC project (para 6.07). Therefore, it could compete with the SRBC
project when all the Krishna water upstream of the AP State border had been
utilized. However, based on the present rate of development irrigation works



- 34 -
in the basin, full utilization is not expected for many years. In the mean-
time, the efficiency of water use in old and new systems is expected to
increase far above present levels. For these reasons, with the assurance
requested (para 6.07) as well as the expected socio-political pressures in
the SRBC area to safeguard the allocated water supply, it can be expected
that the SRBC wilL in fact be provided with the amount of water required to
ensure the economic viability of investments in its development.
SRS Water Balance
6.09    According to the ruling of the Codavari Water Disputes Tribunal
(1979) AP is entitled to all the water that reaches the Sriramasagar Dam.
CWC estimate this to be 160 TMC (5648 Mm3). A further about 17 TMC is avail-
able at the Mannair dam, after downstream commitments in the Mannair river
are met. Thus, overall availability for the SRS scheme is about 177 TMC.
Storage in the Sriramasagar Reservoir (87 TMC, 2,460 Mm3) combined with that
of the Mannair Reservoir (13.4 TMC, 380 Mm") give the Kakatiya Canal much
flexibility. At full development the command would require the following
amounts of water:

would continue to have its supplies met from the Khaddam reservoir,
generated by the Khaddam river (para 2.08).

/c Requires supplementation by wells.
Therefore, at flll development down to km 284 of the Kakatiya canal, about
56 TMC (1585 Mm ) would be available to serve the area beyond km 284. Alter-
natively, if overall system efficiency attained would only reach about 37%,
there would still be sufficient water to serve the project area, even if the
165,000 ha between km 0-146 were to receive all their supplies from surface
sources. In that case, however, extending the command area beyond km 284
would not be feasible.
6.10    The 385 minor tanks within the GCA would be augmented by return flows
and system recoveries induced by irrigation, thereby indirectly benefiting
from the project (para 2.18). Their possible integration in the overall
system would be one of the studies expected to be commissioned by the PPM
Wing (para 5.27).



- 35 -
System Operation and Water Management
6.11    General.  Both SRS and SRBC would be managed as "utilities".  The
main objective would be to provide a reliable water supply to farmers. Ini-
tialLy the scheme (utility) will supply the water down to the 40 ha outlet,
according to predetermined schedules arranged in consultation with farmers'
representatives. Below the outlet distribution would be organized by the
Outlet Committees on warabundi schedules (para 6.18). It is expected that
water users organizations would undertake increasing responsibility over
time; they may ultimately buy water in bulk from the utility for sale to
farmers, collect water charges, etc. The structured system proposed (para
3.22) would provide an on-off supply to the head of each distributary.
Farmers would be free to grow crops of their choice, but the scheduling of
surface water would be such as not to cover the full irrigation requirements
of paddy and sugarcane: to grow these crops, they must meet the gap in their
water demand from their own weLls (para 6.31). There will be no canal sup-
plies in April-May to sustain sugarcane and canal supplies are likely to be
insufficient for rice at all times; certainly so in the rabi. The irrigation
system would however provide full supplementary kharif irrigation for a
typical mix of irrigated dry crops under drought conditions, and an average
irrigation intensity of about 70Z for rabi crops. Since GOAP's ID has no
previous experience with structured system operation and design, provisions
are made in the project costs to retain consultants, supervised by the PPM
Wing, to assist ID with the preparation of the necessary designs, the for-
mulation of operating rules and operation of structured systems (para 5.27).
6.12    Water Duty.  The design duty for the system wouLd be derived from the
peak requirements of the design cropping pattern, with suitable allowances
for seasonal rainfall and system losses. The allocation of water would be
uniform over the whole CCA in both SRBC and SRS except for presently
authorized IW areas in SRS where temporary arrangements would be made for a
higher water allocation to allow for paddy growing during the interim
change-over period (para 6.11). Only peak water requirements would be met
by continuous deliveries; lower than peak requirements, by intermittent
deliveries.
6.13    Irrigation Schedule - Rabi.  In the rabi season, when there is
usually no rain, the required irrigation frequency depends on crop consump-
tive use and the moisture-holding capacity of the soil. For almost all
project soils a 14-day cycle would be suitable. By September 1, the quantity
of water in the reservoirs is approximately known; by October 1, the
estimates are final and can only increase through late storms. Therefore,
the number of waterings for the rabi season is predictable. In consultation
with the Agricultural Department and the farmers' representatives, the ID
would promulgate, by ear'y October, an irrigation schedule for the whole rabi
which would meet the average demands. Every hectare of the CCA would be
allocated the same volume of water and the number of irrigation turns and
their timing would be made known to farmers before the beginning of the
season. An indicative flow schedule of the required surface supplies are
shown in Chart 8.
6.14    The incipient and actual damage and inequities arising out of
localizing part of the previously developed SRS system as IW require to be
remedied. This would be achieved by introducing, as rapidly as it is
expedient, a water management plan which would include a rotational water
delivery system, based on supplying irrigated dry crops over the entire area



- 36 -
(para 6.04). The objective would be that by kharif 1992 continuous flows
would cease in all distributaries and minors, forcing farmers who want to
grow rice to resort to using wells to meet both water requirements. In
addition, an agreement has been reached with COAP that it would, not later
than two years of the expected date in which water is to be delivered to the
SRBC scheme area, prepare and furnish to the Bank/IDA, for its review and
comments a detailed water management plan, which would include the rotational
water supply system, and thereafter apply such plan when water is delivered
to such scheme.
6.15    To ensure that farmers can make the best use of irrigation water, an
agreement has been reached with COAP that it would:
(a) each year, by September 1, starting in 1987, advise farmers of likely
timings and number of turns when water would be available in their
outlet between October and March;
(b) finalize the schedule by October 1 each year, starting in 1987, and
appropriately advise farmers; and
(c) inform farmers of any predictable deviation from the published
schedule at least one month in advance.
6.16    Irrigation Schedule - Kharif.  Under the rainfall pattern of the
project areas the highest return per unit of irrigation water is during
monsoon drought or too long interval between rainstorms. In this case,
irrigation prevents substantial yieLd reductions and crop failures. There-
fore, if over 50% of the farmers request irrigation water during the kharif,
it would be provided in their area if operationally feasible.
6.17    Carry -over storage, to enable an earlier start of the cropping
season, or a fixed-period start irrespective of the actual commencement of
the monsoon, would not be practical in SRS and SRBC schemes and it would be
impossible in the SRBC project without severely interfering with power gener-
ation. In SRS, pre-season planting implies harvesting all the planned crops
except cotton in heavy rainfall, which would result in higher production
costs and crop losses. In cases where early planting is desirable, as with
some varieties of cotton, farmers will have to rely on their wells.
6.18    Water Allocation within Outlet Command will be based in the warabundi
system, adapted to the conditions in the project areas. COAP has had limited
success in applying the warabundi system of water allocation in the SRS
scheme, because when introduced, water supplies were excessive. Now that
more of the area is developed, and the expected further rapid development of
the service area under the project, the lessons learned would facilitate
successful introduction. The system, which has been practised in North-West
India since the introduction of controlled irrigation, rotates the full flow
of the chak outlet to each farmer according to a predetermined timetable each
week. The quantity a farmer draws, i.e. the time period during which the
full flow is available to him, is proportional to the size of his landhold-
ing. As long as a farmer pays his water charges and does not use water for
unauthorized purposes, he is entitled to draw water whenever the outlet



- 37 -
discharges at the time of his weekly turn 1/. During any unscheduled shutdown
of the system, such as unexpected rainfall or canal breaches, the "Warabundi
Clock" continues to run. When supply resumes, it will be drawn by the farmer
whose turn is scheduled for the day and hour of the resumption.
6.19    Warabundi is a rationing system to discribute limited irrigation
supplies equitably. When water is abundant, as was the case when an attempt
was made to introduce warabundi scheduling in Pochampad, strict rationing is
not seem as necessary by the farmers and the plan may fail. However, even at
that stage equitable and predetermined supply at the outlet is essential.
As more of the potential command is developed, the full enforcement of
warabundi scheduling becomes necessary for an equitable and reliable service.
This stage has now been reached by the SRS scheme and is expected to be
reached by the SRBC scheme before 1992.
6.20    Distribution Management.  Three levels of distribution management
would be required:
(a) Main system comprising the dams, main and branch canals, would be
reguLated 2/ to provide a supply according to a pre-scheduled demand
to the distributary heads. In the rabi the demand would be according
to a predetermined schedule, which would only be changed if unex-
pected storms make an irrigation turn unnecessary. In the kharif the
demand will fluctuate according to rainfall. Adequate decision
procedures to determine kharif supplies would be developed. Deci-
sions would be taken by SE Circle (Canal and Dam Operations) (para
5.11) operating from a control center. A microcomputer wil. be used
to pLan scheduling and to monitor continuously the regulation of the
main canal. A transient flow program will be developed to minimize
wastage during either pre-planned or emergency regulation events.
(b) Distribution system, including the distributaries and minors, will be
running full on or off, with proportional distribution flumes or
adjustable proportionate modules (APMs) at each node. Since no gate
operation is involved, the duties of the staff would be limited to
monitoring physical failures and unauthorized interference. Opera-
tion would be supervised by the EEs' Division.
(c) Below the outlet, at the chak level.
6.21    Farmers' Organizations.  The system below the chak outlet would be
managed by farmers. At present, the CADA in the Sas area is charged with
organizing farmers in the chaks and having Outlet Comittecs (OC) elected.
6.22    The Act stipulates that OCs be elected annually.  Their election is a
matter of organization and therefore should be delegated to an authority
1/ Since the channels run for 24 hours, it is usual once a year change the
timing (e.g. farmers who draw water between 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. change with
those who dres it between 6 p.m. to 6 a.m).
2/ Sufficient control structures, as well as computation, communication and
measuring equipment would be provided to ensure that the manual regula-
tion facilities are able to deliver controlled volumes of water.
*           U.                  -



- 38 -
normally dealing with electoral matters. Also, whether all members should be
elected every year, or whether the entire committee should be elected for
four or five-year term, requires consideration.
6.23    The OCs would organize the construction of field channels leading
from the 8 ha outlet to each field. This section would consist of, typi-
cally, about 300 m long channels; the parts of concern to all farmers within
the chak are the ones serving more than one farmer 1/. Layout for this system
would be provided by ID as part of the overall chak development plan; its
execution would be part of the OCs' brief.
6.24    In the already operating portions of the SRS Project, the organiza-
tion outlined requires to be set up as soon as practicable; the enabling Act
has been on the Statute Books since March 1984. Therefore, an agreement was
reached with GOAP that it would, in the already irrigated areas of the SRS
command, arrange for the establishment of Outlet Committees for all outlets
on or before May 31, 1987.
6.25    In areas to be brought under irrigation in the scheme areas, an
agreement has been reached with GOAP that Outlet Committees would be estab-
lished, and their Chairmen suitably trained, not more than six months before
irrigation is due to start.
6.26    In addition to the Outlet Committees, it would be desirable to form
committees dealing with larger areas that the field channel command, commit-
tees to deal with minor canal and distributary commands, with whom ID offi-
cials in charge of larger units could discuss, from time to time, issues
affecting these larger areas. The members of these committees would come
from the OCs: typically, OC Chairmen would constitute a Minor Committee (MC)
and MC Chairmen a Distributary Committee (DC). The broad function of these
two higher-level committees would be:
MCs - to encure that outlets are not tampered and thereby
either deprive OCs of water or dump excesses on them;
- to represent the OC group when water allocations for
the season are arranged; and
- to request water in the kharif in case of draught;
DCs - to advise management of the distributary command
and to initiate remedial actions that would affect all
farmers in the area.
6.27    While in the long run, bearing in mind the ultimate aim of managing
the projects as a utility (para 6.11), these committees will come to fulfill
a major function, their role for the next few years may be fulfilled by ID
engineers. Therefore, an understanding has been reached with GOAP that,
after enough expe-?ience has been gained with the OCs, they will review the
position and initiate the necessary action to establish MCs and eventually
DCs.
11 If a holding is 8 ha, this provision would not apply; the length of
shared channels changes inversely with holding sizes.



- 39 -
Maintenance
6.28    Three kinds of maintenance activities have to be considered:
(a) between construction of a new scheme and its handing over to the operat-
ing divisions; (b) routine maintenance; and (c) special maintenance, made
necessary by storms, breaches, accidents in operation or major repairs that
normally do not lend themselves to routine operations. COAP's budget for
routine maintenance has averaged about Rs 50/ha, of which only Rs 12/ha were
available for contracts, the rest being absorbed in establishment costs.
This sum has proven inadequate, as shown by the r-ondition of completed works
in SRS and other operating systems; it needs to be increased.
6.29    Concerning new works constructed under the project, maintenance
during the first two years of their operation would be part of construction
costs and in the hands of the construction Circles.  This commissioning
period would give adequate time for an in-depth examination and assessment of
realistic O&M costs to cover routine and expected special maintenance.
Accordingly, an agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would (i) by
March 31, 1987, initiate, under terms of reference agreed with Bank/IDA, a
detailed study to review existing rules, procedures and financial require-
ments for operation and maintenance and collection of water charges from the
irrigation systems; (ii) submit to the Bank/IDA, by March 31, 1988, a report
summarizing the results and recommendations of the study for its review and
comments; and (iii) taking into account Bank/IDA comments, implement such
recommendations. Annex 4 provides the terms of reference for the study.
6.30    The maintenance of the distribution systems below the outlet would be
the responsibility of the OC (para 6.24) which would share the task propor-
tionately among farmers in the chak. Maintenance works such as vegetation
control, desilting and minor repair to embankments can be readily provided by
farmers. Repair to structures, which would require cement and sand, is
expected to be infrequent. To ensure proper maintenance of field channels
and their structures, an agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would:
(a) cause the outlet committees to maintain the field channels and assist
the process by promptly providing, for due compensation, the neces-
sary building materials as required; and
(b) where the outlet committees fail to maintain the field channels,
ensure execution of the work by Irrigation Department and recover the
cost from the farmers.
Groundwater Development
6.31    Shallow dug wells are a traditional feature of Deccan agriculture.
There are about 5,200 such wells in the areas to be rought under irrigation.
In the project areas, they would recycle over 300 Mm of water annually from
the shallow aquifers, at present recharged mainly by rainfall. There is a
potential for further about 4,030 wells in SRS and for about 2,000 in SRBC,
to lift a total of about 420 Mm . Under project conditions, groundwater is
likely to be utilized for two purposes, which would almost certainly overlap:
(a) to su?port rice growing under the projected water management regime
(para 6.04) under which the canals discharge intermittently (to
maintain standing water in the field, the compartment requires
replenishment about every three or four days);



- 40 -
(b) to grow crops that require frequent light waterings (e.g. vegetables)
and perennial crops that require irrigation when the system would
be normall-y closed (e.g. sugarcane and orchards).
Present financial incentives to develop wells are adequate and GOAP intends
to continue them. However. excessive supplies of surface water that have
been available in the partially developed SRS project have not only slowed
dowr. well development, but have led to the abandonment of many wells. Once
the service area is more fully developed, and surface supplies better con-
trolled, the momentum to construct wells is expected to resume. The agricul-
tural extension and research services would further encourage the trend by
developing and advocating profitable cropping systems relying on wells to
supplement surface water. The yield of the wells, and the number that can be
developed in the command areas, would increase substantially once irrigation
is established and recharge of the aquifer increased.
VII.  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
A. Agricultural Production
Srisailam
7.01    Present cropping intensity in the project area is about 106%.  The
cropping pattern is largely subsistence oriented: foodgrains and legumes for
home consumption, groundnuts and short-staple cotton as cash crops. Without
irrigation, neither the present crop mix, nor cropping intensities are likely
to change much; however, better extension services, armed with the
appropriate messages, increasing adoption of improved farming practices and
water conservation techniques may enable yields to increase somewhat with or
without the project. With irrigation, production would become more stable,
intensified and would shift to higher value crops; cropping intensity would
reach about 135% (Chart 9). The largest output increments are expected from
groundnuts and from changing to medium-long staple cotton instead of
short-staple cotton (Table 10).
Sriramssagar
7.02    In parts of the project area where there is irrigation, overall
cropping intensity is about 120%. The total irrigated area has never
exceeded 106,300 ha, implying an irrigation intensity of only 64X (1983/84
season), due to deficiencies in the water distribution system. About 22% of
the area actually irrigated grow rice. In parts of the area where at present
there is no irrigation, the cropping pattern, as in Srisailam, is subsistence
oriented. Cropping intensity is about 108Z; double cropping is sustained by
wells. With the project, cropping intensity is expected to reach 150% in the
previously irrigated areas and 135Z where there has been no previous irriga-
tion. The ultimate expected cropping pattern, and the way it fits into the



- 41 -
cropping and farm management calendar is shown in Charts 10-12. Full
development is expected to take about 20 years. The principal cashcrops
grown would be groundnuts and medium-staple cotton. Ultimately, both areas
would be cropped at an intensity of not less than 150X because of conjunctive
groundwater use, made largely possible by the higher aquifer recharge rates
due to irrigation (para 6.31). Production increments of maize, groundnuts
and cotton are expected to account for 75Z of the incremental value of
production. long run, be dictated by international market prices. Produc-
tion will change from short-staple to medium-to-long-staple cotton, which
Lesponds better to irrigation and is internationally more readily marketable.
Market Prospects and Prices
7.03    Incremental production resulting from the project will be a small
percentage of AP's total agricultural production and therefore would be
readily handled by existing marketing channels. Prices of grundnuts and
other oilseeds are likely to be kept steady by India's high income elasticity
of demand for edible oils, and by GOI's continuing efforts to reduce its
Large vegetabLe oil imports. Cotton prices will, in the long run, be dic-
tated by international market prices. Production will change from
short-staple to medium-to-long-staple cotton, which responds better to
irrigation and is internationally more readily marketable.
Far. Incomes
7.04    Representative farm models have been used to calculate the project's
impact on farm incomes. Prevailing financial prices were used to value
outputs and inputs. The results are detailed in Table 12 and summarized
below:

B. Cost Recovery
General
7.05    Direct means of cost recovery like water charges have not been used
to their full extent: their present levels are lov and procedures for their
assessment inadequate. A Betterment Levy for recovery of capital costs has
been sucessfully challenged in the courts and its collection suspended. The
most important source of cost recovery is therefore revenue from sales taxes
on incremental agricultural production. To improve the current situation,
and in particular to increase the share of direct charges in cost recovery, a



- 42 -
high-level standing Water Charge Committee would be established under the
project to review regularly cost recovery policy and propose adjustments.
Present Situation
7.06    Water Charges.  Water charges are generally perceived by farmers as
taxes and not as charges for irrigation service. Revenue from water charges
accounts for Less than 1X of total state income and only about 602 of annual
expenditures on OS". Depending on the type of irrigation provided, two basic
water rates are currently charged: Rs 75 per ha cropped for IW (i.e. paddy)
and Rs 60/ha for irrigated dry (i.e. upland) crops (para 6.03). Concessional
rates are .xarged during the first four years, beginning with 20X of the full
assessment after the initial release of water, followed by equal annual
increases to the full rate in the fifth year 11. The present level of water
charges in SRS irrigated areas amounts to about Rs 60/ha of net CCA which is
about 12 of the gross value of production. It has been at this level since
1974. However, on August 1, 1985 GOAP published in the Government Gazette
its intention to double water charges beginning with the 1986-87 crop season.
The statutory time allowed to raise objections has passed and therefore an
agreement has been reached with GOAP that it will issue orders not later than
May 30, 1986 to revise its water charges and recover the full cost of opera-
tion and maintenance and a reasonable portion of the capital costs, taking
into account farmers' repayment capacity.
7.07    Assessment of Water Charges. Assessment of water charges and the
exchange of information between the ID and the Revenue Department (RD) needs
to be substantially improved (para 7.12). The assessment and collection of
water and water related charges is the responsibility of the RD. Water
charge assessment requires accurate verification of areas actually irrigated.
Detailed records of land revenue and water charge assessments are maintained
by the Village Revenue Officer (patwari). Provisional assessment is made for
every field receiving irrigation (source-wise) during October/November, and
is finalized in Kay/June. The assessments are aggregated by revenue juris-
dictions for the entire State. Au important part of the records are detailed
notes describing the performance of an irrigation system below the outlet.
The reason why every potentially irrigable field does not receive irrigation
or receives an inadequate service is recorded and used to deal with applica-
tions for remission of land revenue. However, revenue remission proceedings
are not communicated to ID; nor are they consulted. Exchange of information
between the ID and RD is limited and irregular: ID does not provide RD with
information on irrigated areas as identified on project maps, and RD does not
inform ID on irrigated areas as entered in the village records. Exacerbated
by a shortage of field staff in both Departments, this lack of communication
permits farmers to conceal irrigated areas, evade payments, misuse water and
own more irrigated land than permitted under the Land Ceiling Act.
7.08    Betterment Levy. The GOAP Irrigation Act provides for collection of
a betterment levy for recovery of capital costs from farmers benefiting from
public irrigation works. The betterment levy is defined as half the increase
in land value due to an individual project (calculated using before-and-after
land values). On the basis of present land prices in SRS, the levy should
amount to about Rs 7,000/ha. The repayment period and the interest to be
1/ A 37% land cess surcharge on the relevant basic rate which used to form
part of the assessment has been recently abandoned.



- 43 -
charged on the outstanding amount are determined by an executive order,
published in the official gazette. However, the assessment of the betterment
levy has been successfully challenged in the courts. Therefore, GOAP sub-
stituted it in 1976 with a special one-time land tax of Rs 500/ha,
recoverable in equal installments (without interest) over a 10-year period.
As pres.,stly constituted, the special land tax would recover less than 1%
of the project's capital costs.
7.09    Indirect Taxation.  GOAP's most important means of cost recovery from
irrigation projects is currently indirect taxation. The State government
relies on revenue from sales and commodity taxes, users' fees for support
services, roads and bridges ("octroi" charges), fees in the regulated markets
and commodities taken to the larger settlements for disposal. Indirect
taxation provides 90Z of public revenues from agriculture and is steadily
growing in real terms. The most important source is the sales tax on
agricultural producis which averages about 4Z. Moreover, according te recent
studies of the Indian tax system 1/ effective indirect taxation on inp. q
indicates actual tax rates on private consumption expenditures of about 6%
and 4% for above and below poverty-level rural households.
7.10    Farmers' Ability to Pay Water Charges.  For the assessment of
farmers' ability to pay for irrigation service, the project rent 2/ has been
estimated. At full development in about 20 years, the project rent would
average about Rs 7,800/ha in SRBC and about Rs 4,200/ha in SRS (Table 13).
Another indicator of the net benefits resulting from irrigation is the
general increase in land prices as a result of irrigation development. For
example, prices range from Rs 10,000/ha to Rs 15,000/ha for dry land and Rs
20,000(ha to Rs 40,000/ha for irrigated land in SRS.
71.11    Capital and OEM Costs.  The present value of the cost of irrigation
infrastructure in the SRBC scheme, including on-farm development works but
excluding roads, would amount to Rs 19,300/ha of CCA. Annual capital
recovery (discounted at 12% interest over 50 years) would amount to
Rs 2,320/ha. The cost of irrigation infrastructure in the SRS scheme is
estimated at Rs 8,700/ha of CCA. This amount includes part of the
Sriramasagar Dam (75% allocated to irrigation), the full cost of the Mannair
Dam and the Kakatiya Canal. The sunk costs of these works have been adjusted
to 1985/86 values. The annual capital recovery cost would amount to Rs
1,050/ha. A preliminary estimate of Rs 150/ha of net CCA for routine O&h
requirements has been used; actual annual OK cost would be subject to a
major review under the project (para 6.29).
7.12    Analysis of Present Situation.  The present level of recovery of
water and water related charges per ha of net CCA would be as follows:

yet been introduced agricultural sales taxes equal about Rs 40/ha.
/b Assumes that all incremental production of cash crops (cotton,
groundnuts, and chilles) will be marketed and that the incremental revenue
would be entirely due to the investment in the project.
Thus, although total recovery would exceed OUM costs, it would average rela-
tively small share of the project rent. Therefore, there would be scope for
increased recovery.  The process of assessment and collection of water char-
ges also needs improvement (para 7.07). The increased reliability of water
supply will undoubtedly increase farmers' (especially tailenders) willingness
to pay.
Proposed Improvements
7.13    Improved Cost Recovery.  Three main conditions would assist to
improve direct cost recovery: (i) providing a reliable and equitable water
supply (para 6.18); (ii) acceptance by system operators and farmers that
water charges are a payment for service provided and not tax; and (iii)
accurate and reliable assessment of areas irrigated. It would be important
that farmers perceive water charges as payments for irrigation service and
not as a form of general taxation. Especially, farmers should see a clear
link betweeen the level of water charges and the quality of service. To
achieve this, and to progress towards a businesslike (utility) management
(para 6.11) of the project's irrigation system, it would be essential to
maintain for each system separate accounts, reflecting the cost of OlI and
the revenue from water charges. Unfortunately however, water charge collec-
tion accounts are not kept in a manner that allows their fully reconciliation
over the entire CCA: the units are village areas which almost always include
non-irrigated areas and often also irrigation from sources other than the
major schemes, e.g. tanks or wells. However, representative sample areas in
each of the schemes allow for a statistically meaningful relation between
collections and expenditures to be established. An understanding has been
reached with GOAP that Bank review missions will be given access to these
records. In addition, an agreement has been reached with COAP that it would
maintain in its Irrigation Department separate records to reflect expendi-
tures on OlK in each irrigation system.
7.14    Vater Charges Comittee.  To ensure that the level of cost recovery
is regularly reviewed, particularly with respect to 0& costs, and increased
to the eztent possible without impairing farmers' incentives to use irriga-
tion water efficiently, a high-level standing Water Charges Coimittee would
to be established (as is the case in several States). It would revie', water
and water related charges at least every two years and propose adjustments.
Accordingly, an agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would (i) by
March 31, 1987, constitute a Water Charges Review Comrittee, with membership



- 45 -
and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank/IDA which would conduct a
review of the level of water and rater related charges and the method of
their assessment and collection; (ii) submit, by September 30, 1987, a report
summarizing the results and recommendations of the comittee to the Bank/IDA
for its review and comments; (iii) taking into account the Bank/IDA comments,
implemeut such recommendations; and (iv) by July 1 of every second year,
commencing July 1, 1989 cause the Water Charges Comittee to complete a
review of the levels of irrigation water and related charges and ba"ed on the
Cormittee's recomendations, if required, promptly revise the charges, to
recover full O&N costs and a reasonable portion of capital investment, taking
into account farmers' repayment capacity. Regarding the composition of the
Water Charges Committee, an understanding has been reached with GOAP that the
Water Charges Review Committee shall consist of the Secretaries of Agricul-
ture, Finance, Irrigation and Revenue of GOAP, among others. The draft terms
of reference have also been agreed (Annex 4).
7.15    Cos. and Rent Recgverr under the Proiect,  Cost and rent recovery
indices aJ are estimated at 191 and 131, respectively (Table 14). However,
given the reliance of GOAP on indirect taxation, the effectiv- rate of rent
and cost recovery is probably understated; increased agricultural income
vould generate growth in other sectors of the economy and thus additional tax
revenue. The latter index indicates that, if the project net benefits would
materialize, there would be a considerable scope to increase cost recovery further.
fII. BENEFITS AID JUSTIFICMTION
Project Imnact
8.01    The overall direct project impact in terms of agricultural produc-
tion, rural employment generated and farm families benefiting at full
development is summarized below:
LI The cost recovery index is the ratio between the incremental tax and
water charge revenue to discounted present value of the total project
cost (discounted over the project's lifetime). The rent recovery index
is the ratio between the discounted present value of the incremental tax
and water charge revenue and the discounted present value of the project
rent. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted over 50
years at 121 in constant 1985/86 prices.

/a Defined as the sum of gross farm incomes minus cash inputs (excluding
labor).
8.02    Project construction works and the increase in agricultural produc-
tion would generate a significant increase in employment opportunities.
Unskilled labor employed in construction work over the next 7 years would
amount to about 15,400 full time jobs. Creating new irrigated areas and the
improvement of existing systems would increase direct employment con-
siderably. At full development, the increased demand for farm labor would
amount to about 11.7 N mandays per annum (equivalent to about 48,600
full-time jobs). About two thirds of the demand would be supplied by hired
labor, the majority of which consists of landless workers. The projected
increase in value-added in agriculture would be some Rs 1,700 M. The
development would generate additional income and employment in local nonfarm-
ing sectors, such as marketing, transport and processing, estimated at about
12,200 full-time jobs.
Poverty Impact
8.03    The absolute poverty income level for rural India is estimated at
Rs 1,370 per capita per year. The landless population in the two project
areas is estimated to be about 25Z in the SRBC and 18S in SRS. It may be
assumed that the income of these families does not exceed that level.
Present net farm incomes for a median farm (2.0 ha) in SRBC is estimated at
Rs 2,600. In the SRS area already receiving irrigation, the net income for a
median farm (1.1 ha) is about Rs 3,500; in areas not yet developed, Rs 2,000.
However, a farm family of five to be above the absolute poverty level,
requires an income of about Rs 6,850 (Is 1,370 x 5) which is more than twice
the present farm income. Since opportunities for off-farm incomes are
limited, it may be assumed that the per capita income of most of these
families at present do not reach this level: in SRBC a farm of about 5.3 ha;
in S3S, 2.1 ha in irrigated areas and 3.7 ha in presently rainfed areas would
be required to achieve poverty threshold incomes. Thus at present about 75%
of farm families in SRBC and 85% in SRS live below the poverty level at
present. With the project, in the SRBC area farm incomes are expected to
increase to about Rs 10,200/ha, therefore the incidence of poverty would be



- 47 -
reduced to about 25%. In SRS the incidence of poverty would be reduced to
22% in the presently irrigated and to 30% in the presently rainfed areas.
Environmental Effects
8.04    The project is not expected to have adverse environmental effects.
In this re' tively low rainfall areas, given the expected care in the manage-
ment of the system, the chances of creating stagnant water for mosquito
breeding are small and will not generate appreciable additional health
hazard.. An agreement has been reached with GOAP that it would take all
measures considered necessary to minimize the hazards of malaria and other
water-related disease in the project area.
Economic Analysis
8.05    Basic Assumptions.  The assumptions for the analysis are detailed
in Annex 2. Economic prices for tradeable crops (rice, sorghum, cotton,
maize, groundnuts) and inputs (e.g. fertilizer) were derived from IBRD price
projections and for non-traded crops (pulses, vegetables) from the prevailing
and projected market prices (Table 11). Studies of farm labor supply and
demand in India typically suggest a ratio of economic shadow wage rate to
market wage in the range of 0.50 to 0.70. The shadow price of agricultural
labor was assumed at about 67Z of the going wage rates for hired labor. Cost
items were valued by employing specific conversion factors to financial
costs. Benefit build-up is the result of the assumed phasing of areas to
come under irrigation and the ability of farmers to adapt to changes brought
about by irrigation. It was assumed that planned irrigation intensities
would be attained in 3 years in areas already irrigated and 5 years in areas
where irrigation will be newly introduced. A more gradual build-up (10
years) was assumed for projected yields, and optimal input use.
8.06    Foregone Power Benefits in SRBC.  When the Srisailam Reservoir is not
spilling, water used for irrigation would result in foregone power revenue.
It is estimated that the opportunity cost of lost power revenue is about
Rs 600,000 per TMC, or Rs 9.6 M for the 16 TMC drawn during the period when
the reservoir is not spil.ling. It was further assumed that the loss of power
revenue would be gradual and proportional to the growth rate of demand for
irrigation.
8.07    Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  The ERR was calculated for the full
development stage of both schemes, since works financed under this time-slice
are closely related to those which would be financed under follow-up phases.
Implementation schedules and costs and benefits were based on COAP's per-
ceived implementation capability and disbursement profiles for Indian



- 48 -
irrigation projects (para 4.13). Sunk costs were accounted for in the
analysis. 1/ Discounting cost and benefit streams over 50 years,
the ERR is estimated at 20% for SRBC scheme, 23% for SRS scheme and 22%
(weighted average) for the two schemes combined (Tables 15a and 15b).
8.08    Sensitivity Analysis.  Sen3itivity analysis was conducted to deter-
mine the effect of deviations from the main assumptions on the economic
viability of the project. The measure of sensitivity used, the 'switching
value' is the value of the variable tested which would reduce the present
value of the project's net incremental be efits discounted at 12% (the
estimated opportunity cost of capital) to Zero. The results are summarized
in the following table:
SRBC Scheme                SRS Scheme

/a Costs and benefits discounted.
Several tests were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the assumptions
made in the economic analysis with the following results:
(a)  Failure of Water Management Component.  During project implementation
(both in SRBC and SRS) the availability of irrigation water per ha of
CCA would be greater than at full development. The pattern of
utilization of surplus water would have an important effect on the
success of water management. If the present trends of utilization of
this surplas are allowed to continue (i.e. excessive water consump-
tion in the upper part of the distribution system) the ERR for the
SRS scheme would decline to 13%. If a similar trend is allowed to
develop in SRBC, the ERR would decline to 9% (para 8.09).
(b) Delay of Deep Cut Channel in SRBC. The works on the approach channel
from the Srisailam reservoir (common works for SRBC and Madras water
supply works) are now in progress and the completion of the works is
expected by 1987. A delay of 4 years, assuming construction on SRBC
would proceed as planned, would reduce the ERR to 12X.
1I/ The sunk cost of the Lower Mannair Dam have been included in the
analysis. The sunk cost and their spread over time beginning in 1978/79
have been brought to constant 1985/86 prices (Indian Wholesale Price
Index), discounted at 12Z rate of interest and entered in the first year
of the project. Similarly, the sunk cost of recently completed con-
veyance works have been taken into account.



- 49 -
(c) Lack of Attention to Block Development. If the currently achieved
standards and quality of works on the distribution system are con-
tinued, the incremental benefits would remain about equal to the
level realized in traditionally designed irrigation projects (a
reduction of incrementaL benefits by about 40%). With an appropriate
adjustment of the investment cost to account for lower quality * -ad-
ards the ERR would decline to about 10% in SRBC and 13% in SRS.
Similar effect would result if chak development and related works
would be allowed to lag behind main infrastructure.
(d) Agricultural Growth without Irrigation. It has been assumed that
without irrigation agricultural production would not change much
except for the caveat stated in para 7.01. However, if instead the
average annual growth rate of 2Z achieved in India over the 1970/71
to 1983184 period is applied to the without-project situation, the
gRR would decline to about 17% in SRBC and 20Z in SRS.
(e) Not developing the balance 12,000 ha in Srisailam and 40,000 ha in
SRS would reduce the ERR to 17% and 20% respectively.
8.09    Project Risk.  Overall, the results of sensitivity analysis indicate
that only large deviations from the basic project assumptions could make the
schemes economically unviable. However, some of the risks require special
attention. In the top part of SRS many farmers are well established paddy
growers in areas localized as irrigated wet. In addition, many farmers
utilize available surplus water to grow paddy in areas localized as irrigated
dry. There is a risk that GOAP may have difficulty in enforcing water
allocation and management procedures planned under the project. However, the
government is fully coomitted, and should be abLe to overcome the difficul-
ties. This judgement is supported by recent evidence from experience
recently found in the AP I project. Moreover, farmers in disadvantaged areas
of S9S are likely to exert sufficient pressure that would help GOAP to
enforce efficient and equitable water allocation.
8.10    Another risk is that GOAP may face development budget constraints and
have difficulties implementing the project according to the projected time
schedule. State finances have been closely scrutinized. It has been con-
cluded that the State would be able to finance a Plan between Rs 52,000 M and
Rs 75,000 M by raising new revenue and be capable of financing the project.
8.11    Regarding the Mannair reservoir site (para 3.19) the remote pos-
sibility exists that the villagers who would be flooded when the reservoir
is filled refuse to give up their houses and lands and would not move.
Should this happen, the live storage of the resorvoir would diminish or even
disappear, but water could still pass down the river bed and be rediverted
into the Kakatiya canal, below km 146. The loss of this storage will not
affect water supplies to the proposed project but may have an influence on
its extension beyond km 284 at some future date.

Note:  The above show theoretical, calculated water requirements to achieve genetic yield
potential. In practice, and particularly during June-July, actual requirements are
lower because the rainfall is more effective than the calculated data. Therefore,
(a) little or no irrigation would be required in June and July, and (b) June
irrigation requirements are postponable to July, without creating irrigation
requirements in April.  Thus, the design cropping pattern in fact requires only
about 522 MV3 of water, out of an allocation of 538 Mm3 (19 TMC).
Water use efficicacy between reservoir and plant was assumed to be 50% in a fully
lined system.

SECOND ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic Analysis
Prices and Conversion Factors
1.      General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural com-
modities (at farm gate) were derived from the IBRD world market prices
(1985 projected through 1995) expressed in 1985/86 currency values with
appropriate adjustments for freight, handling and processing. Non-traded
foodgrains and other non-traded goods and services were brought to a common
basis with the traded goods and services through the use of conversion
factors. Three conversion factors have been used: (i) Standard (SCF);
(ii) Construction (CCF); and (iii) Food (FCF). Details on their derivation
and use is described below. The opportunity cost of capital (OCC) was
assumed at 12X. The exchange rate of US$1.0 to Rs 13.0 was used to convert
prices expressed in US dollars to local currency values.
2.      Standard Conversion Factor.  To measure India's net economic
benefits from the project, costs and benefits of the project have been
evaluated at world market prices. This requires certain price adjustments,
since many items are not traded in the world markets and the prices of
others are affected by tariffs and trade restrictions. To make them com-
parable, a SCF have been applied to the price of non-traded goods. In the
absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be estimated by using the fol-
lowing formula:
SCF=            X + M
X + Sx + M + Tm
where:  X = export value (f.o.b.);
M = import value (c.i.f.);
S = subsidies on exports;
T = taxes an duties on imports
For the period since 1970, this calculation has produced a SCF of 0.86.
However, since this method does not take into consideration quantitative
restrictions on trade, the esti:lsates derived provide only an upper limit
for the SCF.  The Planning Corsvission recommends conversion factors for
foreign exchange and untra" ; goods of about 0.75 in the evaluation of
industrial projects. This estimate is near to the Lower limit of the real
SCF and therefore, 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
3.      Construction Conversion Factor.  The construction of project civil
works require the use of a mixture of equipment, materials, and skilled and
unskilled labor:



-89-
Annex 2
Page 2
(a) Traded Component: This component includes capital-intensive works
which require imported materials. Hence a conversion factor of
1.00 has been used. It is estimated that about 5% of the construc-
tion costs fall under this category.
(b) Non-Traded Component. This component includes works that require
skilled labor and locally manufactured materials. Thus 0.80 has
been used. These works include about 45Z of construction costs.
(c) Unskilled Labor. A ratio of economic to financial wages equal to
that of agricultural labor (67X) has been used for unskilled con-
struction labor (para 6). Unskilled labor is estimated to con-
stitute about 50Z of the total construction costs.
The weighted average of these conversion factors would be as follows:
Conversion Factor       Weight
Traded Items                   1.00               0.05
Non-Traded Items               0.80               0.45
Unskilled Labor                0.67               0.50
Construction Costs             0.75               1.00
(weighted average)
Thus, a CCF of 0.75 has been adopted for converting the cost of cor.3truc-
tion works from financial to economic prices.
4.      Economic Prices of Commodities and Foodgrain Conversion Factor (FCF).
The economic prices for traded commodities such as rice, sorghum, ground-
nuts, maize and cotton were derived by using border prices in US dollars
according to IBRD commodity projections and converted to local currency
values at the standard exchange rate (Table 1). The domestic cost com-
ponents (local transport, handling and marketing charges) were adjusted by
a SCF of 0.80. The economic prices for non-traded foodgrains were derived
by applying a FCF 1/ to the present financial prices. The analysis of price
trends for major foodgrains indicate that prices in local markets are close
to parity with prices in the world market. Therefore, a FCF of 1.0 has
been used for the economic analysis. The econon:ic orices for fruit,
vegetables and chillies were derived from local average market prices
adjusted by the SCF.
5.      Prices of Agricultural Inputs.  Fertilizers have been valued at the
projected world market price. Pesticides and insecticides have been
assumed as traded. To make an allowance for taxes and subsidies and for
the cost of transport and marketing, a conversion factor of 0.95 has been
1/ Estimated as a ratio of economic price of rice (IBRD commodity
forecast) to the average market price of rice in Andhra Pradesh.



-90-
Annex 2
Page 3
applied to their financial prices. The economic price of seed and miscel-
laneous charges has been assumed to approximate their financial price. The
economic price of farm power (bullock pair with operator) was derived from
going daily rental rates, adjusted by the SCL. A summary of economic and
financial prices is presented in Table 11.
6.      Opportunity Cost of Labor.  A survey of monthly farm labor wage
rates in the talukas covering the SRBC indicates that daily wages vary from
about Rs 6.50 (January and February) to Rs 8.0 (April). Wages tend to be
fairly stable (about Rs 7.20) during the rest of the year. In the talukas
covering the Sriramasagar command area wages tend to be higher, varying
from Rs 9.00 (January) to Rs 12.40 (July through December). The wage
difference between the two areas reflects the more limited work oppor-
tunities in the SRBC command. It is assumed that this difference would
gradually diminish and the gap between the two areas would disappear at
full development.
7.      The trend in farm labor wage rates over the past ten years indi-
cates that wages have been increasing pari passu with general price infla-
tion. Historical evidence in India indicates no significant real wage
increases in spite of substancial productivity gains over the last decades.
Projections of future growth of population and labor supply in Andhra
Pradesh, compared with incremental labor demand for the project, would also
suggest that re&l wages are not likely to increase. Consequently, the rate
of Rs 10.0 per manday was adopted for the future as well. Analyses of
seasonal farm labor supply and demand in Indian irrigation projects
resulted in an estimate of the average economic shadow wage rate equivalent
to about 50Z to 70Z of the average financial rate. An economic wage rate
of Rs 6.70 per manday, or two thirds of Rs 10.00 has been assumed in the
economic analysis.
Agricultural Benefits
8.      Build-up Assumptions.  Estimates of crop production, yields, inputs
and farm incomes at 'present', 'future without' and 'future with' project
situations are based on crop yields and production input data available in
the Project File and on the following assumptions;
(a) Crop Yields and Inputs. A five-year build-up period has been
assumed for transition of yield levels from the 'present' to
'future with' project situation. The build-up rate was based on
historical productivity trends. It was assumed that yields in the
'future without' project situation would increase only slightly in
the next ten years (see Chapter VII).
(b)  Cropping Intensities.  Experience from irrigation projects else-
where in India suggest that increases in cropping intensity to full
development level will be faster than increases in yields. A
build-up period of five years has therefore been assumed for tran-
sition from 'present' to 'future-with' project intensities in the
new areas and three years for the upper part of SRS already receiv-
ing irrigation.

Annex 2

(c) Irrigation Block Development. The rate of completion of irrigation
blocks under the project was based on the current implementation
proposals.
The summary of the expected build-up rates is as follows:

Costs of Irrigation
9.      Investment Costs.  The capital costs of all civil works, including
the cost of roads, communication equipment, charges for engineering and
administration and physical contingencies were based on 1985 contract rates
adjjusted by the CCF. Land lost to agricultural production by the construc-
tion of the distribution system and road network was valued at the net



-92-
Annex 2
Page 5
economic rate under the 'future without project' situation. The net return
foregone each year was treated as. a recurrent project cost.
10.     Operation and Maintenance Costs.  At present, the average budgeted
financial amount is about Rs 50/ha. Of this Rs 38 is absorbed by estab-
lishment costs, leaving Rs 16/ha for actual maintenance works. As a
result, most existing irrigation distribution systems are in need of
rehabilitation. Based on estimates in other surface irrigation projects
elsewhere in India, a provisional estimate of Rs 150/ha has been used in
the analysis. O&K involves mostly the employment of unskilled or semi-
skilled labor and therefore the unskilled labor conversion factor of 0.67
was applied.
11.     Land Acquisition and Resettlement Costs.  There are three elements
of direct financial land acquisition costs: (i) compensation for dwellings
lost due to submergence in the reservoir areas (13,799 families in the
Mannair Reservoir); (ii) compensation for farmland submerged by the Mannair
Reservoir (about 7,400 ha); and (iii) the compensation for land acquired
to construct the canal distribution system and the farm roads (about 3,100
ha in SRBC and 14,700 ha in the SRS scheme). It is assumed that all farm
land lost as a result of project execution is and would remain rainfed.
Consequently, the net CCA of the rainfed area has been taken as 4Z larger
than the net CCA which can be irrigated after completion of the canal
distribution systems. Land acquired for the distribution systems is
assumed to be lost to rainfed cultivation from the year that the project
works are constructed. The value of production (Rs 3,200/ha) in the
"future without project" situation was taken to represent this opportunity
cost and was deducted from the benefit stream. The economic cost of reset-
tlement forms part of the sunk cost of Mannair Reservoir the corstruction
conversion factor (CCF).

(a) cover the establishment costs of operating the system in a reliable,
economical, equitable and predictable manner;
(b) enable the system to be maintained in a condition that makes its
operation envisaged in (i) possible at all times; and, in addition
(c) recover such portion ot the capital cost of the system (including
interest on monies invested) that would still leave the benefiting
farmers with an adequate and reasonable return on their capital and
labor expended to grow crops.
2.      For this purpose the Comittee shall:
(a) review pertinent information and data on operation and maintenance
expenditures incurred sLnce its previous review;
(b) evaluate the adequacy of the maintenance carried out and determine
the cause ot inadequacies, if any;
Cc) examine the actual cropping pattern and production obtained by
farmers on commanded land based on cropping data collected by the
Project Planning and Nonitoring Organization;
(d) determine from data, obtained under (c) above and the acceptel
cost of production information, the amount by which farmers' per
hectare income exceed their cost of production; and
(e) recommend what proportion of this margin could be collected to
meet the financial objectives set out in para 1 (a) and (b)
as vell as maintaining farmers' incentives described in
para I (c).

SECOND ANDRE PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Training Centers and Trainin2
Training Institutions
1.      Training of graduate zrrigatica engineers would take place in the
Water and Land Management Training and Research Institute (WALMT&RI) in
Hyderabad. Funds are provided under the project according to the number of
trainees in the special courses. A large training effort would be required
within the project area itself, for diplomate staff and farmers. Training
facilities, provided by the project, would consist of dormitories with
bathrooms tor about 35-40 people, (the maximum number ot trainees who vould
attend at any one time), a dining hall and lecture room. There would be
quarters tor tive teachers; one of them would be the Principal, also an
active teacher. Teaching aids, a 4 WD vehicie and two 16-seater minibuses
would complete investments. The centers would have access to the research
farms and would also be able to make use of the findings of investigations
and Lnterim observations of the adaptive research program which would be
implemented under NARP II.
Subiect, Tau2ht
2.      The discipline required to be at hand for tarmers and Canal Inspec-
tors (CI) would be irrigation layout and land preparation, and irrigation
agronomy. The Canal Inspectors (CI) need the foregoing only as background,
to enable them to view their function in perspective as part of the whole.
Their principal task would be to learn the necessary engineering, adminLstra-
tion and operational details required to provide farmers with a rotational
water supply according to a prearranged plan and to be able to indicate to
their superiors whether some occurances require changes or modifications in
the routine. The laskars would function as site toremen and construction
assistznts for field channel work: their syllabus would be less detailed and
the time required to teach them, shorter. The teachers would be engineers:
at least two of the five permanent staff vould be Assistant Engineers; the
Principal may be a Deputy ER.
The Subjects Tauftnt
4.      Farmers' Trainin.  The farmers' training must, first and foremost,
focus on irrigation layout under less than ideal conditions: length and
width ot borders, possibly a zig-zag layout, adapting to actual stream flow
rates etc. The farmer must have the opportunity to. observe the difference
between a good and a badi layout and learn how to remedy the bad one. Other
points of imediate urgency are cultural practices that may be adopted almost



-103-
Annex 5
Page 2
imediately; bed planting, especially for grounduuts. and ridge cultivation
for cotton. In the future it would include teaching new cultural practices
and land preparation techniques. The farmers' course would last for three
days; a working farmer cannot leave his land and livestock for longer than
that. First, the contact farmers would be trained; later, as time allows,
other rarmers.
Farmers' Leader Trainine
5.      Training of Contact Farmers and Chairman of the Outlet Committees
would include:
(i)  overall project organization;
(ii)  functioning, duties and rights of the Outlet Committees Minor
and Distributary Committees, vith the main emphasis on the OCs.
(iii) system operation, including scheduling and warabundi within the
chak;
(iv)  survey, design and construction of project works; involvement ot
OCs;
(v)  maintenance ot field channels; actions that may be taken in case
the farmers do not carry out the necessary maintenance.
Canal InsDector (CI) Training
6.      Topics to be taught would include, but not be limited to:
(i)  CIa responsibilities;
(ii)  irrigation scheduling (flow rate, irrigation intervals,
crop-soil-water relationships, etc.);
(iii) on-farm irrigation practices;
(iv) water applications and sanctioning;
Cv)  system operation and rotational water supplies;
(vi)  water measuring devices; factors affecting measurement;
(vii) control structures;
(viii) record keeping;
(ix)  reporting;
(x)  relation with water users;



-104-
Annex 5
Page 3
(xi) maintenance policy; preventive maintenance; veed control;
(xii) collection of water charges;
(xiii) legal aspects.
Initial emphasis during the training would be on irrigation scheduling,
system operation and RWS. Essential material will be compiled in a Canal
Inspectors' Manual.
7.      The laskars would receive technical training aimed at increasing
their understanding of the work and their ability to carry out their tasks.
Laskars are mainly employed to assist the AEBs in survey, design and construc-
tion. Their training would therefore include:
5i) principles ot crop, soil and water relationships;
(ii) irrigation methods;
(iii)  principles of landshaping;
(iv)  topographical and "problem" surveys;
(v)  layout of minors and field channels;
(vi) standard structures to be used;
(vii)  hydraulic design of channels;
(viii) drafting standards;
(ix) construction standards and quality control;
(x) role of farmers organizations; communication with farmers.
General Criteria
8.      The centers were designed according to the tolloving criteria:
(i) One trainee group consists of approximately 35 pupils and
never more than 40. If total cadre to be trained is between
40 and 70, they will be trained in two groups.
(ii) Training time available per Center per year: 46 weeks.
(iii)  Training time available under the project:  July 1987 to
December 1993 t- 6.5 years - 338 weeks).

SECOND ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIG&TION PROJECT
Organization and ManaSement
I.  The Present Oreanization
Introduction
1.      All surface irrigation projects in Andhra Pradesh are constructed by
the Irrigation Department (ID). They also operate and manage all but three
of the tunctioning projects. The Irrigation Utilization and Conmmand Area
Development Department (IU and CADD - but usually referred to as CADD) are at
present involved only LC the three largest functioning commands: Nagar-
junasagar, Sriramasagar and Tungabhadra. Both Departments vere under the
State Minister ot Irrigation until March 1, 1985; on that date, CADD was put
under the Minister of Agriculture.
The Irri2ation Department
2.      Senior Manazement.  The Irrigation Department is headed by a
Secretary. Depending on the seniority of the incumbent, he may be a Prin-
cipal Secretary; however, the functions, duties and job description of the
officer in charge is the same in either case. The technical and administra-
tive head ot the department is the Engineer-in-Chief (E-in-C). Nine Chief
Engineers (CE) report directly to him. Three are in charge of the three
largest projects in the State (Nagarjunasagar, Sriramasagar, Srisailam).
Others control: all other major projects; redium projects (400-1000 ha);
minor projects (40-400 ha); the Central Des.A Organization, the Mechanical
and Heavy Metal Structures Fabrication section and the Project Preparation,
Planning and Monitoring Cell (Chart 1).
3.      CEs in charge of the three largest projects report on administrative
and financial matters to the E-in-C, but have access to the Secretary,
Irrigation on policy issues. The CZ SBS operates and maintains the completed
parts of that scheme and is in charge of new constructions. The CE Srisailam
operates and maintains the Srisailas Dam and controls all works pertaining to
the Madras Water Supply Scheme and the SRBC project. Both CEs have a liaison
and coordination connection with the district administration through a Spe-
cial Collector who deals with legal issues of land utilization, land acquisi-
tion and administratic.n arising out of project works. Deputy CEs function as
senior staff otficers, and supervise technical uatters in their respective
disciplines. A Director of Accounts of SE rank is attached to each CE.
Superintending Engineers (SE) are in charge of Circles and report directly to
the CE (para 4). Each of the CEs has a unit, headed by a SE, working on
designs; this unit also controls the quality of completed works. The SE



-107-
ANNEX 6
Page 2
Designs are under the technical control of the CE, Central Design Organiza-
tion; in tact the SE working for the SRS project actually has his otfice in
Hyderabad. The CEs' Design Circles design the smaller and less complicated
structures within the CEOs area of responsibility. The Central Design
Organization operates statewide and designs all major works and structures.
4.      Executive Management.  The actual executing unit is the Circle,
headed by the Superintending Engineer (SE). Any Circle may deal vith dam
operation, construction, construction combined with operation and main-
tenance, or operation and maintenance only.
5.      The unit below the Circle is the Division.  It is he2ded by an Execu-
tive Engineer (EE). Typically, four to seven EEs report to aU SE. Each HE
in charge ot an Operation and Maintenance Division controls atout 54,000 ha.
Four Deputy ERs report to the EE; their jurisdiction is, therefore, about
13,500 ha; the Deputy EE has four Assistant Engineers (AZ), each in charge of
3,400 ha.
6.      The O&M structure below the AE is geared to the actual workload; the
organization can absorb more variation than at the Division and Sub-Division
level. The tunctionary below te AE is the Canal Inspector, who controls up
to six laskars - semi-skilled foreman - laborers. The laskarso workload,
which is tightly defined, is to supervise one of the tolloving:
(i) 500 hectares of CCA, or about 15 to 20 outlet comnands;
(ii)  6 km of main canal or 8 km branch canal;
(iii) one cross regulator, - irrespective whether on a main or branch
canal;
(iv) one escape, on any canal, irrespective of size.
The number of Canal Inspectors reporting to an AE is determined by the number
of askars required in the AE's area.
7.      Construction divisions do not have Canal Inspectors and laskars.  The
ARs are on site, supervising the contractors' work.
Present Organization in the Proiect Area
8.      In Srisailam. the SE at present has four Circles, one of which is
engaged in works on the SRB CAnal. That Circle has seven divisions
(Chart 4).
9.      In Sriramasaaar there are five Circles.
(i) Circle 1 is in charge of operating and maintaining the Srisailam dam
and reservoir; planning, construction and operation of the left-bank
(north) system and the small Lazmi Canal command on the right bank.
It has four divisions.



-108-
ANNEX 6
Page 3
(ii) Circle 2 is mainly an operation and maintenance circle for the whole
Kakatiya I command. One of its division, however, is in charge ot
completing outstanding works upstream of km 113 on the main canal.
(iii) Circle 3 is in charge of all works below the Khaddam dam on the left
bank, including planning and surveys for the Saraiwati Tail com-
ponent, planned tor the 8th five-year plan period.
(iv) Circle 4 is charge vith finishing construction between km 116 and
161, on about 80,000 ha, and all outstanding works on the main canal
and the major distributaries, between km 250-284.
(v) Circle 5 controls all works between km 161-250, on about 140,000 ha,
with seven divisions (Chart 5).
10.     Water Allocation in Sriramasaaar.  At present, water allocation for
each season is determined in a workshop conducted by the SE in charge of the
Dam Cizcle. Participants are the SEs of the Circles where irrigation water
is required, the CADA administrator, the Agricultural Officer, the
panchayats' elected representatives and progressive tarmers invited by the
SEs; - no farmers are elected at present. The Revenue Department are also
represented. This workshop advises on opening dates. The amounts released
are determined on the basis of indents received from SEs and lEs who, in
their turn, receive requests from DEEs and AEs. The CE approves the overall
plan, but detailed day-to-day operation is under the control of the SE in
charge of the dam.
The Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Develonment Department
I1.     Senior Management.  The structure and functions of the Department are
laid down in the Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development Act of
1984. Its functions is to promote and coordinate agricultural development.
The Department is headed by a Secretary, who like the Secretary ID, may be a
Principal Secretary. His staff officers are a CE for Water Management, at
present involved mostly in Nagarjunasagar, the Director of the Water and Land
Management Training and Research Institute (NALAMIARI), of SE rank, and
officers to coordinate, at Secretariat level, the disciplines of cooperation,
credit, statistics, on-farm and agricultural production development (Chart
2). Bis Director ot Accounts is of SE rank.
12.     In the three commands where CADD function there are Command Area
Development Authorities (CAD&) headed by an Administrator, who, unlike in
some other States, is a generalist IAS officer (Chart 6). The
Administrator's staff consists of officers on deputation from line depart-
ments. They are in charge of cells whose function is coordination, problem
solving and liaison with line departments, to remove constraints including
long and short-term credit that would militate against the attainment of
maxizm agricultural production.
13.     A major liaison function is to provide data and background informa-
tion for CADD's two major steering organs: the Command Area Development
Board and the CADA Working Committee.



-log-
ANNE 6
Page 4
(a) The Command Area Development Board is chaired by the Minister of
Agriculture. It consists of the Ministers of Irrigation and Finance,
the Chief Secretary, and all concerned Secretaries. It meets four
times a year, provides policy guidelines for all CADAs and deals with
problems requiring high-level policy intervention.
(b) The CADA Working Committee is chaired by the Secretary IU and CADD
and consists of the heads of line departments in the CADA area. It
meets monthly and deals with operational problems that cannot be
readily solved at the local level by the Administrator.
14.     Operations.  The CADD's direct field duties in Sriramasagar are the
organizing of farmers into outlet and other committees, to operate water
distribution below the outlet, called "pipe" or "pipe outlet" in A.P. (In
Iagarjunasagar they are senior partners in vater management and scheduling
operations). The IU and CADD Act states that Outlet Committees (O.C.) be
eLected annually; CADD have not yet resolved the major problem of how to
organize each year, literally thousands of separate elections in a single
comand: there woull be 6-7,000 elections to invigilate in the top 165,000
ha of SRS project alone. Also, for effective management of minor canal
com-ands, the Outlet Committees would have to be represented on minor and
distributary committees, - which would mean participating in the election or
nomination of several hundred more committees each year.
II. The Proposed Ortanization
15.    Combinitm the Irrigation and the Command Area Development Department.
Following the precedents of CADDs and IDs in other States where, either by
ordinance or expedience, the two departments operate under a single overall
administrative direction, GOAP has decided to bring the two Departments
closer together. They would be under a senior Secretary, Irrigation and
Command Area Development DepartmLnt, reporting to the Minister of Irrigation.
A Secretary, Irrigation and a Secretary IU and CADD would report to this
Senior Secretary. The basic functions and organization of both Departments
vould remain.
A. The Irrigation Deyartment
"6.    The ID would continue to be the entity that constructs and operates
irrigation works in the project areas, monitors progress and evaluates the
effects. The necessary temporary augmentation of design and construction
activities are part of the Department's working tradition as it starts and
completes projects; one of the innovations would be a strengthened and
expanded Project Preparation, Monitoring and Evaluation (PPM) Unit (Chart 3).
17.     A desirable change would be to appoint a Chief Engineer tor all
Operations and Maintenance activities in that State, reporting to the
Engineer-in-Chief. He would have staff functions similar to the CEs heading
the Central Design Organization and the Mechanical Section. Ris office would
set maintenance standards and organize the puchase and allocation of O&M
equipment. The 0&N Circles under the CEs in charge of projects would main-
tain the same link with him as is now the case vith the Design Circles.



-110-
ANNEX 6
Page 5
18.     The PPM Wing.  The Wing would monitor all aspects of project works,
have the capability to evaluate, from time to time, their impact. This
latter activity may be contracted to outside organizations (e.g. the National
Institute ot Rural Development, based in Hyderabad), or individual consult-
ants may be engaged to work with the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, under
specific terms of reference.
19.     The Project Preparation Facility is in place nad does not require
any strengthening to meet its expected workload. The only project-related
activity expected before completion of this project would be to prepare plans
for completing development of the service area of the SRSC project (17,000
ha) and the SRS project to km 284 of the Kakatiya canal (20,000 ha); before
planning for further expansion of the SRS project further studies would be
required on water use in the project area and availability in the Godavari.
20.     Monitoring physical progress of project works in both areas and
identifying causes for departure from the implementation schedule tor a given
construction season would be one of the Unit's major activity; its corollary
would be to report tinancial progress, prepare reimbursement documentation to
GOI and the Bank, and to monitor that tendering and contracting procedures
follow agreed guidelines. Of equal importance would be to monitor system
operation in terms of water deliveries and losses in transit, and its timeli-
ness according to the prearranged timetable. Monitoring groundwater levels,
drainage conditions, the utilization of existing wells and rate of develop-
ment of new wells, and also conditions militating against expected develop-
ments (a stable or receeding groundwater level, increase in numbers and
operating hours of the wells) would be important development aspects.
Records would be kept of all crops grown in the commandable area, irrespec-
tive whether they are irrigated or not; changes in cropping patterns, crop
selections and farming intensities noted. The unit would also have to assist
in identifying factors promoting or slowing down the introduction of benefi-
cial changes in crop and cropping pattern and thereby provide material for
the adaptive agricultural research planning committee.
21.    O0eration and Maintenance in Sriramasagar.  Effective, timely main-
tenance, and operating the system equitably is a self-evident necessity; to
provide the physical and administrative structure to carry it out, a prime
need. The physical prerequisites tor effective water control: communication
equipment and easy access to canals carrying more than 10 cusecs, are key
project components. To ensure its smooth functioning, the O&M organization
should have no other duties.
B. The Comsnd Area DeveloRment Department
22.     Function of CADA in Sriramasasar.  The CADA should, with all possible
speed, establish the Outlet Committees (OC) and create a hierarchy repre-
senting a convenient grouping of OCs. To assist CADD in this task, it would
be desirable to amend the IU and CAD Act to enable eiections to be held less
frequently and for the elections to have a less disruptive effect on the
operation of the OCs.



-1 11-
ANNEX 6
Page 6
23.     To fulfill this function, CADA needs a field organization roughly
matching that of ID, with the important functional difference that the equiv-
alent of the EE, Deputy EE and AE would be concerned entirely with matters
concerning water distribution within outlet commands, water indents to match
the weather and crop requirements, specially during the kharif and, most
importantly ot all, to ensure proper maintenance of the field channels and
structures. CADAos other, coordinating functions would remain as at present.
24.    OrRanization in the SRBC command.  Since at present there is no
irrigation in the SRBC command, there is no functioning CADD. However, the
CADD functions, particularly the organizing of OCs and Distributary Commit-
tees is essential. These would most expeditiously be carried out under the
SE in charge of construction, who would require an O&N division and a CADD
division during the implementation of this project. Once 60,000 ha, have
been developed, the Circle's function would change from construction to
operation. In this smaller area (potentially 77,000 ha against
Srirauasagar's 680,000) it may not be necessary to establish a separate CADA;
the functional need to do so would become less pressing once ID and C&DD come
under the same Secretary.

SECOND ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons
1.      The main objectives of the resettlement and rehabilitation of the
Project Affected Persons (PAP) are to ensure that the PAP shall, promptly
after their displacement: (i) improve or at least regain the standard of
living they were enjoying prior to their displacement; (ii) be relocated
as village units, village sections or families in accordance with the PAP
preference; (iii) be fully integrated with the community to which they are
resettled, and (iv) be provided with appropriate compensation and adequate
social and physical rehabilitation infrastructure, including community
services and facilities.
2.      The plan for resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAP shall
ensure adequate participation by, and consideration of, all PAPs.
3.      The level of compensation for land to be paid to persons affected
by project works (canals, roads, drains) would be based on the current
market value of land of comparable production potential in the Project
Area.
4.      GOAP would take all such action as shall be necessary to provide
the PAPs (para 3), in accordance with their preference, with either (i)
vocational traning or (ii) irrigable land of comparable production poten-
tial to that which the Oustee was holding; or (iii) stable employment.
