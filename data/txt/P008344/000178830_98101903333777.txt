SUMM4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project which forms part
of the 1972-76 expansion program of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus
(the Authority), the autonomous, governmnent-owned corporation responsible
for all public electric service in the country.
ii.       This would be the Bank's fourth loan to the Authority.  Previous
loans have assisted the Authority in the financing of the initial con-
struction and subsequent extensions of Moni power station and of extensions
to the transmission and distribution systems. Those projects have been or
are being carried out satisfactorily.
iii.      The program is estimated to cost US$40 million and comprises
ongoing works included in a previous Bank loan, the addition of 60 MW of
steam generating capacity at Moni power station (fifth and sixth units),
extensions to the transmission and distribution systems, and some works
to be undertaken towards the end of the period related to further system
expansions.
iv.       The present installed capacity of the Authority's system plus
that now under installation will be able to supply the growing system
requirements until 1973; additional generating capacity should be comi-
missioned in time to meet the system peak in December 1974.
v.        Contracts were awarded early in 1972 for the civil works, turbo-
generator, boiler and power and control cables for Moni No. 5 unit, in
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. These contracts contain
options for a sixth unit which can be exercised within six months of the
date of award. The Authority will finance unit No. 5 from its own resources
and would apply part of the proceeds of the proposed loan to finance the
foreign currency cost of unit No. 6.
vi.       The project proposed for Bank financing would also include about
h5% of the Authorityts transmission system investment and about 25% of the
distribution investment through 1976.
vii.      The addition of two 30 MW steam generating units at Moni, which
will bring this station to its ultimate capacity, constitutes the least
cost solution for the expansion of the system. The two units will prcvide
for the growth of the system until 1977, when 30 MW in gas turbines will
be installed near Nicosia, close to the load center.



- ii -
viii.     The project is estimated to cost US$11.9 million equivalent
including physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange component
is estimated at US$9 million, which is the amount of the proposed loan.
ix.       The Authority is a solids well managed organization.  The Authority's
consultants, Preece, Cardew and Rider (United Kingdom) will assist in carrying
out the project. This arrangement is identical to those of previous projacts
and has proved to be satisfactory. Work on the project is scheduled to be
completed by 1976.
x.        The Authority's financial position is satisfactory.  The Authority's
major problem is its inability to gain access to the Turkish-Cypriot areas
for the purpose of meter reading. Therefore such consumption has not been
billed nor cash collected since 1964; the annual revenue lost is estimated
to be running currently at about LC350,o00 or 6.5% of annual billings. Fore-
casts indicate that the present tariff covenant, requiring the op rating ratio
be no more than 68% on a three-year moving average, could not be met from
1972 onwards although no tariff increase is required from a viewpoint of cash
generation. In the circumstances it is considered advisable to bring the
Authority into line with the majority of the Bank's electric power borrowers
by expressing the tariff covenant in the form of a rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation. A rate of 9% has been agreed with the Authority, which it
should have no difficulty in meeting. It is estimated that the Authority will
finance 65% of its 1972/76 program from internal sources.
Xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$9 million equivalent,
for a term of 20 years including a grace period of three and a half years.
The loan would cover the foreign exchange cost of the project, equal to about
20% of the Authority's 1972-76 cash requirements, net of debt service.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Cyprus has requested the Bank to assist in
financing a project which'is'part of'the'1972-76 exPansion program
of the KLectricity Authority of Cyprus (the Authority), the autonomous,
government-owned corporation responsible for all public electric service
in the country. The Authority plans to invest about $40 million equivalent
in the program.
1.02      The project proposed for Bank financing comprises the addition
of 30 NW of steam generating capacity, extensions to the transmission
system, and extensions and reinforcement of the distribution system. The
project was established as the most economic way to meet Cyprust power
requirements in studies made in 1970 and 1971 by the Authority's principal
consultants, Messrs. Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the U.K.
1.03      This would be the Bankts fourth loan to the Authority.  Loans
335-CY and 494-CY signed in 1963 and 1967 assisted the Authority in the
financing of the initial construction and first extension of Moni power
station and of extensions to the transmission and distribution systems.
These projects were satisfactorily carried out and are in commercial
operation. Loan 649-CY, for US$5 million equivalent, signed in 1969,
financed the foreign exchange component of Moni No. 4 unit and extensions
to the transmission system.  Moni unit No. 4 is scheduled to be commissioned
in July 1972, about seven months behind schedule, due to delays in the
delivery of the electro-mechanical equipment by C. A. Parsons and Company,
Ltd. of the U.K. The transmission system extensions have been completed
on schedule, although not yet commissioned. As of April 30, 1972, U341.2
million of Loan 649-CY remained undisbursed; however, this amount is expected
to be drawn down by the closing date of June 30, 1973.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission,
composed of Messrs. S. Astrain and A.A.M. Onslow, which visited Cyprus in
January 1972.



2. THE SECTOR AND THE BORROWER
The Economy
2.01      Cyprus is the easternmost and the third largest of the Mediterranean
islands.  Of its total area of 3,572 square miles, 47% are forest and wood-
lands, 6% is land suitable for irrigated farming and 32% is suitable for dry
farming.
2.02      Population in 1971 was estimated at 645,000. Of this, 81% is of
Greek descent and 19% of Turkish origin. The net growth rate has been 1.1;
per annum over the last decade.
2.03      Political difficulties between the Greek and the Turkish communities
remain unresolved. Under the terms of the Cyprus' independence treaty,
the United Kingdom maintains two sovereign bases and Greek and Turkish
troops are stationed in the island. Besides, a U.N. Peace Keeping Force
has been in Cyprus since 1964.
2.04      In spite of the political situation, the country has had an
impressive economic growth. Gross National Product was £C225.8 million
in 1970 or £C353 per capita and has increased 7.5% per annum in real
terms during 1967-70. The principal sectors of the economy are agriculture,
manufacturing, mining and tourism.
2.05      Water is a scarce commodity in Cyprus, due to the low annual rain-
fall (average in Nicosia is 15 inches), its uneven distribution (mainly in
wintertime), and the pervious nature of a great part of the island subsoil
leaving few areas where impervious rock formations may act as underground
water reservoirs. Since the continued growth of agricultural production
depends largely on the availability of water to irrigate new lands, a serious
effort is being made to conserve the underground water sources and to develop
new surface sources. Likewise, studies are being carried out to determine
the feasibility of sea water desalination in combination with electric power
generation, in order to increase the drinking water supply.
The Sector
2.06      The Authority is the sole supplier of electricity to the public and
generates practically all the electric power in the island. There are only a
few captive power plants owned by industry; they are diesel units of small
capacity, totalling about 10 MW, and are maintained as stand-by units. One
of the British bases has a small combined water distillation-diesel power
plant.
2.07      Cyprus has no known deposits of fossil fuels and, being semi-arid,
has no prospects of hydroelectric power production on a commercial scale.



-3-
Only pumped-storage peaking plants can be envisaged for the future, in
connection with some of the dams under construction, or planned, to relieve
the island's pressing water needs. A study was recently made by Preece
Cardew and Rider to determine the possibility of installing 30 MW of pumped-
storage generating capacity in the Lefkara dam, now under construction to
increase the drinking water supply of Famagusta, Cyprus' third largest city
and its most important tourist resort; the study showed that this is not yet
an economic proposition. Nuclear power generation is not a real alternative,
on account of the small size of the system.
2.08      The expansion of the power sector will continue to be based on
thermal generation using imported fuel for the foreseeable future. Until
now the Authority has been free to buy fuel oil in the open market, but a
domestic oil refinery will soon start operating near Larnaca, with a fuel
oil production capacity of 220-230,000 tons per year. The Authority will
use about 210,000 tons of fuel oil in 1972, increasing to about 295,000 tons
in 1976. The rest of the country now consumes about 50,000 tons. Hence,
the refinery will not have sufficient capacity to supply all the country's
needs. Starting in 1973 the Authority will be required to buy from the
ref'inery all the fuel oil it can supply; above that, it is likely that the
Authority will be free to buy the balance of its fuel oil requirements in
the open market. 1/
The Borrower
2.09      The Borrower would be the Authority, created by law in 1952 "for
the purpose of generating, supplying, promoting and encouraging the use of
electricity". Only a few towns and villages then had public electricity
supplies and the Authority has since established an island-wide power system
and has achieved remarkable progress toward the electrification of the country.
At the end of 1971, 512 out of 632 villages were electrified and public
electric service reached 94% of the island's population.
2.10      The Authority is governed by a Board consisting of a chairman, a
vice-chairman and five members, all of whom are appointed by the Council
of Mimnisters to five year terms. The present chairman is a former cabinet
Minister and a prominent businessman; the vice-chairman has been a member
of the Board since 1963.
2.11      The Board appoints the chief executive officer of the Authority or
general manager. The present general manager -- who also holds the post of
chief engineer -- has been associated with the Authority for a long time, was
.appointed to his position in 1961, and is a capable and experienced engineer
and admrinistrator. Relations between the Board and the general manager, and
the overall management of the Authority are good.
I1JDuring 1972 the Authority will import from Rassia 120,000 tons under an
exivting contract and will buy about 90,000 tons from the domestic refinery;
expected average price for 1972 is £C7.830/metric ton (about $ 5lAl06BTU).
Expected average price for 1973-76 is now £C8.400/ton (about $0.5hA06BTU).
This projected increase in fuel expense does not significantly affect the
Authority's operating results.



- 4 -
2.12      In connection with the previous loans, the Governnment and the
Authority agreed to inform the Bank, in time for the Bank to make comments,
of any proposed amendment to the Electricity Development Law or of any pro-
posed permanent appointment of chief executive, chief teehnical or chief
financial officer. These provisions are repeated in the agreement for the
proposed loan.
Existing Facilities
2.13      The Authority's two steam power stations are located on the southern
coast of the island: one at Dekhelia, with an installed capacity of 84 MW,
and one at Moni, with three 30 MW units, financed by previous Bank loans (see
map). When the fourth 30 MW unit at Moni is in service, the total installed
capacity will be 204 MW.
2.14      Dekhelia steam plant has two 7 MW and five 14 MW units.  The 7 MIW
units were commissioned in 1953 and the 14 MW machines, from 1954 to 1963.
Overall thermal efficiency of Dekhelia is about 22%. The general condition
of the plant is good and its availability is high, and should continue to be
so, since the five older units have been overhauled during the last three
years (reblading of turbine rotors and rebuilding of chimneys) and the two
newest will be similarly reconditioned during 1972 and 1973. Overall thermal
efficiency of Moni is about 28%, due to its larger, newer machines; it is
operated as a base load plant, with Dekhelia making up the balance of the
system requirements. These thermal efficiencies are typical for the size
of units involved.
2.15      The Authority also has four small diesel plants, totalling 3 MN,
which are maintained as stand-by.
2.16      The transmission and distribution systems consist of an island-
wide network comprising: 428 circuit-miles of 66 kV transmission lines;
80 circuit-miles of 132 kV lines (operated at 66 kV); 85 circuit-miles of
132 and 66 kV lines, built but not yet commissioned; 24 main substations
with transformer capacity of 239 MVA; and over 2,000 miles of 11 kV overhead
and underground lines (see map).
Operations
2.17      In spite of the country's political problems, the Authority's
system has grown rapidly (see Annex 1) and its operations have been satis-
factory. Energy sold has increased at an average annual rate of 12.3% from
1964 to 1971, not counting the energy consumed by the residents of the
Turkish-Cypriot areas, where the Authority has no access; consumption in
these areas has been unbilled and unpaid since 1964.
2.18      In 1971 the Authority generated 618 GWh with a system maximum
demand of 135 MW -- except for an abnormally high value of 146.2 MW registered
on an exceptional occasion 1/ -- or an annual load factor of 52.2%.
1/ The maximum demand value of 146.2 MW occurred on an exceptionally cold
December day, when tests of short duration were being conducted at two new
industrial installations, which contributed to the peak demand, but required
little energy.



-5-
2.19      Energy sales, excluding use by the Turkish sector, amounted to
503 GWh in 1971, distributed according to consumer categories as follows:
Domestic                                   27.9%
Commercial (including military bases)    34.6%
Industrial                                 30.4%
Irrigation                                  3.6%
Public Lighting                             3.5%
100.0%
2.20      System losses -- i.e. the difference between total generation (which
includes consumption by station auxiliaries) and sales -- amounted to 18.6% of
total generation. Deducting the estimated unbilled consumption of the Turkish
population (estimated at 33 GWh in 1971) from the generation figures, the
system losses would amount to 13% which is satisfactory.
2.21      The seasonal nature of some of the loads tend to produce a rather
low annual load factor (see Annex 2). The Authority is aware of the possible
benefits to be derived from improving the load factor in an all-steam
system and has under way a successful campaign to promote off-peak loads,
such as storage space heaters, water heaters, irrigation and some types of
industrial loads. During 1971 the number of off-peak consumers increased
by 27,4 and the nameplate capacity of such loads was estimated at 6,400 kW.
Tariffs
2.22      The Authority establishes the level and structure of tariffs but
is subject to government approval for tariff increases. The Electricity
Development Law provides that revenues should be sufficient to meet operating
expenses and debt service and to set aside a reascnable provision for expansion.
2.23      The present tariffs have been in effect for many years and were
calculated with a fuel oil base price of £C7.500 per metric ton. Some of
them -- industrial, street lighting and special -- which make up 52% of the
energy sales, contain a fuel adjustment clause from which the Authority
recovers about 690 of the fuel cost increases above the base price of £C7.500
per metric ton. As both the tariffs and the fuel adjustment clause were
established when the overall system efficiency was lower than today, the
basic tariff level has been adequate to cover the rising costs of later
years. The Authority has thus been able to generate internally a high per-
centage of its capital requirements and the forecasts indicate that it will
continue to do so (see paragraph 5.09). The tariff structure is reasonably
well balanced.

3. THE PROJECT
The Authority's Program
3.01      The Authority's 1972-76 expansion program (see Annex 3) comprises
the completion of ongoing works related to Moni No. 4 unit (financed under
Lnan 649-CY), the addition of the fifth and sixth 30 M; units at onim,
extensions to the transmission system, extension and reinforcements of the
11 kV and low voltage distribution networks and the initiation of works in
connection with the addition of gas-turbine generating capacity at Athalassa
substation, near Nicosia.  The program is estimated to cost £C15.3 fillion,
as shown below:

3.02      In 1971 the Authority invited tenders for the fifth Moni unit,
folloTAing the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The invitation requested
bidders to quote, additionally, prices for the sixth unit, as an option to
be exercised within six months of the award of contracts for unit No. 5.
The tenders for the civil works, the turbogenerator and the boiler were
opened on April 19, 1971. The award for the civil works was made to Cyprus
Building and Roed Construction and for the tiurbogenerators to C. A. Parsons
and Company, Ltd., U.K. on January 12, 1972; the boiler contract was awarded
to Ansaldo Meccanico-Nucleare, Italy, on February 29, 1972. A contract for
power and control cable has also been awarded to Jupiter Electrical Company,
Cyprus on April 21, 1972. The Authority will finance the total cost of
unit No. 5 from its own resources and would apply part of the proceeds of
the proposed Bank loan to theiforeign currency component of unit No. 6 by
exercising the above mentioned options. The Executive Directors have been
informed of this arrangement.

The Bank Prp1ect
3.03      The Bank project, in addition to urit No. 6, would also include
about 45% of the Authority's transmission investment and about 25'4
of its distribution investment through 1976. The proposed project is
expected to cost the equivalent of US$11.9 million.  The foreign exchange
component is estimated to be US$9 million equivalent, which is the
amount of the proposed loan. The detailed cost estimate of the project

The cost estimates for Moni power station are based on the contract prices
for the fifth unit.  The cost estimates for transmission lines, substations
and distribution systeni expansion are based on current contracts for the
procurement of similar goods and services. To take care of possible increases
in quantities, a physical contingency allowance of 10% has been provided for
the local cosbs of civil works for the power plant and transmission system,
and for the local and foreign currency component costs of equipment for trans-
mission lines and substations.  A price contingency allowance of 18%
has been made for Moni electro-mechanical equipment, reflecting tle price
clause. and ceilings of the contract for the fifth unit.  A l11%>price con-
tingency has been allowed for possible variations in the price of the trans-
mission system equipment based on present trends of prices (increase of 5.5%
per annum ).

Engineering and Construction
3.04      The Authority has retained Preece, Cardew and Rider, U.K. as
principal consultants for many years. This firm has assisted the Authority
in carrying out the projects financed under previous Bank loans and is
rendering the same services for the present project, including engineering
and construction supervision for the Moni station expansion, trans-
mission and distribution system extensions. This arrangement has proved
satisfactory in the past. The Authority has agreed that it will continue
to employ experienced consultants for the project, under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement
3.05      International competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines, will also be followed for all the remaining works of the project.
Tenders will be analyzed on the quoted C.I.F. prices; the Authority is exempt
from customs duties, and bids are awarded without considering customs duties.
Except for the engagement of consultants, no contracts will be awarded nor
will options be exercised for the components of the Moni sixth unit before
the signing of the loan.
Disbursements
3.06      Disbursements would be for the foreign currency costs of imported
equipment and services only, including those under the civil works contract.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by mid 1976 (see Annex 6). In
the event the project cost is less than the estimated amount, any savings
from the loan should be cancelled.
Ecology
3.07      Moni power plant is located in an unpopulated section of Cyprus'
south coast where only a cement plant exi.sts. No air or water pollution
problems have been experienced from the operation of the existing units.
Supervision
3.08      Supervision missions about once a year are recommended for the
proposed loan in view of the past record of the Borrower and the straight-
forwardness of the project.

4. JUSTIFICATION
Forecast of Energy Sales and Maximum Demand
4.01      Annex 1 summarizes actual and forecast energy sales by consumer
category for the period 1964-76. The 1964-71 average annual growth has been
12.3% and it can be noted that industrial, public lighting and domestic sales
have had higher than average growth rates. The Authority's sales forecast
is based on a detailed analysis of past growth in each consumer category.
The projections also include all known and expected new industrial and
commercial loads and likely trends in the consuming habits of present users.
The 1971-76 projected average increase in sales is 10.7% per annum. By
estimating system losses and annual load factors, future maximum demand
values were determined. A parallel analysis estimating loads at each
substation produced a good correlation. Aggregate projections were made
for the period 1977-80 based upon the foregoing detailed analysis. Sales
and maximum demand forecasts established by similar methods in the past
have proved to be reliable and the present forecasts are realistic.
4.02      Annex 2 gives a summary of actual and forecast values of maximum demand,
capacity, and required generation. Maximum demand is expected to grow at
a lower rate than energy sales, with a corresponding increase of the system's
annual load factor. This is due to the faster growing industrial loads.
Comparison of Alternative Generating Schemes
4.03      A number of alternative generating schemes were compared by the
Authority's consultants, Preece, Cardew and Rider, to establish the most
economical way of meeting the expected load growth. The four most practical
alternative schemes, involving different sequences in the installation of
2-30 MW steam units at Moni, 2-60 Nd steam units at Dekhelia and 30 MW in
gas turbines at Athalassa substation (near Nicosia), were finally compared
using a computer program. In the four alternatives, the 1980 system would
have the same plant mix (180 Md steam and 30 Nd gas turbine would be added
by then) and the cash streams associated with the different schemes would
be the same from 1981 on, except for terminal corrections applied to take
into account the different replacement time for each type of plant.
4.04      The analysis showed that the alternative comprising the installa-
tion of 2-30 MW steam units at Moni, to be followed by the installation of
30 Md in gas turbines at Athalassa, and then by 2-60 MN steam units at
Dekhelia is the least cost solution for all test rates of discount up to
about 13%.
4.05      These results were then confirmed for wide variations of fuel and
gas turbine plant costs. The alternative chosen would still have a lower
total cost than the next best alternative (the gas turbines interposed
between the two 30 MW steam units at Moni) for discount rates up to about
12% with the gas turbine fuel price increased by 50% and the gas turbine
investment cost increased by 18%. These equalizing discount rates are well
above the opportunity cost of capital in Cyprus.



- 10 _
Transmission and Distribution Extensions
h.06      The extensions to the transmission and distribution systems were
also selected as the least cost solutions to supply the new loads, to main-
tain adequate system voltage lovels and to provide reasonable reliability
of supply, after trade-offs were considered between different voltages,
conductor sizes, losses, number and size of substations and transformer
capacities.
Internal Economic Return
4.07      That part of the Authority's 1972-76 investment program related to
the installation of Moni units 5 and 6 and associated transmission and
distribution system expansions will have an internal economic return of
slightly over 10% (see Annex 5).



- 11 -
5. FINANCE
5.01      The Authority's past financial performance has been very good
and it has been able to finance a large part of its expansion programs
from internal resources. It is anticipated that this good financial
position will be maintained and future borrowing will be at a minimum.
Past Record and Present Position
5.02      Balance Sheets and Income Accounts for 1968-71 are shown in
Annexes 7 and 8. There was a decrease in net operating income in 1971 due
to a falling off in the growth rate of sales, an increase in operating
and maintenance costs on account of wage increases, and increased fuel
costs not fully recovered by the fuel surcharge. However, the results are
still satisfactory and the net operating income (excluding the Turkish
sector consumption3 shows a return on average net fixed assets in operation
of over 9%. Since 1964, the Authority has been unable to gain access to
customers in the Turkish-Cypriot areas for the purposes of meter reading
(although they are able to gain access for the purpose of emergency repairs
to the distribution system within the area). This unbilled consumption
has had a material effect on the earnings record of the Authority, and it
is now estimated that the annual revenue lost on this account amounts to
about EC350,000 or 6.5% of annual billings.

5.04      The assets are shown at original cost and are fairly valued.
Straight line depreciation is charged on each group of assets at percent-
ages based on their useful lives; the resulting overall rate of depreciation
has generally averaged around 3.1%, which is acceptable.                                     *
5.05      The Government loans were provided from the proceeds of five
public bond issues totalling hC7,883,926 made by the Government in Cyprus
and the U.K. between 1953 and 1959 and relent to the Authority. The
interest rates vary from 3.64% to 5.75%, with a weighted average rate of
4.88%. As a result of a decision made by the Government to consider the
proceeds of these issues an equity contribution to the Authority rather
than a loan, the Government pays full debt serwice on these issues, while
the Authority pays only the interest to the Government. In a 1963 agree-
ment between the Government and the Authority, the Government loans are
subordinated to IBRD Loan 335-CY, so that, unless the Bank otherwise agrees,
no repayment of principal will be made until the Bank loan shall have been
fully repaid. This was repeated in connection with IBRD Loans 494-CY and
649-CY, in order to continue to allow the Authority to retain funds for
the expansion of its service, (see paragraph 5.15).
5.o6      Long-term debt consists of:
a.   IBRD Loan 335-CY made in 1963 in the sum of US$21.0 million
for 20 years at an interest rate of 5~9. US$15,268,000 was
disbursed from the loan, the balance being cancelled. This
was the result of reductions in cost, due partly to savings
resulting from international bidding and lower interest
during construction, and partly to a reduction in the scope
of the distribution work, attributable to the political sit-
uation in Cyprus. Repayment started in March 1967.
b.   IBRD Loan 494-CY made in 1967 in the sum of US$2.8 million
for 15 years at an interest rate of 6%. Due to reduced costs
following the devaluation of sterling in November 1968 and to
a reduction in engineering costs, only US$2,325,100 was dis-
bursed from the loan, the balance being cancelled. Repayment
started in September 1970.
c.   IERD Loan 649-CY made in 1969 in the sum of US$5.0 million
for 20 years at an interest rate of 7%. US$3.1 million had
been withdrawn by December 31, 1971. The closing date for
the loan is June 30, 1973, to allow for payment of retention
monies. Repayment will start in July 1973.
d.   Other loans, which are due to the Government and Barclays
Bank, and which were taken over from local authorities at the
time their plants were transferred to the Authority. The
amount outstanding as at December 31, 1971, was LC7,000.
5.07      The Authority's current position is satisfactory.  Liquid resources
are higher than necessary for normal operation, but they will be needed to
help finance the capital expansion program in the immediate future.



- 13 -
Audit
5.08      The Authority has for some time employed the international firm
of Price, Waterhouse, Peat and Company, Nicosia, as its external auditors.
The auditing arrangements are acceptable. During negotiations, the
Authority agreed to continue to appoint external independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and to transmit its financial statements, and
auditor's report thereon to the Bank within four months after the end of
its financial year. In the past the Authority has performed satisfactorily
in this regard.
Financing Plan
5.09      The estimated sources and applications of funds for the period
1972-1976 (Annex 9) are summarized as follows:

5.10      Internal cash generation, net of debt service, would finance 65%
of cash requirements for the five years, which is satisfactory. Consumers'
contributions would supply 9% of requirements - the balance of 26% coming
from IBRD Loan 649-CY (5%) and the proposed Bank loan (21%).
5.11      The Bank loan of US$9 million equivalent (WC3,454 thousand) would
be made for a period of 20 years, with amortization commencing in the second
half of calendar 1975 after a grace period of about three and a half years.



- 1h -
For purposes of analysis tthe interest rate has been assumed to be 71-%.
It is estimated the Authority will be able to finance thje project and its
other cash requirements for 1972-76.  Nevertheless, during negotiations
thie Government agreed to provide the Authority, on terms acceptable to thle
Bank, with any funds necessary to complete tthe project.
Financial Forecasts
5.12      Estimated income statements for the years 1972-76 are shown in
Annex 10. During appraisal the possibility of the Turkishi-Cypriot areas
paying for electricity consumed or of the Government paying the Autliority
for such consumption was discussed with Government officials.  Bothi
suggestions were unacceptable on political grounds and in thie financial
projections it has been assumed that the Authority will not be paid for
consumption in the Turkish areas.  Fuel costs have been based on a price
of EC8.400 per ton for 1973-76 and other operating expenses have been
increased by 11.5% in 1972 and 1973 and by 10% thereafter to take into
account the recent wages award and other increased costs. Net operating
income is expected to increase from tCl.5 million in 1971 to 1C2.6 million
in 1976.
5.13      The tariff covenant under previous loans to the Authority has
the form of an operating ratio and requires that this ratio, calculated on
a three-year moving average, be no more than 68%.  The Authority has been
able to meet this obligation until 1970 but, due to increased operating
expenses (higher fuel price and increase in personnel remunerations) and
the unpaid consumption of the Turkish population, the three-year moving
average was slightly above 68% in 1971; present forecasts indicate that
it will increase to about 72% in the following years. The forecast perform-
ance of the Authority is acceptable both in terms of its ability to finance
the proposed expansion program and the return it earns on its investment,
in spite of the projected increase in operating ratio. The Authority's
estimated contribution to expansion from internal resources is 65% during
1972-76. During the same period the rate of return on net fixed assets in
operation never falls below 9.5% and averages 9.8%. In the circumstances,
it is proposed to bring the Cyprus tariff covenant into linie with the
majority of other Bank borrowers for electric power; i.e. to express it in
the form of a return on net fixed assets in operation.  During negotiations,
the Authority agreed to earn a return of not less than 9% on its net fixed
assets in operation, such assets to be valued in accordance withi methods of
valuation or revaluation acceptable 'o the Bank.  It is considered that
the present valuation of assets meets tiis requirement.  The Goverrment
also agreed to authorize any future tariff increases which may be necessary
to meet the rate of return.
5.14      Annex 12 shows estimated balance sheets for 1972-1976.  During
the period, the average net fixed assets in operation wil1 increase by
60% from wC16.3 million to hC26.1 million, and the return would fluctuate
between 9.5% and 10.3%.  The cash position of EC2.3 million as at December 31,
1976, is larger than for normal requirements and arises through a falling



- 15 -
off in the capital expenditure in 1976 (OCl.4 million against an average
of EC3.5 million during the previous four years).  However, the Authority
will have an estimated capital expenditure of lC10.8 million in the two
years 1977 and 1978, which justifies the building up of cash balances in
1975 and 1976.
5.15      The financial ratios shown in Annex 11 indicate the continuing
good financial position of the borrower. The debt/equity ratio in 1971 is
32/68 dropping to 29/71 in 1976; interest is covered 1.9 times by net
operating income in 1971 and 2.7 times in 1976; while debt service coverage
increases from 2.3 times internal cash generation to 2.7 times. In order
to maintain the good financial position and conserve the Authority's cash
for the large expansion program anticipated in the future, it was previously
agreed that the Government loans would be subordinated to the Bank loans
and no repayment of principal would be made except as the Bank may other-
wise agree. A similar condition has also been included in the proposed
loan, but any request by the Government for the repayment of these loans
should receive sympathetic consideration by the Bank. It was also agreed
during negotiations that the existing conventional debt limitation covenant
in the form of a debt service coverage test of 1.5 be repeated in the proposed
loan.

6. AaREEMENT REACHED AND RECOMM[NDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal point:
The existing Loan and Guarantee Agreements be amended to
require the Authority to earn a return of at least 9% on
its properly valued net fixed assets in operation (paragraph 5.13).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$9 million, for a term of 20 years including a grace period of about
3Ω years.

Internal Economic Return on the Investment
1.        The internal economic return of a project or a program is the
discount rate which equates the present worth of the project or program
economic costs throughout its life to the present worth of its attributable
economic benefits.
2.        In the case of a power project or program, no undue difficulties
are encountered in deriving its economic costs from its known financial
costs. This is not the case, however, for the economic benefits and,
rather than attempting to calculate these, a minimum value is determined,
assuming that they would be equal to the revenues, plus any sales tax,
attributable to the project or program throughout its life.
3.        In the case of Cyprus, there is full employment and the current
exchange rate reflects fairly the value of the local currency. No shadow
prices need therefore be considered for valuing the labor or the foreign
exchange components of the program costs. Furthermore, the Authority is
not subject to taxes or customs duties and market prices can be used in
the cost stream.
4.        The internal economic return was calculated along the foregoing
lines for that part of the Authority's 1972-76 construction program (see
paragraph 3.01) that relates to the installation of Moni units 5 and 6 and
associated transmission and distribution facilities. The cost and benefit
streams associated with this part of the program were obtained up to the
year 2004 as the difference between the corresponding streams of the
following two cases.
Case Is   a)  Investments to be made by the Authority up to 1978 were
considered, including ongoing works, Moni units Nos. 5 and 6 and invest-
ments in transmission and distribution facilities required to transmit
and distribute the energy generated up to 1978, but excluding those invest-
ments to be made in the period and related to further extensions to the
system thatshould come into operation towards the end of 1978.
b) Total system projected annual operating expenses (excluding
depreciation) were considered up to 1978. For the years 1978 to 2004 (end
of the investment's useful life) these operating expenses were assumed to
remain constant at the 1978 level.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2 pages
c) Total system projected annual revenues were considered up
to 1978. From 1979 to 2004 these revenues were assumed to remain constant
at the 1978 level.
Case II: a) Investments related to the ongoing works only.
b) Total system projected annual operating expenses (excluding
depreciation) up to 1974 were used (Moni 5 starts operating towards the
end of 1974). From 1975 on these were assumed to remain constant at the
1974 level.
c) Total system projected annual revenues were used up to 1974.
These were assumed constant at the 1974 level from 1975 on.
5.        The present worth of the net cost and benefits stream thus
determined were found to be equal at a discount rate slightly above 10%.
