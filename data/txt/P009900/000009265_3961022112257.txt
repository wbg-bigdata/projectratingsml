IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Private Power Utilities (TEC)
Project for the Tata Electric Companies (TEC) in India, for which Loan 3239-IN in the amount of US$
98 million equivalent was signed on October 3, 1990, and made effective September 30, 1991. The
loan closed as stipulated in the Loan Agreement, on June 30, 1995. The loan amount was filly
disbursed by December 3, 1995. Cofinancing was provided by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), Switzerland and a conglomerate of local banks led by the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI). The balance amount was met by the Tata Electric Companies
(TEC) from their own intemal resources, and through the issuance of convertible debentures in the
domestic financial markets.
The ICR was prepared by Mihir Mitra (Consultant) and Argun Ceyhan (Task Manager) of
SA2EI of the South Asia Region and reviewed by Jean-Francois Bauer, Division Chief, SA2EI and
Kazuko Uchimura, Project Adviser, SA2DR. The Borrower, Guarantor and Cofinanciers provided
comments that are included in the appendices to this ICR'.
Preparation of this ICR started during the Bank's mission in September 1995. It is based on
material in the project file. The implementing agency, TEC, contributed to the preparation of the ICR
by providing timely input for the statistical data and by preparing a detailed ICR for its own internal
evaluation and archives. This latter ICR was placed in the Project Files.
In accordance with South Asia Region's general policy as regards the management of closing
dates, the loan was closed as originally scheduled when TEC had incurred eligible expenditures to
cover the whole amount of the loan, although one of the components (i.e., Bhira Pumped Storage
Scheme) was not completed. Satisfactory completion of this component will be reported to the Board
in due course.
The Borrower's contribution is given in Appendix B. When received, the Guarantor's and Cofinanciers' contributions
will be included in the ICR.

PRIVATE POWER UTILITIES (TEC) PROJECT
LOAN 3239-IN)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.    The principal challenge facing the Government of India (GOI) in the power sector lies in
improving the balance between expansion and efficiency improvement. Electricity demand in the
1990s, projected to grow at approximately 9% per annum through 2000, continues to remain
supply-constrained. To meet the demand and improve supply quality, and given the enormous
investment the power sector needed to sustain the demand growth, GOI decided to utilize the
private sector's ability to implement major power projects.
ii.    India is one of the few developing countries with a vibrant, even though small, private sector
presence in public power supply. The Tata Electric Companies (TEC) represent the largest electric
power utility in the private sector in India and constitute one of the principal power systems in Western
India. TEC is composed of three utility companies: (i) The Tata Hydroelectric Power Supply
Company Ltd., (ii) The Andhra Valley Power Supply Company Ltd., and (iii) The Tata Power
Company Ltd., and the three companies conduct their business basically as one single entity. TEC
supplies power to consumers in the highly industrialized area of the metropolitan city of Bombay. The
reliability of TEC's power supply and the quality of its service are high. It is a well-managed
corporation with strong financial performance and an excellent record of efficient management and
operation of its plants. The loan was made to the three companies forming the TEC, under the
guarantee of India, acting by its President. The project was cofinanced by the Government of
Switzerland, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI). This was the fifth IBRD loan to TEC, the IBRD-TEC relations
dating back to 1954, when the first IBRD loan to the Companies was approved.
Objectives
iii.    The physical objectives of the project were to increase TEC's peak generating capacity2,
reduce its dependence on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for power to serve its
consumers, reduce the average cost of generation in increasing the capacity utilization of TEC's
existing thermal power plant at Trombay, mitigate the sulphur dioxide emissions (SO2) from the coal
and oil burning Trombay Unit 5 3, and improve system reliability and quality of supply in the Bombay
area. In order to achieve these objectives, the physical components of the project included: (a) the
2   At appraisal TEC's own generating capacity was 1,613.5 MW, comprising 276 MW from the three hydro stations
(Khopoli - 72 MW; Bhira - 132 MW, and, Bhivputi - 72 MW) and 1,337.5 MW from one thermal station with six units
(Trombay - Units 1,2 and 3: 3x62.5 MW; Unit 4: 150 MW; and Units 5 and 6: 2x500 MW).
3   Funded under Ln. 1549-IN for the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project, approved in April 1978.



- 11 -
addition of a pumped storage (PS) unit at TEC's existing Bhira hydroelectric station to generate 150
MW of additional peak power to meet more of the increasing demand in the Bombay area and also
increase the capacity utilization of TEC's existing thermal generating units at Trombay by consumning
off-peak thermal power; (b) a 220 kV transmission line to carry this power to TEC's licensed areas; (c)
a gas-based combined cycle (CCGT) plant of 180 MW at the Trombay thermal power station to
reduce the average cost of generation (this unit would be Trombay Unit 7); (d) a second flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) unit to control SO2 emissions from Trombay Unit 5; and (e) review of design
and technical specifications and supervision of construction of the Bhira PS scheme, as well as the
acquisition of know-how for the FGD facility at Trombay. The institutional and sectoral objectives
were to: (i) support increased private sector participation in the supply of power; and (ii) encourage
improved tariff structure and load management procedures for TEC's direct consumers.
Implementation Experience and Results
iv.    Project implementation was vitiated by delays, much of which were beyond the control of
TEC. Delays of several months were caused by belated environmental clearance by the GOI for the
CCGT plant resulting in the loan effectiveness date having to be extended three times and the
implementation schedule, as envisaged in the SAR, requiring to be extended accordingly. In 1984,
when Trombay Unit 6 was cleared by GOI, GOM and MSEB, the oldest three units of 62.5 MW each4
were scheduled to be retired when Unit 6 was commissioned. Unit 6 was commissioned in 1990, but in
view of the peak power shortage still prevailing in the Bombay area, GOM and MSEB agreed to
extend Units 1, 2 and 3, until the CCGT plant (Unit 7) came on stream in FY94. GOI required much
longer than anticipated at appraisal (in October 1990) to agree on this issue and grant the said
environmental clearance. Upon receipt of environmental clearance, the loan was made effective from
September 30, 1991. However, physical implementation was speeded up and the loan was closed as
per the original schedule on June 30, 1995. The loan amount was fully disbursed by December 3,
1995.
v.    The overall project implementation results have been satisfactory. Except for the
commissioning of the Bhira Pumped Storage Scheme, all other project components have been placed
in commercial operation. TEC's peak generating capacity has increased with the commissioning of the
CCGT plant, that has also caused the average cost of TEC's generation to decrease because of its
significantly higher overall thermal efficiency, the additional FGD unit at Trombay has helped reduce
emissions from the Trombay power station. TEC' s system reliability and quality of service have
improved. The only physical objective that has not yet been realized is the improvement in capacity
utilization of TEC's existing thermal generating units at Trombay, which would occur when the Bhira
PS facility is placed in operation.
vi.    The 150 MW Pumped Storage Unit was mechanically completed and the generator/motor has
operated on synchronous condenser mode since March 1995. During wet commissioning tests, a
section of the penstock ruptured and caused a serious setback to the project completion targets.
Detailed investigation of the causes of failure has been undertaken by experts. Preliminary estimates
4   Units I and 2, were funded under Ln. 106-IN for the Trombay Power Project, approved in November 1954; Unit 3 was
funded under Ln. 164-IN for the Second Trombay Power Project, approved in May 1957. Ullit 6 was funded under Ln.
2452-IN for the Fourth Trombay Thermal Project, approved in June 1984.

indicate that this facility can be prepared for commissioning tests by March/April 1996. The rating of
the project will be revised when the final report is available and an addendum to this ICR will be issued
to record the findings as well as the measures taken to resolve the problem.
vii.   The upgrading of the Bhira-Dharavi transmission line from 1 10 kV to 220 kV was
accomplished ahead of schedule; the line was charged at 1 10 kV in June 1994. It was placed in
operation at 220 kV in February 1995.
viii.   The gas turbine unit of the Trombay CCGT plant was placed in operation on schedule in July
1993, but its operation could not be sustained due to non-availability of gas. First synchronization of
the CCGT Plant in the combined cycle mode was achieved in December 1994 and upon satisfactory
conclusion of its performance test, the plant was placed in commercial operation in June 1995. The
plant is able to generate 203 MW. Its operation has been satisfactory.
ix.    The second flue gas desulfurization unit for Trombay Unit 5 was placed in commercial
operation in September 1994 and its performance has since been satisfactory. It is removing 85% of
the SO2 from unit 5 flue gas.
x.    In terms of the long-term sectoral objective, TEC have shown that a private utility is more
efficient in implementing, operating and maintaining its facilities, than a publicly-owned utility. In
accordance with its commitments, GOM extended TEC's licenses for another ten years5, thus showing
to potential investors its seriousness in attracting, dealing and keeping private investments. The burden
of taxes/duties on the project was alleviated by virtue of the exemption of customs duties GOI
continued to grant to procurement carried out under IBRD loans. While this project cannot act as a
model for private sector participation in the future, it nevertheless shows that GOI's and the Bank's
strategies to move towards private investments in the power sector are correct. The internal economic
rate of return (IERR) computations updated for this ICR show that TEC's tariffs were adjusted to
orient consumer surplus from the consumers to the utility (para 1.06). Thus initial steps to fulfill the
expectations of the SAR about improving TEC's tariff structure so that TEC's direct consumers are
induced to implement demand-side management procedures and projects have been undertaken.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
xi.   The project was implemented generally satisfactorily, albeit some delays as noted above. The
physical objectives have been partially met, and full economic benefits of the project would be realized
as soon as the Bhira PS scheme starts operation on a commercial basis. In accordance with South Asia
Region's portfolio management guidelines, the loan was closed on its original closing date when TEC
had incurred eligible expenditures to cover the whole amount of the loan, although the Bhira PS
Scheme was not completed. Satisfactory completion of this component will be reported to the Board
in due course.
xii.   The Bank remained closely involved in the implementation of the project, from preparation
through completion. Its excellent relations with TEC throughout the execution of the project as well
5   Under Ln.2452-IN for the Fourth Trombay Thermal Power Project, TEC's licenses were extended to August 15, 2004.
Under Ln. 3239-IN for the Project, the licenses were extended to August 15, 2014, the maturity date of the Loan.

as close interaction with TEC officials, helped remove implementation bottlenecks while enhancing the
quality of TEC's efficient management.
xiii.  Future operations of the project are likely to be sustainable. Power continues to remain in
short supply throughout India's Western Region and the high-efficiency CCGT plant at Trombay
and the Bhira PS scheme, when completed, are expected to contribute in filling the supply-
demand gap. Peaking power of up to 150 MW is expected to be provided by the Bhira PS and its
operation in the pump-motor mode will improve system operating efficiency by providing off-
peak load for TEC's thermal generating units. The additional FGD unit for Trombay Unit 5
employs flue gas clean up technology using sea water to improve air quality in the surrounding
areas.
xiv.   The key findings and lessons learned are:
(a)   The Bhira PS penstock failure is still under investigation. Available data indicates
that because not all the studies were conducted prior to implementation, design
requirements which would have been informed by the studies were not fully
satisfied. Stringent design quality control in this case appears to have been lacking
(para. 1.07).
(b)   The experience in this project confirms the appropriateness of the Bank's current
procedure by which investment projects with significant environmental issues have
to obtain all the necessary environmental and other clearances from all concerned
central and state government agencies, well ahead of the approval of any loan by
the Bank (para. 1.08).
(c)   Finalizing subcontracts at the time of main contract award, along with complete
quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plans, saved significant amounts of time
and helped accelerate project implementation. Similarly, for major equipment
suppliers, linking payment to the furnishing of essential design information required
for detailed engineering helped alleviate design coordination problems (para. 1.09).
(d)  Single turn-key contracts for the main plant and equipment of the various
components, especially for the combined cycle technology, proved easier to
implement and manage (para. 1.10).
(e)  It is necessary to evaluate the manufacturing capability as well as the
corresponding shop facility of vendors through a thorough prequalification
exercise. Substantial delays were experienced because some manufacturers had to
refurbish and augment their shop facilities to accommodate the work in hand (para.
1.12).



INDIA
PRIVATE POWER UTILITIES (TEC) PROJECT
(LOAN 3239-IN)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.01  Electricity demand in India in the 1990s was projected to grow at an annual average of
approximately 9% through the year 2000. This huge demand had caused supply gaps arising from
scarcity of public resources on the one hand and frequent breakdown of existing plants on the
other owing to nonavailability of spare parts, deteriorating fuel quality and inability of the public
sector utilities to take timely outages of the generating units for maintenance. To meet the
demand and improve the quality of power supply, the Government of India (GOI) decided to tap
the private sector and utilize its ability to implement major power projects.
1.02  India is one of the few developing countries with a vibrant, if small, private sector
presence in the public power supply domain. The Tata Electric Companies (TEC) represent the
largest electric power utility in the private sector in India. The reliability of TEC's power supply
and the quality of its service is extremely high. TEC is a well managed corporation with strong
financial performance and an excellent record of operation and technical innovation. The private
power utilities are regulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, under which the utilities may
set their tariffs to recover their full operating costs, depreciation, interest and return on equity .
Their individual franchises are defined in licenses granted by their respective state governments,
which cover their geographical areas of operation.
1.03  At appraisal, in October 1990, IBRD involvement with India's private power utilities had
comprised four loans to TEC for the staged development of the Trombay Power Station near
Bombay. This involvement and TEC's efficient project implementation, operation and
maintenance of its plants helped GOI to decide to invite and induce private investment into the
power sector. Additionally, IBRD and IFC participation also helped mobilize additional financing
for the project from the Government of Switzerland and a conglomerate of local banks led by the
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI).
1.04  The project's physical objectives were to: (a) provide additional peak generating capacity
to meet more of the increasing demand in the Bombay area and reduce TEC's dependence on the
state's grid; (b) increase the capacity utilization of existing thermal generating units at Trombay
and add a gas based combined cycle plant, to reduce the average cost of generation; (c) mitigate
the sulfur dioxide emissions from the coal and oil burning Trombay Unit No. 5; and (d) improve
system reliability and quality of service to consumers. The institutional and sectoral objectives
were: (a) support increased private sector participation in the supply of power; and (b) encourage
improved tariff structures and load management procedures for TEC's direct consumers. The
project was fully consistent with the Bank's lending strategy for the Indian power sector.



-2-
B. Achievement of Objectives
Overall Results
1.05  The overall objectives of the project were substantially achieved, except for the
commissioning of the Bhira PS facility. TEC has been able to increase its peak generating
capacity, which will increase further as soon as the Bhira PS facility comes into operation; TEC
has been able to reduce its dependence on MSEB, the average cost of generation by TEC is
significantly reduced; and TEC's system reliability and the quality of power supply have
improved. The air quality in the surrounding areas of the CCGT plant has improved. TEC's
technical competence and management capabilities are well recognized.
1.06 Rate of Return. In the SAR, the economic analysis was carried out in computing the
estimated internal economic rates of return (IERR) of: (i) the FY90 - FY2000 time-slice of the
Western Region development program; and, (ii) the Project. The [ERR for the FY90 - FY2000
time-slice of the Western Region development program was estimated at 7% counting as benefits
only the economic value of incremental revenues (using the tariffs as proxy) and 25% when
allowance for associated consumer surplus was made. The IERR for the Project was estimated at
about 26% (associated consumer surplus considered). For the ICR, the economic analysis for the
investment program was updated, considering the commercial operation of the Trombay CCGT
Plant at a load factor of 68.5%, as envisaged by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), and
assuming that the Bhira PS Scheme will start operation from April 1996 on the basis of 4 hours
every day in the generating mode at full power (Part III, Table 8). The benefits of the investment
program relate mainly to the incremental consumption which they make possible. A minimum
measure of benefits was derived from the incremental sales revenue based on the average retail
tariffs of TEC (Rs. 2.1 1/kWh), representing the minimum willingness to pay for electricity, i.e.,
without taking into account consumer surplus. On this basis, the IERR achieved for the project is
20.4%. If the savings from the reduced purchase of power from MSEB are also taken as a
project benefit, the IRR increases to 26.4%. Comparison of the project IERR estimated in the
SAR and the ICR, shows that TEC's tariffs were adjusted to orient the consumer surplus from the
consumers to the utility.
1.07  Implementation Experience.- Loan 3239-4N was approved by the Board on June 26, 1990
in the amount of US$ 98.0 million equivalent and the Loan Agreement was signed on October 3,
1990. There were specific conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan which included, inter
alia, the receipt by TEC of all environmental clearances from the GOI and GOM as necessary for
the construction of the Trombay CCGT plant. The loan effectiveness date had to be extended
three times before the environmental clearance was finally obtained by TEC, upon which, the
other conditions having been met, the loan became effective on September 30, 1991 (para. 1.08).
Except for the commissioning of the Bhira Pumped Storage scheme, all other project components
have been placed in commercial operation (Part III, Table 5). The gas turbine was commissioned
in open cycle in July 1993, while the combined cycle module was put into commercial service in
March 1995. The 220 kV transmission system was commissioned in June 1994 and the FGD Unit
in September 1994. The 150 MW Pumped Storage Unit was mechanically completed and the
generator/motor started operation on synchronous condenser mode in March 1995. During wet
commissioning tests, a section of the penstock ruptured and caused a serious setback to the



- 3 -
project completion targets. Detailed investigation of the causes of failure has been undertaken by
experts. Preliminary estimates indicate that this facility can be prepared for commissioning tests
by March/April 1996.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
1.08  Project Start Up. The project experienced an initial delay of almost one year due to:
(a)   the long time taken by the GOI Ministry of Environment and Forests in providing
environmental clearance for the project. In 1984, when Trombay Unit 6 was cleared
by GOI, GOM and MSEB, the oldest three units of 62.5 MW each were scheduled to
be retired when Unit 6 was commissioned. The unit was commissioned in 1990, but in
view of the peak power shortage still prevailing in the Bombay area, agreed to extend
these units until the CCGT plant (Unit 7) came on stream in FY94. GOI required
much longer than anticipated at appraisal to agree on this issue and grant the said
environmental clearance; and,
(b)   delay by the CEA in clearing the 180 MW CCGT unit. Because of emission limits
put by GOM Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, TEC had its engineering
consultants determine capacity of the Trombay station making optimum use of
coal, oil and available gas. Thus the capacity of 180 MW was defined for the
CCGT unit. Clearance of the proposal by GOM and MSEB did not require long
time. However, CEA proposed a 410 MW plant to burn all the "firm" gas being
used at that time in Trombay's conventional boilers, contending that it was
wasteful to burn gas in conventional boilers at 3 5% efficiency when the CCGT unit
offered to yield an efficiency of 49%. More particularly, CEA insisted that
Trombay had received clearance for the older units to burn coal only. CEA's
proposal would have entailed extensive reengineering and careful evaluation of its
techno-economic viability. In fact, the proposal would have delayed the project at
least by two years for the studies to be completed, and that too without any
assurance that they would yield any tangible results. In the end, however, CEA
agreed with the project proposal as originally envisioned.
1.09  TEC did its utmost to recover the time lost owing to circumstances beyond its control.
Despite the delays, TEC was always in control of the situation, optimally reduced the
implementation time table and helped completion of the major elements of the project by
expediting construction and commissioning. TEC got excellent results by insisting on the
finalization of all subcontracts at the time of main contract award, along with complete QA/QC
plans. Also, for major equipment suppliers, linking payment to the furnishing of essential design
data required for detailed engineering and design coordination proved to be very helpful in
securing timely information and alleviating implementation bottlenecks. The Gas Turbine of the
CCGT plant was, in fact, commissioned ahead of schedule, but its operation could not be
sustained because of shortage of natural gas supplied by ONGC.
1.10  Procurement. For performance guarantee reasons, the main package for the 180 MW
CCGT scheme was procured as a single responsibility contract under international competitive



bidding (ICB) procedures, and on a supply-and-erect basis. The main package was divided into
three components: 120 MW gas turbine and generator; waste heat recovery boiler; and 60 MW
steam turbine and generator. This contracting strategy proved easier to implement and manage.
The Industrial Model for Domestic Preference for goods manufactured in India was applied in
accordance with Bank guidelines, as agreed during negotiations. Bidders were required to price
each of the components separately to make up the lump sum price. Each such component offered
ex-works India had to have a domestic value added of not less than 20% of its price. Those
without domestic value added were offered on a CIF basis. For the purpose of providing
domestic preference, the CIF price of the component offered from abroad within a bid was
increased by the applicable duty, or 15%, whichever was less.
1.11  The turbine-generator/pump-motor set for the Bhira PS was also procured under ICB, on
a supply-and-erect basis. The remaining contracts, some including civil works, were procured
under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. No special preference was accorded to
domestic bidders when competing with foreign bidders, state-owned enterprises, small-scale
enterprises or enterprises from any given State. No negotiation on the bid price was allowed.
1.12  The CCGT plant contract was won by the least-cost bidder under a joint venture between
Siemens of Germany and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) of India, with Siemens as the
main partner. ABB was the other bidder and it made a representation that it had by mistake,
included the price of a component (auxiliary air compressor) as extra. However, ABB was not
allowed to change the bid and the price of the component was taken into account for the purpose
of bid evaluation. Even otherwise, the result of the bid evaluation would not have changed as the
devaluation of the Indian Rupee favored the Siemens-BHEL bid because of its significantly larger
local component. BHEL, however, had to augment its manufacturing shop facilities to
accommodate the fabrication of the very large equipment components, which caused delays in
project implementation.
1.13  Prices of components quoted under ICB were about 23% higher than budgeted for
financing under the IBRD/IFC loan. They seemed to reflect the existing global market situation
consequent upon the Gulf War raging at that time. As the prices for the parts of the contract to
be manufactured in India were higher than the estimates, it was agreed that TEC would finance
expenditures incurred in the local currency from its own resources, while Bank funds would be
used for disbursing against foreign currency expenditures and expected contingencies.
1.14  The contract for Bhira PS was also awarded to the least cost bidder, Sulzer-Siemens.
Sulzer, a Swiss company, was the lead partner. Following the award of this contract, and in light
of the costs exceeding the budget, GOI and Switzerland decided with TEC's concurrence, that
parts of an ongoing Swiss loan to India would be allocated to finance the expenditures in Swiss
Francs incurred by the Swiss manufacturer.
1.15  Finalization of subcontracts at the time of main contract award, along with complete
QA/QC plans, was insisted upon and compliance with this requirement saved significant time in
project implementation. TEC also linked progress payment to the furnishing of essential design
data required for the detailed engineering and design of the plant.

D. Project Sustainability
1.16  The achievements of the project are likely to be sustainable. Supply of gas to the
Trombay power station is quite good6. TEC will take all the necessary actions to ensure
satisfactory operation of the Bhira PS scheme. The Operational Plans to ensure the sustainability
the project components have been discussed and agreed with TEC's management during the ICR
rnission. These plans are presented in Part III, Table 6.
E. Bank Performance
1.17  The performance of the Bank from project preparation through project completion was
satisfactory. In particular, the Bank has successfully maintained a good working relations with
TEC from identification to loan closing. A total of nine supervision missions were fielded during
the project implementation period. Problems encountered were identified, solutions, agreed
action plans were developed and advice on problems were provided to those concerned. Suitable
follow-up actions were taken as needed and mid-course corrections were made. Interestingly, a
hand-held grouting tool, simple to fabricate, light weight (28 kg), easy to operate and ready for
instant deployment on small grouting jobs, invented by one of the Bank's engineering staff, was
used very effectively on the rehabilitation of the "old" tunnel (built in the 1930s) in Bhira, even
though the World Bank is not in the business of designing or manufacturing applications
equipment.
F. Borrower Performance
1.18  The overall assessment of TEC' s performance is satisfactory. All commitments made
during the negotiations and covenants under the loan were fulfilled. The financial performance
has remained very strong during the project implementation period. Given the fact that the
project included the first gas-based combined cycle power plant in the private sector, it did lay the
foundation for TEC to become fully knowledgeable in the state-of-the-art technology in respect of
engineering, construction, and commissioning. Despite the favorable outcomes, the deficiencies
in project execution relate to delays in completing some of the project components on schedule,
including the Bhira PS scheme. Even though much of the problems were beyond TEC's control,
such as delays due to GOI's granting the clearances for Trombay CCGT unit (para 1.08), the
inadequacy of shop floor facilities to manufacture the waste heat recovery boiler, or heavy
monsoon in the case of Bhira PS scheme, there are interesting lessons to learn for the future. For
instance, it is assumed that the transient hydraulic analysis of the long penstock under all
operating conditions of the pump/turbine unit, and the stringent design quality control dictated by
it, were not adequately satisfied in this case, thereby causing the failure of the penstock during
wet commissioning tests with the loss of five precious human lives. This hypothesis would be
verified by ongoing investigation into the causes of failure of the penstock. The findings may well
point towards other lessons to learn.
6 In 1994, TEC suffered from reduced supply due to some problems in the gas fields. The situation has improved since early
1995, and TEC are in a position to operate the CCGT unit at full load.

G. Cofinancier Performance
1.19  IFC cofinanced the project to the tune of US$ 68.3 million equivalent. The project was
appraised by a joint Bank-IFC mission. IFC staff deferred to the Bank (IBRD) for project
supervision. The Government of Switzerland was also provided with Bank supervision reports.
The local financial institutions were led by ICICI. ICICI staff participated in meetings Bank
preparation and appraisal missions had with TEC. They subsequently appraised the project
independently before committing funds.
H. Summary Assessment of Outcome
1.20  The physical results of the project have been satisfactory, except for the delay in
completing the Bhira PS scheme. The components of the project that have already been
completed meet or exceed most of the major objectives. TEC's peak generating capacity has
increased with the commissioning of the CCGT plant, which has also caused the average cost of TEC's
generation to decrease because of its significantly higher overall thermal efficiency. The additional
FGD unit at Trombay has helped reduce emissions from the Trombay power station. TEC's system
reliability and quality of service have improved. The only physical objective that has not yet been
realized is the improvement in capacity utilization of TEC's existing thermal generating units at
Trombay, which would occur when the Bhira PS facility is placed in operation. In terms of the long-
term sectoral objective, TEC have shown that a private utility is more efficient in implementing,
operating and maintaining its facilities, than a publicly-owned utility. The internal economic rate of
return (IERR) computations updated for this ICR show that TEC's tariffs were adjusted to orient
consumer surplus from the consumers to the utility (para 1.06). Thus initial steps to fulfill the
expectations of the SAR about improving TEC's tariff structure so that TEC's direct consumers are
induced to implement demand-side management procedures and projects have been undertaken.
1. Future Operation
1.21  The CEA has specified that the CCGT plant at Trombay should achieve a minimum Plant
Load Factor (PLF) of 68.5% and that the overall thermal efficiency of the plant should be 49%, as
designed. The PLF equates to a generation of about 1.2 million MWh per annum. The additional
FGD system installed at the Trombay plant (Unit 5) should continue to remove SO2 at an
efficiency of 85%. The Bhira PS facility, when completed, should run in the generating mode for
4 hours every day during day time, and in the pumping mode for 6 hours every night.
J. Key Lessons Learned
1.22  Several specific lessons can be drawn from this project that have both operational and
strategic implications for the design of similar projects in the future:
(a)   The Bhira PS penstock failure is still under investigation. It appears, on the basis
of available data, that not all the studies (such as transient hydraulic analysis of a
long penstock under all operating conditions of the pump/turbine unit and checking
with respect to any risk of hydraulic resonance) were conducted prior to
implementation. The result was that design requirements as would have been



- 7 -
dictated by the studies were not fully satisfied. Stringent design quality control in
this case appears to have been lacking.
(b)   The experience in this project confirms the appropriateness of the Bank's current
procedure for which investment projects withi significant environmental issues i.e.,
to secure all the necessary environmental and other clearances from all concerned
central and state government agencies, well ahead of the approval of any loan by
the Bank.
(c)   Finalizing subcontracts at the time of main contract award, along with complete
quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plans saved significant amounts of time
and helped accelerate project implementation. Similarly, for major equipment
suppliers, linking payment to the furnishing of essential design information required
for detailed engineering helped alleviate design coordination problems.
(d)    Single turn-key contracts for the main plant and equipment of the various components,
especially for the combined cycle technology, proved easier to implement and manage.
(e)   It is necessary to evaluate the manufacturing capability as well as the corresponding
shop facility of vendors through a thorough prequalification exercise. Substantial delays
were experienced because some manufacturers had to refurbish and augment their shop
facilities to accommodate the work in hand.
(f)    Not only the implementing agency, but also other government departments
involved in the approval or licensing processes, must be equally alive to the project
implementation schedule and work in unison to meet the schedule.
Evaluation of Program Objective Categories
A. Private Sector Participation
1.23   One of the major objectives of the project was to support increased private sector
participation in the supply of power in India. The project has accomplished this objective and
TEC has successfully implemented the project, albeit slight delays in implementation. GOI has
shown its seriousness in inviting and inducing private investments in the power sector by
guaranteeing the IBRD loan for the Project and agreeing to allocation of funds form a line of
credit provided by the Government of Switzerland to India. GOM has shown its interest in
private power by extending the licenses of TEC and adjusting TEC tariffs in a timely manner. The
success of the project is likely to encourage similar participation by private developers in the
future and this is consistent with priorities set out in the country assistance strategy. However, it
should be noted that this project cannot act as a model for private sector participation in the future
because the three companies forming TEC are well established companies with an excellent record.
The Project nevertheless shows that GOI's and the Bank's strategies to move towards private
investments in the power sector are correct.

B. Financial Objectives
1.24 At appraisal, the only matter for concern was that most of TEC's debt was in foreign
exchange, hence exposing the companies to foreign exchange risk. The SAR projected that debt
service coverage would remain above 1.25, and that about 20% of total new investment would be
covered by internal cash generation by FY2000. These projections included the effect of fuel cost
increases, assumed at 8% p.a., and purchased power cost increases assumed at 10% p.a., which
were to be passed on to the consumers through automatic tariff increases. TEC' s financial
performance during the project implementation period was significantly better than the appraisal
projections, as can be seen from TEC's income statement, balance sheet and sources and
application of funds presented in Appendix - D. Overall, TEC's financial position remained solid,
with a long-term debt to net worth ratio consistently above 1.5 and a current ratio below 1.2.
C. Environmental Objectives
1.25  All the components of the Project were designed to comply with GOI and GOM as well as
the applicable environmental policies and guidelines of the World Bank. Operational
performances of the components commissioned met the above policies and guidelines. Further
information about the components is given in Appendix E. At the time environmental clearance
for the Project was given, GOI/GOM mandated that TEC must install a fly ash utilization plant to
reduce the environmental impacts of the fly ash discharged by Trombay Unit 5 of 500 MW
capacity (built under Ln. 1549-IN for the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project - FY78).
Accordingly, TEC installed a Fly Ash Aggregate Plant of 200,000 t/annum capacity to produce
cold-bonded light weight aggregates. Although this unit was not part of the Project, all the
components of the project were designed to comply with GOI and GOM as well as the applicable
environmental policies and guidelines of the World Bank. Information about this unit is also given
in Appendix E.

In September 1993, TEC decided to use about US$30 million equivalent from the IFC loan instead
of the IBRD loan to take advantage of the then prevailing exchange rates. The favorable exchange rate of
the Japanese Yen vis-a-vis the German DM made it significantly more attractive for TEC to use the IFC
loan in Japanese Yen for the CCGT contract with Siemens-BHEL. The IFC loans of US$30 million and
Yen 4,600 million were fully disbursed by September 1992.

APPENDIX- A
AIDE-MEMOIRE
This aide-memoire formalizes the observations of the special Implementation Completion
Mission of the World bank for the Private Power Utilities (TEC) Project, Loan 3239-IN, and
records the agreements reached by the mission with the Tata Electric Companies in connection
with the preparation of an Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission was conducted
from September 19 to 23, 1995, and again on October 31 and November 1, 1995 for the wrap up.
The mission also visited the Trombay Thermal Power Station as well as the Bhira Pumped
Storage Facility. The mission was joined by Mr. Argun Ceyhan, Senior Power Engineer, on
October 31. The mission would like to take this opportunity to thank the management and the
entire staff of TEC for the courtesies and cooperation extended to it during its work.
1.    The policy of the Bank is to evaluate completed projects, and it requires Borrowers also
to do so. The ICR is a milestone in the project cycle, making the transition from implementation
to the projects future operation. It was agreed that the ICR would be prepared in accordance
with the guidelines contained in the Bank's Operational Policies OP 13.55 (April 1994), a copy of
which along with its annexes, had been sent earlier to TEC from Washington DC.
2.    Based on this agreement, TEC prepared a draft ICR and presented a copy of the same to
the mission for discussion on October 31, 1995. The draft report contained a wealth of valuable
information, prepared with high professional competence. The mission indicated that this report
would be included as Part II of the ICR; however, it would need to be pruned in a manner so that
the entire text did not exceed ten (10) pages for it to be included in the main report, in accordance
with Bank guidelines. It was also agreed that the information to be given in Part I of the report
would not be repeated in Part II. A copy of the first draft of Part I, prepared by the Bank, had
earlier been given to TEC. In light of the discussion on the draft report, TEC would revise its
draft to incorporate Bank comments and transmit the same to the Bank in Washington DC within
two weeks from the date of this aide-memoire.
3.    It was agreed that the project cost would be computed in accordance with the following
principle: the amount indicated in each contract award letter would be shown as the base cost for
that contract. Subsequent change orders issued against the contract would be lumped together
and shown as "physical contingency", duly authorized for the contract to be completed.
Similarly, any price escalation in accordance with Price Variation formulas allowed under the
contract would be captured to reflect the "price contingency" for that contract. This exercise for
each contract would serve to help compute the total base cost and total physical and price
contingencies comprising the project cost. Interest During Construction (IDC) has already been
computed and indicated in the draft report by TEC. IT was agreed that TEC would revise the
format of the project cost in accordance with the above guide'ines and include the same in the
revised report.
4.    Even though taxes and duties paid on the procurement of goods and services are included
in the base cost, the Bank would need an indication of the magnitude of these costs separately.
TEC would need to capture these costs and convey the results to the Bank in its revised report.

Status of the Project
5.    Trombay Combined Cycle Plant. The gas turbine was commissioned to operate in an open
cycle mode in July 1993 and in the combined cycle mode in December 1994. This plant has since
been in commercial operation.
6.    Flue Gas Desulfurization Plant. This project component was commissioned and placed in
commercial operation in September 1994. It has since been operating satisfactorily and helping to
ensure a cleaner atmosphere due to reduced emissions.
7.    220 kV Bhira-Dharavi Transmission System. The erection of the transmission system was
completed and the lines charged at 1 10 kV in June 1994. The transmission system was
commissioned to operate at the rated voltage of 220 kV in February 1995.
8.    Bhira Pumped Storage Facility. Completion of this component has been delayed. It was
reported to have suffered a serious set back as a result of the failure of a section of the Penstock
during commissioning tests which, in its wake, took a toll of five lives, including that of the
Project Manager of the Penstock erection. Preliminary indication is that the failure has been
caused by low frequency vibration induced during commissioning that coincided with the natural
frequency of the Penstock itself Detailed investigation by several experts, including EDF, has
been undertaken, and it is estimated that the delay could extend by several months. It was,
however, decided that the ICR would be written in any case with the Bhira Pumped Storage
Facility still outstanding.
9.    The mission requested TEC to keep the Bank informed of the results of the investigation
on the Bhira Penstock failure as well as the progress of repairs until final commissioning, testing
and placing the facility in commercial operation.
10.   The following schedule was agreed for the preparation of the ICR:
Revised draft of ICR from TEC to Bank              November 13, 1995
Draft Final ICR, from Bank to TEC           November 22, 1995
Comments on Final Draft, TEC to Bank               November 30, 1995
Final ICR issue                                    December 31, 1995

APPENDIX - B
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
PROJECT OBJ1ECTIVES AND DESIGN
Project Objectives
Physical Objectives
The SAR envisaged the following four physical objectives., which have been largely met.
A)   "Provide additional peak generation capacity and reduce TEC's dependence on the
State's grid".
Since the commissioning of Gas Turbine and Generator in July '93 and Combined Cycle,
Power Plant (CCPP) in December "94, TEC's purchase from MSEB has been reduced
(29%).
B)    "Increase the capacity utilization of existing thermal generating units at Trombay all of
which will reduce the average cost of generation".
The load on each of the two 500 MW Units at Trombay are reduced by 100 MW for a
duration of six hours every night and during the reduced load operation these plants
operate at a lower efficiency of 36.3% compared to 37% at full load operation. When the
pumped storage plant at Bhira becomes operational, the Trombay 500 MW Units will be
able to operate at their best efficiency, thereby reducing cost of generation.
C)    "Mitigate the sulphur dioxide emissions for the coal and oil burning Trombay Unit No.
5".
The augmentation of Flue Gas Desulphurisation Plant capacity from 25% to 50% has
benefited Trombay Thermal Generating Station with flexibility of fuels while meeting
emission regulations stipulated by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. It has also
improved the air quality in surrounding areas.
D)    "Improve system reliability and quality of service to consumers".
Since the commissioning of Combined Cycle Plant at Trombay, the quality and reliability
of power supply in TEC system have improved. However, the supply continues to fall
behind demand. TEC have, therefore, proposed installation of 450 MW Combined Cycle
Plant at it's hydro generating station at Bhivpuri where substantial infrastructure facilities
are available.



- 21 -
Sectoral Objectives
The SAR envisaged the following institutional and sectoral objectives.
E)    "Support increased private sector participation in the supply of power".
TEC's ability to finance capital intensive power projects as a private utility as well as
implement the same on schedule have strengthened Government of India's and
Government of Maharashtra's endeavor to bring in private sector participation in power.
TEC have also subsequently raised finances through GDR issue and demonstrated that
global financing opportunities are feasible for private sector participation in power in
India.
F)    "Encourage improved tariff structure and load management procedures for TEC's direct
consumers".
The necessity for implementing time-of-the day tariff is now being increasingly recognized
and in a small way this has been initiated in Maharashtra. TEC's studies for implementing
the Load Management Center are proceeding and financial provisions have been made.
Project Design
The project design envisaged in the SAR for Bhira Pumped Storage Plant, Bhira Dharavi
Transmission System and Flue Gas Desulphurisation plant generally remained unchanged.
However, in the case of Trombay CCPP, consequent to modular design, the rated capacity of the
installed plant is 203 MW at site ambient conditions, instead of 180 MW envisaged during
appraisal. In addition, at the time of issue of environmental clearance for the Combined Cycle
Power Plant at Trombay, Government of India/Government of Maharashtra have stipulated
installation of fly ash aggregate project for useful utilization of fly ash from Trombay 500 MW
Unit 5. Accordingly, TEC has installed a plant (200,000 T/annum capacity) for producing cold-
bonded light weight aggregates using fly ash with the technology process from Aardelite Holding
B.V. (now Hoogovens Technical Services), a Dutch company. This process is well suited for
Trombay as it is environment friendly with no emissions or effluent discharges. The light weight
aggregates are used for civil works at Trombay and other divisions of TEC for making roads,
pavements concrete blocks. etc.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness
The Project was appraised in March '90 and the loan agreement was signed on 3rd
October '90. However, the loan became effective only on 30th September '91, on the final day
of expiry of Loan Agreement after three extensions, as one of the conditions to the effectiveness
of loan agreement, viz., "Environmental Clearance for the construction of Trombay Combined
Cycle Plant" was delayed from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India,
though only clean fuel, viz., associated gas from Bombay High was proposed for use in the



- 22 -
Combined Cycle Plant. However, in the meanwhile, TEC had completed all procurement
activities for the main plant and equipment and the contracts were awarded on the same date
when the loan became effective.
Project Implementation and Operation Experience
Trombay Combined Cycle Plant
The SAR envisaged that the gas turbine and the combined cycle system would be
commissioned within 24 and 36 months of contract award respectively which were generally
achieved. The contracts for the main plant were awarded on 30th September '91 and the open
cycle was commissioned in July '93 (22 months) and combined cycle in December '94 (38
months). The maximum load carried by Gas Turbine was 149 MW in January '95 when the
ambient temperature was 190C. The performance test of GTG was carried out in November '93
and the efficiency was found to be 31.89% compared to guaranteed 31.56%. The Steam Turbine
was synchronized on 9th December '94. The combined cycle plant achieved a maximum capacity
of 214 MW in June' 95. The daily maximum generation was 4.88 GWh. The performance tests
were completed in June '94. The preliminary results indicate achievement of contractual capacity
of 203 MW and thermal efficiency of 49% in the combined cycle mode. The teething troubles
have been solved and the performance of the plant is satisfactory.
Bhira Pumped Storage Plant
During loan negotiations, the completion of Bhira PS Scheme was agreed upon as March
'95. The project was commissioned on synchronous condenser mode in March '95. However,
there has been a delay of 6 months in mechanical completion of the project for commencement of
wet tests, largely due to stringent schedules originally adopted and very heavy monsoon in '94
which delayed the work. Though the wet tests commenced by end September '95 the project
suffered a setback consequent to the rupture of penstock when the wet tests were in progress on
16th October '95. The Project is expected to be in operation on generating/pumping mode in the
first quarter of 1996.
Flue Gas Desulphurisation Plant
The SAR envisaged that "the commissioning of the Flue Gas Desulphurisation Plant
would be realized during 1991-1994 period, within 24-30 months of award". The project was
completed in September '94 and has been in operation since then. The performance is
satisfactory.
Bhira Dharavi Transmission System
The SAR envisaged that "the transmission development associated with Bhira PS Scheme
would also be implemented in the 1991-1994 period, to be ready when the pumped storage
project is commissioned". This has been met. The 220 kV transmission lines were in operation
at 110 kV since June '94 and at 220 kV since February '95.



- 23 -
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Trombay Combined Cycle Power Plant
At the time of clearance of the project Central Electricity Authority had envisaged that the
unit will operate at plant load factor of 68.5%, which will continue to be its performance
indicator. In addition, the Combined Cycle Power Plant is designed to operate at an efficiency of
49% which will also be monitored.
Flue Gas Desulphurisation Plant
The Flue Gas Desulphurisation plant is designed to operate at 85% efficiency for a S02
loading of 350 kg/hr.
Bhira Pumped Storage Plant
The plant is scheduled to operate six hours in the night on pumping mode and four hours
(two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening) in the generating mode during day time
peak. The efficiency during pumping mode is 92% and generating mode is 90.6%. The plant is
expected to generate 160 GWh of peaking power and save 33 GWh during monsoon season.
220 kV Transmission System
Consequent to upgrading the system from 1 10 kV the transmission losses are lower. The
losses in turn depend upon generation which is dependent on monsoon.
PROCUREMENT
The procurement under ICB was done satisfactorily following IBRD guidelines. In case
of each of the packages of Trombay and Bhira Projects, there were representations by Bidders
who were not the lowest evaluated and acceptable. These issues were clarified to the Bank with
additional information and the Bank accepted the Consultant's recommendations. The contract
awards were rescheduled in line with the loan effectiveness of IBRD loan and availability of funds
for consultancy, particularly for Bhira and FGD Projects. As far as possible, all of the contracts
were awarded ahead of schedule to provide adequate time for manufacturing and erection.
Though the SAR envisaged that the main plant and equipment for Trombay Combined
Cycle Plant and Bhira Pumped Storage Plant would be procured on a supply-and erect basis for
performance guarantee reasons, in the case of Trombay Combined Cycle Plant Project the
erection of Gas Turbine, Steam Turbine and Control Room equipment was carried out using in
house expertise, retaining the vendor's supervision for guarantee obligations.
Wherever vendor's expertise was required for erection, contracts were awarded on supply
and erect basis, viz., Diesel Generator Set, Condenser Circulating Water Pumps, etc., whereas,
TEC utilized its in-house agency to erect Transformers and switchyard equipment.



- 24 -
QUALITY CONTROL
As in previous projects, the quality assurance and quality control were established
independent of project construction agency. The services of Tata Consulting Engineers and Tata
Projects Ltd. were availed for the in-process inspection at vendor's/sub-vendor's work.
Performance tests were carried out at Vendor's Works whenever possible and witnessed. The
operation and maintenance personnel were inducted right from the beginning of the project for
Quality Control, which also enabled smooth handing over of the projects.
EXPEDITING
Like previous projects the Project Monitoring and Expediting Cell carried out the project
planning, monitoring and expediting work. As a part of contracts, the Vendors submitted Level
1, Level 2 and Level 3 networks for their manufacturing activity which formed a basis for
monitoring. The services of Tata Consulting Engineers and Tata Projects Ltd. were also availed
for expediting.
For Trombay CCPP, while the imported items were delivered in time, substantial
expediting efforts were required to ensure sequential and timely delivery of components from
BHEL. A full time inspection and expediting engineer was posted both at BHEL (Hardwar) and
BHEL (Trichy) to expedite deliveries. In addition, frequent intervention of BHEL's top
management was found necessary to accord priorities and expedite the work. TEC had to
mobilize additional resources as BHEL's erection contractor could not mobilize adequately.
In the case of Bhira Project, for the erection of penstocks two additional agencies were
mobilized at different fronts to expedite the work. Similarly, TEC mobilized it's departmental
agency for dismantling after hydro test, transportation and erection of penstock isolation valve as
the schedule indicated by the valve supplier was not at all acceptable.
LOCAL CLEARANCES
The local construction clearances of all projects were generally received in time.
However, the commencement of civil works of Trombay CCPP was delayed by six months as the
local Municipal Authorities insisted on having the approval for conversion of Trombay CCPP site
from 'No Development Zone' to 'Special Industrial Zone' prior to commencement of civil works.
This was done by Government of Maharashtra by notification in the Gazette only in end April '92
which became effective on 15th July '92.
PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTORS AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT
Like previous projects, while the deliveries of imported equipment were generally
satisfactory, the delivery of indigenous equipment were delayed resulting in pressure on erection
work. The erection contractors had to compensate this with additional resources to achieve the
project schedule.



- 25 -
For Trombay project, one of the reasons for the delay in supplies of main equipment
contractors like BHEL was that the equipment (capacity and size) in their scope of supply were
being manufactured for the first time in India, which needed substantial augmentation of their
manufacturing resources.
In the case of the Bhira project, the contractors for penstock supply and erection, station
EOT crane and penstock isolation butterfly valve grossly under-estimated the quantum of work
and the resources required, resulting in delay in commissioning of the unit.
TEC has also adopted extensive contractual management measures to expedite the
progress of work at site, which are briefly as under:
* Finalizing sub-contractors at the time of contract award, along with quality plan and
customer hold points.
* Linking 10% payment to equipment vendors with furnishing of data for future detailed
engineering and foundation design by consultants.
* Splitting of civil works between two major contractors. This ensured that in case one
of the contractors failed, work could be immediately transferred to the second
contractor. This philosophy was extended to electrical cabling works as well.
3 In-house capabilities were mobilized for erection of gas turbine, transformers and
switchgear.
* Project Monitoring and Expediting Cell closely monitored and carried out expediting
of contract award, drawings approval, order placement on sub-vendors,
commencement of manufacturing, etc.
* Departmental Erection Agency supported wherever contractors failed to meet the
required progress.
TRAINING
TEC has provided for extensive training of their personnel for the operation and
maintenance of plants at the time of finalizing the tender specifications as well as contracts. TEC
has trained 12 engineers for the Combined Cycle Plant at various manufacturing /design offices of
Siemens AG. Similarly for the Bhira Project, six engineers were trained at Sulzer, Escher Wyss,
Ltd. and Siemens AG and other plants. In addition, the operation and maintenance personnel
were inducted into QA/QC work right at the beginning of construction which enabled better
training at site. The operation personnel of Trombay were associated with simulation tests of I &
C of Trombay CCPP enabling them to acquire complete plant operating particulars and sequence
of operations.

PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
The Bank took a very practical view at the time of making the loan effective by agreeing
to extend the "loan effectiveness date", understanding the administrative and political
involvement required for obtaining environmental clearance for the Trombay Project. This is very
much appreciated. The professional approach of the Bank in formulating the quarterly reports
and precise review are also very much appreciated. Some of the Bank's recommendations were
found innovative and useful for expediting the civil works at Bhira, which included the use of
hand held grouting tools for grouting jobs. The Bank's response to the purchase
recommendations forwarded by Purchaser was very prompt and all recommendations of
consultants were accepted by the Bank. The Bank was flexible in regard to financing items not
allocated initially in Bank's financing package. The financing of steam turbine generator and
condenser package of Trombay CCPP was accepted for financing by the Bank when proposed at
the fag end of the Project so as to fully utilize the loan from the Bank. The Bank's performance is
deemed excellent with very close rapport between Project Authorities and Bank personnel.
PERFORMANCE OF THE CO-FINANCIERS
The local financial institutions were led by ICICI. Though they had appraised the Project
independently, for the progress review they relied on the same quarterly reports as submitted to
the Bank. There were a few visits. They were also considerate and helpful and agreed to defer
disbursement of funds, when TEC had other rupee funds available for the completion of the
Projects.
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Like all TEC's previous projects, the Trombay and Bhira Projects have introduced new
technologies in utilities. These projects also served for transfer of technology to indigenous
manufacturers in a number of areas.
Trombay CCPP
Trombay CCPP has been provided with a black start facility, a first time effort in this
country. The fully automated plant is provided with technological features to start within
minimum possible time and sustain for two hours with diesel fuel when gas is not available, until
the 500 MW units are brought back on line. The heat recovery steam generator and the boiler
feed pumps of the required capacity are manufactured for the first time in India, needing improved
manufacturing processes. Similarly the air cooled generator is also first of it's kind manufactured
by BHEL.
Bhira Pumped Storage Plant
The 150 MW Bhira Pumped Storage Plant is the largest unit of its kind in India. Tata
Consulting Engineers have augmented their engineering expertise particularly for hydraulic
transient studies having obtained WHAM package developed by Prof C. S. Martin of Georgia
Institute of Technology, USA and used for Bhira Project.



- 27 -
Flue Gas Desulphurisation
This is the largest gas desulphurisation plant in this part of the world, which utilizes sea
water scrubber for flue gas desulphurisation. The Gas to Gas heat exchanger with corrosion
resistant glass flaked lining has been manufactured for the first time by BHEL, with back up
guarantee from ABB, Germany.
Fly Ash Aggregate Project
While fly ash bricks are made in some power stations in India, a full scale plant for
conversion of fly ash to light weight aggregate has been successfully implemented and operated
for the first time in India. The technology transferred to TEC is now available for other power
stations, several of whom have shown interest in installation of similar plant.
LESSONS LEARNED
Contract Management
In earlier Trombay units, TEC and TCE had extensive experience in engineering of the
plant and equipment in packages and integrating the same. For the main plant and equipment of
Trombay CCPP, the contracts were awarded on turn key basis, at the same time retaining
engineering and construction of miscellaneous equipment, viz., switchyard, transformers and civil
works separately. This has been found successful particularly for timely receipt of civil
engineering data for main plant foundations.
While the main plant of Bhira Project has been installed on turn key basis, the Gas Turbine
Generator (GTG) and Steam Turbine Generator (STG) of Trombay CCPP were erected
departmentally retaining minimum supervision for guarantee obligations, which arrangement was
found satisfactory as well as saved substantial expatriate and supervisory expenditure.
With the experience gained in Trombay CCPP project, Tata Consulting Engineers are now
in a position to engineer individual systems for combined cycle plant and integrate the same.
Splitting of civil works between two major contractors ensured that in case one of the
contractors failed, work could be transferred to the other contractor as they operated on identical
price rates. This philosophy was extended to cabling as well.
EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES
Though the contracts were awarded to fully qualified parties, it was found that their shop
floor needed substantial augmentation when manufacturing commenced. A typical example is the
manufacturing of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), at BHEL where substantial changes
were to be made at the Works to accommodate the 21 m long modules for assembly, heat
treatment and storage, resulting in a delay of 5 months until the first module was completed.
Similarly for Bhira project the contractors for station EOT crane, penstock isolation valve and



- 28 -
penstock fabrication did not pay adequate attention to manufacturing facilities resulting in delay of
the project. For future projects it is, therefore, necessary to critically review the manufacturing
facilities for specific application even if the supplier is a qualified and reputed vendor.
Equipment Design
HRSG module boxes
The HRSG of Trombay CCPP was supplied in module boxes, each consisting of 4 to 5
modules of 21 m long with weight of 80 T. Considering the time requirements, costs involved
and difficulties in transportation by road of over-dimensioned consignments, BHEL have
dispensed with module box construction at Works and modules will now be assemble on site.
Penstock isolation valve
The split design of 3.7m butterfly valve body to facilitate transportation needs to be
reviewed as achieving the machining accuracies is difficult, in addition to the potential source of
leakage at the joint.
Expediting
The necessity of very close follow up at vendor's Works on daily basis by posting a person
there proved to be a success once again. Also taking up of the progress with the chief executive
of the vendor organization (e.g. BHEL) on a monthly basis right from the beginning has now been
found useful, particularly for assigning additional resources at Works. With more jobs being sub-
contracted by manufacturers like BHEL to reduce costs, the network for expediting had to be
augmented.
CONCLUSION
The major factors leading to successful completion of the project were active involvement
of engineering, operation, maintenance and quality control personnel at all stages of the project
right from preparation of feasibility report, sound Contract Management, Expediting and
Contractors Management at site. The Projects have certainly fulfilled the main objective of TEC,
viz., supply of adequate and reliable power at economic price.

The Cofinanciers
Comnments by the Government of Switzerland (Letter dated February 7, 1996, from the Federal
Office for Foreign Affairs, Bundeshaus OST 3003, Berne; Ref. No: 3/861.3-IN):
I thank you for consulting our Office on the draft Implementation Completion Report for the
above mentioned project.
We agree with most of the content of the report, but feel that the subject matter of the rupture of
the penstock, which caused the death of five persons, is not treated thoroughly. The relevant
paragraph on key findings and lessons learned states, that "not all the studies (such as transient
hydraulic analysis of a long penstock and checking with respect of any risk of hydraulic resonance)
were conducted prior to implementation" - which is true. As a matter of fact, Sulzer Hydro, at the
time, had offered the transient hydraulic analysis, but the contract for the calculations was awarded to
another entity (Sulzer Hydro was thus involved neither in the calculation, engineering, manufacturing
nor in the inspection of the penstock). Should a close supervision not have detected such a flaw before
the accident happened? Which measures can the World Bank take to make sure that, in the future,
stringent quality control is made during manufacturing as well as erection of similar works?
In this connection, we would suggest the following addition to letter (e) of paragraph xiv on
page ix, "It is necessary to evaluate the manufacturing capability as well as the corresponding shop
facility and field erection know-how through a thorough prequalification exercise."
We hope that in spite of this tragic accident the project will be completed soon and start
generating power. Sulzer Hydro has offered to the customer (TEC) full support and cooperation to
expedite commissioning the Bhima Pumnped Storage Plant as early as possible.
With best regards,
Yours sincerely

the pumped storage was delayed one year, yet this seriousness is not apparent until
one reads Appendix A at Page 20.

(para viii) The gas turbine operation was low initially due to "non-availability of gas". Is there
no backup liquid fuel in the design?
4.    Page iv
(para xiii) The pumped storage provides peaking power by using surplus off-peak thermal
energy to pump water for peak time generation. In reality, it is an operating tool. It
improves system operating efficiency, not system energy efficiency, because the
energy conversion from off-peak to peak is only 800/o efficiency, i.e., pumped
storage consumes energy, it does not produce energy.

APPENDIX - D
TEC's FINANCIAL STATUS AND FINANCIAL TABLES
TEC's Financial Status at the Time of Project Appraisal. TEC is a licensee regulated
by the Sixth Schedule to the electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. This schedule provides, inter alia,
that licensees may recover the full cost associated with the sale of electricity and earn a
predetermined return on the capital base. Despite the low depreciation rate allowed under the
Act, TEC had been able to maintain a comfortable cash flow, mainly as a result of the special
appropriations allowed by the State under its license. These special appropriations included: (a) a
debt redemption reserve, to cover the difference between the provision for depreciation and
principal repayments; (b) a foreign exchange liabilities reserve, to cover exchange losses on
foreign currency loans; (c) a project cost reserve, to raise funds for future investments; and (d) a
deferred tax liability reserve, to cover an eventual tax liability of shareholders for unrealized
capital gains (arising from different depreciation rates under the Income Tax Act and the
Electricity Act) in the event the utility were taken over.
The operating costs of TEC's own generation had been contained, mainly due to the use
of competitively priced gas as the main fuel, as well as the high plant load factor and overall
operating efficiency. TEC's existing generation mix comprised efficient thermal units of recent
vintage as well as hydroelectric units generating about a fifth of TEC's total generation. The
absence of losses associated with low voltage distribution enabled TEC's tariffs to be lower than
MSEB's. When the fifth Trombay unit of 500 MW, financed by IBRD loan 1549-IN, came into
operation in 1984 and natural gas from the nearby Bombay High oilfields was made available at a
promotional price, TEC's average cost of generation declined. Rather than pass on the savings to
consumers through tariff reductions, TEC was able to retain them and appropriate them to the
project cost reserve (para. 2.02). TEC was thus able to finance its other projects with more
internal accruals and less debt, which in turn reduced the interest burden and therefore, the need
to adjust tariffs. The mechanism thus allowed the savings to come full circle back to the
consumer. By contrast, the cost of purchased power from MSEB had increased sharply in the
previous five years, to a about twice the cost of TEC's own generation.
Overall, TEC's financial position remained solid, with a long-term debt to net worth ratio
consistently above 1.5 and a current ratio below 1.2. The only matter for concern was that most
of TEC's debt was in foreign exchange, hence exposing the companies to foreign exchange risk.
The SAR projected that debt service coverage would remain above 1.25, and that about 20% of
total new investment would be covered by internal cash generation by FY2000. These projections
included the effect of fuel cost increases, assumed at 8% p.a., and purchased power cost increases
assumed at 10% p.a., which were to be passed on to the consumers through automatic tariff
increases.
TEC's Financial Performance: Comparison with SAR Forecasts - TEC's
financial performance during the project implementation period was significantly better than the
appraisal projections, as can be seen from TEC's income statement, balance sheet and sources and
application of funds presented at the end of this Appendix. Tables D-I, D-II and D-III below

provide a summary of TEC's performance in terms of energy sales, tariff rates and distributable
profits as compared to the SAR estimates:

94-95            234.0           1,452.2        520.6
Inflation, which had been forecast at 7% during the project period, turned out to be
higher, at about 11% on the average, thus leading to higher growth in operating expenses and
tariffs. Higher tariffs more than made up for lower energy sales, thereby leading to higher
revenues from power sales. Overall operating expenses also grew more rapidly than projected,
but less than revenues, resulting in an operating margin consistently well above appraisal
estimates. Several factors other than inflation accounted for higher operating expenses: (i) fuel
expenses increased as TEC had to import higher-cost oil and coal, albeit in small quantities; (ii)
large repair expenditures were incurred at Trombay and Bhira; (iii) extraordinary payments were
made to staff on account of a voluntary retirement scheme introduced in 1994/95; and (iv) higher
depreciation expenses were recorded in 1994/95 due to an increase in the allowable depreciation
rate from 3.5% to 7.5% effective April 1, 1994.



- 33 -
Despite a rapid increase in interest expenses and foreign exchange losses brought about by
the depreciation of the rupee, net income ("distributable profits") remained significantly higher
than forecast as TEC had unexpected income from investments (para. 2.08). In 1994/95, profits
increased in a sizeable manner. Tariffs were revised effective August 1994 based on conservative
estimates for thermal generation for the entire financial year. However, as a result of record
thermal generation due to increased availability of fuel and the commissioning of the combined
cycle plant at Trombay, TEC earned a clear profit well in excess of the permissible return.
Consequently, it appropriated some of the excess profit to the tariffs and dividends control
reserve, retained the permissible excess and set aside another portion to be refunded to consumers
in 1995/96. Higher profits enabled TEC to build up their statutory reserves at a faster pace. In
particular, the companies appropriated in advance to the debenture redemption reserve and to the
project cost reserve in 1993/94 and 1994/95.
During implementation of the Project, TEC identified various other expansion projects
involving capital expenditures of about Rs. 30 billion. In anticipation of their implementation, the
companies initiated a program to mobilize financing resources, essentially in the form of equity
funds as against debt financing envisaged earlier. A rights issue of Rs. 375 crores took place in
1993/94 and 1994/95. Global depositary rights (GDR), of a combined value of US$75 million,
were issued in February 1994. As the projects were not implemented right away, the funds
mobilized were invested in short-term securities. The income derived therefrom had not been
projected at time of appraisal and accounts for a significant share of the profits derived in the
latter part of the implementation of the Project.

ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
Bhira Pumped Storage Scheme: The Bhira PS Scheme involved upgrading and expansion
of existing facilities. The Mulshi Lake reservoir served as the head pond, while the pickup pond
was conveniently used as the tail pond. There was no increase in the overflow from the Bhira
dam as a result of the additional pump-turbine unit. Given the project's planned use of the
existing facilities, the construction of the penstock on existing rights-of-way, and marginal
changes in the water level of the reservoir and the pickup pond, the environmental impacts of this
component were minimal.
220 kV Transmission Line: One of the existing 1 10 kV single circuit transmission line
between Bhira and Dharavi was dismantled and replaced by a new 220 kV double circuit line,
using the existing right-of-way. At the Dharavi end, this line was connected to the substation by
an underground cable to avoid any adverse environmental impact and possible resettlement issues.
High voltage transformers were designed to strictly avoid the use of polychlorinated biphenyl
(PCB), a hazardous chemical. Because of the use of the existing right-of-way, an environmental
clearance was not mandated for this component.
Trombay Combined Cycle Scheme: The 180 MW CCGT scheme was technically and
environmentally the most appropriate investment that was intended to use all the available gas as
economically as possible, while still remaining within the environmental limitations imposed by the
Central and State governments. The CCGT plant was based on conventional technology. The
major environmental impact of the CCGT plant is in its exhaust emissions. The exhaust of the gas
turbine, passing through the waste heat recovery boiler, contains oxides of nitrogen (NOJ). The
plant was designed for reduced NO, emissions, not to exceed 50 ppm, and the stack height was
determined based on extensive flue gas dispersion modeling, so that ground level concentrations
remained well within the limits set by the environmental guidelines. With the commissioning of
the CCGT plant, Units 1, 2 and 3 (total capacity 187.5 MW) of the Trombay power station,
funded by earlier Bank loans (First Trombay Thermal and Second Trombay Thermal) were
decommissioned. This resulted in a reduction of the total volume of cooling water discharged to
the sea at elevated temperatures. Modeling studies indicated that a cooling water outlet
temperature of up to 50C above the ambient temperature had no damaging effects on the local
marine environment, because the actual thermal gradient is such that by the time the cooling water
gets to the sea, its temperature is just about 1°C above the sea water temperature. Demineralized
water needed for this plant is drawn from the existing plant and the effluent are treated to
acceptable standards before being discharged into the sea.
Additional FGD Scrubber for Trombay Unit 5: The FGD Scrubber is identical to the first
FGD stream, which has been operating satisfactorily since 1988, and consistently removing SO. in
excess of 85%. The additional FGD unit was necessitated by the deteriorating quality of coal
used at the Trombay power station as fuel. The performance of the additional FGD train,
specifically in terms of SO, removal efficiency, is satisfactory.

Fly Ash Utilization: At the time environmental clearance was given for the project,
GOI/GOM mandated that TEC must install a fly ash utilization plant to reduce the environmental
impacts of the fly ash discharged by Trombay Unit 5 of 500 MW capacity. Accordingly, TEC
installed a Fly Ash Aggregate Plant of 200,000 t/annum capacity to produce cold-bonded light
weight aggregates.. Although this unit was not part of the Project, all the components of the
project were designed to comply with GOI and GOM as well as the applicable environmental
policies and guidelines of the World Bank. This plant is already in successful operation. The light
weight aggregates are being used for civil works at Trombay and other divisions of TEC for
making roads, pavements, concrete blocks, etc. The plant is environment-friendly, easy to
operate and there is a tremendous interest to replicate the plant for other utilities in India.
