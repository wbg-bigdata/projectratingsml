                   Section on current assets (stores, spare

                   quire all other necessary parties to
                   take all necessary steps to ensure that
                   all liens, including the Existing Liens,
                   outstanding upon the assets and all
                   liens upon such assets to be created
                   under this Section 5.02 shall be dis-
                   charged or be varied to the reasonable

Bank, convert the equitable mortgage to be created in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section, into a
legal mortgage in English form by way of a Trust Deed in
favor of such trustees and in such form as the Bank may
reasonably require to constitute by way of security for
the Loan substantially in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.02.  To this end, the
Borrowers shall execute in favor of the Bank an irrevoca-
ble power of attorney authorizing the Bank,  inter alia,

      Section 5.03. Except as the Bank may otherwise
agree, if the Borrowers or any one of them shall directly
or indirectly pay or otherwise settle for a consider-
ation, before maturity, part or all of any outstanding
secured debt, the Borrowers or any of the Borrowers, as
the case may be, shall repay a proportionate part, or
all, as the case may be, of the Loan.
      Section 5.04. (a) Except as the Bank shall otherwise
agree, the Borrowers shall not incur any debt, if after
the incurrence of such debt the aggregate principal
amount of debt of each Borrower then incurred and
outstanding would be greater than 2.0 times the equity of
such Borrower.  For the purposes of this Section:
      (i)   The term "debt" means any indebtedness of the
            Borrowers maturing by its terms more than one
            year after the date on which it is originally
            incurred.
      (ii)  Debt shall be deemed to be incurred: (A) under
            a loan contract or agreement or other instru-
            ment providing for such debt or for the modi-
            fication of its terms of payment, on the date
            of such contract, agreement or instrument; and
            (B) under a guarantee agreement, on the date
            the agreement providing for such guarantee has
            been entered into but only to the extent that
            the guaranteed debt is outstanding.
      (iii)        The term "equity of the Borrower" means
                   the sum of the total unimpaired paid-up
                   capital, retained earnings and reserves
                   of each Borrower not allocated to cover
                   specific liabilities.
      (iv)  Whenever for the purposes of this Section it
            shall be necessary to value, in terms of the
            currency of the Guarantor, debt payable in
            another currency, such valuation shall be made
            on the basis of the prevailing lawful rate of
            exchange at which such other currency is, at
            the time of such valuation, obtainable for the
            purposes of servicing such debt, or, in the
            absence of such rate, on the basis of a rate
            of exchange acceptable to the Bank.
      (b)   The Borrowers shall, by December 31 of each
year, furnish to the Bank their financial projections
covering their current and next four financial years
projected performance.

made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrowers shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrowers, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrowers shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special Ac-
                   count, the Borrowers shall furnish to
                   the Bank requests for deposits into the
                   Special Account at such intervals as the
                   Bank shall specify.
            (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such
                   request, the Borrowers shall furnish to
                   the Bank the documents and other evi-

                   such request, the Bank shall, on behalf
                   of the Borrowers, withdraw from the Loan
                   Account and deposit into the Special

documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrowers directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General Condi-
tions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agree-
ment; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories, less the amount of
any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent
of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrowers.  Such
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.

that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made
for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrowers
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide
such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall
so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrowers have provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrowers shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
      (c)   The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
