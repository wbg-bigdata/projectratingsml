1.     The closing date for the GEF Grant Tunisia – Energy Efficiency
Program/Industrial Sector, P078131, TF54398, will be extended from December 31,
2010 until September 30, 2011. This will be the second extension: the original closing
date was December 31, 2009, and a first one year extension was granted in July 2009.

2.     Audit reports for the project are up to date. The latest audit report has been
recognized by the Bank as acceptable. The Bank has requested for the refund of ineligible
expenditures (totaling USD 757), and the PIU has agreed to refund this amount. Another
minor issue regarding procurement was addressed as well by the PIU.

3.    The Grant was approved on November 4, 2004, and became effective on
December 13, 2004. Its amount is USD 8.5 million. The project consists of the following
components:
   • Component 1 provides an additional subsidy (“surprime?) to what is offered by
      the National Energy Fund (budget: USD 2.5 million);
   • Component 2 provides a guarantee for investments made by industrial companies
      under a contract with an Energy Service Company (ESCO). The budget includes
      USD 3.725 million for guarantees and USD 0.275 million as fees for Sotugar,
      who is managing the guarantee fund which has been set up;
   • Component 3 is for technical assistance (TA, budget: USD 2 million).

4.      As disbursement was very slow for the first years of implementation of the
project, the Tunisian government requested an extension in May 2009. It was granted by
the World Bank on July 23, 2009, while an action plan was being developed to accelerate
disbursement.

5.     A reallocation of funds also took place in July 2010, totaling USD 625,000 (USD
500,000 as per unallocated funds in the Grant Agreement, USD 125,000 from Sotugar
fees, which were overestimated in the initial allocation). USD 225,000 were reallocated
to the guarantee and USD 400,000 to the TA, leading to the current budgets of USD
3.725 million and USD 2 million, respectively.

6.      The action plan mostly consisted in using funds available under Component 3 to
assist participating industrial companies in implementing their energy conservation plans
more rapidly, and in preparing their application to collect subsidies (Component 1). A
mission was also launched to assess and adapt the ESCO contract system, in order to
accelerate disbursement of Component 2. This plan was implemented during 2010.

7.      Thanks to the action plan and to its successful implementation by the PIU, the
project’s activity has significantly accelerated throughout 2010. The guarantee
component will probably be disbursed by 12/31/2010. However, the “surprime? and TA
budgets will not be fully disbursed, as shown by the following table:

 Cumulative ‘000 USD and             2008           2009        2010 Q1-3       2010 Q4
 disbursement/budget (%)                                                       (estimate)

 Component 2 (Sotugar fee)            115            187           213            275
                                     42%            68%           77%            100%
 Component 3 (TA)                     958           1 120         1 261          1 521
                                     48%            56%           63%             76%
 Total                               2 432          3 085         5 633          7 259
                                     29%            36%           66%             85%

8.      Regarding the TA, since the reallocation of funds only took place in July 2010,
there was too little time to fully spend the reallocated funds before the end of the year.
However, the commitment rate of Component 3 should reach close to 100% by
December 31, and most of the undisbursed budget is expected to be spent during the first
quarter of 2011.

9.      Regarding the “surprime?, the commitment rate has reached 100%. Disbursement
rose from 26% at the end of 2009 to 53% at the end of September 2010, and should reach
70% at the end of December. This is still relatively modest; it can be explained by the
low disbursement rate until end 2009, and the time needed to fully implement eligible
investments (about 2 year average).

10.     The action plan that was decided in 2009 to accelerate disbursement is still active,
and will be continued using part of the remaining TA funds. The procurement plan has
been updated accordingly during the last supervision mission. It includes additional
assistance activities to help disburse Component 1 (while assistance to Component 2 will
continue until full disbursement of the budget). The PIU believes that about half of the
undisbursed funds under Component 1 will be disbursed during the first quarter of 2011.
The remaining funds, i.e. about USD 400,000, would require another quarter to be fully
disbursed.

11.     Based on these considerations, on the favorable disbursement rate over the last
year and on the fact that the extension conditions mentioned in paragraph 3 of OP 13.30
are met, the WB team recommends that the project is given a second and last extension of
9 months. The WB team and the PIU believe that 6 months will probably be enough to
disburse all remaining funds. However, the team believes it would be reasonable to keep
a 3 month margin beyond these 6 months, due to the intrinsic uncertainty of all industrial
projects, in order to ensure full disbursement of funds.
