I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The early 2000s were a turning point for Tunisia’s economy. The country had
become a net importer of energy due to the depletion of its oil reserves and a fast-
growing domestic demand. Energy intensity was with almost 0.4 toe/US$1,000 of GDP
significantly higher than European countries or some of its neighbors. 1 Tunisia was also
more and more under pressure to improving the competitiveness of its export industries
against the background of increasingly lower cost production in Asia. Reinforcing energy
efficiency performance in Tunisia’s industrial sector seemed key to changing this trend as
the sector used 36% of final energy. Reduced energy use in the industrial sector would
enable reaping a double dividend: (i) reduced cost of production, thus rendering the
industrial sector more competitive; and (ii) enhanced environmental performance of the
sector mainly by mitigating climate change.

2.      In May 2001, the Government of Tunisia (GoT) adopted an aggressive strategy
including twenty presidential decisions aimed at enhancing energy efficiency. To put
these activities into action, supplementary institutional reform was pursued: the handing
down of the main responsibility for energy efficiency measures from Tunisia’s energy
efficiency agency, the "Agence Nationale pour la Maîtrise de l'Energie" (ANME) to the
Ministry of Industry in the late nineties had not led to sizeable results in energy use
patterns. In 1996 Tunisia had instituted a competitiveness enhancement program for its
domestic industries, which was based at the Ministry of Industry, the "Programme de
Mise-à-Niveau? (PMN). The program did not prove effective in supporting the
development of energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector, arguably because the
Ministry of Industry did not dispose of in-house technical capacity to guide companies in
their investments pertaining to energy efficiency. Meanwhile ANME continued to
provide the industry with mandatory energy audits. 2 While the energy audits indicated
significant energy saving potentials, these were not translated into actual investments as
ANME lacked the financial backing to assist companies in undertaking these.

3.      Following the reforms in 2001, the responsibility for energy efficiency in the
industrial sector was transferred back to ANME, as ANME was again placed under the
authority of the Ministry of Industry and Energy in 2003. This opened a window of
opportunity for ANME to also directly provide financial subsidies to industry. At the
same time, a successful GEF financed program to encourage solar water heaters
(P005589), that was financed through the World Bank, was about to conclude. The GoT
and the World Bank began to exchange on how a follow-up GEF-financed program could
support energy efficiency in Tunisia’s energy sector. The development of the program
drew from recent lessons of experience elsewhere, including from Canada, Hungary,
Poland and Romania.




1
  Morocco’s energy intensity of GDP was 0.29 toe/US$1,000, Germany’s was 0.18 toe/US$1,000, and
France’s was 0.19 toe/US$1,000.
2
  In the industrial sector, 320 large industries, out of 6,000, consuming more than 75% of the industrial
sector energy consumption are mandated by law to conduct regular energy audits.
                                                   1
4.      The result of these discussions was the present project, which aimed at supporting
the interrelated goals of enhancing Tunisia’s competitiveness and combating climate
change.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

5.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) states that the project development
objective (PDO) was to “overcome barriers to the development of a sustainable market
for energy efficiency products. In addition to the removal of institutional and capacity-
related barriers, the project aim[ed] to establish energy service companies (ESCOs) as the
main vehicle to guarantee a sustainable energy efficiency market.? However, the PDO as
expressed in Schedule 2 of the Grant Agreement for the project is different and states that
“The objective of the Project is to facilitate the development of a sustainable market of
energy sub-projects through: (i) the removal of institutional and capacity-related barriers;
and (ii) the establishment of energy service companies.?

6.      The project’s global environmental objective (GEO) as expressed in the PAD was
“to achieve a deeper penetration of sustainable commercial energy efficiency investment
activities in Tunisia’s industrial sector, by removing barriers and lowering transaction
costs.?

7.      While it is common for the PDO and GEO to be different, especially if the GEO
refers to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (which is not the case here), the PDOs in
both PAD and the Grant Agreement should always be the same. The PDOs of both PAD
and Grant Agreement do furthermore not refer to Tunisia’s industrial sector alone and
therefore could be interpreted as meaning to cover all energy-using sectors in Tunisia. As
such, the GEO appears to be the most precise of the objectives.

8.      In addition, the PDO and GEO include side sentences explaining how the
objectives are to be met, including a reference to “by? [means of]. These additives should
not be part of an objective as they refer to the means by which the objectives are to be
met. The matter is further complicated as these “by? [means of] statements are not picked
up as part of the outcome indicators, leaving considerable uncertainty about how they are
to be measured.

9.     The “Outcome/Impact? indicators presented in the PAD against which the
Government of Tunisia and the World Bank agreed to measure the project performance
included:

   1. Establishment of a sustainable energy efficiency market for Tunisia’s industry;
   2. Long-run greenhouse gas emissions reductions; and
   3. Increased gross investment in energy efficiency in Tunisia’s industry of US$25
      million for the five-year implementation period of the project.

10.     It should be noted that the main body of the PAD only refers to outcome/impact
indicators 1 and 3, while in Annex 1 of the PAD 1 and 2 are being referred to as GEO
indicators, and 3 is a Outcome/Impact indicator. Output indicators, which in mid-2012
are commonly referred to as Intermediate Outcome Indicators, by component and as
stated in the results framework of the PAD, are presented in Annex 2.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
11.     The objective and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.    The project targeted private Tunisian companies in the industrial sector that spend
more than US$150,000 per year on energy costs.

1.5 Original Components

13.      The project was designed to provide incentives to energy investments in Tunisia’s
industrial sector by (i) providing additional subsidies; (ii) by guaranteeing energy
efficiency investments to ensure their bankability; and (iii) by providing technical
assistance to improve the understanding of all stakeholders (companies, financial
institutions, government ministries and agencies, and technical centers) on how such
investments could be made.

Component 1 – GEF Pilot Phase for Energy Efficiency (US$ 2.5 million)

14.     This component aimed at developing energy efficiency projects in the industrial
sector by administering an output-based subsidy, which would be paid once energy
efficiency measures were implemented. Before the GEF project started off, the Ministry
of Industry already administered a subsidy for energy efficiency in the amount of 13% of
the underlying investment through its competitiveness fund, the "Fonds de
Développement de la Compétitivité Industrielle" (FODEC). Within the Ministry of
Industry, this subsidy was administered by a department in charge of enhancing
competitiveness of Tunisia’s industries, the "Bureau de Mise-à-Niveau (BMN). By 2004,
FODEC had received 1,202 applications from industrial companies containing measures
to improve their competitiveness, but none of them included energy efficiency projects.
This was initially surprising to stakeholders, as FODEC funding had been successful in
attracting other types of competitiveness-enhancement projects. The overall assessment
was that the BMN at the Ministry of Industry did not have the required technical know-
how to support decisions by companies in energy efficiency investments.

15.    In order to involve the one institution in Tunisia with the required know-how in
energy efficiency investments, the GEF project proposed an additional 10% subsidy to be
administered by Tunisia’s Energy Efficiency Agency, the Agence Nationale pour la
Maîtrise de l’Energie (ANME), bringing the total financial incentive to 23%. The level of
the additional incentive was derived from a market analysis 3 and targeted efficiency
measures for production processes and systems management such as condensate recovery,
pipe insulation, and boiler optimization. The subsidy of ANME under this component
was implemented by a new Project Implementation Unit (PIU), staffed with ANME
employees and located at ANME's premises, in close coordination with the BMN.


3
 A higher subsidy level, e.g. 15%, would have brought the total subsidy for energy efficiency projects
closer to 30%, i.e. FODEC + PEEI. This level of subsidy was considered too high considering the solar
water heater experience, which disbursed a similar level of subsidy one year ahead of schedule (World
Bank, Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Report N° 28045-TUN, page 9)
                                                  3
16.    As part of the administration process for the eligibility of the 10% subsidy,
companies had to sign a framework contract, the "contrat-programme" (CP) 4 with ANME
to benefit from the GEF project’s subsidy and the 70% subsidy for energy audits that was
also administered by ANME.

17.     A framework program (CP) contained an action plan over three years to
implement an energy efficiency project. The selected company was given the choice to
implement the project alone or with the assistance of an ESCO. In the latter case, the
industrial company and the ESCO had to sign a performance contract, the "contrat de
performance énergétique" (CPE), in which the ESCO guaranteed the energy savings. A
CPE is a turnkey contract providing all the services required to design and implement an
energy efficiency project at the client's facility. The idea was that if the guaranteed level
of savings was not realized, the ESCO would have to pay for the difference. This risk to
ESCOs was mitigated during project implementation as ESCOs revenue structure had a
large fixed fee and only a small variable fee subject to actual energy savings.

Component 2 – GEF Partial Guarantee Fund (US$4 million)

18.     This component aimed at promoting the use of energy service companies
(ESCOs) by giving them access to guarantees. For any given energy efficiency
investment project, the ESCO would receive a 75% guarantee for their bank loans (up to
a maximum of US$200,000). These guarantees were administered through a guarantee
fund of US$4 million hosted by the "Société Tunisienne de Garantie" (SOTUGAR). 5 The
ESCOs were expected to pre-finance the entire project, including the investment costs.
This is also otherwise being referred to as the "full-service ESCO model" in Tunisia.

19.     During project negotiations the representatives of the Government of Tunisia
requested that the guarantee facility also be directly accessible to the eligible companies
themselves and the commercial banks. The Government felt that in the context of Tunisia,
these entities would be better placed in making the investments for the physical
equipment than the ESCOs, which at that point in time did not yet exist. While this was
reflected in the grant agreement, it was not reflected in the PAD, introducing thus another
inconsistency between the Grant Agreement and the PAD.

Component 3 – GEF Technical Assistance (US$ 2 million)

20.    This component aimed at reinforcing the technical capacity of key stakeholders to
encourage energy efficiency investments. Component 3 was intended to support
awareness campaigns and training activities for industries, while focusing on improving

  First, industrial companies submitted their energy efficiency project proposals to ANME for review. A
technical consultative commission was given the task of evaluating the proposals according to the
eligibility criteria of the PEEI and other subsidies managed by ANME. PIU staff had a key role in the
technical consultative commission. ANME’s Department of Juridical Affairs prepared then a draft CP
based on the assessment of the technical consultative commission. After approval by the Ministry of
Industry, the CP was signed by ANME and the industrial company. Subsidies were only disbursed after
implementation of energy efficiency projects.

and engineering firms. It also financed the establishment of a PIU.

1.6 Revised Components

21.     While there was no formal restructuring of the project components, at two points
in time significant changes were affected to the overall program: (i) in 2005 the
Government of Tunisia changed the FODEC, implicitly affecting Component 1; and (ii)
in 2007 at mid-term review the financial intermediation mechanisms of Component 1 and
2 were fine-tuned to respond to the lack of ESCO participation in the actual energy
efficiency investments.

22.    One of the changes affected during the mid-term review would have required an
amendment to the Grant Agreement. However, no such amendment was prepared. The
operational manual of the project was also not updated following the above changes.

Component 1 – GEF Pilot Phase for Energy Efficiency

23.     Changes to the FODEC (2005): The Government of Tunisia realized that it was
preferable for subsidies for energy efficiency to be administered by the ANME as the
body responsible for energy efficiency rather than the Ministry of Industry, because
ANME had the technical energy efficiency know-how. It was therefore decided to
replace the 13% FODEC subsidy by a new and augmented 20% subsidy to be
administered by a newly created national energy efficiency fund, the Fonds National pour
la Maîtrise de l’Energie (FNME), based at the ANME. As previously, ESCOs did not
have direct access to this subsidy. This change consolidated ANME as the one-stop shop
for energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector. Following the consolidation of the
two subsidy schemes within ANME, the approval processes were fully coordinated. For
example, the project implementation unit (PIU) for the GEF project at ANME
participated in the approval process of the FNME investment subsidy.

24.     Changes at mid-term review (2007): To facilitate the participation of those
ESCOs in the program that would take on the actual investment risk (as opposed to
playing only an advisory role), two modifications were introduced: (i) the GEF subsidy
available to these types of full service ESCOs was increased from 10% to 20%; and (ii) a
dedicated credit line for ESCOs, which offered an interest free loan for 15% of the
investment costs was introduced. Measure (i) should have resulted in an amendment of
the Grant Agreement (as per Schedule 2, Part A2). None of these measures were actually
used. Measure (ii), which was never used, should have been subject to review of
compliance with OP.8.30.

Component 2 – GEF Partial Guarantee Fund

25.    Changes at mid-term review (2007): The three changes to Component 2 were as
follows: (i) the guarantee period was extended from 3 to 5 years to bring it in line with
Tunisian banking practices; (ii) the cap on the investments that could be guaranteed was
increased from US$200,000 to US$400,000 reflecting the larger size of potential
investment projects as anticipated at project appraisal; and (iii) an additional guarantee
was introduced to cover any payments due to the ESCOs from industry. (iii) was again

                                            5
indirectly trying to support direct investments by ESCOs in equipment, by making them
implicitly more credit-worthy.

Despite these additional measures, ESCOs could not obtain credit for financing energy
efficiency investments from commercial banks, because they were unable to address the
fundamental barrier for ESCOs to obtain commercial bank loans for these investments.
This was their small balance sheet with respect to the investments required. Therefore,
the "full-service ESCO model" did not emerge. 6

26.     Component 3 - GEF Technical Assistance - none

1.7 Other significant changes

27.    Closing Date Extensions: The closing date of the project was extended three
times. The original closing date was December 31, 2009. A first extension was granted
until December 31, 2010, a second extension until September 30, 2011 and a third
extension until November 30, 2011. The main reason behind these changes was the slow
disbursement of the project during the first years of implementation. However,
disbursements accelerated in 2010 and 2011 because, due to the output-based nature of
the subsidy, Component 1 was slow to disburse.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.      The choice of project scope was well aligned with Tunisia’s goal in relation to
energy efficiency, which was to reduce total energy consumption by 1.25 million toe over
the period 2005-2008. 7 The industrial sector was the appropriate sector to be targeted due
to its high potential for energy savings.

29.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) 8 adequately identified the main obstacles
for increasing energy efficiency investments in Tunisia’s industrial sector, namely the
lack of: (i) a consistent institutional framework, (ii) available commercial financing, (iii)
sufficient information on energy efficiency for industrial companies, and (iv) adequate
technical expertise in the country. However, the project design itself was complex and
focused on establishing ESCOs as the main drivers for energy efficiency investments
without arguably directly targeting all of the identified barriers.

30.     Complex project design: Rather than focusing on a single new financial
intermediation instrument such as for example the successful GEF Romania Energy
Efficiency project (P068062), the project proposed two financial intermediation
mechanisms through components 1 and 2, which applied differently to different
stakeholders (industry and ESCOs), and which linked different institutions (ANME,
Ministry of Industry). Given that the notion of comprehensive energy efficiency

  Despite the fact that the PAD did not consider a guarantee for industrial companies, the Trust Fund Grant
Agreement dated December 13 2004 includes this possibility.

investments in the industrial sector was new to Tunisia, the level of complexity of project
design must have been confusing for potential beneficiaries. Moreover, no formal
mechanism was established as part of the project design to regularly consult with
stakeholders. This rendered the comprehension of the project even more difficult.

31.     Use of “full service? ESCOs: ESCOs were supposed to engage in investing in
energy efficiency measures as a major vehicle for meeting the project’s development
objective (PDO), corresponding to the notion of “full service ESCOs.? The project design
was based on a feasibility study undertaken by a Canadian consulting firm during project
preparation. This consulting firm owned the only existing ESCO in Tunisia at appraisal
and therefore arguably had an inherent potential conflict of interest of recommending the
use of ESCOs as a major vehicle for project implementation. Interestingly, this ESCO
ceased its activities shortly after the GEF project started up, as a result of high transaction
costs and difficulties in developing a strong pipeline of sufficiently large energy
efficiency projects in Tunisia.

32.     Clearly, the complexity of setting up a suitable framework for the development of
the "full-service ESCO" model 9 was underestimated. Despite Tunisia’s Presidential
Decision No. 8 of May 3 2001, which mandated the development of an ESCO market,
and the Ministerial Order of December 4, 2004 regulating ESCO activities, there was no
legislation regulating the transfer of equipment ownership from ESCOs to industrial
companies and none was foreseen as part of project preparation. This was, however, key
for the proposed ESCO model under the GEF project. Furthermore, the project design
could have benefited from a more in-depth analysis of previous experiences in
implementing similar projects. In light of the past experience as reviewed by the World
Bank (2004) 10 the focus on the “full-service ESCO? model would have arguably not
sufficiently been justified.

33.     Assessment of risks: The PAD identified most of the critical risks. However, it
underestimated the behavior and business practices of some key stakeholders, e.g. local
banks and industrial companies. Also, the PAD did not anticipate some of the important
risks that did materialize such as the lack of initial confidence from industrial companies
in ESCOs due the fear of intrusion of ESCOs into their core business. The acceptance of
the use of ESCOs required a trust-building process between Tunisian industrial
companies and ESCOs engineering professionals, who had to get involved in the
industry’s highly-sensitive production processes. ESCOs, with PIU support, therefore had
the challenge of demonstrating the value of their new services to industrial companies


9
  The model described in the PAD corresponds to the “full-service ESCO" model. However, the ESCOs
that were developed by the project followed another business model with lower risks. A "guaranteed
savings" model approach, where the industrial company provided the financing for the energy efficiency
project was prioritized. In this model, the ESCO generally guarantees that energy savings are sufficient to
cover debt service payments. In Tunisia, though, ESCOs guaranteed energy savings were disconnected
from the industrial company's debt service payments. Hence, ESCOs worked as technical consultants with
performance-based payments.
10
   A review of GEF projects published at the time of appraisal states for example that “ESCOs have been
widely accepted by the Bank as an attractive business model for bridging the gap between end-users and
financing […].Despite these promising attributes, creating strong and credible ESCOs, not to mention full
ESCO markets, has proven very challenging. Client countries often lack the legal and financial
infrastructure to adapt to and support such business models.? World Bank, GEF Energy Efficiency
Portfolio Review and Practitioners’ Handbook, January 21 2004
                                                    7
and banks. 11 This process inevitably had to take time and was partially responsible for the
disbursement delays during implementation.

2.2 Implementation

34.    The challenges in implementing the GEF program rested with (i) getting the
program sufficiently quickly underway by adding energy efficiency sub-projects; and (ii)
making the ESCO model work.

35.     Creating and implementing the energy efficiency sub-project pipeline: while new
energy efficiency sub-projects were continuously added to the GEF program, the
project’s implementation was characterized by slow disbursements during its original five
years (Dec. 2004-Dec 2009). Disbursements of Component 1 (“Pilot phase?) were only at
22% by mid-2009, while 55% were committed. A significant acceleration of
disbursements took place in the last two supplementary years (Dec 2009-Nov 2011),
following three extensions. This disbursement pattern was due to the initial lead time
necessary for implementing the energy efficiency sub-projects 12 and for allowing
stakeholders to get more familiar with the ESCO concept.

36.    Moreover, there was a lag of between two to three years from framework program
(CP) approval at the level of ANME until the effective disbursement of the GEF subsidy
under component 1 happened. As a reminder, the GEF subsidy was only disbursed once
the energy efficiency equipment was put in place.

37.     The main reason for the acceleration of the disbursements in 2010 and 2011 was
the successful implementation of an action plan by ANME in 2009 that provided support
to accelerate disbursements of Component 1. This plan consisted mostly in using
available funds under Component 3 (“Technical Assistance?) to assist participating
industrial companies in implementing their energy conservation plans more rapidly and
in preparing their application to collect subsidies under Component 1. This plan was
successfully implemented through 2010 and 2011, even during the Tunisian Revolution
which only caused a limited slowdown of the project.

38.    Making the ESCO model work: despite all efforts, including those during the mid-
term review described above, the “full-service ESCO? model never worked. Instead,
ANME focused on enlisting engineering consulting companies to provide the necessary
“know-how? for defining the energy efficiency sub-project in industry. ANME was able
to accredit 10 consulting companies as ESCOs whose business model was based on
providing industries with technical assistance in return for performance-based payments.
Of these 10, 4 were able to sign performance-based contracts.




11
  This has been confirmed through selected interviews with stakeholders in February and March 2012.
12
  Several barriers had to be overcome, e.g. industrial companies’ lack of information on energy efficiency,
industrial companies’ preference to replace their outdated manufacturing process rather than invest in
energy efficiency, lack of project financing, etc.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.     M&E design: An appropriate Monitoring & Evaluation framework was designed
as described in Annex 14 of the PAD. 13 The framework described the functions required
to collect sub-project level indicators and aggregate them into project-level indicators to
track progress towards outcome indicators.

40.     M&E implementation: The PIU at ANME used its own engineers to undertake
M&E, not a consultant as described in the PAD for Monitoring & Evaluation. The PIU
only hired a consultant to perform an evaluation of the performance of a sample of
twenty-six framework contracts with industry (CPs). The Monitoring & Evaluation
framework was implemented satisfactorily by the PIU during the project. The PIU
effectively verified each energy efficiency investment 14 through on-site visits to
companies before releasing the claimed project subsidy. However, the PIU did not use
the International Measurement and Verification Protocol 15 for verifying the energy
savings. The energy savings data are therefore not verified in accordance with such a
protocol but can be considered reliable because of the high technical expertise of ESCOs
and PIU engineers as well as the PIU’s proactive monitoring of each energy efficiency
sub-project benefiting from the project’s subsidies. The data on CO2 emissions reductions
was calculated using the following the formula: ∑ (energy savings by fuel type) times
(carbon content of fuel (tCO2/toe)) 16.

41.    M&E utilization: During project implementation, available information was used
appropriately to track progress towards achievement of project’s objectives. Available
data was used for drafting a high-quality mid-term review report, 17 which made several
recommendations to improve the project performance. Most of these were adopted by the
PIU at ANME. Available information from sub-projects was also correctly used to report
data for the project’s performance indicators monitoring in the twelve Aide Memoires
and in the seventeen implementation status and results report filed by the Bank’s team
from December 2004 until December 2011.

14
   The energy efficiency actions identified in Tunisian industry are divided in four types: a) adoption of
more efficient heating equipment, i.e. boilers, furnaces, heat exchangers, b) recovery and use of gas, heat
and residual pressure, c) installation of high performance mechanical and electrical equipment, i.e. motors,
pumps, ventilation and heating equipment, d) optimization of production systems to reduce energy
consumptions
15
   The PIU held several workshops with stakeholders to discuss this issue. Annex 14 of the PAD stated that
“savings would be recorded in accordance with the standards set by the International Measurement and
Verification Protocol?. The PIU plans to develop the measurement protocol in future projects with the
participation of key stakeholders.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.     There were no deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguards and fiduciary
policies and procedures during project implementation. ANME regularly prepared the
required reports.

43.    Environment: The environmental category of the project at the time of appraisal
was C. Thus, the project did not require an environmental and social assessment. The
PAD nevertheless mentioned that some non-significant impacts could be expected, such
as temporary dust and noise emissions due to replacement of materials and equipments
during construction, as well as disposal and de-contamination issues. The PIU monitored
energy efficiency sub-projects after construction only, but did not report any significant
impacts in this regard.

44.     Financial Management: The financial management system in place was
satisfactory and in accordance with Bank procedures. The action plan for financial
management as reflected in the Operations Manual (2004) was implemented satisfactorily
by the PIU/ANME and SOTUGAR by January 2005. 18 By then, the PIU was staffed with
one financial management specialist. The accounting software was adequate. For
example, in 2005 ANME purchased Oracle 9i to ensure high accounting standards were
maintained. The PIU/ANME also produced the regular financial monitoring reports
required by the Bank for the PEEI project in a timely manner. 19

45.     Disbursement: The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$ 31.8 (US$ 8.5
million from the GEF). The actual project cost totaled US$ 36.1, of which US$8.4 was
from the GEF (see Table 3, Annex 3). The total disbursement for the project as of April 9
2012 was 99.7% of the GEF grant (0.3% of undisbursed funds under the technical
assistance component).

46.     Procurement: The PIU at ANME was staffed with one procurement specialist
knowledgeable with Bank’s procedures. After each supervision mission, the procurement
plan was updated by the PIU. The performance of the PIU on procurement was
satisfactory during project implementation. 20

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47.     The project was conceived to provide support to the Government’s efforts to
reduce energy intensity, contribute to climate change mitigation and increase the
competitiveness of the industrial sector. The project mobilized around 40% of the total
potential of investments in energy efficiency in the industrial sector estimated in 2002.
Hence, the project was able to realize a significant share of Tunisia’s market potential.
The ANME and the PIU had succeeded in signing 566 framework contracts (CPs) 21 with

21
   Contract-Programs (CPs) had increased from 550 by November 2011 to 566 by March 2012.The
signature of a CP is a condition for industrial companies for accessing to EE subsidies from the PEEI
                                                   10
companies (up from 0 CPs in existence in 2003) and in attracting around US$164
million22 worth of investments in energy efficiency projects from 2005 to April 2011. 70
percent of the signed framework contracts were realized. The project contributed to about
one-fifth of these contract-programs (116 contract-programs signed) and around one-
fourth of these investments through Components 1 and 2 (US$ 36.1 million). The
technical assistance (Component 3) was critical in building the necessary local capacity
and providing support to industrial companies for signing the remaining framework
programs (CP).

48.     Following project closing, ANME has a pipeline of 240 energy efficiency projects
of which 40 have signed a framework contract (CP). These projects will benefit from the
FNME subsidy. This suggests that despite the decrease in overall subsidy, there remains a
strong interest by industry in undertaking energy efficiency investments.

49.      The GEF Partial Guarantee Fund (Component 2) could not cover ESCOs loans as
planned due to their impossibility of obtaining credit from local commercial banks.
Instead, the guarantee was used to cover the loans from industrial companies for
implementing energy efficiency projects. The use of an ESCO was a condition for
benefiting of the guarantee. Therefore, the guarantee fund succeeded in incentivizing
thirty industrial companies to use the services of four ESCO companies accredited at the
ANME. 23 The loans were not backed by the energy savings of the project, but by the
assets of the industrial company. Commercial banks still requested substantial collateral
from industrial companies, but the guarantee provided them with a supplementary
assurance.

50.    Key issues for the development and sustainability of energy efficiency projects
following the closure of the project include the following:

    •   The future of the financial intermediation mechanisms to be used needs to be
        reviewed to enable a sustainable pipeline of energy efficiency projects in the
        industrial sector going forward. A priori, the 10% GEF subsidy is depleted, and
        going forward the 20% subsidy of the FNME is presumed to be sufficient to
        generate interest in more projects. The strength of the existing project pipeline at
        ANME, which is at 200 projects, would suggest that the reduction in subsidy has
        not had a negative impact on the development of future energy efficiency
        investments in the industrial sector.

    •   The future use of the guarantee fund is still to be decided. Commonly a decision
        on the use of the guarantee funds should have been made with concurrence by the
        Bank before project closure, especially as the existing funds could be used to help
        sustain the results obtained under the project. It is estimated that six loans from
        industrial companies benefiting from the guarantee under the Partial Guarantee
        Fund to implement energy efficiency sub-projects through ESCOs have been


project or the government (FNME), i.e. 70% subsidy on non-tangible investments with ceiling at 70,000
TND and 20% of tangible investments with ceiling at 250,000 TND.

   Ten companies, mostly consulting companies, were previously accredited by the ANME as ESCOs as
defined by Tunisia law. However, only four have been active in the market and signed energy performance
contracts with industrial companies: CRA2E, Partners, 3E and BCE.
                                                  11
         repaid at project closing. The total amount covered by the guarantee of the six
         loans has been around US$ 653,327. Put differently, it is estimated that the Partial
         Guarantee Fund had around US$ 653,327 of uncommitted funds at closing. It is
         unclear why no provisions for the future of the fund were finalized before project
         closing.

     •   A measurement and verification protocol was developed by project closing, which
         ANME plans to use in future energy efficiency projects. This should enhance the
         confidence between industry, ESCOs and commercial banks. Moreover, ANME's
         management intends to transform its "energy efficiency in the industrial sector"
         unit, including the PIU, into a higher-level direction in its organization chart. In
         conclusion, the outcomes of the PEEI project represent a first step in the right
         direction for the development of energy efficiency projects in Tunisia, but a
         strategic plan for sustaining its results is needed.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     Relevance is rated as substantial because: (i) the objective of the GEF project
continues to be highly relevant to the country’s current development priorities and the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 24; and (ii) the design and implementation could have
been improved by simplifying the design of the project and focusing less on “full service?
ESCOs. The project supported activities were relevant to two of the three pillars of the
CPS 2010-2013, i.e. (i) employment, growth and competitiveness, and (ii) sustainable
development and climate change. The project allowed participating companies to
improve their competitiveness by reducing their energy bill by 20-30%. 25 The project
also contributed to the CPS objective of promoting energy efficiency and renewable
energy26 by increasing local investments in energy efficiency by US$ 27.6 million (from
a baseline close to zero) and avoiding 710,333 tons of CO2 emissions over 2005-2011.

52.     The project had a significant impact in improving local technical capacities to
undertake energy efficiency projects, especially of ESCOs. However, the project fell
short in developing the type of ESCO described in the PAD, i.e. “full service ESCO?,
which assumes that ESCO finances the energy efficiency project. ESCOs could not
develop this function due to their inability to borrow. Tunisian banks did not lend to
ESCOs due to their uncertain credit-worthiness, the absence of adequate regulation and
their lack of knowledge on EE projects.

53.     During mid-term review, several measures were introduced to overcome these
barriers and improve ESCO’s credit-worthiness. But these measures were ineffective and
insufficient to encourage commercial banks to lend to ESCOs. Instead, ESCOs provided
technical consulting services to industrial companies, worth 7% of the total investments

of ESCO-mediated projects, i.e. US$ 32,523 27 on average per contract. The four active
ESCOs in Tunisia, i.e. CRA2E, Partners, 3E and BCE, succeeded in guaranteeing the
energy savings of 30 projects through CPEs. ESCOs performance risk was low due to
the fact that only a small part of ESCOs revenues, as established in the CPE, were
dependent on the actual energy savings.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

54.      Since 1987, Tunisia’s industrial companies have been implementing energy
efficiency projects with Government support through framework programs (CPs). From a
modest start, the number of energy efficiency projects stalled from 1998 to 2003 for
institutional reasons. However, energy efficiency projects increased dramatically since
the start of the PEEI project (see Figure 1, Annex 2). Considering the country’s inactivity
in the energy efficiency sector before the project start, the efficacy in achieving the
Global Environmental Objectives is rated Moderately Satisfactory. From a baseline
close to zero, 116 framework programs (CPs) directly linked to the project were approved
to benefit from the GEF grant, and a total of 566 framework programs (CPs) 28 were
approved to benefit from the FNME subsidy, in large because of support from the project.

55.     Due to the strong integration of the PIU in ANME’s organizational structure, the
project’s technical assistance (Component 3) contributed also to the adoption process of
CPs only eligible to the FNME subsidy and not to the PEEI subsidy (Component 1).
Among the 116 CPs that were eligible for PEEI's project subsidy, only 81 effectively
implemented energy efficiency measures 29.

56.     The 10% additional subsidy offered by the PEEI project for physical investments
(Component 1) complemented the 20% subsidy of the government’s FNME. The PEEI
subsidy has been a useful complement of the larger Government’s incentive scheme for
energy efficiency activities. The leveraging effect of the PEEI subsidy has been 13:1, i.e.
for every dollar disbursed under this component 13 dollars have been mobilized from the
private sector and Government (see Table 2, Annex 3). Moreover, the cost of reducing
one ton of CO2 was US$ 11.9 (see Table 4, Annex 3).

57.     The GEF Partial Guarantee Fund (Component 2) has achieved its performance
indicators, e.g. at least three ESCOs operational, commitment of at least ninety percent of
the funds and at least 30 companies with ESCO-mediated projects, but it has not fulfilled
the purpose stated in the PAD. 30 ESCOs were paid by industrial companies on a



27
   51,625 Tunisian Dinars on average. Exchange rate TND1 = US$0.63 as in PAD.
28
   550 CPs were approved by closing date, November 30 2011. By March 2012, this number increased to
566. The contract-programs signed are composed of: 455 contract-programs related to energy-efficiency
measures, 106 contract-programs related to substitution to natural gas, and 5 related to co-generation.
According to a 70% completion rate, confirmed by the PIU, the number of industrial companies that have
implemented projects as signed in their contract-programs is around 396.
29
   The difference between 116 contract-programs signed and 81 contract-programs effectively implemented
is mainly due financial reasons, e.g. company closing or difficult financial position, encountered by the
industrial company since signature of the contract-program.
30

enhance the development of ESCOs in Tunisia […] In order to minimize risk of default, only ESCOs or
other intermediaries would be eligible for such guarantees?, Project Appraisal Document, Report No:

contractual basis with a large fixed fee and a small variable fee proportional to the
achieved energy savings. Industrial companies paid for the physical investments, e.g.
equipment and machinery, of their energy efficiency projects (US$ 575,953 31 on average).
Two thirds of their investments were paid through credits guaranteed by the Partial
Guarantee Fund. Despite the guarantee, commercial banks still required traditional
collateral to industrial companies. The guarantee only provided a supplementary
insurance to commercial banks for providing credit to energy efficiency projects, which
were rather new to banks’ business portfolio.

58.     The Partial Guarantee Fund, therefore, did not act as a catalyst for ESCOs to
participate in the financing of energy efficiency investments, but as a double guarantee,
on top of the traditional collateral, for industrial companies’ loans. The partial guarantee
fund reassured commercial banks and incentivized lending to industrial companies using
ESCO’s consulting services, i.e. from auditing to equipment installation. The guarantee
might have slightly reduced the amount of collateral required by risk-averse commercial
banks to industrial companies for energy efficiency projects. More importantly, the
Partial Guarantee Fund had a positive impact on the licensed ESCOs technical
capabilities by encouraging ESCO-mediated projects. Energy audits carried out by local
consulting firms before the start of the project were often below international standards of
quality. 32 But performance contracts (CPEs) signed between ESCOs and industrial
companies dramatically improved the quality of the audit reports because it introduced
the necessary professional rigor in monitoring the implementation of energy efficiency
measures to guarantee energy savings.

59.     However, the main driver of energy efficiency investments has been the technical
assistance component of the project (Component 3). This component has allowed the PIU
to launch the necessary energy efficiency awareness campaigns, support industrial
companies throughout the application process of Government subsidies 33 and enhance
confidence among operators in the energy efficiency market. The activities financed by
this component leveraged parallel initiatives that were critical for market development,
e.g. 2005 high energy-consuming industries’ “task force?. 34 The technical assistance also
financed a total of 120 days of training for 400 stakeholders, including Technical Centers,
ESCOs, SOTUGAR, industries and Banks.

   729,042 Tunisian Dinars on average. Please, note the wide range of investments from 32,800 TD
(US$25,912) to 1,758,000 TD (US$ 1,388,820).
32
   Selected interviews with stakeholders in February and March 2012.
33
   Around 53% of the budget allocated to this component was used for training of local stakeholders
(ESCOs, Banks, Technical Centers, SOTUGAR), 17% for training the Project Implementation Unit, 15%
for awareness and dissemination, 10% for implementing project procedures, and 5% for IT and vehicle
purchases.
34
   Following the recommendations of the National Conference on Energy Management (April 2005), the
Ministry of Industry, Energy and SMEs created a working group “High energy-consuming industries Task
Force? in June 2005 (Decision n°319 of June 3 2005) to implement energy efficiency programs to reduce
energy consumption in such industries. The working group was formed by four experts, including M. Néji
Amaimia, former PIU Director.
                                                 14
3.3 Efficiency

60.     Efficiency is rated as substantial. As shown in Annex 3, the project significantly
attracted public and private local investment. For every dollar of the GEF grant disbursed
from components 1 and 2, US$ 4.2 were attracted from local sources (see Table 2, Annex
3) 35. Moreover, project achieved its goals efficiently based on outcome per GEF dollar
invested. Thus, the cost of reducing one tone of CO2 was US$ 11.9.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     Due to the close integration of the project in the existing Tunisian institutions and
policies, it is not possible to clearly evaluate its impact on the expected outcomes.
However, it can be acknowledged that the approval of 566 CPs 36 on energy efficiency in
the country from 2005-2011 would have been difficult to achieve without Components 1
(“Pilot phase?) and Component 3 (“Technical Assistance?) of the project. The significant
pipeline of over 200 energy efficiency projects developed by ANME at project closing37
confirms the sustainability of the project's outcomes despite the lower pipeline of the
World Bank-financed line of credit. 38 The project provided the necessary elements for
scaling-up energy efficiency in the country, but the next steps are uncertain, in particular
the future role of ESCOs as stated in the PAD.

62.     The Partial Guarantee Fund did not fulfill its intended purpose at appraisal, but
incentivized a significant number of industrial companies (30) to use ESCOs for the
implementation of their projects. The improvement in ESCOs’ accountability and
technical competences was underpinned by the project’s technical assistance component.
The transformation of existing local engineering firms into ANME-licensed ESCOs
offering a wider array of consulting services with guaranteed performance built the
required local technical capacity to develop complex projects in the future, such as co-
generation. The development of co-generation, with average investments far larger than
energy efficiency projects, is the main future target of ANME. However, several
obstacles still remain for further developing a sustainable energy efficiency market in
Tunisia, namely regulatory and monitoring and verification.

63.     Thus, the overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory, based on
substantial relevance of objectives, moderately satisfactory achievement of development
objectives and satisfactory efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64.     The project has increased the ESCOs annual turnover by 30% in some cases, 39 but
has not translated in significant additional jobs due to the small size of the projects.
However, the project has created the necessary conditions for the development of larger
projects, where further high-value jobs are likely to be created. With respect to gender
issues, they were not assessed in the PAD nor in the ICR because the design of the
project was considered gender-neutral, i.e. the enabling environment to participate in the
project was equal for men and women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.     The project’s implementation arrangements were simplified because of a change
in the institutional structure after project effectiveness, i.e. the Government’s creation of
a dedicated energy efficiency fund, FNME, in 2005 managed by ANME. From an
original complex project design where an industrial company could request the project
subsidy from two different entities, the Ministry of Industry and ANME, the latter finally
became the only interface with industries on energy efficiency projects.

66.     The ESCOs created by the project guaranteed the estimated energy savings by the
performance contract (CPE), but did not participate in the financing of the project as
stated in the PAD. Ten ESCOs were licensed by ANME as per Tunisian law, 40 but only
four were operational. The PEEI project contributed to diversify and moderately increase
the business of the four ESCOs, which were small engineering firms before obtaining the
ESCO license. The ESCOs operated as technical consultants with performance-based
payments. If the “full-service ESCO? had to be developed in Tunisia as stated in the PAD,
i.e. ESCO financing the EE project, several changes would have been required, including:

      •   Regulatory: mechanisms and legal provisions regulating the ownership transfer of
          equipment from ESCOs to beneficiary and tax advantages for the beneficiary after
          asset transfer.

      •   Monitoring and Verification: establishing of a commonly-agreed monitoring and
          verification protocol, clarification of accounting period of energy efficiency
          measures, clarification of liabilities of the parties in case of disputes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

67.       There are no unintended outcomes and impacts that are measured.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

68.    On June 16 2011, ANME organized, together with all international donors active
in the country, the conference “Towards a competitive energy efficient-industry, key

well as its experience in promoting energy service companies.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

69.     During implementation, several changes were introduced in the project to
strengthen the sustainability of its outcomes, such as additional subsidies for ESCOs,
extension of the guarantee to industrial companies' payments to ESCOs, etc. However,
only some of these measures proved to be effective. The creation of a dedicated fund for
energy efficiency projects in 2005, the FNME, and the implementation of an action plan
by the PIU in 2009 contributed to increase energy efficiency investments. The Tunisian
Revolution of January 2011 had only minor effects in the project’s disbursements, which
had reached 84% on April 30, 2011 41.

70.     Despite these mitigation measures, the risk to development outcome is significant
due to the following:

        •   Technical risk: Before the project, the four active ESCOs were small
            engineering consulting companies. During project implementation, these
            companies could obtain an ESCO license from ANME as stated by law. The
            project supported the transformation of small engineering consulting
            companies focusing on auditing services in ESCOs guaranteeing energy
            savings and specializing in a wider array of services. After the project, though,
            it is uncertain that ESCOs, as described in the PAD, will succeed in becoming
            the main vehicle for a sustainable energy efficiency market in Tunisia. The
            ESCOs financial fragility precludes them from mobilizing large investments
            for energy efficiency projects and they are likely to continue providing
            services as auditors/consulting companies. The Tunisian market is likely to
            force ESCOs to either specialize on highly technical issues, e.g. compressed
            air systems, and/or merge with local or international companies to strengthen
            their balance sheet. The future role of ESCOs is therefore unclear.

        •   Institutional risk: The on-going World Bank energy efficiency line of credit
            project (2009) has not shown signs of progress so far, with less than 5%
            disbursed by February 2012. However, the energy efficiency market is
            growing with the support of the competing line of credit financed by the
            Agence Française de Développement, which has financed a total of 25MW
            worth of co-generation projects. A World Bank reassessment of the market
            confirmed that the potential for investment in energy efficiency/co-generation
            remains significant 42 . The PIU is expected to implement an action plan to
            remove the obstacles for project progress. Technical assistance support would

            Moreover, ANME's administrative procedures for the approval and
            disbursement of subsidies could be more simple and transparent. ANME's
            "energy efficiency in the industrial sector" unit is already working on this
            issue. The planned energy efficiency database is a step in the right direction.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

71.     The Bank team identified most of the obstacles for increasing investments in
energy efficiency, but significantly overestimated the capacity for transposing the
innovative ESCO model to Tunisia. The Bank team did not justify appropriately the
reasons for using a model of European and North American inspiration in Tunisia, which
had less experience in energy efficiency projects. In early 2000s, the ESCO concept and
the assessment of energy efficiency projects were largely unknown among industries and
banks. Tunisia was, and still is, a society where personal contacts are paramount to build
the trust necessary for business development. Therefore, ESCOs could not have emerged
before a period of solidifying this trust, with the support of the PIU and ANME to
develop the energy efficiency market.

72.     The project was designed based on a study44 carried out by the same company
who owned the only ESCO at the time, STGE 45. This company went bankrupt a few
years later because of the high transaction costs of developing a pipeline of energy
efficiency projects. Some Tunisian operators also affirm that this failure was predictable
because of the immaturity of the market that made a “foreign-company not to be trusted
by Tunisian industrial companies? 46. With benefit of hindsight, the “full-service ESCO"
model developed by the project was probably not the most appropriate for the Tunisian
context taking into account other experiences around the world 47, especially given that
this model has not worked well for scaling-up EE in industry anywhere except in few
countries 48.

73.    Finally, the formulation of the project in the PAD and in the Grant Agreement is
not consistent: (i) there is a discrepancy between the PDO in the PAD and the Grant

Agreement. Moreover, the objective(s) of the project are arguably not well defined; (ii)
the PAD only allows access to the guarantee fund through the ESCOs, while the Grant
Agreement also allows industrial companies to access the guarantee fund. As a rule, the
PAD and the Grant Agreement need to be fully consistent. These inconsistencies created
some confusion to the implementing agency and to the Bank supervision team, whose
staffing changed over the lifetime of the project. As the lack of consistency is considered
a failure on the part of the Bank team to adhere to basic principles of Bank project design
together with the above findings, a rating of overall moderately unsatisfactory is
suggested.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

74.      The Bank team was generally proactive during project supervision. The team's
composition during missions was balanced and reporting by Aide Memoires and
Implementation Status Report was done regularly. Moreover, the Bank team reacted
timely during key milestones to accelerate the lagging disbursements, e.g. mid-term
review and after first extension. During the mid-term review, the Bank team agreed to
introduce further incentives to industrial companies to increase the use of ESCOs when
implementing energy efficiency projects. The result of these measures was uneven. While
some contributed to accelerate disbursements, e.g. raise the ceiling of guarantee coverage
in industrial companies' credits using ESCOs, others were largely ineffective, e.g.
supplementary 10% subsidy to ESCOs when carrying out "material" investment. After
the first extension of the project (from December 31 2009 to December 31 2010), the
Bank worked intensively with the PIU to implement an action plan. The key element was
the use of capacity building funding under Component 3 to facilitate the industrial
companies' application process of the subsidy under Component 1. This measure was
critical in accelerating disbursements.

75.      However, some significant shortcomings were noticed in the following areas: a)
Measurement and Verification protocol for energy efficiency; b) exit strategy for the GEF
Partial Guarantee Fund, which was not agreed with the PIU; and c) at mid-term, a review
on the applicability of OP.30 to introduce an interest-free loan on investment costs was
not carried out. A moderate shortcoming was oversight in adequately monitoring the
indicator "Level of lending to ESCOs and industry by commercial banks as compared to
all energy efficiency investment under the project exceeds 5%". The rating on quality of
supervision could have been improved if the team had restructured the project in order to
clarify the objectives and setting the targets according to the evolving context.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76.      The Bank's team tested a theoretically appealing model, ESCOs, to a weak and
underdeveloped market. The introduction of a new concept largely developed in Europe
and North America was risky, and the “full service? ESCO did not materialize. The slow
disbursement during project implementation could have been anticipated because an
initial period for getting familiar with the new ESCO concept was necessary, but it was
not planned. Therefore, the overall bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77.      The Tunisian Government was the major advocate for enhancing energy
efficiency in the country. In 2005, the spike in international oil prices severely
constrained the government's budget. The government took then two decisions that
enhanced the project's impact: a) created a working group to raise awareness and propose
an action plan to reduce energy intensity among the country's highest energy consumers
in the industrial sector, and b) created a specialized energy efficiency fund, the FNME in
2005. The existing FODEC fund had not had much success in attracting proposals on
energy efficiency. The new FNME, financed by a tax on vehicle registration and
managed by the ANME, significantly raised the grants available for energy investments
from 13 to 20%. The enhancement of ANME's institutional role on energy efficiency was
critical for the success of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The PIU hosted at the ANME was key in the success of the project. The PIU
launched a proactive awareness and personalized campaign to support industrial
companies in the process of applying for the 20% FNME subsidy and the supplementary
10% PEEI subsidy. After three years, 50 companies had already benefited from the direct
and permanent support of the PIU 49 . In February 2007, the PIU launched a
professionally-designed website to enhance its communications and to foster trust among
key stakeholders 50. A new PIU Director took office on November 1st 2008, whose efforts
contributed to the improvement of project implementation. By then, one year before the
project’s original closing date, only 18% of the subsidy under Component 1 had been
disbursed 51. The newly appointed PIU Director, with the support of the Bank’s team,
swiftly implemented an efficient action plan which improved disbursements in the
following three years (after three project extensions).

79.     However, during the project lifetime (2004-2011) the following moderate
shortcomings were also noticed: a) inadequate PIU staffing after two years 52 ; b) late
development of a measurement and verification protocol, which is key to the
establishment of any performance contract, and therefore the ESCO market; and d) lack
of a comprehensive sustainability plan after the project. Despite these shortcomings, the
engagement and professionalism of the PIU was key for the success of the project.

6. Lessons Learned

81.    Grants and guarantees are not sufficient to develop an energy efficiency
market, whereas capacity building (awareness, coordination, and training) is critical.
The Tunisian experience showed that incentives were not immediately effective because
there were serious obstacles to overcome: awareness about energy efficiency, low
technical capacity, and lack of trust among key stakeholders (ESCOs, banks, industrial
companies and ANME). The role of a pro-active PIU as a driver for market development
was important at an early stage.

82.      The "full-service" ESCO model is not a viable instrument to leverage energy
efficiency market development. The establishment of alternative ESCO models, which
do not take the investment risk, on the other hand, appears feasible as the case of Tunisia
shows. The four active ESCOs in Tunisia were small engineering firms at project start
which could diversify their original auditing business because of the project 53. Based on
eligibility criteria set by law 54, they obtained an ESCO license at ANME. The only large
ESCO at the time of project preparation, STGE, left the Tunisian market due to the high
transactions cost. The four active ESCOs (CRA2E, Partners, 3E, BCE) did not finance
any energy efficiency project because their balance sheet was too low and commercial
banks did not accept to lend them funding for EE projects despite the project's guarantee.
Hence, the "full-service" ESCO model could not emerge. The four active ESCOs,
however, could guarantee the sub-project’s energy savings while taking limited risk.
Only a minor fraction of their performance contract depended on the energy savings
achieved. After project closing, the likelihood of survival of the existing ESCOs may be
increased if they merge with partners with strong balance sheets and/or specialize on
highly-technical areas, e.g. compressed air, to offer the best value-added to industrial
companies.

83.     Subsidies that are administered on an output basis do not address the barrier
of lack of “upfront capital? that is typical for energy efficiency investments. The
10% GEF subsidy was de facto provided as an output-based subsidy, because the strict
approval processes under which ANME required the effective implementation of energy
efficiency sub-project before disbursement of the subsidy. The time-span between
approval in principle of the subsidy until disbursement (effectively until after installation
of equipment) would last around two years on average due to the time required for the
implementation of energy efficiency sub-projects (industry). This administration
arrangement did not address the barrier of up-front capital costs for energy efficiency
projects, and may have inherently reduced the number of energy efficiency sub-projects.
This process also led to delays in the project’s disbursement.

   Some ESCOs reported 20-30% turnover increase since the start of the project because of new services,
e.g. monitoring of energy efficiency savings, offered in ESCO-mediated sub-projects. Source: Interviews
during mission to Tunisia in February 2012.
54
   Article 6 of law n° 2004-72 of August 2 2004 considers an ESCO to be an organization preparing “a
project that produces energy savings and ensuring its implementation, management, monitoring and
possibly its funding? and that “ensures the effectiveness of the project in the area of energy savings?.
                                                  21
84.    Keep project design simple. This project provided two financial intermediation
instruments, a subsidy and a guarantee, instead of one as in other similar operations. It
allowed different stakeholders access to different support mechanisms, which led to a
very complex administration model. The governance structure and eligibility criteria of
both instruments were complex, which created more difficulties to the implementing
agency managing the project. A simple structure should be sought in future projects to
enhance development impacts.

85.     A guarantee fund is not sufficient to provide comfort to commercial banks
and change the financing culture in a traditional system. Commercial banks in
Tunisia kept requesting large collaterals for ESCOs credits despite the project’s guarantee
fund. While commercial banks were used to provide credit to regular industrial clients
with adequate assets, ESCOs with small balance-sheets and “unconventional? energy
efficiency projects were barred from credit. The cash-flow from energy savings is not a
familiar form of revenue or collateral to back lending. The familiarization process by the
banking sector on the evaluation of energy efficiency projects must not be underestimated.

86.      The appropriate selection of the project implementation unit is key for
project success. The project was well anchored in the government policy and the
institutional structures. The decision to host the PIU at ANME was highly positive. The
ANME managed the newly created FNME, which provided the main incentive (20%
subsidy) for energy efficiency projects. Hence, the 10% subsidy provided by the PEEI
project complemented it. The administrative coordination between the PIU and ANME to
approve and disburse the subsidies was therefore easier.

87.     A sustainability plan should be drafted. The PIU and the Bank’s team made
considerable efforts to introduce measures to accelerate lagging disbursements, such as
an action plan. ANME confirmed the development of a significant pipeline of energy
efficiency projects, but a formal strategy to support the implementation of such projects is
missing. Presence of such a plan would reduce the existing uncertainties on the future
energy efficiency market in the country. Despite some in-depth analysis 55, the strategy
should confirm the expected future role of ESCOs in Tunisia. The average investment
under the project was US$ 423,000, while larger co-generation projects are recently being
explored more intensively. To build upon the project’s achievements, the ANME could
consider developing the audit system and CP system into an integrated audit system with
guaranteed energy savings (both systems are currently disconnected). Due to the high
risk-aversion of commercial banks to project financing, i.e. asset-backed, combined with
ESCOs financial weaknesses, efforts to make the "full-service" ESCO model emerge
might be abandoned. However, existing ESCOs might still be able to guarantee energy
savings and offer highly-technical consulting services to industrial companies, according
to other ESCO models.

88.    Direct lending to industrial companies not through ESCOs. Building on the
outcomes of the project, the World Bank approved the Energy Efficiency & Renewable
Investment project (P104266) on June 30 2009 to further support energy efficiency
investments in Tunisia. The new project consists in a US$55 million line of credit to

industrial companies through commercial banks. Taking into account the lessons learned
from the project, the new operation was designed to provide loans directly to the
industrial companies, while avoiding any ESCO intervention.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

89.     An ICR mission met with several project stakeholders in February 2012, such as
ESCOs and industrial companies. Two interviews were conducted with two of the four
active ESCOs. The main issues raised by their representatives were the following:

    •   In 2004, at the beginning of the project, industrial companies were reluctant to
        rely on ESCOs for advice on EE. But an intensive two-year door-to-door
        awareness campaign led by the PIU and supported by ANME contributed to
        increase the popularity of ESCOs. The awareness campaign offered a 1-day audit
        and an energy efficiency action plan carried out by ESCOs to a random sample of
        20 industrial companies. The campaign was successful and allowed ESCOs to be
        more visible and build trust in their relationships with industrial companies.
    •   Most energy efficiency improvements financed by the PEEI project correspond to
        simple actions of less than US$ 63,000 (TND 100,000)
    •   The PEEI project allowed ESCOs to enhance their technical skills through
        learning by doing during their assessment and advisory process to industrial
        companies. Thus, before the project, one of the ESCOs was not knowledgeable in
        compressed air systems. But by the end of the project, the ESCO itself trained
        other technical experts on the subject.
    •   Industrial companies had to know personally the ESCO representatives before
        establishing any business relationship.

90.     Likewise, two interviews were also carried out with industrial companies, which
benefited from the PEEI project. The main issues raised by their representatives were the
following:

    •   The main motivations to implement energy efficiency measures were to reduce
        costs and to comply with existing regulation, which mandated high energy-
        consuming industries to conduct energy audits regularly. The PEEI subsidy was
        interesting, but it was not the main incentive.
    •   The energy efficiency measures implemented with PEEI assistance substantially
        reduced the companies' annual energy costs.

(Budget initial: US$ 2.5 million – Budget revised: US$ 2.09 – Actual: US$ 2.07 million)

91.    Component 1 was rated moderately satisfactory because of its slow disbursement.
Component 1 succeeded in attracting 116 projects (see Figure 1 below) by providing
10% subsidy to industrial companies on top of the 20% subsidy of investment costs that
they received from the FNME. However, out of the 116 approved projects, only 81 (44
below target) were finally implemented due to the financial difficulties of 35 industrial
companies after framework contract (CP) approval. A majority of projects were
implemented by industrial companies in the Construction Materials, Ceramics and Glass
sector (see Table 1 below). The PEEI subsidy was an appropriate complement of
ANME's subsidy mechanism, i.e. FNME, but it would not have attracted this number of
EE project requests without the persistent door-to-door awareness campaign led by the
PIU vis-à-vis the industrial companies, which was supported by component 3.

92.     At mid-term review, it was agreed to introduce an additional 10% subsidy for
ESCOs if they financed energy efficiency projects. This measure was meant to encourage
industrial companies to use ESCOs when implementing energy efficiency projects.
ESCOs would therefore receive a total 20% subsidy on their investments. However,
ESCOs did not benefit from this additional subsidy because commercial banks could not
lend them. Also, they could not finance energy efficiency projects with own resources
due to their financial weakness. Component 1 has achieved one of its three targets:

   •   Estimated greenhouse gas emission reductions as resulting from energy
       efficiency investment. Expected reduction of 127,284 tons of CO2 annually
       and 636,422 tons over the project lifetime: The sub-projects benefiting from
       this component implemented energy efficiency investments resulting in 710,333
       tons of CO2 avoided emissions during the life-time of the project 2004-2011 and
       101,476 tons of CO2 emissions annually (compared to the target of 636,422 tons
       over the project life-time and 127,284 tons of CO2 annually). The cumulative
       target corresponds to the sum of CO2 emission reductions of all sub-projects
       implemented from 2004-2011. It has been assumed that each sub-project reduces
       emissions for a period of five years. However, sub-projects implemented after
       2007 have been reducing emissions beyond 2011 –end of project lifetime-, but
       have not been accounted for. The cumulative target of avoided CO2 emissions
       over the lifetime of the project has been exceeded. The annual target has been
       calculated by dividing the cumulative value by the number of years of the project.
       The target has been partially achieved (80% of achievement).

   •   Quantified energy savings of at least 10 ktoe per year, but on average
       expected at 33 ktoe per year: The sub-projects benefiting from this component
       contributed to quantified, i.e. actual, energy savings of at least 31 ktoe/year and
       expected energy savings of 51 ktoe per year (compared to the target of actual
       energy savings of at least 10 ktoe per year, but expected 33 ktoe per year). The
       expected energy savings correspond to the sub-projects' annual average expected
       at the time of signing the CP. The difference between actual and expected energy
       savings is mainly due to financial problems of industrial companies that had a CP
       approved by ANME, but could not implement the energy efficiency project. The
       target was largely achieved (310 % of achievement).

   •   Number of projects generated and reaching financial closure –a minimum of
       125 demonstration investments envisaged: The PEEI and FNME subsidies
       attracted 116 companies to sign a CP with ANME. However, only 81 projects
       reached financial closure, or 65% of the target established at 125 projects. Despite
       this performance, the funds allocated to this component were disbursed
       satisfactorily. The types of energy efficiency measures more frequently used
       were: Energy management systems, HVAC and steam system optimization (see
       Table 2 below).

Component 2 – GEF Partial Guarantee Fund
(Budget initial: US$ 3.725 million-Guarantee fund + US$ 0.275 million-Management
fee; Budget revised: US$ 4.135 + US$ 0.275 million; Actual: US$ 4.164 + US$ 0.275
million)

93.     Component 2 was consistently rated satisfactory but was not used for the main
objective stated in the PAD, which was to “support efforts of ESCOs to arrange for the
financing of energy efficiency investments? 56 . The main cause was the fact that
commercial banks requested traditional collateral to ESCOs despite the 75% guarantee
provided by the GEF Partial Guarantee Fund. Instead, the guarantee was mainly used for
industrial companies working through an ESCO under a CPE contract so that they could
obtain loans from commercial banks for their EE investments. To a lesser extent, the
guarantee was also used to cover payments by industrial companies to ESCOs for their
EE services, but this measure was not sufficient to incentivize commercial banks to lend
to ESCOs. At mid-term, an interest-free loan to ESCOs equivalent to 15% of project cost
was introduced to support ESCOs capacity of financing EE projects. However, this
measure was not implemented because of the persistent inability of ESCOs to borrow
from commercial banks.

94.    The disbursement of funds was consistently slow along the project. The use of the
guarantee not only to cover loans contracted by ESCOs, as stated in the PAD, but also to
cover loans from industrial companies using ESCOs to implement EE projects facilitated
the engagement of the funds. By the end of the original five-years of the project, this
component had disbursed only 32% of its funds. However, disbursements quickly
accelerated by April 2010 to reach 60% due to an effective action plan implemented by

the PIU. The variable management fee received by the Guarantee Fund manager 57 ,
SOTUGAR, did not have a significant impact on the number of contracts signed by
ESCOs and industrial companies.

95.    Nevertheless, Component 2 performed well as an incentive for industrial
companies to sign CPEs with ESCOs, as defined by Tunisian law 58 . CPEs became a
major opportunity for ESCOs, small consulting firms, to learn-on-the-job and
substantially improve their technical skills. Component 2 allowed ESCOs to evolve from
carrying out occasional energy efficiency audits to provide a comprehensive service
package to industrial companies with guaranteed energy savings. In this context,
Component 2 has achieved all four key performance indicators:

     •   At least 3 ESCOs are operational: Ten ESCOs were licensed at ANME, of
         which four were fully operational during the project, generating 30 contracts.
     •   At least 30 companies have ESCO-mediated projects: 30 contracts signed with
         industrial companies as a result of ESCO-mediation.
     •   Commitment of at least 90 percent of the Partial Guarantee Fund: 100%. The
         target has been achieved.
     •   A minimum of 20 percent of energy efficiency projects in the industrial
         sector use the Partial Guarantee Facility: 37% or 30 CPEs/81 projects
         implemented with project subsidy. The target has been achieved.

Component 3 – GEF Technical Assistance
(Budget initial: US$ 2 million; Budget revised: US$ 2 million; Actual: US$ 1.95 million)

96.     Despite its slow disbursement (56% by the original closing date, i.e. December
2009 59 ) this component provided the necessary resources to the PIU, e.g. vehicles,
training, for developing energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector. This
component provided critical resources for raising awareness, enhancing technical skills
and empowering market operators, e.g. ESCOs and industrial companies, to invest in
energy efficiency projects. In 2005, for example, the PIU had a leading role in one of the
national initiatives to raise awareness on energy efficiency, the "task force" 60 on high
energy-consuming industries.

97.    As shown in Table 3 below, Component 3 has benefited around than 400
professionals among technical centers, ESCOs, commercial banks, industries and others,
in 120 days. Hence, 17 training days per year were organized by the PIU. On the other
hand, PIU staff benefited from 138 days of training, or 19 days per year, on different

   Following the recommendations of the National Conference on Energy Management (April 2005), the
Ministry of Industry, Energy and SMEs created a working group “High energy-consuming industries Task
Force? in June 2005 (Decision n°319 of June 3 2005) to implement energy efficiency programs to reduce
energy consumption in such industries. The working group was formed by four experts, including former

98.       Component 3 achieved one of its three output indicators:

      •   Adoption of energy efficiency program planning in overall Ministry of
          Industry and Energy and/or BMN and/or ANME planning: A National
          Program of Energy Efficiency has been developed and a dedicated Energy
          Efficiency Fund, the FNME, has been put in place. The target has been achieved.

      •   At least two Technical Centers develop a monitoring and verification
          procedure for energy efficiency investments: Two technical centers have been
          hired to monitor the implementation of PCs in the construction materials,
          ceramics and glass industries as well as the mechanical and electric industries.
          Both technical centers have ensured that the equipment required to implement the
          EE measures included in the PCs is properly installed and that it generated the
          expected energy savings. However, these technical centers did not develop a
          monitoring and verification procedure which would have allowed them to develop
          a business case to become independent monitoring and verification certifiers for a
          performance contract-based ESCO market. Hence, this target has not been
          achieved

      •   Levels of co-financing by commercial banks to ESCOs and industry exceed 5
          percent of all energy efficiency investments: Around 42% of energy efficiency
          investments are undertaken through loans from commercial banks to industry.
          However, this target does not correspond to the original indicator. As stated in the
          PAD, page 98, “this indicator is aiming to finance 5 percent of all the energy

100. The leveraging of the GEF subsidy under Component 1 was expected to be 9:1. In
other words, the GEF subsidy was expected to leverage US$ 9 from local sources for
every dollar it disbursed assuming that local sources, i.e. private sector and government,
would not have been mobilized in the absence of the subsidy. In reality, the leveraging
effect was 13:1 (see table 2 below). The difference between the estimated leveraging
effect in the PAD and the actual leveraging effect is due to more participation from
private sector than expected and the different exchange rate used. The leveraging effects
of Component 2 partial guarantee and technical assistance are difficult to estimate, but
some ratios are provided in the following table.

101. As can be observed in Table 3 below, total investment in the project increased by
about 14% between the time of appraisal (2004) and closing date (2011) mostly due to a
larger participation of the private sector than expected. Based on PIU's data, Table 3
compares actual investments by financing source and project component with PAD

          greenhouse gas emissions through savings in energy consumption. The PAD estimated
          that the total emissions reductions generated by the project over its original five-year
          period were 636,422 tons of CO2 equivalent. In reality, the project achieved larger CO2
          emission reductions, 710,333 tons of CO2, during the 2005-2011 period. The unit costs of
          CO2 emission reductions are presented in the following table.

   I.      Summary of Borrower’s ICR

Brief Description of the Project
Three components were implemented with the support of the GEF (8.5 million USD)
managed by the World Bank and with co-financing of over 30 million USD, 5 million of
which were financed by public funds:
        1) Component 1: Investment assistance intended to encourage energy efficiency
           actions by medium-sized and large enterprises through ESCOs.
        2) Component 2: Implementation of a partial credit guarantee fund to facilitate
           project financing.
        3) Component 3: Technical assistance and training for stakeholders (public
           institutions, industries, financial institutions, energy service providers,
           ESCOs, etc.)
The project timeframe was set at over a period of 5 years (2005-2009) but, for reasons
associated with delays in project delivery and disbursements, the ANME requested two
project extensions, which led to it ending on November 30, 2011.

Project Performance

Generally speaking, the project performance has been rated very satisfactory even if
activity start-up delays, a number of project design weaknesses and, most importantly,
the fact that two project deadline extensions were requested significantly undermined the
Evaluators' rating insofar as the efficiency of project delivery was concerned. That being
said, it should be noted that the project was adjusted over time to deal with the various
constraints, all required improvements were put in place and the project finally met its
defined objectives with flying colours. This is a reflection of the high quality
management of the project during the period following the Mid-Term Evaluation, both on
the part of the World Bank and the ANME.

Lessons Learned

        - Design weaknesses can be overcome if decision makers demonstrate the
          needed flexibility and project managers are able to face reality without any
          double talk.
        - The importance of the start-up phase must never be underestimated, especially
          when a project's design includes significant weaknesses (which are often the
          case). The contribution of international experts becomes crucial at this point.
        - In spite of efforts to raise the awareness and train the financial sector, the
          conservative nature of these institutions must never be underestimated when it
          comes to their analysis of credit files, even when a first quality guarantee is
          available.
        - Introducing the ESCO concept is always difficult in all countries. It probably
          would have been wise to include a special component (or sub-component) to
          support the overall implementation of this business model through a number of
          demonstration projects.

                                           37
       - A poorly adapted regulatory and incentive framework is often another barrier to
         the development of the ESCO business model. The regulatory framework must
         be examined at the earliest stage of the project implementation and, if need be,
         adjusted to facilitate and encourage the development of the ESCO business
         model and the use of a contract performance scheme. These issues should be
         studied in the very first year of a project.

Recommendations for Increased Sustainability

Transfer of Assets and Future Use
As a rule, the transfer of assets stipulates, among other things and generally speaking,
that the assets of a project be used in accordance with the objectives of the projects
financed by the GEF. This project's main asset is without a doubt the value of the
guarantee fund to date totalling 4,135 million USD. The Evaluation Team recommends
that the ANME revise certain fund management rules to better meet the needs of
businesses and especially ESCOs that have not benefited from the guarantee to finance
investments according to the Energy Performance Contract scheme.

Develop a Regulatory and Taxation Framework Adapted to Performance Contracts
Financed by ESCOs
An appropriate and incentive regulatory framework is key to moving forward with the
CPE scheme. The tax treatment of investments according to the CPE scheme should be
analyzed and adjustments should be recommended to the tax authorities.

Monitoring and Verification Plan
Develop and implement a plan adapted to the Tunisian context for the monitoring and
verification of EE project results.

Promote Synergy with the Existing and Future Financial Tools
The intensive use of the line of credit established by the World Bank in 2010 is an
important element to ensure the sustainability of the PEEI and future actions.

Resource Mobilization Plan: Financial Resources
Given the success of the PEEI in recent years and the transfer of assets (4 million USD),
the ANME is well positioned to conduct a campaign towards the mobilization of
resources from the funding agency community. The objective will then be to develop a
specific and complementary project, for example an ESCO project.

Review the Implementation Conditions of the Contracts-Programmes
This is to allow the payment of subsidies (FNME and PEEI additional premium) after the
implementation of each measure and to report a completed CP (closed file) at the request
of the beneficiary, when 50% of the objectives have been reached, or upon the decision
of the ANME, or after 3 years following the signature of the contract-programme. The
maximum duration of a CP should never exceed 5 years.

   II.      Borrower’s comments on draft ICR

The following comments were received from the Borrower on June 18 2012:

         Importance of the project for Tunisia

The PEEI project is part of a broader program (2005-2007 three-year program and 2008-
2011 four-year program), initiated by the Tunisian government since 2004 to accelerate
the change of scale in the volume of investments dedicated to energy conservation. This
program aimed to reinforce the energy efficiency component, which already was one of
the most important national priorities (Presidential decisions of May 3 2001).

At the time of project design, Tunisia faced several challenges at the international level:
facing an increase in international energy prices as the country became a net importer in
this sector since 2000, ensuring the competitiveness of its industry particularly with the
entry into force in 2008 if the free Trade agreement with the European Union (EU) and
honor its commitments to international agreements related to the environment.

More specifically, the project aimed to improve the competitiveness of Tunisian
companies by reducing production costs related to energy and at the same time emissions
of greenhouse gases. It also aimed to encourage the emergence and use of ESCOs . The
PEEI project aimed to develop the Tunisian market of energy efficiency in the industrial
sector on a sustainable manner through ESCOs. In particular, the project set a target to
mobilize a total investment equal to US$ 25 in the field of energy efficiency, in a pilot
phase of 5 years and, through the implementation of 125 energy efficiency projects.

The institutional stakeholders are mainly:

• National Energy Management Agency (ANME) that hosts the project implementation
unit (PIU) and also administers the National Energy Management Fund (FNME).
• The Tunisian Guarantee Company (SOTUGAR), a company with public participation
and with financial autonomy, created in 2003 to administer the guarantee fund.
• The Competitiveness Enhancement Bureau (BMN) that is in charge of the Industry
Competitiveness Fund (FODEC).

The project beneficiaries were industrial companies, engineering consultants, the newly
created ESCOS and financial institutions (banks, leasing companies). During the project
implementation period, all stakeholders were directly or indirectly involved in the project.

The PEEI project has had the following results:

- Establish a sustainable market for energy efficiency in the industrial sector in Tunisia.
- Increase overall investment in energy efficiency in the industrial sector of US$ 32
million during the project implementation period.

An ex-post evaluation of the country's energy efficiency programs conducted during the
period 2005-2011 has estimated the accumulated energy savings in 3,500 ktoe. Of this
amount, the program targeting the industrial sector (CPs and cogeneration) contributed to
42%, hence the importance of this sector in the Tunisian energy efficiency strategy.

                                             39
In the future, Tunisia plans to further strengthen its energy efficiency policy by setting
more ambitious targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy, under the Tunisian
Solar Plan. The latter sets a target primary energy savings of about 24% in 2016 and 40%
in 2030, compared to business as usual scenario. The industrial sector should contribute
significantly to these energy savings, particularly through cogeneration and innovative
energy efficiency measures directly affecting the improvement of industrial processes.

       Performance of World Bank and Borrower during period 2004-2011

The PEEI project was designed in its pilot phase to (i) to support the development of an
energy efficiency market in the industrial sector in accordance with the priorities of the
country in energy efficiency and (ii) test and adapt the innovative concept of ESCOs to
the Tunisian context as a driver for the development of this market.

The project with its components 1 and 3 has created a true market dynamics and has been
a real catalyst for the development of the energy efficiency program in the industrial
sector, which earned him to be a flagship program at ANME as its energy and economic
benefits were substantial.

Component 2 was used primarily for the emergence of ESCOs and to develop and
improve services related to energy efficiency and also raise the financing barriers for
energy efficiency activities. Taking into account its pilot nature, the "full-service" ESCO
model has encountered in its implementation several problems:

       • Immaturity of the energy efficiency market
       • Ignorance of the ESCO concept by different key stakeholders

The challenge of the project was to gradually introduce the new concept taking into
account the reality on the ground and take steps to make it more attractive and accepted
by the different stakeholders. In this respect the project has worked very well even if the
"full-service" ESCO model has been only partially developed.

Indeed, the project promoted the expansion of the market for ESCO activities to
complementary services, which allowed them to provide a full range of integrated
services to the industrial company. These services, as part of energy performance
contracting, have also integrated: identification of energy efficiency measures, support
during implementation, advise on financial issues, monitoring of implemented measures,
and performance guarantee.

The ESCO network created during the lifetime of the project is an important asset of the
PEEI project in terms of sustainability of its impacts. The objective was to create three
ESCOS, while the PEEI has prompted the creation of 10 ESCOs. Most of these ESCOs,
though, existed already on the market as consulting firms. These firms have either created
a subsidiary or simply converted themselves into ESCOs to meet the changing market.

The ESCO network and development of these new profitable services is a very positive
outcome of the PEEI project. Although only four ESCOs were active under the PEEI, the
project has largely achieved its objective to create three ESCOS and to complete thirty
energy efficiency projects through energy performance contracts (CPE).

The role of the PIU/ANME was instrumental in achieving the targets. The PIU/ ANME
adopted a pragmatic approach by mobilizing the various operators when necessary
(outreach and ongoing coaching, use of high-quality external experts, involvement of all
stakeholders, support to ANME, etc.).

The team from the World Bank has been proactive and has worked effectively with the
Tunisian side to implement corrective measures, given the difficulties encountered
related to the Tunisian context, without deviating from the original purpose of the project
and procedures, while respecting those of Tunisia and the World Bank.

       Sustainability of project impacts

Based on these achievements and to capitalize on past experience, the ANME is
launching new programs and actions to mobilize the potential of energy savings in the
industrial sector. Among them:

       • Exploration of new areas of energy efficiency in industrial companies by
       developing specific techniques to improve processes (program launched with the
       support of the EU)
       • Improved the quality of energy savings by implementing a systematic protocol
       for measuring and monitoring EE actions, built-in the audit process and the new
       generation of CPs.
       • Launched a program to promote the progressive integration of energy efficiency
       into the industries' management system (ISO50001 standard) (Program launched
       with the support of UNIDO)
       • Establish an information system on energy efficiency in industrial sector, based
       on appropriate indicators to enable ongoing evaluation of the energy efficiency
       policy in this sector.
       • Continue implementation of co-generation development program by
       strengthening the regulatory framework for co-generation and increasing
       awareness of industrial companies
       • Preparation and implementation of an action plan to better position ESCOs in
       the future energy efficiency and co-generation market.


       Borrower's conclusions

Because of the above, I invite the World Bank team that led the final evaluation of the
project to revise the suggested rating for the World Bank team and the borrower as
follows:

- Overall performance of the Borrower: ''very satisfactory'' instead of ''satisfactory''
- Overall performance of the Bank: ''satisfactory'' instead of ''moderately satisfactory''

Moreover, as has been stated, this project was designed as a pilot, and as any satisfactory
pilot operation, it is recommended that the evaluation report makes a recommendation to
donors, the GEF in particular, to continue their financial support to energy efficiency in
the Tunisian industrial sector, particularly to help ensure the sustainability of such
operation.
