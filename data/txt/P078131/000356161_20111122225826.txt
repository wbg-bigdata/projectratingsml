1.     The GEF grant “Tunisia - Energy Efficiency Program/Industrial Sector? (ID
P078131, TF54398) was approved on November 4, 2004, and became effective on
December 13, 2004. Its amount is USD 8.5 million. The project consists of the following
parts:
    • Part A provides a subsidy to industrial companies investing in energy efficiency
       (budget: USD 2.5 million). It is paid by the National Agency for Energy
       Conservation (ANME) and is additional to what is offered by the National Energy
       Fund;
    • Part B finances a guarantee, provided by SOTUGAR, for investments made by
       industrial companies under a contract with an Energy Service Company (ESCO).
       The budget includes the guarantee itself (Part B.1, USD 3.725 million), and a fee
       for SOTUGAR for the management of the guarantee fund which has been set up
       (Part B.2, USD 0.275 million);
    • Part C is for technical assistance (budget: USD 2 million).
2.     The closing date for the project was extended three times: a first extension from
December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 was granted in July 2009, a second extension
to September 30, 2011 was granted in December 2010, and a third and final extension to
November 30, 2011 was granted in September 2011.
3.      A first reallocation of funds also took place in July 2010, totaling USD 625,000
(USD 500,000 from the “unallocated? category and USD 125,000 excess funds initially
allocated to the SOTUGAR fee). USD 225,000 were reallocated to the guarantee
component and USD 400,000 to the technical assistance, leading to the current budgets of
USD 3.725 million and USD 2 million, respectively.
4.      The audit report for 2010 was due on September 30, 2011 and was not received
yet. Since the four months overdue has not been reached, the World Bank does not take
any action in respect to non compliance with FM requirement (BP10.02). The Bank is
closely following up with the auditors (CGF) on their action plan to ensure that the audit
report will be received at the latest on January 1, 2012. The final audit report will cover
the period up to the current closing date of November 30, 2011. As an alternative
assurance mechanism, a supervision mission took place in June 2011 and FM
performance was rated satisfactory.
5.      Disbursement was very slow during the first years of implementation of the
project, due to imperfections in project design. An action plan was designed to accelerate
disbursement when the first extension was requested. This plan mostly consisted in using
funds available under Part C to assist participating industrial companies in implementing
their energy conservation plans more rapidly and in preparing their application to collect
subsidies (Part A). A mission was also launched to assess and adapt the ESCO contract
system, in order to accelerate disbursement of Part B. This plan was successfully
implemented by the PIU during 2010 and 2011, even during the Revolution which only
caused a limited slowdown of the project.
6.       As of September 2011, the disbursement situation was as follows:
     •   The guarantee component was fully disbursed (USD 3.725 million),
     •   A little over USD 2.1 million out of USD 2.5 million were disbursed under the
         subsidy component,
     •   USD 1.1 million out of USD 2 million was disbursed under the technical
         assistance component.
7.      Regarding technical assistance, several contracts were recently signed with
consultants to deliver the remaining activities under the project’s procurement plan, and
the PIU is confident that such activities will be completed before closure of the project
(as of September, USD 1.950 million was committed for contracts under implementation
and expected to be completed before November 30). Regarding the undisbursed USD
373,571 under the subsidy component, and considering the very short timeframe before
closure of the project, the PIU proposed these funds be reallocated to the guarantee
component. A formal request for such guarantee was received by SOTUGAR as part of
the financing package for a cogeneration investment by Nejma Huiles SA, which will
also benefit from a sub-loan by Amen Bank under the IBRD Energy Efficiency and
Cogeneration line of credit.
8.     The project team recommends the proposed reallocation is accepted. The actual
amount of the reallocation will be slightly different from the requested amount (USD
373,571 instead of USD 410,000), due to the actual disbursement level of the subsidy
component. It would allow the Grant to be fully disbursed within the allocated timeframe,
making good use of all the instruments made available under the project, while showing
synergies with the IBRD line of credit.
