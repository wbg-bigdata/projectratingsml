                                 Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for the GEF Grant Tunisia - Energy Efficiency
Program/Industrial Sector, P078131, TF054398, will be extended from September 30,
2011 until November 30, 2011. This will be the third extension: the original closing date
was December 31, 2009; a first extension to December 31, 2010 was granted in July
2009; a second extension to September 30, 2011 was granted in December 2010.

2.      The project’s audit report for 2009 has been recognized by the World Bank as
acceptable. The audit report for 2010, which was due by June 30, 2011, has not been
finalized yet. Following a request by the Tunisian government and due to the turmoil
following the Revolution, the Bank agreed to extend the deadline for the 2010 audit
report by three months, to September 30, 2011.

3.    The Grant was approved on November 4, 2004, and became effective on
December 13, 2004. Its amount is USD 8.5 million. The project consists of the following
components:
   • Component 1 provides a subsidy (“surprime?) to industrial companies investing in
      energy efficiency, which is additional to what is offered by the National Energy
      Fund (budget: USD 2.5 million);
   • Component 2 provides a guarantee for investments made by industrial companies
      under a contract with an Energy Service Company (ESCO). The budget includes
      USD 3.725 million for guarantees and USD 0.275 million as fees for Sotugar,
      who is managing the guarantee fund which has been set up;
   • Component 3 is for technical assistance (TA, budget: USD 2 million).

4.      As disbursement was very slow for the first years of implementation of the
project, the Tunisian government requested an extension of one year in May 2009. It was
granted by the World Bank on July 23, 2009, while an action plan was being developed
to accelerate disbursement.

5.      A reallocation of funds also took place in July 2010, totaling USD 625,000. USD
225,000 were reallocated to the guarantee and USD 400,000 to the TA, leading to the
current budgets of USD 3.725 million and USD 2 million, respectively.

6.      The action plan mostly consisted in using funds available under Component 3 to
assist participating industrial companies in implementing their energy conservation plans
more rapidly, and in preparing their application to collect subsidies (Component 1). A
mission was also launched to assess and adapt the ESCO contract system, in order to
accelerate disbursement of Component 2.

7.      This plan was successfully implemented by the PIU during 2010, and the
project’s activity significantly accelerated throughout the year. However, it appeared
towards the end of 2010 that, while Component 2 would be almost fully disbursed by
December 31, Component 1 and 3 were still late on schedule. This led to a second
extension of nine months, which was granted by the World Bank on December 14, 2010.
The 2009 action plan, which proved successful, continued, using part of the remaining
TA funds. It was expected that most undisbursed funds would be disbursed during the
first half of 2011.

8.      The Revolution caused a slowdown of the project. However, this slowdown was
limited. As of April 30, 2011, Component 2 was fully disbursed and Component 1 was
almost fully disbursed. At the beginning of August, the overall disbursement rate was
93%. All remaining contracts under Component 3 are expected to be signed during
summer, but their execution will need about a month beyond September 30. Therefore,
although the previous restructuring paper stated that the second extension would be the
last one, a new two month extension is required. The 2009 action plan will remain active
until completion of the project, as no further action is required to facilitate disbursement
of remaining funds.

9.     Based on these considerations, on the favorable disbursement rate over 2010 and
2011, and on the fact that the extension conditions mentioned in paragraph 3 of OP 13.30
are met, the project team recommends that the project is given a third and last extension
of two months.
