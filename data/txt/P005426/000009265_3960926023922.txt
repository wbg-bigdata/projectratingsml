SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAJIG PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          The Kingdom of Morocco.
Beneficiaries:    The Office of Vocational Training and Employment Promotion
(the Office) and the Vocational Training Administration
(VTA).
Amount:             US$22.3 million equivalent.
Terms:             twenty years, including five years of grace at the current
variable inLerest rate.  US$21.3 million equivalent of the
Bank loan would be made available by the Borrower to the
Office, on a grant basis. The remaining US$1.0 million
would be provided in support of the VTA. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks on
the Bank loan.
Project            The objectives of the proposed project are to (i) improve
Description:        the quality of vocational training; and (ii) reduce
vocational training costs. The project would address these
objectives by (i) improving instructor training; (ii)
upgrading training programs; (iii) implementing treasures to
enhance cost recovery; (iv) improving the Office's
efficiency; and (v) technical assistance and preinvestment
studies.
Benefits and       The major benefits of this project are expected to be:
Risks:             an increase in the supply and quality of workers urgently
needed in the Moroccan economy and more employment
opportunities for lower income groups and females due to
improvements in training programs and greater efficiency.
The single identifiable risk associated ' th the project is
that implementation could be slowed by budgetary shortages
in the context of the Government's current fiscal austerity
program. The Government has, however, made a firm
commitment that the necessary funding will be provided, and
is planning cost recovery measures which will offset Office
recurrent expenditures by 1990.  Significantly, Government
funding for the First Vocational Training Project has been
sufficient and timely.

I. MANPOWER CONSIDERATIONS
M        nweTemand ad SU1
1.01       zording to the 1982 census, the Moroccan labor force increased at a
4X per annum rate between 1971-82, from about 4.0 million in 1971 to some 6.0
million in 1982, including an estimated 0.6 million unemployed.   During the
same paeriod, total population increased by 2.62 per annum to reach 20.4
million in 1982.  This large labor force increase reflects both the return of
Moroccan migrant labor from Europe and higher labor-force participation,
particularly for females. Rapid labor-force growth is certain to continue for
the foreseeable future. The Government is concerne'4 with the need to provide
relevant training opportunities to ensure that new entrants to the labor force
can make a productive contribution to Morocco's development.
1.02     Information  on  the  nature  of  current  asxd prospective  needs  for
skilled manpower  is available  from several  sources.   The  1982  census  and
subsequent surveys confirm a considerable and continuing shift in the labor
force structure towards activities requiring higher okill. levels particularly
in industry and construction, whose share increased together from 15.0% in
1971 to 23.21 in 1982 and to 26.21 in 1985 (Annex 1).  In 1985, over a million
persons were employed in industry and some 0.5 million in construction. Among
the incentives for industrial growth are  the reform measures  being adopted
under the two Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Loans whose ?rincipal aim
is to change the system of incentives in order to eliminate the bias against
exports, lower manufacturing costs, and hence, restore dynamism to industrial
growth.   One  likely  consequence  of  these  measures  is  faster  growth  of
industrial  employment.   Unemployment  is  still  high  and  increasing,  but
employers continue to report shortages of qualified mar.power in areas such as
electricity and electronics and in all aspects of maintenance.  Unemployment
is expected to stabilize or decrease during the next ten years with the
acceleration of exports and with improved management of manpower resources.
1.03     To  assist  the  Government  to  obtain  more  precise  indicators  of
manpower needs, a comprehensive Bank-supported manpower study is under way
with the Ministry of Planning (MOP), under financing from the recently
completed Third Education Project (Loan 1220-T-MOR) and the ongoing Vocational
Training  Project  (Loan  2479-MOR).   The  Vocational  Training  Administration
(VTA) under the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), which is in charge of
vocational training programs nation-wide, used the first findings of this
study and information from the 1982 census to carry out a more specific set of
studies on training and employment (Etude de l'Ad6Quation entre la Formation



-2-
Profeasionnelle  et  1'EmDloi)-'  in  the  organized  sector.   These  studies
include:
(a) a survey of the number, capacity, and type of training programs
throughout the public and private sectors;
(b) a survey of employers' views on the quality of vocational training
programs; and
(c) a tracer study of vocational training graduetes into the labor market.
The preliminary findings from these studies confirm several key issues which
would be addressed by the proposed project.   These  include:   (a)  the poor
education and training of the skilled labor force--at the skilled worker level
492 had never attended school and only 72 had attended training courses.   On
the other hand, a high proportion of middle and higher level technicians (15X
and 112, respectively) had only semi-skilled or skilled worker qualifications
(Annex 2); (b) weaknesses i} instructor training, equipment supply and
management of the vocational Lraining system; and (c) inadequacy in the
recruitment and placement of trainees.   The findings of these studies (which
are  separately  supported  by  the  fiiAdings  of  numerous  Bank  missions  for
preparation and appraisal of the First Vocational Training Project  and the
proposed project and previous sector work, including the Etude Sectorielle sur
l'Education et  la Formation Professionnelle (Report No. 4105-MOR dated June
10, 1983)) emphasize the urgent need to consolidate recent expansion (para.
1.11) by giving priority to upgrading and adapting training program& to meet
evolving labor market needs, and to improving the planning and management of
the vocational training system.
1.04     More detailed information on regional manpower needs is provided on
an ongoing basis by the advisory councils (conseils de perfectionnement) which
are  attached  to  each  of  the  training  centers  of  the  principal  training
agency--the National Office of Vocational  Training  (the Office)  2/.  These
councils comprise representatives of employers' associations, trade unions,
and training  center managers.   The  advisory  councils  play  a  key  role  in
assuring a suitable match between training program content and enrollments and
needs of employers (para. 1.10).
1.05     Expansion of vocational training capacity has been given top priority
ir. Government plans in recent years.   The Vocational Training Administration
(VTA) was established (para. 1.11) to plan, coordinate and monitor this
expansion.   The VTA target  to absorb  into semi-skilled  and  skilled worker
levels training programs between 502 and 602 of the secondary school leavers
at grade 9 equivalent and some 902 of school leavers at grade 12 equivalent
who do not procede to higher education into technician training programs, will
be reached in 1987/1988 when ongoing constructioni of new institutions will be
completed. The balance of school leavers at these levels will be absorbed by
informal training, including traditional apprenticeship and training provided
by private sector establishments. The First Vocational Training Project will

1.06     Despite  these  increases  in  output,  mission  projections,  based  on
recent VTA studies  and other  data  (Annexes  1 to 5),  demonstrate  that  the
supply of skilled workers at hoth technician and skilled worker level will be
insufficient to meet demard over the next decade.   By 1990 these projections
suggest that. demand for technicians, skilled and semi-skilled workers will
exceed supply by a factor of 2:1,  3:1 and 2:1 respectively.   Furthermore,  a
recent Bank study (Report No. 3233-MOR) of the electromechanical industries,
identified skills shortages as a major constraint to industrial output.

1.07     Theme projections are supported by the results of studies initiated
by the VTA to investigate labor market needs and define new training
requirements at various levels in specific industrial areas where skilled
manpower  needs  have  recently  changed.   The  first  such  study  covered  the
electronics industry. This study led to a plau for the implementation of the
new  traininj  programs  in  late  1987.   Of  equal importance are studies  in
specific geographic areas aiming at investigating the occupational patterns of
the skilled labor force particularly in the non-formal sector for self-
employment.  The Meknes area study, now completed, is the first of these.  The
study found that out of a sample of 14,000 workers employed in the non-formal
sector in Meknes, some 261 were in technical jobs for which fully productive
employment requires structured vocational training (auto mechanics, plumbing,
masonry, elec.ricity, etc.) and of those only 6X were graduates of vocational
training  institutions and 14X were  traditional  apprentice  trainees.   These
findings, which are expected to ve replicated in other regions, document the
considerable need for trained manpower in the non-formal sector, mainly at
skilled  worker  level.   The  VTA  plans  to  institutionalize  region-specific
studies and is taking steps to tut its own planning and administration on a
decentralized basis which will facilitate regular conduct of the studies.
Togethter with the advisory councils these measures will enhance the VTA's
ability to respond to evolving needs (para. 1.10).
Vocational Traingg System
1.08     In 1968, the Ministry of Fducation (MOE) vocational training program,
until then the major source for skilled worker training,, was abolished and
each Ministry was assigned the task of training specialized rsrsonnei for its
own needs.  At present,  practically all ministries hpve their own training
programs mainly at skilled worker and technician levels (para. 1.11).
Pre-service skill training programs within the private sector are limited and
are confined mainly to commercial specializations (para. 1.09).  In 1975, the
Office was created as a financially autonomous public enterprise under the
supervision (tutelle) of the MOL, to meet training needs mainly in the
industrial, construction and commercial fields (Annex 6).  Recurrent costs of
Office training programs are recovered from beneficiaries throughi a traiairng
levy (taxe de formati2n professionnelle), equal to 1% of the gross mcinthly
income of employees of the private sector--industrial and commercial oublic
enterprises are exempted from this tax.  However, the recent expansion rrogram
(para. 1.05) means that revenues  from this levy are  insufficient  to cover
recurrent expenditures, and the Government proposes to increase revenues by
expanding the training levy to public sector companies (para. 1.15) and other
measures  (Annex 14).  In 1981, supervision of the Office was transferred to
the MOP and in July 1984 to the MPW which became the Ministrv of Public Works,
Vocational  Training  and  Staff  Training  Administration    .   This  recent
transfer sought in part to enlist the construction capacity of the MPW in
expanding  the  Office's  training  facilities  (para.  1.12).   The  structure,
programs and financial autonomy of  the Office  were not affected  by  this
transfer.
1.09     There  are  four  levels  of  vocational  training:  (a)  basic  level
(iritiation), for trainees below full primary schooling, (b) semi-skilled
1/ Ministere de l'equipement, de la formation professionnelle, et de la
formation des cadres.



- 5 -
worker level (ss6cialisation) for those with prim.ry school certificate, (c)
skilled worker level (qualification) at the upper secondary level, and (d)
pout-secondary technician training (techniciens). With the implementation of
the educational reform (para. 1.17) and the nine years of compulsory schooling
for all, the first two levels of training will be phased out.   At present
(1985/86), there are 20 ministries or agencies running their own training
programs with a total of aome 14'.,000 trainees of whom 26,000 are at the
skilled worker level and 21,500 at the technician level (Annex 5). The Office
share of these skilled worker and technician training programs is 601 (15,600)
and 591 (12,600), respectively.  In addition, there are 209 accredited private
schools with an estimated 34,000 trainees of whom over 801 are in the
commercial field (co_merce, accounting, secretarial, computers) and 501 are at
the technician 'evel.
1.10     Office  training  facilities   include  full-time  programs  at   the
following levels: institutes of applied technology (IATs) (grades 13-14) for
technician training, vocational training centers for skilled worker training
(VTCs) (grades 10-11), ard vocational training centers for semi-skilled worker
training (post primary level). Most VTC programs last 18 months ax-d have a
modular structure with a broad common base. For each training institution (or
for each city, if there is more than one training institution in the same
city) there is an "upgrading council" (Conseil de Perfectionnement) (para.
1.04)  chaired  by  a  local  employer  with  the  director  of  the  training
institution  acting  as  vice-chairman  and  secretary  of  the  council.   The
councils deal with specific questions concerning the training in7titution such
as trade tests labor market information, placement of graduates and feedback
from employers.   They will also play a role  in conducting  region-specific
employment studies (para. 1.07).  However, the Office lacks adequate staff and
systems to update and modify training program content to provide the necessary
flexibility in program content.  Amnog the other services of the Office is a
well run equipment maintenance service.   However, when the new  institutions
come on stream (para. 1.05), its capacity to respond in timely and flexible
fashion  to  this  largely  decentralized  system  will  be  strained.   Further
details on the Office are given in Annex 6.
1.11     The VTA was created in 1984 within the MPW with terms of reference to
coordinate the vocational training effort at the national level, plan the
expansion of vocational training capacity and monitor its implementation, and
carry out the studies necessary .o keep the vocational training system
effective and constantly adjusted to the developing economy's needs.  Through
a system of accreditation the VTA also has responsibility for qtality control
of vocational training programs in the private sector.  However, this system
needs to be improved.   The VTA is composed of three directorates  (Planning,
Vocational Training and Staff training) with a numbe: cf divisions and
services (Annex 7).  Each individtal ministry and training agency,  including
the Office, is responsible for detailed planning and budgetting as well as
implementing its respective se;toral training programs within the national
training policy framework established by the VTA.
Vocational Training Isues
1.12     To meet the projected increases in demand for skilled manpower (para.
1.06), the Government has in the past few years concentrated on expanding the
capacity of the vocational training system by increasing the number of student
places.   ihis physical expansion has taken place (para.  1.13) without making



- 6 -
adequate budgetary provision for the purchase and installation of additional
training equipment and for meeting the  increased  recurrent  costs.   Because
many VTCa are poorly housed and inadequately equipped and lack funds for
consumable materials and maintenance of equipment and buildings, the quality
of training has also suffered.   Furthermore, the training of new instructors
for this expanded system, conducted under an accelerated program, was largely
insufficient, because many instructors lacked industrial experience and were
not  given adequate  teaching  practice.   In  additioa  to  these  qualitative
aspects, tLe efficiency of the vocational training system also needs to be
improved.  Measures to be taken would include:   (i) improving the day-to-day
management of individual training centers and the overall management functions
of the Office; and (ii) linking content and duration of training programs, and
the levels of trade or technical qualifications more closely to employer
needs.  To address  the issues of financial viability and system efficiency,
the Government has concluded, and the Bank agrees, that it should now give
priority to improving the quality of existing training programs before
investinig in a further expansion of the vocational training system (para.
1.05).
1.13     Quality.  The Government has placed top priority in the past on the
expansion of the vocational training system and in 1984 launched a major
expansion program (programme d'urgence) covering the 1984/85-1987/88 period
(para.  1.05).   The activities supported under the First Vocational Training
Project,  and  particularly  the  22 new  VTCs,  constitute  the  core  of  this
expansion program.  The expansion program also involves a major effort by the
Government to create temporary, improvised, training places, in advance of the
fully equipped training places being established under the proposed project.
Virtually all of the new capacity (Table 1.1) of this part of the programme
d'urgence  is already either  in operation or under construction.    However,
most of the equipment in the older Office training centers is outdated and/or
obsolete, while in a number of the recently established centers equipment is
incomplete.   As a result,  training  cannot  be appropriately delivered.   The
proposed project would remedy these deficiencies, as detailed in Chapter II of
this  report.   Physical  facilities  at some  centers  are  inadequate,  needing
repair  or  renovation.    The  proposed  project  would  provide  the  minor
refurbishment needed.  Content and duration of the various training programs
would be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their relevance to employers
needs  (paras  2.07,  and  2.12).   The quality  of  training also  suffers  from
deficiencies in instructor training (para 1.12) and the proposed project wculd
finance the development of an industrial training program for instructors
(para.  2.06).   Monitoring  of  self-employment  opportunities  through  market
surveys and assistance from the trai.ing council, introducing entrepreneurship
development  training  courses  mainly  in  the  VTCs,  and  improving  contacts
between  training   institutions   and   employers   would   improve   employment
opportunities  for  graduates.    Since  the  recent  emphasis   on  providing
additional training infrastructure has diverted the Office's attention from
the need  to upgrade  the content and quality of the training programs,  the
project includes technical assistance (TA) to help:   (i) devise new training
prograrlsi to meet the changing needs of the economy; (ii) develop accelerated
skill upgrading courses to rapidly respond  to employers'  needs, particularly
in  ,he  small  enterprise  sector;  (iii) organize  training  programs  directly
reLaLed to self-employment;  and (iv)  improve tralinee  selection,  orientation
and certification, and evaltLate the effectiveness of training programs (para.
2.07 and 2.12).



-7-
1.14     Efficiency.   The findings of a study on coordination of vocational
training financed by the First Vc.2ational Training Project show a clear need
to improve coordination by the VTA of the various training agencies, to
eliminate  overlap  between  courses  and  to  assist  employers  select  job
candidates by the results of a trade testing and certification service.   The
proposed project would improve VTA planning and management capabilities (para.
2.10).   The  Office  appropriately  plans  to  decentralize  its  planning  and
administration to make its network of centers more responsive to localized
needs.  The project would support the creation of regional coordination units
and  the  training  of  coordinators  and center directors  (para.  2.09).   The
project would also assist in improving career guidance and assistance in job
placement.   The results of these actions, and their effect on dropout rates
and svstem throughput would be reviewed on the basis of tracer studies to be
conducted under the project (para 2.14, Annex 13).
1.15     Financial Viability.  Until 1984, receipts from the training tax were
sufficient to cover recurrent costs of Office training programs (Annex 6).
The need for mobilization of additional resources to cover training activities
became evident in 1984 when the Office's recurrent expenditures for the first
time began to reach the level of receipts from the training levy (Table 3 of
Annex 6).   The MPW has  just completed  a study  (First  Vocational  Training
Project) on financing to investigate ways and means of increasing income and
reducing costs by such measures as raising the rate of the vocational training
levy, extending the base of the levy to include public enterprises, whict
benefit from Office programs; providing incentives for private sector
employers to participate more fully in training; and introducing training
fees.  Under the ongoing First Vocational Training Project, the Government has
agreed to put into effect measures to maintain the self-financing of the
Office recurrent costs.  On the basis nf the results of the study, the primary
measure envisaged by the Government is to increase the training levy (taxe de
formation professionnelle) from the actual rate of 12 to 1.6X.  This measure
will increase immediately by 60% the actual cost recovery (Annex 14) and is
politically  feasible.   Additional  measures  envisaged  by  the  Government
include: (i) measures for improved collection of the training levy; and (ii)
introduction  of  training  fees  for  certain  categories  of  training.    (n
addition, the proposed project includes equipment and TA for introducinig a
self-help initiative combining training with the operation of maintenance and
repair services which would generate income to meet consumable material
expenditures  (para.  2.08).  Finally,  the TA for program design,  development
and evaluation will help reduce the length and costs of certain trairing
courses (para. 2.07).
1.16     Improved Equity for Low-Income Groups.   The present poor quality of
vocational training programs means that these programs are of limited benefit
to their major recipients (low income groups) in improving job-related
skills.   A  major  objective  of  the  Government's  currcrft  education  reform
program (para.  1.17) is to orient an increasing share of scnool  leavers  to
vocational training in order to improve the income-earning opportunities of
this group--typically comprising the lower income segments of the population.
Qualitative improvements in vocational training programs wouAid therefore
enhance equity by providing more practical job skills for vocational trairnees,



-8-
including training for women, not only in traditionally female trades such as
textiles   and   commercial   specializations,   but   also   in   industrial
specializations such as electronics, which have begun to attract significant
numbers of female applicants.
Government Education/Train  Priorities and Bank Le     Strate
A. Government Priorities
1.17     Since  independence  in  1956, government  efforts  in  the  education
sector have focussed on expansion of the school capacity at all levels, on
Moroccanization of the teaching staff and on developing new programs
consistent with the needs of a growing economy.  The Government has recently
undertaken, with Bank support (Education Sector Loan, Loan No. 2664-MOR), a
broad education reform program which concentrates on expanding basic schooling
and improving its quality and efficiency and on providing vocational training
to as many school leavers as possible, particularly at the skilled worker and
technician  levels  (para.  1.16).   The  current  development  of  vocational
training capacity focuses on specializations in which shortages of skilled
manpower are constraining growth particularly in the electromechanical
industries (para. 1.06) and on trades suitable for self-employment.  A study
of medium-term manpower needs being carried out by the MOP and a series of
studies initiated by the MPW (paras. 1.03 and 1.07) will identify other
priority areas and provide guidance for program design and development.
B. Bank Lending Strateg
1.18     Although other external sources have supported particular elements of
rhe education program I', the Bank has had the most sustained and the most
comprehensive involvement in the education sector since 1963, as reflected in
the seven education/training projects (four of which are ongoing) and in the
sector work and government policy discussions which led to a recent FY86
sector  adjustment  loan  and  reform  program  (para.  1.17).   Consistent with
government needs and priorities, Bank lending in the sector has evolved irom
an initial focus on reinforcement of general education (primary and secondary)
to its current emphasis on reinforcing employment-oriented skill training and
on introducing structural reforms to improve the efficiency, financial
viability, and employment orientation of education at all levels.  With the
exception of direct support through small project components for manpower
1/ Most notable of these are the UNICEF support for primary teacher training
in practical activities, the ongoing programs of technical assistance for
teacher training provided by French, Canadian and Belgian aid, and the
extensive cooperation program through which France provided teachers at
subsidized rates to all parts of the education system (ended in 1984).
The vocational training programs of the Office have also benefitted from
external support: from the European Economic Community (EEC) to expand the
Office's network of post secondary technician training institutes, and
from USAID to enlarge Office industrial training programs for girls.



-9-
training in the sectors of forestry (Second Education Project), and healta,
tourism and rural development (Third Education Project), the thrust of Bank
lending has been in support of the formal education systems particularly of
basic education and technical and engineering specializations and has
attempted to improve both internal and external efficiency of education
through curriculum reform, upgrading teacher skills, and improving teaching
equipment.  A concerted program of sector work was carried out  in  1981  to
review issues and objectives in the education/training sector.  The findings
and recommendations of this work (Sector Survey Report No. 4105-MOR, August
1983), together with those of a subsequent special study on the costs of
primary and secondary schooliag (Special Study Report No. 5508-MOR, February
1985) were discussed with the Government as a basis for the reform program.
The First Vocatiotial Training Project (FY86) extends Bank involvement to the
complementary area of middle-level skill training to meet pzivate sector
manpower needs, particularly in the industrial sector.   It also suppo-ts the
development of a national training program in project identification,
preparation and appraisal, an area in which current deficiencies have hampered
investment planning and implementation in all sectors.  The proposed project
builds on the First Vocational Training Project by consolidating measures
already initiated to enhance the quality of vocational training programs.
Specifically, the proposed project would improve the quality and management of
vocational training in order to consolidate the recent expansion.
1.19     The  project  completion  reports  and  related  PPARs  indicate  the
desirability of: (i) ensuring as adequate and complete a preparation of
project components as possible prior to Board Presentation; (ii) concentrating
project components in a single ministry with good implementation capacity;
and (iii) close and continuous monitoring of TA.  The design of the proposed
Second Vocational Training Project is consistent with these lessons of past
project implementation and the reform program; an important feature is the
impressive implementation record of the VTA and the Office which would execute
the project (paras. 3.12 and 3.13).  Procurement of construction and equipment
in the First Vocational Project is more than one year in advance of appraisal
estimates.
H. THE PROJECT
2.01     The project was identified by the Government during a September 1985
Bank mission, and prepared with the assistance of a Bank mission in
January/February  1986.   It  wsq  appraised  in April/May  1986.   The  project
focuses on consolidating and improving the quality of Morocco's vocational
training system and on implementation of cost reduction and cost  recovery
plans.   The project  is consistent with Government  priorities  for  economic
recovery and development and with Bank strategy for lending in Morocco.
Project Obiectives and Scope
2.02     The  proposed  vocational  training  project  would  address  the  key
vocat onal training issues described in paras. 1.12 to 1.16.  Accordingly, tthe
project would assist the Government to:



- 10 -
(a)  improve the quality of the Office skill training programs in order to
meet labor market demand for skilled manpower and to increase
employment   opportunities    for   skilled   workers   in   priority
specializations and for technicians in electronics, by improving
training  facilities,  by  improving  the  content  of  the  training
programs (including the introduction of entrepreneurship training),
and by upgrading instructor skills;
(b)  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  vocational  training  system  by
decentralizing   its   planning,   administration   and   maintenance,
enhancing its responsiveness to local labor markets by improving
coordination, and by implementing the recommendations of studies on
cost reduction and cost recovery; and
(c)  improve equity by increasing income earning opportunities (including
self employment) for lower income groups who traditionally enroll in
vocational training programs; this would be achieved by better
adaptation of the content, pedagogy and duration of training programs
to evolving labor-market needs.
2.03     To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  proposed  project  would  include
provision for:
(a)  The Office:  (i) re-equipping and minor refurbishing of 33 existing
VTCs  for indubtrial and commercial  specializations  at  the skilled
worker level, and electronics equipment for 15 IATs at the technician
level; (ii) establishment of an in-plant instructor training program,
provision of training for staff responsible for designing skill
training programs, and introduction of an entrepreneurship training
program; (iii) minor construction and equipping of 10 training/repair
service units in 10 VTCs; and (iv) minor construction and equipping
of 10 regional coordination units and equipping of 50 sub-regional
planning management units to assist in the decentralization of the
Office, and provision of 10 mobile maintenance units.
(b)  The VTA:  establishment of local training capacity in planning  and
management through development of training programs and the provision
of equipment.
(c)  Technical Assistance, including expert services (132 man-months) and
fellowships (309 man-months), related to the above components, and
studies.
The number of existing training places to be re-equipped through the Project
is given in Table 2.1.

Project Description
A. The Office
2.04     Re-equipping and Refurbishing of VTCs and Electronics Equipment for
IATs. This component would finance the re-equipping and minor refurbishing of
33 existing Office VTCs.  These priority VTCs were selected by the Office in
consultation with local officials and representatives of the Regional Training
Councils, taking into account employment opportunities and prospects in the
regions  (Map).   The  centers  are  designed  to  pl2vide  training  programs
averaging 18 months in duration in 23 industrial and commercial speciali-
zations (Annex 8).  Most enrollments (64%) are in industrial specializations
while 24% are in construction and 12% in commerce.  These VTCs also operate a
second shift to provide skill upgrading progra"s specially designed to meet
specific  employer  requirements.   The project would increase output of these
upgrading courses by 50Z.   The VTC  training  programs  are  well-subscribed:
there are three times as many applicants as training positions.   Consistent
with  Government  priorities,  the  current  percentage  of  females  in  Office
industrial and construction courses is 7% and rising.  In some specializations
(accounting,  typing, home economics) the majority of students is female and
the proportion of females in other courses (e.g. electronics, automation,
technical drawing) is steadily increasing.
2.05     Given the especially critical shortage of electronic technicians, the
project would provide assistance for curriculum development and additional
equipment for a revised electronics technician training program conducted at
15 IATs.  Curriculum materials for the program would be prepared under the TA
component.  tpgrading training would he provided for 3Cu existing electronic
instructors  to enable them to implement the new electronics program with the
assistance of expert services (para. 2.12).



- 12 -
2.06     In-service and In-plant Instructor Training Programs.   Two  thousand
now instructors received one year's training in the period 1984-86 in order to
meet the Office's urgent and rapidly expanding staffing needs.  Many of them
do not have the requisite industrial experience.   'he project would provide
these  instructors  exposure  to  industry  through  in-plant  training.   The
Instructor Training Center, under construction and scheduled for completion in
late 1986, will have adequate capacity to provide the Office with the 100 new
instructors annually needed. However, a permanent in-service training program
for the Office's instructors is not yet in place.  The project would provide
TA to assist in the design of such a program and train instructors to conduct
the program (para. 2.12).
2.07     Design and Development of Training Programs.  The Office VTC training
programs,   averaging   18   months   in   duration,   are   being   implemented
successfully.  However, in order to keep these programs abreast of changing
technology and to minimize unit costs, their content and duration need to be
periodically  reviewed and  revised  in the light of employers'  needs.  Many
small and medium enterprises, which lack facilities to conduct their owl
training programs, often require more advanced or specially tailored programs
which need to be developed and delivered.   In addition, courses need to be
introduced to advise and assist trainees interested in starting up their own
small business.   To support these various curriculum development activities,
the project would provide the Office's programs division with expert services,
staff training, microcomputers and printing equipment in order to (a)
introduce additional short specialization/upgrading courses; (b) introduce
entrepreneurship training in the regular VTC programs and in evening courses;
and  (c)  initiate  short-duration  pre-employment  training  programs.   These
curriculum development activities would enhance the quality and relevance of
vocational training programs, and improve income opportunities for the lower
income groups which traditionally are more heavily represented in vocational
training programs.
2.08     Traininx/Repair Service Units.   The Government  and  the Office  are
exploring the possibility of reducing the operational costs of vocational
training by generating additional revenues from paid services.   The proposed
project would provide simplp building extensions, equipment and TA to
establish and run pilot training/repair service units in 10 Office VTCs in
such fields as auto maintenance and repair, radio/TV repair, air-conditioning
maintenance and repair, househcld appliance maintenance and repair, buildings
maintenance and repair, woodwork, and printing.  The 10 VTCs where the units
would be located were selected by local officials, based on local market
demand.  The units will combine practical training (including entrepreneurship
training) with the provision of paid services.  Income generated by the units
would help reduce recurrent costs of the 10 VTCs by financing material
purchases and equipment renewal.
2.09     Decentralization of Office Management.   Decentralization  to provide
greater local autonomy in vocational policy making and financing is important
if the Office is to respond flexibly to the needs of local labor markets.
Following the results of a recent study of the Office administration, the
Office decided to establish 10 regional coordination units (of which 3 are
already  operational)  and  to  assign  to  VTC  and  IAT  directors  direct
responsibility for budgets, trainee recruitment and placement and links with



- 13 -
the private  sector.  Under this decentralization program,  directors of 50
larger training institutions (15 IATs and 35 VTCs) would be responsible for
supervising the management of a number of smaller institutions in their area.
The 10 regional coordination units would be responsible for implementation of
regional vocational training policy and for liaison with the Office's
Ieadquarters as well as with regional VTA representatives.  They would also
provide  assistance  in  planning,  administration  and  maintenance  for  the
institutions  located in their region.  These  ten  regional  units  would  be
equipped  with  a  small  truck equipped  with b; S1c  tools  and  manned  by  a
technician and a skilled electro-mechanical mainttnance worker.  These mobile
units would maintain VTC equipment on a regular basis so as to relieve
pressures  on  the  central  Office  maintenance  service  (para.  1.10).   The
proposed project would provide equipment (microcomputers, office equipment,
ten mobile maintenance units and sa-e light vehicles), as well as minor civil
works for the ten coordination units within existing IATs, and microcomputers,
office equipment and light vehicles for the 50 IATs and VTCs participating in
the  decentralization  program.   The  project  would  also  finance  a  local
management training program for the 10 regional coordinators and the 50 center
directors.
B. ITe VTA
2.10     rhe VTA  is responsible  for  the coordination of the national  and
private vocational training systems (para. 1.11).  Under the proposed project,
the VTA would improve its system of accreditation and quality control of
private vocational training programs, and the project would provide TA to
strengthen this important function.  The project would also provide consultant
services to help upgrade thnt skills of VTA staff, and data processing
equipment and other office equipment to enhance the planning and management
capacity of the VTA.
C. Technical Assibtance (TA)
2.11     To support the implementation of the Office and VTA components, the
proposed project would provide expert/consultant services, fellowships and
financing for a series of studies, as detailed in paras. 2.12-2.14.
Assurances would be obtained during negotiations that TA would commence no
later than September 30, 1987 according to a schedule to be agreed by the
Bank.  Job description3,  required qualifications and experience of experts,
and outlined objectives are presented in Annex 13.
2.12     The proposed project would provide 132 man-months  expert/consultant
services  to  the Office to help:   (a) restructure and update  the  training
programs  (para.  2.07)--24  man-months;  (b)  update  and  help  manage  the
in-service instructor training programs and initiate a complementary in-plant
training  program  (para.  2.06)-48  man-months;  (c)  organize  and  set  in
operation the training/repair service units to be provided by the project
(para. 2.08)--24 man-months; (d) improve the trainee testing and certification
system  (para. 1.13)-18 man-months; and (e) irplement a management training
program   (para.  2.09)--6  man-months.  The  project  would   also   provide
expert/consultant  services  to the VTA to improve staff skills in planning,
management and coordination of vocational training--6 man-months, and to
improve  the  accreditation  system  for  private  vocational  schiools  (para.
2.10)--6 man-months.



*- 14 -
2.13     To help the Office improve the quality and relevance of its programs
the project would provide 309 man-months of fellowships for:  (a) VTC and IAT
directors to urgrade their knowledge in planning and management and prepare
them for the decentralized management of Office operations; (b) instructor
trainers to update their knowledge and prepare them for the operation of the
instructor training center now under construction; (c) senior instructors to
upgrade their knowledge in program design, focussing on new specializations
for which expertise in the country is scarce; (d) curriculum development
specialists to upgrade their knowledge in design methodology and in particular
in the use of computer technology; (e) guidance counsellors to broaden and
deepen  their  knowledge  in  training  planning  and  orientation;  and   (f)
specialists in testing methods  to upgrade their knowledge in this area.  The
details of the fellowships program are shown in Annex 13.
2.14     Studies.   The  project  would  include  60  man-months  of  consultant
services to the VTA for studies on manpower needs in several key economic
sectors, planning, management and evaluation of the vocational training
system, employment counselling and tracer studies for graduates of the system,
and other studies  (Annex 13).   The Government will exchange  views  with  the
Bank on the results of these studies and will promptly implement the
recommendations on the basis of this exchange of views (para. 5.01 (b)).

A summary presentation of estimated project costs, by project component and by
category of expenditure appears in Annex 9.
3.02     Basis  of  Cost  Estimates.   Construction  cost  estimates  for  minor
extensions (Regional Coordination Offices and Repair Service Units) are based
on recent contracts for similar types of construction in Morocco with
adjustment for regional cost differences.
3.03     Estimated equipment costs are products of: (a) lists provided by the
VTA and the Office and (b) current CIF unit prices adjusted to include local
transportation costs and,  where appropriate,  installation costs.   Equipment
costs per training place in all Office institutions assisted under the project
are estimated at an average of US$1,200, which is comparable with those of
other Bank-wide financed facilities of this type (Annex 9).  Use factor for
Office workshops would be about 80X, which is acceptable.
3.04     Estimated  costs  for  TA  services  including  training  are  based  on
recent   TA   contracts  in  Morocco  and  include  salary,   fees,  overhead,
international   travel   and   subsistence.    Unit   costs   for   international
consultants are based on recent similar financial proposals from the
International  Labor  Organization.   Base  cost  estimates  reflect  prices  as
projected for negotiations (November 1986).



- 17 -
3.05     Customs Duties and Taxes.   Project cost estimates include duties or
taxes only for the local cost components of civil works, locally manufactured
furniture and local support for consultanta, and amount to about US$0.5
million. All materials and equipment imported for the project are exempt from
duties or taxes.
3.06     Contingency Allowances.   Project cost estimates include contingency
allowances fcr: (a) physical factors, equivalent to 10 of the estimated base
cost of all the project components to allow for unforeseen expenditures, and
(b) price escalation covering the period from negotiations to initial
expenditures in accordance with the implementation schedule (Annex 10) and the
following projected annual rates of price escalation:
Projected Annual Price Escalation Rates
1987     1988      1989      1990     1991      1992
Foreign Costs          6.82      6.82      7.02      7.0S     4.0%      4.0Z
Local Costs            8.01      8.0%      8.0X     8.0%      8.0%      8.02
At these rates, prices are projected to increase during the project
implementation period by a total of 241 for civil works, 281 for equipment,
and 231 for TA.  Aggregated price increases are estimated at 22.7% of base
costs   plus   physical   contingencies.    Together,   physical   plus   price
contingencies are equiva'ent to 32.7% of base costs.
3.07     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$ 22.3 million,  or about 801 of total estimated project  costs.   The
estimation of the foreign exchange component is based on mission estimates of
indirect foreign exchauige components of civil works, architectural services,
and locally manufactured furniture and on the expectation that: (a) all labor
and most of the materials for civil works will be available locally, and that
all construction contracts wilt. be awarded to locally based contractors; (b)
all equipment and furniture will be imported; and (c) consultant services wi'l
be provided from foreign sources.  The resulting foreign exchange content of
each category of expenditure is as follows: civil works, 501 l'; furniture
and equipment, 871; and TA, 811.
3.08     Financial  Plan.   The proposed Bank  loan of  US$22.3  million  would
finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  the project.   The Government would
finance the remaining US$5.6 million estimated  local  costs of  the project,
including local taxes and duties.   The Borrower would make available US$21.3
million equivalent to the Office under a grant basis.  The proposed financing
plan for the project is summarized in Table 3.3:
I/  Foreign exchange for civil works is high because refurbishing of existing
VTCs will use imported, or indirectly imported, materials such aa
electrical   fittings   and   appliances,   sanitary   appliances,   roofing
materials, painting and glazing, etc.

3.09     Recurrent Expenditures and Cost Recovery.   Because the project does
not create any additional training places, no increase in staff will be
needed.   Salary  expenditures  for  the  programs  would,  therefore,  not  be
affected.  The single  recurrent  ex-...nditure category which  is projected  to
increase under the project is the modest increase in expenditures for
expendable stocks of workshop materials associated with the workshop equipment
to be provided under  the project.   This cost  is expected  to bo partially
offset by receipts from the repair services to be introduced under the project
(para. 2.08).  In addition, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that it
would charge and collect from private enterprises a vocational training tax
and use other measures if necessary, sufficient to ensure that the revenues
provided  shall  cover  the  following  percentages  of  the  Office's  annual
operating expenses:  80% in the 1988 fiscal year, 90% in the 1989 fiscal year,
and 100% in the 1990 fiscal year (para. 5.01 (a)).  A draft action plan for
cost recovery, confirmed during negotiations, is contained in Annex 14.
3.10     Investment Fxpenditures.   The discounted benefits of the project in
terms of improved productivity of trained graduates are expected to very
significantly   exceed   the   present   value   of  project   costs--consisting
exclusively of investment costs because of tbe absence of significant
incremental recurrent costs (para. 3.09).  Given the time profile of expected
benefits and costs, discounted benefits of the project would fully offset
discounted costs as long as the average increment in worker productivity
exceeds US$81 per year I    As this amounrt is less than 5% of the recorded

differential  between  skilled  worker  productivity  and  unskilled  worker
productivity, it is highly likely that the project will increase worker
productivity by at least this amount.
Project Implementation
3.11     Implementation Period.  As shown in the implementation  schedule  in
Annex 10, the refurbishing, furnishing and equipping of all institutions, and
TA programs are scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1992.  The Closing Date
would be December 31, 1992.  The implementation period (6 years)is below the
regional average of eight years because the proposed project includes only
purchase of equipment, TA, and minor works, and because 952 of the proposed
project would be implemented by the Office whose Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) is competent, experienced and sufficiently staffed.
3.12     Project Management.   Details of the organizatiorn of the VTA and the
Office  are  provided  in Annexes  6 and  7.  The  Directorate  of  Vocational
Training   Planning   (Direction   de   la   Planification   de   la   Formation
Pro&essionnelle)  of  the  VTA  (Annex  7)  would  be  responsible  for  the
implementation of all aspects of the VTA component including: (a) procurement
of micro-computers and office equipment; (b) consulting services; dnd (c)
studies  included  in  the  project.   Implementation  of  the  Office  project
component would be carried out by the Office, under the responsibiiity of its
Director  General  (Annex  6).   This  component  includes:   (a)  10  regional
coordination offices; (b) refurbishing and/or equipping of 33 VTCs and 15
IATs; (c) 10 training/repair service units; (d) purchase of 10 maintenance
mobile units;  (e) office equipment  and furniture  for 50 existing  IATs and
VTCs; and (f) TA program (consultant services, local training, fellowships and
related training materials) related to this component.
3.13     The experienced staff of the VTA Directorate of Vocational Training
Planning  (para.  1.11)  and  of  the  Office  are  considered  competent  to
successfully  implement  the  above  program.   The  Office  has  demonstrated
efficient  implementation  performance:   the on-going  project  (Loan 2479-MOR)
whici started in October 1984 is 60% complete, disbursements are on schledule
and  physical  implementation  is  one  year  ahead  of  SAR  schedule.   Thi.s
performance is not only due to adequate staffing, but also to streamlined
administrative procedures.  Also in the past, the Office has been able to make
payments to contractors and suppliers without the delays which often arise
witlh t:he Ministry of Finance approval procedures applicable to ministries---a
source  of  difficulties  experienced  by  previous  Bank  assisted  education
projects.
.3.1.4    Monitoring_  and   Evaluation.    Vocational   training   programs   are
regularly monitored and evaluated by the VTA and the Office.  The VTA and the
Office carry out periodic micro surveys to ensure that programs match
employment  needs,  and  advisory  councils  provide  continuous  feedback  from
employers.   The Office also conducts tracer studies on job placement of its
vocational  training  graduates.   These  activities  will  be  maintained  and
reinforced under project TA (paras. 2.12 and 2.14). The Office will also
improve its capacity to implement program changes arising  from findings  of
-egional manpower surveys.   The VlA and  the Office would submit quarteclv
progress reports to the Bank.



- 20 -
3.15     Equipment.   Preliminary  equipment  lists  have  been  reviewed  and
detailed equipment lists for the VTA as well as for the Office project
component are under preparation in both organizations. These are scheduled to
be  finalized  for  Bank  review by June 1987.  Bids  for equipment would be
received between January 1988 and December 1988. Equipment would be delivered
and installed by suppliers upon completion of the training facilities for
which they are destined.
3.16     Technical  Assistance  4nd  Studies.   Draft  terms  of  reference  and
schedulee of implementation for ensultant services, fellowships programs,
programs for local training and pi-nned seminars to be organized by both
organizations and details of the studies to be conducted by the VTA were
prepared during appraisal, and are presented in Annex 13.  The implementation
schedule relating to the TA program (Table A, Annex 13) was agreed at
negotiations.
3.17     Procurement.   Proposed  procurement  procedures   for   the  project
components are summarized in Table 3.4:

3.18     Civil Works.  Contracts for civil works to be financed under the loan
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB).  In view
of: (a) the wide geographic distribution of institutions to be refurbished or
extended; and (b) the small average contract value (less than US$100,000),
there is an anticipated lack of interest by foreign firma, as experienced in
the ongoing Fourth and Fifth Education Projects and in the First Vocational
Training  Project.   Prevailing  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  are
generally consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution
of  the  project.   There  are,  however,  a  few  procedures  which  require
modification  in order to be acceptable  to the Bank.  These procedures and
actions  to  improve  them are  detailed  in Annex  12.   During  negotiations,
understanding was obtained from the Government and the Office that LCB
procedures for procurement under the proposed loan would be modified so as to
be acceptable to the Bank.
3.19     Equipment.   All  equipment  to be financed under the proposed loan
would be grouped to the extent possible in large packages of over US$100,000
for  bulk  procurement  under  the  following  procedures:   items  exceeding
US$100,000 equivalent estimated value per contract would be procured on the
basis  of  ICB  in  accordance  with  Bank  guidelines.   Items  which  cannot
practically be grouped in bid packages of more than US$100,000 equivalent
estimated value, could be procured on the basis of quotatioiAs from at least
three qualified manufacturers or suppliers.  Procurevrent of equipment items by
means other than ICB would be subject to an aggregate value limit of US$2.0
million equivalent (corresponding to about 101 of the total estimated value of
equipment and furniture requirements,  including contingency allowances).   In
the comparison of bids obtained on the basis of ICB, local manufacturers would
be allowed a margin of preference equal the existing rate of customs duties
applicable to competing imports, or 151 of the CIF price, whichever is lower.
Prior   Bank   review   of   procurement   documentation   and  contract   award
recommendations would be required for all equipment and furniture contracts to
be awarded on the basis of ICB.
3.20     Technical Assistance would be tendered to the extent possible as two
comprehensive packages (studies for the VTA and consultant services and
fellowships for the Office) in order to ensure integrated approaches to the
vocational training system development.   To keep the bidding and evaluation
process manageable, not more than six qualified TA firms would be requested to
submit  proposals.   The  TA  firms  would  be  selected  in  accordance  with
principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank on the basis of the
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency".

3.21     Accounts and Audits.  The Government would maintain accounts for the
VTA component and the special account.  The Office would maintain accounts to
reflect  its operations.  These accounts and the Office financial statements
would be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; snd the VTA and the Office
would each furnish to the Bank, within six months of the end of each fiscal
year,  certified  copies  of  the  audit  reports  (para.  5.01  (d)).   During
negotiations, assurances to this effect were obtained from the Government and
the Office.

3.22     Disbursements.  The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of
six years, as shown in Annex 11.  This  implementation period  is below the
regional average of eight years because the proposed project includes only
purchase of equipment, TA, and minor works.  Disbursements would be made on
the basis of:
The Office
(a)  Civil Works:  502 of total expenditures (US$2,000,000 equivalent);
(b)  Furniture  and  Equipment  (including  vehicles):   100l   of  foreign
expenditures, 100I of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 80% of
local expenditures for other items procured locally (US$16,500,000
equivalent); and
(c)  Technical Assistance:
Consultant services: 100% of total expenditures
(US$1,400,000 equivalent)
Fellowships:           100% of total expenditures
(US$1,400,000 equivalent).
The VTA
(d)  _quipment  (including vehicles):   100% of foreign expenditures,  1002
of   local  expenditures   (ex-factory   cost)   and   80Z   of   local
expenditures    for   other   items   procured   locally   (US$250,000
equivalent);
(b)  TecUnical  Assistance:   100Z  of  total  expenditures  of  consultant
services (US$750,000 equivalent).
A  special  account  will  be  opened  and  maintained  in  a  financial
instituLtiorn acceptable to the Bank and on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the  Bank  and  will  be  operated  in accordanAe  with  Bank  guidelines.   The
authorized allocation of the special account would be US$400,000 equivalent.
During  negotiations,  assurances  to  this  effect  were  obtained  from  the
Government.   Withdrawals  for civil works  contracts  valued  up  to  US$50,000
equivalent, and for fellowships and equipment, furniture and vehicle contracts
valued up to US$30,000 equivalent, will be made on the basis of statements of
expenditut-es (SOEs).
TV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The proposed  project would assist  in meeting  the skilled manpower
requirements of the Moroccan economy in the 1990s.  By improving the quality
and the eIfficiency of the vocational training system, the proposed project
would make a significant contribution toward meeting urgent labor market needs
for skilled manpower.  In particular,  the project  would alleviate critical
shortages of electronic technicians in industry.   The project is expected to
lead to a significant improvement in productivity and earnings of graduates.



- 23 -
4.02     The proposed project would also serve to address the equity concerns
of the Government by increasing employment opportunities (including self-
employment) for lower income groups who traditionally enroll in vocational
training programs. It would also enhance employment opportunities for females
at  the  skilled  and  technician  levels.   Female participation  in vocational
training programs (currently about 72) is steadily rising and new programs
such as electronics are likely to enhance it (para. 2.04).
4.03     The efficiency and effectiveness  of the vocational  training system
would be improved through better management and improved linkages with
industry and employers as a result of the project support for the Government's
decentralization plan.   Together with other  initiatives being  taken by  the
Government (para. 1.16), the proposed project is expected to support the
planned expansion of industrial sector output and would provide benefits to
employers in the form of improved productivity.  However, the proposed project
will not add any significant recurrent costs.  It will, in fact, contribute to
reduction of the Government's financial burden for vocational training through
the introduction of measures to achieve full cost recovery (para. 3.09 and
Annex 14).
Ris
4.04     The most  identifiable risk is that project implementation could be
slowed by budgetary shortages in the context of the Government's current
fiscal austerity program.   Ongoing  Bank-financed  education  projects  (except
the First Vocational Training Project, which is being implemented more than
one year ahead of schedule) have experienced delays from this source averaging
about 12 months. However, the proposed project, which constitutes the highest
priority part of the Government's initial plan for vocational training
investment, is among the Government's core program of investments for
immediate  implementation.   The necessary funds to implement the project are
programmed in the 1986 Loi de Finances and draft laws for 1987, and subsequent
years. Moreover, officials of the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Finance and
Planning have confirmed the priority commitment of the Government to the
proposed  vocational  training  project.   This  commitment  has  recently  been
confirmed at the highest level of Government.  In view of this commitment, and
in view of the highly desirable recurrent cost recovery which would occur
under the project, it is foreseen that the project will be adequately funded
to ensure timely implementation.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  the Government would charge and collect from private enterprises a
vocational training tax at levels sufficient to ensure that the
revenues provided by such tax and other measures if necessary, shall
cover the following percentages of the Office's annual operating
expenses:  80% in the 1988 fiscal year, 90% in the 1989 fiscal year,
and 1001 in the 1990 fiscal year (para. 3.09).

(b)  the consultants'  services  (including  those  for studies)  would  be
provided in accordance with a timtable satisfactory to the Bank, as
reflected in Annex 13, and the Office would provide the Bank with an
acceptable action plan for fellowships within a year after the loan
becomes  effective  (paras.  2.11  and  3.16).   The  Government  would
exchange views with the Bank on the results of these studies and
would promptly implement  the recommendations on the basis of  this
exchange of views (para. 2.14).
(c) a special account would be opened and maintained on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank and the special account wculd be
operated in accordance with Bank guidelines (para. 3.22); and
(i) the Government would maintain accounts for the VTA component and the
special account.  The Office would maintain accounts to reflect its
operations.  These accounts and the Office financial statements would
be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing prin-
ciples by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and the VTA
and the Office would each furnish to the Bank, within six months of
the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of the audit reports
(para. 3.21).
5.02     Subject to the ab%ove conditions,  the project  provides  a  suitable
basis for a Bank. loan of US$22.3 million to the Kingdom of Morocco for a term
of 20 years, including 5 years of grace at the current variable interest rate.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
The National Office of Vocational Traip4jn  (the Office)
Status and Administration
1.       The Office is a public enterprise with financial autonomy created in
1974 with the principal objectives to: (i) train the necessary technical
manpower; (ii) adapt training to the specific needs of the labor market; and
(iii) promote the social advancement of workers. Originally the Office was
under the authority of the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training. In
1981, it was transferred to the Ministry of Planning and in 1984 to the
Ministry of Public Works which was renamed Ministry of Public Works,
Vocational Training and Staff Training.
2.       The Office is administered by a board of directors presided by the
Minister of Public Works and composed of 28 members representing the
Government (14), the employers (7) and the labor force (7). The internal
administrative structure of the Office (page 7) is highly centralized; hence,
the difficulty in coping with the expanded training system. Decentralization
is being considered and the proposed project would contribute to this effect.
For each training institution or for each city (if there are more than one
training center in the same city) there is an upgrading council (Conseil de
perfectionnement) which deals with specific questions concerning each training
center such as practical tests, labor market requirements, training within
industry, adaptation of programs, placement of graduates, etc. The Chairman
of the upgrading Council is a local employer and the Vice Chairman and
Secretary the Director of the Training Center.
Training Facilities and Enrollments
3.       The Office offers pre-employnent technician and skilled and
semi-skilled worker programs covering several specializations in the
industrial and commercial sectors and two (tailoring and dress making) in the
services sector. Its training facilities include institutes of technology or
ITAs (Instituts de Technologie Applique) for technician training and training
centers and mobile units for skilled and semi-skilled worker training. There
are four types of training centers: (i) Vocational Training Centers or CQPs
(Centres de Qualificatiion Professionnelle) which are mainly industrial.;
(ii) Commercial Training Centers or CCSs (Centres de Comptabilite et
Secretariat); (iii) Tailoring (and dress making) Centers or CFPTs (Centres de
Formation Professicnnelle-Tailleurs); and (iv) Construction-Project Training
Centers or CPBs (Contres du Project Batiment). The ITAs also run some skilled
worker courses and certain CQPs also run commercial programs. Table 1
summarizes the enro lments by program for the years 1980/81, 1983/84, 1984/85
and 1985/86.

In addition to the pre-employment programs there are in-service traininIg or
work promotion programs comprising correspondence courses, functional
training, seminars, technical upgrading and evening courses.  Enro1ilielnts iln
such courses reached some 10,000 in 1984/85.
Institutes of Applied Technology (ITAs)
4.       ITAs are post-secondary institutions offering courses for technicians
and instructors. Entrants requirements to technician training courses are:
(i) completion of the 7th secondary grade in a science, economics, mathematics
or technician option; (ii) 19 year. of age, minimum; and (iii) passinlg of a
selective psycho-technical test. Graduates of vocational training centers
(CQPs) can be accepted provided their performance during training was
exceptionally good and that they fulfill the other requirements including some
10 general education subjects, 80S workshop practice and related theory and
l0S work in industry. They cover 20 specializations.
5.       Instructor training programs were introduced in 1964 as two-year
programs parallel to the technician programs their curricula being especially
designed to incorporate, together with the technical subjects, pedagogical and
teaching knowledge. In September 1981, the instructor training prog7ams were
revised to become an extension of the technician programs by the addition of a
third year for pedagogical training and practical work in industry. The
Office also trains at request, a limited number of instructors for other
training agencies and from other countries.
Vocational Training Centers (CQPs)
6.       rhe CQPs focus on industrial and construction training at skilled
worker level, although a number of them have also commercial and/or tailoring
sections. The majority of training programs last two year (a few last only
oi,e year) and are of a modular character. Their general structure is given in
Table 2.

At present there are 26 speciali'3ations offered at this level. Entrants to
skilled worker courses must have c.iaipleted the 4th secondary grade and passed
a test in general knowledge (mathemiatics, Arabic and French) organiized at the
national level.  The Commercial Training Ceniters (CC^s) offer two-year courses
or accountants ani. secretaries and one-year courses for assistant accountants
and typists.
Semi-SkiLled Worker Training Centers (Specialization)
7.       At this level thert ate: (i) the tailoring Training Centers which
offer two-year courses in tailoring and one-year courses in dress making for
trainers who have completed tbe 2nd secondary grade; and (ii) the Construction
Project Centers (CPBs) which were established in 1976 with the participation
of local authorities to meet urgent needs in this field.
Work Promotion Activities
8.       Under this heading are included: apprenticeship training; training
through mobile units; correspondence courses; functional training; seminars on
accounting and secretarial; technical upgrading, and evening courses.
Aprenticeshi ,Training
9.       Apprenticeship training is at an experimental stage with some 500
apprentices placed in 108 enterprises in Greater Casablanca. The terms of
apprenticeship are regulated by a circular of the Ministry of Labor (14 April
1981). Employers' comments on the pilot experiment show that there are still
a number of issues to be resolved prior to the official introduction of the
scheme, if employers are to participate willingly and effectively. Among
their main preoccupations are: the non-coverage of the apprentices by the
Social Security; the fact that they already pay the training tax; and
difficulties resulting from the young (immature) age of the apprentice. A
study on apprenticeships included in the first vocational training project is
to provide guidance for further action.
Mobile Units
10.      The main objectives of training through mobile units is to
decentralize training and reach more rural areas. Mobile units consist of a
mobile classroom/workshop cabin, especially equipped for training, which can
bo transported by a vehicle. So far the mobile units are centrally operated

and run three types of programs as follows: (i) introduction to training (6-10
weeks) addressed to persons who can read and write and has an objective to
train for simple operations and current equipment maintenance and repair;
(ii) training - addressed to primary school graduates, lasts four to six
months and aims at imparting basic technical knowledge in the disciplines
concerned; and (iii) complementary or upgrading training - addressed to
already working persons and aiming at improving and/or complementing their
knowledge. The duration of these courses varies with the type and level of
knowledge of the trainees. The first vocational training project provided
five additional mobile units which would start functioning in the 1986/87
school year. Two of the new units would be assigned to regions (Fez and
Agadir).
Correspondence Courses
11.      Correspondence courses are addressed to persons living far from
training centers and include nine-month programs in three areas as follows:
(i) Expression Techniques - this is composed of 30 chapters and is intended
for those who have difficulty in written or oral communications in their work;
(ii) Introduction to General Accounting - this consists of 36 courses and it
is addressed to persons who have completed the 4th secondary grade and wish to
learn basic accounting principles; and (iii) Office Organization - this is
composed of 32 courses and it is addressed to secretaries, typists, cashiers
and other office employees who wish to improve their knowledge in this
domain. Correspondence courses w_re initiated as early as 1975 and reached an
average of some 600 trainees per year during the 1975-1979 period. In recent
years the number of participants is greatly reduced (below 200).
Functional Training
12.      Functional training includes mainly seminars intended for industry
supervisors and journeymen and cover topics on human relations, work planning
and organization and on the role of the Office 5.n assisting the enterprises.
Such seminars reach some 2,000 persons per annum. In addition, the Office
organized campaigns on work security and accident prevention for the
enterprises.
Seminars on Accounting and Secretariat
13.      These seminars aim at improving the knowledge of office employees an
cover areas such as general accounting, office work, stock supply and
management, wricten communications, labor legislation and social security.
Their duration varies from two days to a week. An average of 200-250 persons
per annum participate in such seminars.
Technical Upgrading
14.      Technical upgrading activities concern exclusively the industrial
sector and include skill upgrading, complementary training, vocational
adaptation, and retrainiiig. There are two types of upgrading activities,
namely "planned activities" which are of general interest and involve several
enterprises, and "specific acti-ities" s;hich concern a specific enterprise and
are organized at its request. Planned activities have a duration of one to
three weeks and take place mainly in multitrade, specially equipped for this



- 35 -
Annex 6
Page 5 of 7
purpose, workshops or the Office. Specific activities take place within the
requesting industry and may last up to four months. The courses are run by
some 20 instructors with special pedagogical training. This activity involves
500-700 participants per annum.
Evening Courses
15.      Evening courses are offered by practically all institutes and
training centers of the Office and cover most of the specializations offered
in day courses. Such courses last nine months at the rate of six hours per
week and are adapted to the specific requirements of the trainees. Some 200
instructors and 40 directors are directly involved in the organization and
operation of the evening courses. Some 2,500-3,000 trainees per annum
participate in evening courses.
Training Contracts
16.      Training contracts concern mainly the conclusion of contracts between
the Offici and enterprises or professional associations subjected to the law
for vocational training tax. In general, such contracts set the terms for an
up to 50X participation of the Office in training expenses undertaken by the
contractor. The concept of training contracts is foreseen by the vocational
training tax regulation which stipulates that "enterprises organizing training
activities can, at their request, conclude contracts with the Office for the
operation of special training programs." The objectives pursued through the
training contracts are to: instill a "training spirit" within the enterprise,
promote investment in vocational training, and create the conditions necessary
for a continuous skill upgrading adaptation to the requirements of the ever
changing industrial techniques. Data for 1982/83 show that in this year there
were 105 contracts signed out of a total of 126 presented to the Office
Technical Committee for approval. The number of participants was 999 and the
total training lays 32,924. Of the 105 contracts, 29 (28%) concerned training
within the enterprise, 42 (40%) training in local institutions and 34 (32X)
training abroad. Corresponding percentages for 1981/82 were 61, 10 and 19
respectively.
Service for Equipment Maintenance and Repair
17.      There is a special service within the Office which deals with the
maintenance and repair of equipment. The instructor in charge of each
workshop is responsible for the routine maintenance of the equipment in his
workshop. Major preventive maintenance for machinery and repairs take place
at the Central service in Casablanca which occupies some 20 technicians for
this purpose. Each machinery is registered with the service where a log book
is kept. Students of ITAs and CQPs on their "stage en entreprise" participate
in the process of maintenance as part of their "training within industry"
course, mainly by making spare parts for repairs. The service is well
organized and prior to the 1984/85 expansion was functioning effectively.

Curriculum Development
18.      The "programs service" is in charge of curriculum development and
preparation of training programs. The 1981 major revision of the CQP program
for instance, was preceded by a methodical job analysis for each trade carried
out in close collaboration with industry. Based on the results of this
analysis the modular type of programs were introduced on an experimental asis
and then generalized after several modifications. The "programs service"
continues research on the programs and incorporates new modules and units to
keep abreast of industry's requirements. The modular type of program
facilitates the process and allows the construction of special programs
through the combination of a number of modules and units.
Publications Services
19.      This service occupies 13 persons and deals with the publications and
distribution of all the documents which are needed for the operati,n of thie
Office. These include: (i) program outlines and leaflets distributed to all
students at all levels; (ii) work documents such as forms, examination papers,
purchase requests, accounting documents; (iii) all other studies and documents
which are reproduced and circulated by the staff of the Office. Production
reaches some 12 million pages per annum. The equipment includes a small (one
color) offset, duplicators and two electronic stencil machines which are very
old (1963).
Finances
20.      The almost exclusive direct financial resource for the Office is the
Vocational Training Tax. According to Decree No. 2-73-633 (21 May 1974), the
vocational training tax is imposed on all private industrial and commercial
enterprises, insurance agencies, cooperatives and unions as well as on
employers and contractors and those hiring workers for cottage industries.
The tax is equivalent to one per cent of the gross salaries paid. The decree
establishing the Office also foresees as financial resources: state
subsidies, the product of the Office investments, and donations and bequests.
The training tax/recurrent budget relation is shown in Table 3.
