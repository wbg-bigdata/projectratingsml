FLOOD REHABILITATIOH PROJECT
(CREDIT 1587-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Flood
Rehabilitation Project in Bangladesh, for which Credit 1587-BD in the amount
of SDR 31.3 million was approved on April 30, 1985. The credit was closed, as
scheduled, on December 31, 1987 and a disbursement grace period of six months
was allowed after that date. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement
was made on July 6, 1988.
Since the borrower had prepared the PCR following the old PCR
guidelines, this PCR has been prepared by the Task Manager as an 'old style"
PCR. It is based on the President's Report (dated April 11, 1985), the
Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, project files, and
completion reports prepared by the project agencies.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED). The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on March 7, 1991, for
comments by April 18, 1991, but none were received.

(CREDIT 1587-BD)
EVALUWTION SULIOARY
Obiectives
1.      The objective of the project was to assist the Borrower in financing a
high priority program of restoring infrastructure destroyed by the floods that
occurred in Bangladesh in the sumer of 1984.
Implementation Experience
2.      Due to a cimely start of the project, 9CZ of the works were completed
by the closing date and the remainder, which included some additional works
agreed during project implementation, were completed within the six-month
disbursement grace period. The overall quality of construction by all agencies
was satisfactory.
3.      The project proceeded as planned and the credit was 1001 disbursed at
the end of the six-month grace period. The Special Account (SAFE) worked well
though there were problems at the beginning due to an inadequate initial
deposit for the Local Government Division component. This was rectified
quickly by increasing the initial deposit for LGD from SDR 0.95 million to SDR
2.0 million.
4.      The progress reports were submitted on time and the quality of the
reports was good. Audit reports and SOE opinions were submitted regularly and
are up to date.
5.      Both the Bank and the Borrower performed well in respectively
supervising and implementing the project. The project was processed
expeditiously, implementation bottlenecks were identified on time and were
corrected without delay through close coordination. The consultants also
played a vital role in the successful implementation of the project.
Result
6.      The project was successful and exceeded its original physical targets.
As a result of the project, major items of national infrastructure were
repaired to a satisfactory standard.
Sustainability
7.      The issue of sustainability is not relevant as the project was an
emergency operation carried out for restoration of the efficiency of road and
waterway systems constructed earlier under other projects.



vi
Lessons Learned
8.      A timely start and an implementation uninterrupted by a requirement of
prior Government approvals for minor hodifications were keys to the success of
this project. Consultants were vital for the effecti¶e supervision of this
type of project, with a large number of widely scattered repairs, but they
should be engaged at the beginning of the project for proper selection and
implementation of the repairs. For larger contracts, the contractors should be
prequalified and preference should be given to contractors who have previously
completed similar works sutcessfully.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1587-BD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.      Most of Bangladesh is a low-ly'.ng alluvial plain subject to flooding
from both heavy monsoon rainfall and snow melt surges in two of the world's
largest rivers, the Brahmaputra and the Ganges. High ocean tides and cyclones
also cause serious flooding in southern coastal areas. About half of the
country is vulnerable to annual flooding. The substantial damage that these
floods cause in normal years is tolerable because the farming systems are
adapted to and benefit from the floods through recharge of aquifers and
improvements in soil fertility through silt deposition. However, majo' floods
at irregular intervals overwhelm the country's growing flood control
infrastructure, causing tremendous losses.
2.      Nineteen eighty-four was a year of such major flooding, when the
country was devastated by floods covering an estimated 52,520 square
kilometers. The floods were caused by a combination of repeated flash floods
and the blockage of drainage systems by record high rainfall in the central,
southern, southeastern and northern parts of the country. The situation was
exacerbated by the rise of all major rivers to above danger level by the end
of July and the breaking of flood protection embankments at a number of
points, especially along the ri8ht bank of the Brahmaputra. The duration of
the floods was particularly long, continuing from May through September.
3.      Based on estimates of crop losses, equipment and infrastructure
damage, and the relief and rehabilitation activities undertaken by the
Government, the cost of the floods to the economy was estimated at about US$
378 million. In an immediate response Government spent about US$ 109 million
on relief and agricultural rehabilitation efforts. However, farmers and others
connected with agriculture suffered a net loss of about US$ 207 million.
Government sought donor assistance to rehabilitate infrastructure which
suffered an estimated US$ 62 million worth of damage. The project was a
response to that request.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation and Appraisal
4.      The Flood Rehabilitation Project was prepared by staff of the Bank's
Resident Mission in Bangladesh and headquarters staff in the period December
1984 - February 1985. The project was processed as an emergency operation by
both IDA and Government. Reflecting the emergency nature of the operation,
conventional, detailed preparation and appraisal was not undertaken and a
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was not prepared. Similarly, from the Government



2
side, i.ts requirement of a Project Proforma (PP) for the project was also
waived and block allocations to cover all project costs were provided under
the Annual Development Programme (annual capital investment budget). The
credit was negotiated in Washington March 27 through April 02, 1985 and was
signed on May 02, 1985.
Design and Organization
5.      Reflecting experience with the overly complex organization of the
Coastal Area Rehabilitation and Cyclone Protection Project (Credit 339-BD),
the Flood Rehabilitation Project was designed to be implemented directly,
without central coordination, by the four concerned agencies of the
government. These agencies were: (i) Roads and Highways Department (RHD) for
roads and associated structures; (ii) Local Government Division (LGD) for
infrastructure managed by local government authorities; (iii) Bangladesh Water
Development Board (BWDB) for irrigation, drainage, and flood protection works;
and (iv) Inland Water Transport Authority (IWTA) for navigational aids and
other facilities.
6.      Consultant's services were prcvided under the project to RHD, BWDB and
LGD to: (a) check that all sub-projects selected for financing under the
credit were consistent with the criteria agreed between the Government and
IDA; (b) approve the desigi. of project structures and prepare detailed designs
where necessary; (c) monitor the quality and progress of project works; (d)
prepare progress reports; and (e) monitor and assist in preparing applications
for IDA reimbursement. A separate consultancy, under the BWDB, was included to
conduct a Flood Preparedness Study to assess the Government's capability to
respond effectively to flood attaek and to recommend appropriate improved
flood response procedures.
7.      Overall the design and organization of the project, which was but one
element of Government's donor assisted rehabilitation program, were
appropriate to its emergency nature and to local conditions. In particular,
significant reliance on consultants, to assist Government in carrying out
damage assessments and to supervise implementation, was appropriate in view of
the absence of the Bank's normal preparation and appraisal activity.
Objectives and Description
8.      The project was to provide emergency assistance for priority
rehabilitation works to be carried out over a period of two years. Some
critical works, such as flood protection embankments, were to be completed
before the onset of the next flood season, while the larger portion of the
reconstruction activity was to be completed during the FY85/86 dry season. The
project's specific components were:
(a) rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and flood protection
works;
(b) rehabilitation of roads and associated structures;
(c) procurement of road construction equipment;



3
(d) replacement of navigational aids and water-gauging equipment;
(e) repair of river landing jetties; and
(f) provision of technical services by local and foreign consultants.
9.      The IDA credit of US$ 30 million was to ccver about 65Z of the project
costs (US$ 48.25 million), excluding duties and taxes estimated at US$ 1.8
million equivalent. The remaining USS 18.23 million of project costs,
including all taxes and duties, was to be met by the Government (US$ 7.4
million) and from two existing IDA credits, the First and Second Drainage and
Flood Control Projects (864-BD and 1184-BD). Savings available for this
purpose under the two credits were USS 6.S million and US$ 4.0 million
respectively.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
10.     The credit was quickly declared effective, 34 days after signing,
because the only condition for effectiveness was to provide the legal opinion
on the DCA. The result was a timely start of -onstruction activities: about
702 of tne civil works repairs were completed at the end of the first year of
the project. This ultimately enabled completion of 90Z of the works by the
closing date. The remaining repairs were either selected late or were
contracts of long duration. nut of 29 scheduled repairs not cnmpleted at the
closing date by RHD, 19 were bridges and culverts; similarly -or LGD only
bridges were left; all were completed by June 1988. In the elent, the final
quantity of works completed exceeded original targets. The project also
financed the repair and rehabilitation works carried rit by BWDB for the
restoration of damage caused by the May 1985 cyclone and later floods. Because
there had been a substantial fall in the velue of the Taka against the Dollar
and the Dollar against the SDR during the project period, these additional
works could be accommodated. The overa& quality of construction by all
agencies was satisfactory.
11.     Though the implementation of the works program was generally
satisfactory, it would have been better if contractors had been prequalified.
SomL of the delays that occurred werc the result of awarding large contracts
to contractors with known poor performance records.
12.     The project had a provision to procure equipment for  10D and IWTA. No
problem was encountered by RHD because it initiated its procurement
immediately after the credit was signed and all items were or .ered by December
1985. Some additional items, which were later approved, were also procured
without delay and all of these went into service by December 1986.
13.     In contrast, IWTA was slow in procuring its equipment. Initially, IWTA
had procedural problems vis a vis IDA's requirements. These were resolved



4
during a supervision. Eventually all items were procured by the closing date,
except tor 3,000 rft of dredger pipes. These were subsequently financed under
the Second Flood Rehabilitation project (Credit 1876-BD).
14.     Consultants for the project were engaged in July 1985 while the credit
was signed on May 2, 1985. Thus, many works were completed before the
consultants could select, design and supervise them. This resulted in
suboptimal selection and implementation of some early repair works.
15.     The flood preparedness study, which was to have been completed by
December 1986, was actually completed in June 1988, too late to be of use in
connection with the severe floods that occurred in 1987 and 1988. However, the
study provided information for a broader ranging preparedness study initiated
after the particularly severe 1988 floods. The delay to the study was due to
indifference on the part of Government, which led to delays in the selection
and appointment of consultants. The study contributed to knowledge of the
preparedness needs for protection of infrastructure.
16.     Though there were some delays in claiming reimbursements, the credit
was 1002 disbursed within six months after the closing date.
17.     The ovaeration of the project's Special Account (SAFE), one of the
first Bangladesh projects with a SAFE, faced little difficulty except that the
LGD component received an inadequate initial deposit. LGD quickly incurred
expenditures muchi in excess over its initial deposit and faced a work stoppage
because it could not pay contractors. The situation was rectified by
increasing the initial deposit for LGD from SDR 0.95 million to SDR 2.0
million.
18.     The monthly and quarterly progress reports of the project were
submitted on time. The quality of the reports was very good. They contained
detailed and summarized data of physical and financial progress and raised
issues. Audit reports and SOE opinions were submitted regularly but they were
on average about 9 months late.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
Result
19.     The project was successful. ApaiL from the Flood Preparedness study,
it was completed virtually on time and achieved more than the original
physical targets. Though delayed, the study was eventually completed
satisfactorily. As a result of the project, major items of national
infrastructure were repaired to a usable condition.



5
SustaLnabillty
20.     rhe issue of sustainability is not relevant as the project was an
emergency operation carried out for restoration of the efficiency of road and
waterway systems constructed earlier.
V. INSTITUTIONAL VPOMANCE
Bank Performance
21.     IDA's decision to support GOB's priority program of restoring flood
damaged infrastructure was sound, given that without restoration the
efficiency of road and waterway systems would be permanently impaired and
flood protection, irrigation and drainage schemes would not function. The
project was correctly processed as an emergency operation and valuable time
was saved by foregoing the normal preparation and appraisal processes. The
project was well supervised. About 64 staff weeks were spent by the Bank on
formal supervision of the project at an average interval of six months. The
supervision missions were adequately manned, carried out on time and
maintained good continuity. The supervision reports comprehensively covered
all aspects of project implementation and routinely had key project indicators
appended to them. A noteworthy feature of supervision was the identification
of prospective savings by all agencies, during the first supervision in
December 1985, and the recomiLendation that additional works, which became
necessary after the 1985 cyclone, be undertaken. The early identification of
savings and a quick decision to use them for repairing additional damage,
caused by the May 1985 cyclone and later floods, allowed completion of the
additional works within the project period. The savings arose as a result of
unexpectedly large devaluations of the Taka against the SDR and not from over
estimating the costs in local currency. IDA's initial deposit to SAFE,
calculated on the basis of the conventional method of four months requirement,
uas inadequate for implementing this type of emergency operation where
substantial retroactive financing was allowed. However, the problem was
quickly identified and IDA increased the initial deposit to a satisfactory
level (para 17).
Borrower Performance
22.     GOB's agreement to depart from its conventional Project Proforma
process not only helped the project to an early start, but it also allowed the
project scope to be changed without delay during implementation. GOB also
deserves credit for implementing the project virtually on time. The quality of
work was generally good, progress reports were submitted on time and audit
reports, though delayed, were submitted regularly. Adequate funds were
provided throughout the project period and fund releases were also made on
time.
23.     All the agencies of -he project, however, neglected to submit
reimbursement applications to IDA in a timely fashion and they always had a

backlog of claims. IWTA initially failed to follow IDA's procurement
guidelines, however after IDA's intervention this was rectified. Completion of
the flood preparedness study by the BWDB was delayed (para 15).
Consultants' Performance
24.     The consultants played a vital role in the successful implementation
of the project which comprised a large number of repairs scattered throughout
the country. To supervise these, and monitor and report progress, was a
difficult task which th.e consultants performed well. They also ensured
selection of schemes based on the criteria agreed with IDA, and produced the
monthly and quarterly progress reports on time. The reports covered adequately
both physical and financial progress and identified issues requiring action.
Cowmliance with Covenants
25.     The covenants of the Development Credit Agreement were generally
complied with (Annex I:I).
VI. LESSONS LEARNED
26.     The main lessons from the project's implementation are:
(a) The successful completion was largely due to an early start and
subsequent prompt revisions of project scope and components. This
in turn was possible due to the absence of a Project Proforma, a
rigid document that usually requires a long time for its
preparation or revision. As a PP is obligatory for any project,
except for this emergency operation, it should be prepared in a
flexible manner so that the time consuming revision and approval
process can be minimized during implementation;
(b) Consultant's services are important for this type of project with
a large number of schemes scattered throughout the country.
However, the consultants should be in place at the beginning of
the project to avoid the possibility of sub-optimal selection and
implementation of works; and
(c) For large contracts, contractors should be prequalified and
preference should be given to contractors who have previously
completed similar works successfuly.l
