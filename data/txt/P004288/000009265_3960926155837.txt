SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Malaysia
Second FELCRA Lad Deve&oAment Proiect (Loan 2917-MA)
Attached is the Project Cc- -.Aetion Report on Malaysia - Second ELCRA Land
Development Project (Loan 2917-MA). Parts I and m were prepared by thie East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office and Part II by the Borrower.
The Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) is charged with
the rehailitation of suitable idle or low yielding smallholdings. These are organied into group
fming schemes based mainly on replacing existing crops with improved tree crop varieties, using
modem technology and management systems. lhe project comprised a three-year time slice of
FELCRA's agriculural development program, with related in*astructure, construction of offices,
training faciities and construction of two oil palm mills.
The agricultural program was Implemented as planned, but the constuction program was
delayed by a year because of problems with small scale contractors, delays in land acqulsiion and
Goverment licensing and approval procedures. Ihe training component included short term
specialised technical assistance, as a result of which a new rubber tapping technique was tried and Is
proving very successfl. Yields are projected to exceed appraisal esdmates beemse of technological
improvements, but the PCR reetmated the ERR to be 10 percent compared to 14 percent estimaed
at appraisal. This reduction results from increased labor costs and a decline in projected prices for
rubber and oil palm. The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory. Because of the stog
management capability of the agency, sustainability is considered likely. But in view of the shortfall
in construction of training facilides, achievement of insdtudonal objectives is rated as partial.
The Borrower, in Part II, wotes the value of exchange of views on tecical matters
during supervision and also the need for staff who undertake supervision to be familiar with Bank
procurement and disbursement procedures, so th  problems can be resolved on te spot.
The completion report provides an adequate account of project implementation. An
audit is not planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MA~LAXSIA
SECOND FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2917-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objecti-yes
1.        The project objectives were to help improve the level and
efficiency of smallholder agricultural production, raise smallholder incomes,
and reduce migration to urban areas by providing more rural job opportunities
and improving the quality of rural life. These objectives were to be achieved
by continuing support to the development program of the Federal Land
Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) focussed on rehabilitating
idle and low-yielding smallholdings, which were to be organized into group
farming schemes based mainly on improved tree crop varieties and some
diversified crops, using modern technology and management systems. The
formation of group farms was to support government policy to build an
efficient agricultural sector based on larger sized, economic farm units. The
project included: (a) planting of some 45,000 ha of idle and unproductive
lands with oil palm, rubber and diversified crops; (b) crop maintenance
during immaturity on an average 70,000 ha per annum, including areas
rehabilitated prior to the project; (c) construction of about 160 km of access
roads and other group farm infrastructure; (d) construction of four FELCRA
State offices, two palm oil mills, and a Central Training Center;
(e) provision of vehicles and equipment; and (f) strengthening of FELCRA's
institutional capacity through local and overseas training of staff and
provision of computer and other support services. The project, covering
Peninsular Malaysia, was to be implemented over a three-year period (1988-90).
Iglegmentation Experience
2.        Project implementation was satisfactory but took about a year
longer than estimated at appraisal. This was mainly due to slower than
expected agricultural implementation in the first two project years and a
delay in the civil works program caused by the contractor taking longer to
complete than anticipated. At project completion in 1991, costs were
estimated at MYR 612 million (US$226 million), about 3OX higher than the
appraisal estimate of MYR 470 million (US$188 million). The increase in costs
was mainly due to the longer implementation period. The Bank loan of
US$66.0 million was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on Nay 11,
1992.
3.        The project achieved most of its physical targets in group farm
development. Some 45,400 ha were planted, exceeding the appraisal estimate
by 1X. The crop ratio was 71:26:3 for oil palm, rubber and other crops
compared to the appraisal target ratio of 60:30:10. The shortfall in the
planting of crops other than oil palm and rubber was due to lack of-production
skills, marketing channels and farmer interest. The average annual area of



- iv -
immature crop maintained under the project was 95,600 ha. This was about 36X
higher than the appraisal estimate due mainly to a longer immaturity period
than that estimated at appraisal. Standards of crop establishment and
maintenance were satisfactory but there were some deficiencies in the quality
of planting materials which increased the requirements for supply planting and
lowered uniformity of stands.
4.        The civil works program was affected by delayed Government
approvals for the works, some land acquisition difficulties, contract delays
and, in the case of the Seberang Perak oil palm mill, an oversight in
obtaining licensing approval after doubling its throughput capacity. About
195 km of access roads to schemes were constructed (22X above appraisal
estimates), generally in a timely manner. However, completion of on-farm
roads was sometimes late which, in oil palm schemes, delayed harvesting of the
crop. The number of offices and staff quarters for scheme clusters was scaled
down as part of an effort to improve management efficiency. The State offices
and training facilities are being completed under the Third FELCRA project
(Ln. 3484-MA) while the two oil palm mills were completed and commissioned in
1992.
5.        Contractor delays affected the timely implementation of all
categories of works. The frequently delayed performance of contractors was
due to their limited capacity, especially financial; the inexperience of many
smaller agricultural contractors; and the severe labor shortages in the
agricultural sector due to the competing demands of industry.
6.        As a response to the growing shortage of rubber tappers in FELCRA
schemes, the project initiated a series of demonstrations testing the
suitability of low-intensity tapping systems, which can reduce labor
requirements by 33 to 501. The results were very promising and the program
was carried over to the Third FELCRA project for further development.
7.        Tha staff training program, both local and overseas, was
implemented successfully and contributed to high levels of staff motivation
and skills which benefitted project implementation.
Project Results
8.        Overall, the project was satisfactory and had a partial
institutional impact. Smallholder lands which were previously idle or low-
yielding have been rehabilitated with high yielding varieties of tree crops
and project beneficiaries, many of them living in poverty, are expected to
enjoy higher farm incomes and improved standards of living. Some 7936 farm
families have benefitted from land rehabilitation to date (some agricultural
lands developed for States still await family allocations) and another 35,746
families have benefitted from the support for maintenance of immature crops.
Further, the new reduced-frequency tapping technology is expected to attract
the interest of rubber growers outside the project area and lead to its wider
adoption which is important for the longer term profitability of rubber in
Malaysia.
9.        Very little of the project area was in production by the end of the
project. Based on FELCRA's 1991 survey of schemes in production, yields of
oil palm are expected to be close to appraisal projections while those for



- v -
rubber are expected to be around 25X higher as a result of FELCRA adopting
improved tapping practices which would lead to the conservation of tapping
bark resources, the prolongation of the peak production period and a more
gradual yield decline. At full crop maturity, the project is expected to
generate net incomes of NXR 560/month from oil palm and KYR 710/month from
rubber for beneficiaries working on schemes. These levels are about 402 lower
than appraisal projections due to decline in commodity prices but compare
favorably with the Government's poverty income benchmark of MYR360/month.  The
economic rate of return for the project, based on new plantings and
replantings only, is estimated at 101, which is satisfactory but lower than
the appraisal estimate (14X) due to higher labor costs and less attractive
commodity price projec,ions compared to those at appraisal.
Project Sustainability
10.       Project sustainability is likely with the use of modern production
technology and management on group farms and satisfactory projected crop
yields. Prospects of cost recovery are good as beneficiary land development
loans are repaid through deductions from crop sales which are handled by
FELCRA. Loan repayment is currently 951. FELCRA's program to privatize the
management of mature schemes, which have repaid their land development loans,
by handing them over to the recently-formed estate management company owned by
scheme cooperatives, enhances project sustainability. It also furthers the
beneficiaries' opportunities for entrepreneurship. The ability of the
cooperative management company to deliver professional management services and
a sharp deterioration of oil palm and rubber prices are potential risks for
project sustainability.
Findings and Lessons Learned
11.       The main lessons are the following:
(a) rehabilitation of smallholdings under group farming arrangements is
a viable development option;
(b) development progress is greatly assisted when the implementing
agency enjoys the confidence of the farmers;
(c) successful diversification into new crops depends on the interest
of farmers and the availability of appropriate crop production
technology and marketing channels;
(d) group farming arrangements offer opportunities to develop
smallholder entrepreneurship;
(e) small farm rehabilitation improves incomes but may not stem the
migration of farm families to the non-farm sector if standards of
living remain low;
(f) a vigorous and well-focussed staff training program enhances
development performance; and
(g) Bank staff continuity during project sup-r-ision facilitates
effective relationships with the Borrower.

UKRT I, PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSECTIVE

Loan Number : Lu. 2917-MA
RVP Unit    : East Asia and Pacific Regional Office
Country     : Malaysia - 
Sector      : Agriculture
Sub-sector  : Tree Crops
2.          hAckground
2.1          In recent years, the relative importance of the agricultural
sector in Malaysia has. declined due to industrialization. In 1988, it
contributed 20Q to the gross domestic product and employed 321 of the national
labor force. By 1992, these shares had fallen to 15X and 251, respectively.
Government's agricultural policy is to ensure the supply of commodities for
food, industry and export while eradicating rural poverty. In the smallholder
tree crop sector, poverty alleviation and efficiency improvement are pursued
through the replanting of low yielding stands of trees with high yielding
varieties and group farming arrangements to introduce improved production
technology and management. The focus of the Federal Land Consolidation and
Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) in this program is on smallholdings with
ownership titles.
2.2         Rubber and oil palm, the predominant tree crops of Malaysia, cover
about 85X of the total cultivated area of 5 million hectares. Although rubber
was still the main crop by area in 1988, it has since been superseded by oil
palm, which, with over 2 million hectares, has provided greater profitability
and has been less prone to the effects of the increasingly severe shortage of
agricultural labor. Malaysia now produces over 502 and 241 of the world's
palm oil and rubber, respectively.
2.3         The Bank has consistently supported the Government's agricultural
development objectives and has provided 13 loans to parastatals for rubber and
oil palm. Loan 2917-MA was the third loan to FELCRA and the second in support



X 2 -
of its overall development program; both of the earlier projects were judged
to be successful.
3.           roiject Objectives and Description
3.1         Objectives.  The project objectives were to increase the
efficiency of smallholder tree crop production by replanting low yielding
areas and employing group farming arrangements to introduce improved crop
production technology and management systems.
3.2         Descrigtign.  The project components were as follows:
(a)   planting of some 45,000 ha of idle and low-yielding smallholdings
with oil palm, rubber and diversified crops, and the maintenance
of an annual average of 70,000 ha of crops during immaturity,
including areas planted prior to the project;
(b)   provision of about 160 km of access roads and group farm
infrastructure, including offices, staff quarters, water supply
and electricity systems, etc.;
(e)   construction of four FELCRA State offices, a Central Training
Center and upgrading of a training subcenter;
(d)   construction and commissioning of two palm oil mills; and
(e)   strengthening of institutional management and support services.
3.3         Einancing.  The Bank loan of US$66.0 million was to finance
FELCRA's development program for three years (1988-90). Government funding of
FELCRA comprised loans for land development and the construction of palm oil
mills, and grants for administration, services and civil works. FELCRA
extended land development loans to farmers for 25 years at 4X interest after a
10 year grace period. These terms were standard for Government smallholder
development schemes and the interest rate was positive in real terms compared
to Malaysia's inflation rate.
4.          Proiect Design and Organization
4.1         The project, based on Government's approved budget and program for
FELCRA, was simple in design and benefitted from a strong single agenc,
responsibility for most of the work. Implementation by other agencies was
mostly funded from FELCRA's budget. Time-slice loan financing using the
Statement of Expenditure procedure was introduced for most agricultural and
scheme infrastructure works to avoid the difficulties experienced under FELCRA
I (Ln. 2013-MA) in processing large numbers of small contracts for loan
withdrawals. This arrangement was appropriate for FELCRA which was a mature
agency with strong and focussed management and experience in Bank procedures.
Two important concerns at appraisal were long term management arrangements for
schemes as FELCRA's land development portfolio expanded, and crop
diversification. FELCRA acknowledged that a management divestment program was
necessary but as the issue was also relevant to other parastatals implementing



the Government's smallholder development program, it was agreed that the
project would not focus on the issue, leaving FELCRA more flexibility to
pursue different options. This non-interventionist approach cemented close
Bank/FELCRA cooperation and led to FELCRA developing significant management
privatization initiatives by the end of the project. As regards
diversification, there were some concerns in the Bank that reliance on only
two perennial crops exposed smallholders to an undue risk of commodity price
fluctuations, although Malaysia had a strong comparative advantage in the
production of both oil palm and rubber. Sugges*-tons for a diversified crops
proportion of 20X or more were eventually mode ved to 10, a level which
FELCRA accepted as a target while emphasizing that there were many practical
problems of production technology, marketing channels and farmer interest that
would have to be addressed in order to succeed.
5.          Eroject Imnlementation
5.1         Implementation was generally satisfactory but took about four
years (1988-91), a year longer than that estimated at appraisal. This was due
mainly to slower than expected agricultural implementation in the first two
project years and a delay in the civil works program which, in turn, was duet
to contractors taking longer to complete than anticipated.
5.2         Project Costs and Financing.  Government budget allocations to
FELCRA were adequate and, in later years, significantly above appraisal
estimates. The total cost of the project at appraisal, based on the
indicative Government budget allocation to FELCRA for the remaining three
years of the Fifth Malaysia Plan period ending December 1990, was estimated at
MYR470.0 million (US$188.0 million), including US$5.0 million of retroactive
financir.g.  Total actual project cost over four years to the end of December
1991 was MYR612.1 million (US$226.2 million equivalent), an increase of about
MYR142 million or about 301.  The increase was due mainly to the longer
implementation period. On an annualized basis, appraisal and actual costs
were similar at MYR157 million and MYR153 million, respectively. Compared to
appraisal, there were significantly higher costs for scheme infrastructure
(+118X), representing the increased government allocations, especially in 1990
and 1991, for completion of a backlog of preproject works, and for
agricultural development (+27X), reflecting the higher average annual area of
immature crops maintained under the project (para. 5.3). For project new
plantings, average development costs per hectare were only 41 higher than
appraisal estimates.
5.3        AMricultural Development.  The project rehabilitated 45,400 ha,
about 11 above the appraisal target, of idle and low-yielding smallbolder
farms with modern varieties of tree crops. The cumulative area of maintenance
of immature crops, including areas planted prior to the project, amounted to
382,000 ha compared to 211,000 ha estimated for 1988-90 at appraisal. The
average annual maintenance of immature crops was 95,600 ha, some 361 above
the appraisal estimate. The main increase was for oil palm, which had a
longer period of immaturity than estimated at appraisal. The crop ratio in
new plantings was 71:26:3 as against the project target of 60:30:10 for oil
palm, rubber and other crops (fruits and cocoa). Scheme participants could
plant the crop of their choice provided agroclimatic conditions of the area



-4-
were suitable for the crop. Overall, crop establishment standards were
satisfactory and consistent with appraisal expectations. Some weaknesses in
the uniformity and vigor of planting materials necessitated relatively high
supply plantings but stands of young trees were well maintained during
immaturity. Factors adversely affecting agricultural performance in some
schemes were untimely compleclon of land preparation due to contract delays
(para. 5.6), low participation levels of scheme beneficiaries in field work
thus increasing FELCRA's demand for contract labor, the need to redevelop
agricultural areas that were steeper than recommended by !ZLCRA for land
development, and planting of oil palm in some areas despite impeded main
drains off the scheme. With an eye to the future introduction of reduced
frequency tapping of rubber (para. 5.9), FELCRA took the progressive step of
changing from mixed cloral plantings to blocks of clones of at least tapping
task size.
5.4         Croo Diversification.  Inadequate farmer interest and marketing
outlets for new crops constrained crop diversification. A FELCRA initiative
to grow several hundred hectares of the small golden banana in the Seberar.g
Perak area failed for lack of production skills and export channels. A
smaller initiative with pineapple in an established area close to factory
processing facilities has been sustained. A small program of diversification
with local tree fruits and cocoa was implemented, but its success is so far
uncertain given the inadequate FELCRA and farmer experience in the relevant
crop production, high labor demands and undeveloped markets.
5.5         Scheme Infrastructure. About 195 km of scheme access roads,
largely implemented by the Public Works Department (JKR) for FELCRA, were
constructed to national standards. Budgets were adequate. There were delays
in some oil palm schemes in the implementation of access roads and in the
upgrading of farm roads required for first crop harvesting. Supplemental 1989
budget allocations permitted asphalting of some 53 km of preproject access and
village roads which the Bank accepted for financing. In line with
Government's efficiency drive, FELCRA substantially scaled down the number of
offices and staff quarters to be constructed in scheme clusters. Only 280
were constructed, compared to the appraisal target of 520.
5.6         Scheme Contracring. Contractor problems in the implementation of
agriculture;and scheme infrastructure often seriously delayed completion of
works. These problems were not specific to FELCRA but were country-wide and
resulted from a rapid industrialization. The problems included labor
shortages, strained contractor resources, and the reallocation of experienced
contractors to larger and more lucrative works. The national policy requiring
agencies to be preferential to bumiputra contractors, especially for smaller
works, resulted in delays 4Jn performance in many cases due to the contractors'
inexperience and a lack of financial resources. Delayed agricultural
implementation has longer-term implications for small farmers in terms of
lower crop productivity, reduced farm income and larger land development
loans.
5.7         Civi Works.  Construction of four State offices, the Training
Center and the Training School fell much behind schedule and remained
unfinished at the end of the project (Ln. 3484-MA). The facilities are being



-5
completed under the Third FELCRA project. Plots of land for three of the four
offices had been acquired at appraisal but budgetary constraints in 1988 and
delays in Federal and State approvals were factors beyond the direct control
of FELCRA. By the end of the project, construction of the Perak office was
well under way and a start had been made with the Ne8eri Sembilan and Pahang
offices. The contract for the Kedah office was awarded after the end of the
project. Government approvals for the training facilit.es were delayed by
more than a year. In view of the increasing importance of Seberang Perak as
an established area of smallholder development, FEICRA received Government
approval for the construction of a new Training School there instead of
upgrading the small, somewhat isolated, training facility at Lekir, The Bank
agreed to finance this facility under the loan and the Loan Agreement was
amended accordingly. Construction was mostly completed by the end of the
project. Work on the Tebing Tinggi Training Center started in 1990 but
progress was slow and the contractor failed in 1991 due to financial problems,
with about 20X of the work completed. The works were retendered. Since then
progress has been good and the Center is expected to be completed in 1993
under the Third FELCRA project.
5.8         Paln Qil Ifil1s.   Implementation of the two palm oil mills was
slow, about two years behind schedule. They were completed after the end of
the project in 1992 under FELCR's own financing arrangements.  Arising out of
community concerns over effluent odor, the proposed Tanjung Batu mill was
resited as the Maran mill. Negotiations for acquiring the new site on State
land delayed implementation by more than a y' ar. For the Seberang Perak mill,
the planned initial milling capacity (30 tons/hour of fresh fruit bunch) was
considered inadequate in the light of an expanding crop command area as public
roads in the region were improved, and the earlier than projected full
capacity operation of FELCRA's other Perak mill (Nasaruddin). The
construction of a 60 ton/hour mill was agreed and the Loan Agreement amended
to reflect this. FELCRA, however, overlooked national licensing approval
procedures in respect of these changes and engineering works had to be halted
for about a year while legal action took its course. By the end of the
project, engineering works and a large proportion of equipment installation
had been completed for both mills. They were commissioned in 1992.
5.9         New Agricultural Technology.  In view of the severe shortage of
tappers and an increasing area of untapped rubber in many rubber schemes, the
Bank in 1990 proposed that FELCRA consider the use of reduced frequency
tapping, a technology which had been commercialized about 15 years earlier in
some West African countries to address labor shortages. The technology
involves tapping of rubber every third or fourth daily instead of alternate
daily along with the use of latex stimulant to approximately maintain yield
levels. Tapping labor requirements can thus be reduced by 331 to 50%. A study
tour for four FELCRA managers was organized to Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon to
see the technology in operation. FELCRA staff liked what they saw and
requested Bank assistance to launch a pilot program on selected schemes. A
program of 9 field demonstrations to verify the applicability of the systems
under Malaysian conditions was developed with consultant assistance (para.
5.10) and launched in mid-1991. FELCRA management and staff gave full support
to the initiative and by mid-1992, very promising results were emerging. The
economic potential of the technology soon became apparent and further
development of the technology is a key component of the Third FELCRA project.



- 6-
5.10        Technical Assistance and Training.  The services of the Training
Advisor, carried over from the first project, ceased in the first year of the
project due to secondment arrangements. By that time, however, the Advisor
had completed assessment of the training needs of FELCRA, established a strong
staff training program with associated curricula and had played an important
role in establishing a two-year cooperation program for FELCRA with the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The CIDA program proved to
be very valuable, providing FELCRA with trainers, courses and-workshops for
many subject areas and professional advice on the design and facilities of the
new Training Center.    For the development of the new rubber tapping
technology (para. 5.9), the Bank sourced the Consultant Trust Fund for
consultant services in 1991 to set up a pilot program and financed a follow-up
visit in early 1992 to review progress and evaluate early results. As regards
training, a large number of staff had multiple training through a wide
selection of courses provided both in-house and outside while a total of 51
staff, including 6 female staff, benefitted from overseas courses in
management, finance and agriculture (Part III, 4(c)).
5.11        Procurement of Goods.   For ICB procurement, there were some
problems, particularly in the earlier part of the project, concerning tender
processing timetables and specifications for equipment and vehicles. FELCRA
and the Bank jointly reviewed FELCRA's operating procedures and concluded that
the procedures could be significantly streamlined without losing quality
control or i.aairing FELCRA's lines of executive authority. New procedures
successfully put into operation by 1990 reduced processing time to no more
than 3 months, less than half of what it had been before. As regards tender
specifications, there were instances of inadequate specifications which caused
differences in views between the Bank and the Borrower regarding bid
responsiveness and the award of contracts. In the case of palm oil mill
boilers, FELCRA decided against the lowest evaluated bidder and Bank financing
in order to procure the preferred design feature. For agricultural tractors,
FELCRA agreed to retender with modified specifications and this had
satisfactory results.
5.12        Loan Agreement Amendment.  At the request of the Borrower, the
Loan Agreement was amended on January 16, 1990 to provide for the construction
of the Seberang Perak Training School in place of the Lekir training subcenter
(para. 5.7) and an increase in the processing capacity of Seberang Perak palm
oil mill from 30 to 60 tons/hour (para. 5.8).
6.          Pg1Lect Results
6.1         Overall, the project was satisfactory and had a partial
institutional impact. Smallholder lands which were previously idle or had
senile tree crops have been rehabilitated with modern varieties of tree crops
and organized under group farming arrangements with modern crop production
technology and management systems. Several thousands of small farmers, many
of them living in poverty, are expected to enjoy higher farm incomes and
improved standards of living. Further, the reduced frequency tapping
technology promoted under the project is expected to attract the interest of



- 7 -
other rubber growers and its wider adoption could have an important impact on
the viability of rubber in the country as a result of the reduced labor
requirements.
6.2        At this stage, the area planted under the project has benefittcd
7936 farm families while a further 35,746 participant families bonefitted from
the maintenance of areas planted prior to the project. There were also
considerable areas of State agricultural land developed by the project for
which the States have yet to identify the beneficiary families; normally this
is done at about the time of first crop production.
6.3         Crop Production.  No significant area of new crop development
attained production during the project period. Based on FELCRA's review in
1991 of the performance of producing schemes, it is expected that yields of
oil palm would be close to appraisal projections which, in turn, are similar
to the average profile of the industry. Yields are expected to reach a peak
of about 22 tons/ha of fresh fruit bunch by the seventh production year and
average about 17 tons/ha over a 25 year production cycle. Assuming that
FELCRA will adopt improved tapping practices and reduced frequency tapping
technology as standard practice on its schemes within the next two to three
years, it is expected that project rubber yields will be better than appraisal
estimates. It is assumed that rubber will continue to take about 7 years to
come into production, take about 7 more years to rise to an average peak yield
of 1700 to 1750 kg/ha, and then, because of a much slower rate of tapping bark
consumption, maintain this high yield level for about 10 more years before
starting a much slower decline than under the old tapping regime. The average
annual yield is projected at about 1540 kg/ha over 25 years of production, 25X
higher than the appraisal estimate. The above yield profiles have been used
in the project economic analysis. The detailed profiles for both crops are
shown at Annex 1, Table 1.
6.4         Scheme Partieipant Income.  Data of FELCRA schemes in production
indicate 1991 average dividend incomes of scheme beneficiaries of about
NYR470/month from both rubber and oil palm. In the first nine months of 1992,
average dividend incomes were MYR439/month from oil palm and MYR223/month from
rubber, the disparity probably reflecting commodity price differentials and
the growing shortage of tappers which had left about 30X of mature rubber
untapped. The Government's poverty income benchmark is NYR360/month. A 1991
FELCRA survey indicated that only about 251 of FELCRA beneficiaries work on
the schemes. Host beneficiaries have significant off-farm income. It is
estimated that, at full crop maturity, the project would generate net incomes
of MYR560/month from oil palm and MYR710/month from rubber for beneficiaries
working on schemes. For other beneficiaries, incomes would be about
KYR325/month from oil palm and MYR455/month from rubber.
6.5         Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return for the
project, based on new plantings and replantings only, is estimated at 10,
which is satisfactory but lower than the appraisal estimate of 14% due to
higher labor costs and less favorable commodity price projections. Although
yield estimates exceed appraisal targets, the price of oil palm has been
halved since 1989. Details of the analysis are shown in Section III, Part 6
and in Annex 1, Table 2.

7.          Project Sustainabilitv
7.1         Project sustainability is likely.  FELCRA's successful development
of group farms with tree crops has introduced the small farmers to modern
production technology and management systems. Prospects of project cost
recovery are favorable. Agricultural development loans assumed by the
beneficiaries are recoverable through deductions from the sales of rubber and
palm oil, all of which are marketed by FELCRA. Loan repayment performance is
good with about 95X currently on schedule. Additionally, duty and cess
charges on rubber exports contribute to cost recovery. FELCRA recognizes,
however, that as its land rehabilitation program expands, it cannot continue
management of developed schemes indefinitely. FELCRA favors privatization of
management of mature schemes to meet this situation, to encourage smallholder
entrepreneurship and to guard against reversion of group farms to individual
operations. Accordingly, it has promoted the formation of an estate
management company by the umbrella cooperative of all scheme cooperatives.
Schemes which have repaid their land development loans (currently about 40)
are being assisted to contract management services from this company or, if it
is the choice of the group owners, from any other private entity. Only a very
small number of owner groups have chosen the latter alternative. The
potential risks to project sustainability are the ability of the cooperative
management company to deliver professional management services and a sharp
deterioration in the cost-price relationship for tree crop production making
group farms less viable and less attractive for commercial management.
8.           ank Performance
8.1         The good relationship developed between FELCRA and the Bank during
the FELCRA I project continued through the Second project and greatly assisted
its implementation. At all times there was frank dialogue on project
concerns. The rapport was particularly enhanced by the Bank's delivery of the
rubber tapping technology development package. In addition, the Bank provided
advice and assistance in the areas of engineering and infrastructure,
management information systems and accounting procedures. It also strengthened
FELCRA's processing of ICB procurement. The Bank mounted regular project
supervisions and staffed them with technical skills appropriate to project
requirements.
8.2         Bank pressure on FELCRA during project preparation to pursue a
vlgorous-crop diversificatlon program, particularly with fruit crops, despite
well-recognized production and marketing constraints, was ill-olaced.
Malaysia was already well diversified into three major tree crops (rubber, oil
palm and cocoa) and had a strong comparative advantage in at least the first
two. Even the compromise diversification target of 10 of the total
agricultural program proved to be unrealistic in the absence of production
skills, marketing channels and farmer interest. FELCRA remained very
conscious of its mandate to farmers to increase their incomes through
established and economically-proven agricultural systems and was not in a
position, nor disposed, to experiment with the farmers' livelihood.

8.3         Lessons Learned.  A number of lessons were learned from the
project, some corroborating experiences of the FELCRA I project. The lessons
were:
i)    the rehabilitation of smallholder tree crop farms under group
farming arrangements is a viable development option;
ii)   development progress is greatly assisted when the implementing
agency enjoys the confidence of the farmers;
iii)  successful diversifJcation into new crops depends on the interest
of farmers and the availability of appropriate crop production
technology and marketing channels;
iv)   group farming arrangements offer opportunities to develop
smallholder entrepreneurship;
v)    small farm rehabilitation improves incomes but may not stem the
migration of farm families to the non-farming sector if their
incomes remain low;
vi)   a vigorous and well-focussed staff training program enhances
development of operational effectiveness by building staff skills,
dedication and motivation; and
vii)  Bank staff continuity during project supervision facilitates
effective relationships with the borrower.
9.          Borro   Perfemma
9.1         From its experience with the FELCRA I project and familiarity with
Bank procedures, FELCRA was able to move effectively into the implementation
of the Second project. Management and staff at all levels were imbued with a
desire to do a good job for FELCRA and the project, and worked with dedication
to achieve that. Good staff performance and morale was attributable to the
strong and yet open style of top management and FELCRA's comprehensive staff
training program. Government confidence in the competence of FELCRA to
successfully implement the project remained high throughout the period. The
Borrower complied adequately with legal agreements, prepared timely and
detailed reports of project progress and at all times kept accounting files
open to Bank inspection. Preparation of annual financial statements was slow
and the audited accounts were mostly submitted late.
10.         Prolect Relationshins
10.1        FELCRA management welcomed frank dialogue with the Bank on project
performance and responded well to supervision mission recommendations such as
the streamlining of procurement procedures and the block planting of rubber
clones. The management's willingness to try out new field technology for the
benefit of small farmers was particularly well-demonstrated by their positive
response to the Bank's proposals on the new tapping technology.

11.         lrolect Documentation and Data
11.1        The Bank maintained full documentation of project progress
including procurement actions, The project SAR provided a satisfactory
framework for project implementation while supervision reports focussed
adequately on project status and problems encountered. The data required for
the preparation of the PCR were promptly provided by FELCRA.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROER'S PERSEACTIVL
A.  EvAUatog  of -Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned
1.          Throughout the project period from preparation to implementation,
Bank personnel performed well, as mission members were often well qualified
and specialists in their respective fields. At least two mission members were
familiar with FELCRA's operations having worked with the agency from FELCRA I
Project (1981-1987) and thus the continuity of staff assigned to the project
helped considerably to smoothen Bank's performance. Overall, the Bank made a
positive contribution to the physical, institutional and technical development
of the project, having learned from the lessons of the FELCRA I Project.
Credit should be given to the Task Manager who was also the Supervision
Mission Chief through project implementation for carefully selecting well-
qualified and experienced staff to be in his team.
2.          Lessons Learned.  The following lessons emerged from the
experience of the project:
(a)  As disbursement and procurement problems feature frequently during
each supervision mission, it would be useful to have on each
mission a member who is thoroughly knowledgeable in Bank's
procurement and disbursement procedures so that advice can be
given on the spot without having to refer to Washington, D.C.
(b)   The Bank was very supportive of financing the crop diversification
program in the form of pilot schemes. However, due to lack of
experience and technical know-how, FELCRA did not meet with much
success in this area of development. In retrospect, the
diversification program could have performed better if the Bank
had monitored more closely and offered specific crop technical
advice and assistance as in the case of rubber when the Bank
imparted the advanced tapping technology to FELCRA through the
provision of a study visit and technical consultancy.
(c)   Field visits by Supervision Mission members should be encouraged
as experience in this project had shown that their findings,
observations and recommendations were often helpful to FELCRA
management in identifying and overcoming weaknesses in field
operations and supervision. Supervision usually focussed on
agricultural operations. It would be useful if attention is also
given to engineering operations related to the Project.
(d)   For ICB tenders, particularly with respect to vehicles and
fertilizers which are procured more than once during the project
period, it would save time if standard bidding documents are
agreed upon and finalized at the beginning of the project and such
documents are used thereafter for subsequent ICB tenders called so
that prior Bank review would not be necessary from then on.

B. Evaluation of Borrower's Zerformance and Lessons Learned
3.          This project turned out to be FELCRA's most successful World Bank
financed loan package to date. FELCRA's project proposal was well-received by
the Bank. Appraisal was smooth except for the delay in the confirmation of
FELCRA's Fifth Malaysia Plan budget allocation due to the recession. Overall,
implementation was on schedule with no significant delays or problems; there
was sufficient budget support from the Government with the upturn of the
Malaysian economy; no loan cancellation was required; and the loan was fully
utilized with no extension of loan period. However, despite the generally
good performance, the following lessons may be learned from FELCRA's
experience:
(a)   Financial support from the Federal Government in the form of
adequate budgetary allocation is important for the successful
implementation of the project. This, of course, must be supported
by the availability of suitable lands for rehabilitation and
consolidation.
(b)   The staff of the Procurement Section has to be well versed with
the Bank's procurement guidelines so that they can ensure timely
sourcing of goods and services, processing of bids and advising
the management of the Bank's requirements. It would save a lot of
time if tender documents and working papers to be presented to the
Tender Award Committee and Executive Working Committee are
prepared in the English language with respect to ICB tenders or
tenders which require the prior review of the Bank. One of the
steps taken by FELCRA to speed up the tender evaluation process is
to establish a Tender Evaluation Unit to process the evaluation of
bids.
C.  Effectiveness of Relationshin Between the Bank and the Borrower
4.          There was good staff continuity from project preparation to
project completion and the team was technically strong. Relationship with the
mission members and the Bank was built up from FELCRA I Project days and this
has contributed significantly to the effectiveness of relationship between the
Bank and FELCRA. A strong feature throughout was the constructive dialogue
and support between the Bank staff and the executing agency. The Bank's
familiarity with FELCRA's operations helped considerably in speeding up
project implementation.
