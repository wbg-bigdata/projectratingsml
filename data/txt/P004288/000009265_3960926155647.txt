MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A SECOND FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Malaysia for US$66.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would have a repayment period of 15 years, including a grace
period of three years, at the standard variable interest rate, and would help
finance a land development project.
Background
2.        Malaysia's agricultural sector has enjoyed a long period of high
growth rate and continues to play a key role in the economy despite the
decline in its relative importance as industrialization proceeds. Tree crops,
which account for 80X of the agricultural area and for which Malaysia has a
strong comparative production advantage, contribute about one-third of the
country's foreign income, Malaysia being the world's largest producer of both
rubber and palm oil. Despite increasing labor costs, Malaysia's high yields
and wide use of advanced technology result in significantly lower marginal
production costs for both crops, compared with those of most competitors.
Similarly, Malaysian palm oil has a cost of production typically only one-half
to one-third those of other major traded edible oils.
3.        Tree crop production in Malaysia is characterized by a large private
estate sector whose superior performance has had a major impact on the design
of Government land development programs. Group farming systems have been
developed to provide for the transfer of estate-type production technology and
management to the smallholder sector. This strategy derives from policy
initiatives to raise rural incomes and generate foreign exchange and has
become increasingly important with the recent economic slowdown and the need
for fuller utilization of agricultural resources. In its effort to narrow the
performance gap between estate and smallholder production, the Government's
major development program is designed to rehabilitate idle or underutilized
smallholder lands, prima:ily with tree crops. The Federal Land Consolidation
and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) is the major implementing agency. The
4         Bank has supported many successful group farming land development projects in
Malaysia involving tree crops, particularly rubber and oil palm, including two
FELCRA projects which are ongoing. 1/
4.        Although Malaysia's medium-term agricultural strategy is based on
specialization in tree crops, Government has continued to explore the most
promising opportunities for crop diversification in an effort to lessen the
dependence of the economy on the rubber and palm oil industries. Padi, which
has been the focus of the Government's food security program, enjoys a number

Area Development Project, Ln. 1960-MA.

of protective subsidies, but production has nevertheless stagnated with low
commodity prices and unsatisfactory yields. Other diversification
possibilities which are being pursued include cocoa, coffee and some fruits
(especially bananas) and vegetables. Cocoa and coffee, again tree crops, are
developing well, but progress with other crops will be quite slow over the
medium-term, as major efforts are needed to develop suitable production and
post-harvest technologies, particularly for fruits.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  FELCRA's land development program
is closely identified with Government's agricultural objectives, which the
Bank supports. The proposed project would ensure continuation of an effective
development program for rehabilitation of large areas of idle smallholder
lands with valuable export earning tree crop3. It would also provida a strong
institutional arrangement for the transfer, through group farming systems, of
modern production technology and management typical of the high performance
estate sector, to the smallholders. The project addresses rural poverty,
particularly prevalent among rubber farmers because of low-yielding trees, and
would raise the farm family income of working scheme participants from below
the Government poverty benchmark of M$360/month to a maximum of about
M$850/month at full development at 10 years (net of loan dues). The project
would also counter urban drift and promote Malaysia's export revenues. FELCRA
is a mature agency with experience in implementing Bank-financed projects and,
with some further institutional strengthening, it has the capacity to respond
to greater development program challenges.
6.        Project Objectives.  The project would support government polices to
increase the efficiency of smallholder agricultural production, enhance
national export revenues and raise smallholder incomes. By creating more job
opportunities in rural areas and improving the quality of rural life, the
project would help to reduce the rate of urban drift. It would bring idle and
low producing agricultural land into full production with high value tree
crops, transfer modern production technology and management to the smallholder
sector, promote the formulation of larger and more efficient smallholder
production units and encourage some crop diversification.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed project would finance a three-
year expenditure time slice of most of FELCRA's total development program. It
would provide for (a) the rehabilitation of about 45,000 ha of idle
agricultural and old rubber lands organized as group farms, with oil palm,
rubber and diversified crops suited to the local conditions in an approximate
ratio of 6:3:1 respectively; (b) the maintenance during crop development of
about 99,000 ha of rehabilitated areas, including some 69,000 ha rehabilitated
over several years prior to the project; (c) construction of scheme access
roads, staff quarters and offices, FELCRA State Offices, two palm oil mills
deferred from other projects and a Central Training Center; (d) provision of
vehicles and equipment; and (e) strengthening of FELCRA's scheme support
services and management. Some 18,000 new participant families and 27,000
already involved families would benefit from the project. Total project cost
is estimated at US$188.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$66.5 million (35%). The proposed loan of US$66.0 million would provide
funds for agricultural development, scheme infrastructure, palm oil mills,
training, vehicles, equipment and furniture, including up to US$5.0 million in

retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred from the start of
appraisal on July 1, 1987. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the Status of Bank Group Operations in Malaysia
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No.7014-MA, dated February 12, 1988 is also attached.
Agreed Actions
8.        During negotiations, confirmation was obtained from the Government
and FELCRA on the following:  (a) an annual review and agreement with the Bank
on FELCRA's proposed annual work program and its funding in advance of each
fiscal year; (b) the development of a settler loan accounting system; (c) the
updating of monitoring of land development costs used in budget and program
planning; and (d) the Public Works Department having sufficient capacity to
adequately undertake its portion of the engineering design and construction
supervision of scheme access roads.
9.       Benefits.  Benefits under the proposed project are expected from:
(a) total annual incremental production at full development of 100,000 tons of
palm oil and 15,000 tons of rubber, amounting to about 3% and 1X respectively
of total national production, and 10,000 tons of diversified crops; (b)
improved farm incomes for smallholders, particularly those previously earning
below the relative poverty leveL; (c) continued institutional strengthening of
FELCRA. The internal economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is
estimated at 14%. At the farm level the rates of return range from 12% for
rubber replanting to 25Z for oil palm planted on idle land. The return on
investment in palm oil mills is 21%. The project ERR is comparatively robust,
requiring either a 20% fall in the price of both ruboer and oil palm or a 25%
rise in project costs to switch the ERR to below 10%.
10.       Risks.  The project imposes a continuing obligation on Government to
fund and maintain infrastructure in areas replanted under the project. FELCRA
would need also to finance scheme operating costs after development, should
participants leave schemes for work elsewhere. FELCRA's ability to meet these
obligations is dependent on the market prices for the commodities being
planted, and on the long-run success of the developmental approach being
taken. However, this is not expected to be a problem. Projected long-term
prices are high enough to attract sufficient scheme participants to sustain
the momentum of the land development program, and the Government confirmed its
commitment during appraisal to provide adequate funding to FELCRA.
