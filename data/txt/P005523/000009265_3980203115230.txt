Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
(a) increase the provision of basic infrastructure services in small and medium-size cities;
(b) strengthen Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC) as a commercially viable, autonomous financial institution
specialized into providing financial services to the municipal sector.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Component                            Category              Cost including         %

Institutional development                         Technical assistance              0.3             0.3
Total          110.3           100.0
3. Benefits and target population:
The main direct and indirect benefits of the project will be:
(i) Improved living standards of about 4 million people living in some 90 small and medium-size rural and urban
communes, and integration of these communes, which account for most of Morocco's underdeveloped areas, into
the modern economy. These benefits will be monitored by the following indicators which are based on the
experience of the First Municipal Finance Project and FEC's pipeline of investment projects.
*  About 90 percent of the number of subprojects and 75 percent of the total investment financed by the Bank loan
are expected to directly benefit rural and urban communes with a population below 150,000 (50 and 15 percent for
communes, predominantly rural, with a population below 20,000);
*  Basic infrastructure services (water supply and sewerage, solid waste, wholesale markets and urban roads) directly
aimed at raising living standards of local populations and accelerate their integration into the modern economy,
are expected to account for about 70 percent of the Bank loan.
(ii) The Borrower, Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC), will be strengthened through a set of financial and
institutional measures. These include its legal status as a bank, which implies full compliance with Central Bank
prudential regulations. An institutional development plan will be implemented by FEC and a set of financial
indicators will be monitored under the project (para. 14). These measures will enable FEC to better serve its
municipal clients while maintaining a prudent balance between growth and profitability.
The target population is creditworthy local communities, especially small and medium-size cities (under 150,000), which
are expected to account for the vast majority of municipal infrastructure projects financed by the Bank loan. FEC will
select projects and borrowers on the basis of risk assessment. Disbursements will be channeled through FEC for on-
lending to eligible beneficiaries. The Bank loan will not deal with the investment needs of uncreditworthy
municipalities. These needs are addressed directly and differently by the Central Government with the assistance of
donors, including the Bank.'
t Such as the proposed Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Phase One Project.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 4 years (FY1998-2001)
Executing agencies:   FEC for the line of credit component and the implementation of the institutional development
plan. FEC will on-lend Bank funds to eligible beneficiaries at domestic, market-determined
interest rates. The Government will maintain the same foreign exchange coverage system
which has been operating satisfactorily under the First Municipal Finance Project
(Loan 3617-MOR dated June 14, 1993). Under this system, FEC will pay the Treasury an
insurance premium which equates the cost of Bank funds with that of domestic resources of
comparable maturities (Annex 2).
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of Interior (Mol) for initiating and overseeing
the transformation of FEC into a joint stock company.
Project coordination:  FEC in consultation with the Directorate of Local Governments at Mol and the Directorate of
Treasury at MoF.
Project oversight:  Mol and MoF for municipal and fiscal policies; MoF and the Central Bank for regulatory
financial and prudential policies.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: FEC will submit annually, by June 30, (a) the audit report
on its financial statements; (b) a review of its compliance with the financial ratios agreed upon
with the Bank (para. 14), including, if necessary, corrective measures needed to meet the
requirements; and (c) an updated medium-term business and financial forecast.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The Bank on the basis of (a) regular visits to FEC, Mol, MoF and local
governments; and (b) a final evaluation report to be submitted by FEC within six months of the
loan closing date.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the project (CAS Report No. 16219-MOR; Board date January 30, 1997):
(a) Social Development: Improved access to basic infrastructure services including near-universal access to potable
water by 2010.
(b) Modernizing the public sector: Public enterprises reform; opening of infrastructure to private participation.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The municipal sector includes 1,546 communes of which 248 are urban and 1,298 are rural (groups of villages and areas
with dispersed population). Fourteen large urban area municipalities are regrouped into urban communities. In addition,
there are 24 regies owned by municipalities that specialize in the provision of one or more services, such as water, power
and local transportation. The level of coverage for municipal services in Morocco is low, particularly in small cities and
rural areas. Investments over the 1990-94 period, of about DH 21 billion (US$2.3 billion), were insufficient to eliminate
an important backlog of priority projects estimated at DH 30 billion (US$3.3 billion). This has contributed to widen
social disparities and to create a situation where large segments of the population do not significantly contribute to, nor
benefit from, the country's overall growth achievements.

Country: Kingdom of Morocco                                             Project Title: Second Municipal Finance Project
Since the early 1990s, the Government has been implementing a decentralization program aimed at increasing access to
basic infrastructure services for the populations living in small and medium-size cities and at facilitating their integration
into Morocco's modern economy. This program is based on three strategic priorities:
(a) Municipal Tax Reform. Local taxes are about equally divided into taxes managed by the Central Government
and taxes managed by the local governments. Local taxes and fees were last reformed in 1990-92 and have since
been accounted for an important and stable contribution to local government revenues. They consist mainly of
market- and food-related fees and taxes levied on the rental value of real estate. Some local taxes appear to be
low yield/high administrative and compliance cost taxes. Following a Bank report (No. 8782-MOR) on local
finance, the Government implemented a major reform in the distribution of the 30 percent local share of the VAT
in 1996. Seventy percent of this share is now allocated between provinces (20%), urban communes and
communities (30 percent) and rural communes (20 percent) according to a formula selected for each group.
Communal formulas take into account the need to help poorer communes through equalization. As of 1996,
local governments know in advance the budgetary transfers allocated to them, thus facilitating budgetary
planning. This new system requires more financial discipline at the local level because it eliminates the former
ex-post equilibrium subsidies which covered, in particular, debt service obligations and requires them to save for
capital spending. As a result, municipal lending institutions, in particular FEC, will have to pay increasing
attention to municipal credit risk management. However, debt service remains a compulsory budgetary line item
for municipalities under the new system. This provides FEC or other banks with a first creditor status and
constitutes the single most important guarantee available to municipal lenders.
(b) Private Provision of Infrastructure. The volume and efficiency of investment in infrastructure necessary to
sustain a growth rate of about 5 percent by the end of the century require the opening of most sectors to
competition and private capital. The Government has clearly stated its policy in encouraging greater private
provision of infrastructure and a recent Bank report (No.15059-MOR) makes detailed policy and regulatory
recommendations on expanding private participation in infrastructure. This report covers, in particular,
municipal services and identifies water distribution and solid waste disposal as promising candidates.
(c) Modernization of the Municipal Credit Market. Local governments rely almost exclusively on FEC to provide
long-term finance for their investment programs. This situation, in particular the limited interest of other
Moroccan banks for the municipal credit market, has resulted from (i) local governments' lack of financial and
decisionmaking autonomy under the tight control exercised by Mol; (ii) uneven accounting and auditing
standards applied to local governments; and (iii) the role assigned by the authorities to FEC itself, first as a
department of CDG, the state-owned institution collecting pension and social security funds, and since 1992 as a
separate specialized financial institution. The Government's decentralization policy offers significant scope for
broadening competition in the municipal credit market. In particular, the 1996 municipal tax reform allows
greater predictability in forecasting local governments' revenue flows, thus facilitating meaningful municipal
financial planning. In addition, an improved format for public accounting should be introduced at the communal
level in 1998-99.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project supports the above three strategic priorities. In particular:
(a) The project's mid-term review (March 1999) will, on the basis of a report to be prepared by FEC and the
Government, examine the functioning of the ongoing reforms, including the new VAT allocation formula and
possibilities of simplifying low-yield local taxes;
(b) As part of its transformation into ajoint stock company, due to take place no later than end- 1 998, FEC is
expected to become authorized to lend to privately sponsored municipal projects. So far, FEC can lend only to
local governments. The broader policy agenda for private participation in infrastructure will be pursued
primarily through the forthcoming Private Sector Adjustment Loan.
(c) Several prudential regulatory, financial and institutional measures have been agreed upon (para. 11). These
measures, once implemented, will enable FEC to operate according to internationally accepted norms, to improve
its financial performance, and to pave the way for eventual privatization through its transformation into a joint
stock company (societt anonyme).

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Opening the line of credit to other financial institutions to foster competition. Although one commercial bank expressed
interest, this option was not pursued because that bank asked for a Government guarantee on individual subloans.
However, there are no legal barriers to competition between FEC and the other financial institutions and FEC does not
enjoy special privileges, in the form of interest rate subsidies or access to cheap resources (the foreign exchange risk
coverage scheme will ensure the equalization of the cost of Bank funds to FEC with the cost of domestic capital of
comparable maturity; see Annex 2). Until alternative sources of term finance become available, FEC continues to offer
the only efficient channel of long-term finance for critically needed municipal infrastructure investment programs.
9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned):
Bank:         Pilot Project for the Communal Infrastructure Fund (Loan 2272-MOR, completed)
Municipal Finance I (Loan 3617-MOR, ongoing)
Private Sector Development Adjustment Loan (planned)
EIB:          Ongoing ECU 50 million line of credit to FEC
KFW:          DM 20.5 million concessional loan to Government passed on as equity to FEC;
Ongoing line of credit (DM 6.5 million) and DM 2.5 million grant for training and environmental
studies for rural municipalities. DM 15 million line of credit planned.
USAID:        Guarantees on US$15 million in bonds, and grant to FEC for training and equipment.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
(a) The Project Completion Report on the Pilot Project (No. 10075) recommends that FEC become more
autonomous and be supervised as a financial institution. This is a major objective of the proposed loan
(para. 11).
(b) The ongoing Municipal Finance I Project has demonstrated the need for more rigorous environmental and
economic analysis of subprojects (para. 18 and Annex 4).
(c) A loan of US$4 million was made in parallel to the Municipal Finance I Project to set up a training system for
the personnel of municipalities. This loan was cancelled due to its lack of utilization and MoF's decision to seek
grants for training. The 1997-99 Government training program for local governments was been reviewed by the
Bank during project preparation and found satisfactory (Annex 8).
11. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
(a) Prior to Board
- Statutory change of FEC into a bank (November 1996);
- Publication of the Central Bank's prudential regulations for FEC (February 1997);
- Start of the institutional development study (June 1997);
- Settlement of FEC's arrears with the transport regies and Special Accounts (second quarter 1997);
- FEC's capital increase by DH 120 million (February 1997);
- Presentation by the Mol of a satisfactory training program for the personnel of municipalities, together with a
financing plan (December 1996);
- Adoption through two internal Technical Instructions of (i) a new Environment Impact Assessment Procedure;
and (ii) new guidelines on economic analysis of municipal infrastructure projects (August 1997).
(b) Planned Actions
During negotiations, the following measures were agreed to and recorded in the legal documents:
- Compliance with selected financial performance indicators as of end-1997 (para. 14).
-  FEC's corporatization (transformation into a joint stock company, or societe anonyme) (December 31, 1998);
- Adoption by FEC of a medium-term development program based on the results of the institutional development
study (September 30, 1998);
- The Government and FEC will maintain the foreign exchange risk coverage scheme (Annex 2);
- Project mid-term review (March 31, 1999).

12. Value added of Bank support:
(a) The Bank loan will provide the long-term resources which are required to finance municipal infrastructure
projects and remain scarce on the domestic capital market;
(b) Assistance to FEC's transformation into a commercially viable, specialized financial institution which supports
the realization of economically justified and environmentally sound municipal infrastructure projects.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4):    [X]- ERR= at least 10 percent for subprojects with quantifiable benefits
Fiscal impact. The fiscal impact of the project will depend primarily on the benefits/costs that will accrue to the
Government under the foreign exchange risk coverage scheme. Based on the experience of the First Municipal Finance
Loan, the fiscal impact is expected to be neutral (a gain of DH 15 million accrued to the Treasury in 1994-95).
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5): NPV=US$ million n.a. FRR = 12 percent (for subprojects)
*  FEC's Financial Situation and Performance FEC's audited financial statements for the years 1992-96 are
summarized in Annex 5.
*  Capital adequacy. Since 1996, FEC has become a regulated financial institution. Accordingly, as of end-1996,
risk-weighted assets have been calculated on the basis of a ruling from the Central Bank which stipulates that a
20 percent weight will apply on budgeted loans to municipalities and a 100 percent weight will apply on loans to
Transport Authorities and to other nonbudgeted loans to municipal borrowers. The same ratios apply for the
calculation of loan provisions. The Central Bank ruling has based the 20 percent ratio applied to municipal loans
on the legal obligation of local governments to include all debt service expenses in their annual budgets.
Following the adoption of these Central Bank regulations, FEC's capital to risk-weighted assets ratio reached 12.8
percent at the end of 1996, above the minimum required level of 8.0 percent.
* Earnings performance. As shown in the table below and in the financial statements detailed in Annex 5, FEC's
profitability has been historically low. Since 1994, FEC has increased its lending rates to strengthen its income
generation capacity. Return on assets has improved (0.1 percent in 1996) but is still lower than the target of 0.8
percent included in the First Municipal Finance Project and below the average performance achieved by Moroccan
commercial banks. Similarly, return on equity is improving but remained weak at 2.4 percent in 1996.
*  Quality of loan portfolio. The percentage of the loan portfolio affected by loans in arrears was slightly less than
10 percent in 1995, of which 6 percent represents loans in arrears for more than 90 days. While the quality of
FEC's portfolio has been sound, and the percentage of loans in arrears, in terms of both number and principal
amount, has been relatively low in recent years, the replacement of ex-post Government subsidies to cover
municipal budget deficits by the introduction of a VAT receipts allocation formula in 1996 may increase the credit
risk of some municipal borrowers in the coming years (para. 6 (a)).
*  Loan provisions. Under the First Municipal Finance Project, policies for loan loss provisioning were established
in consultation with the Bank. As indicated in the notes to FEC's audited financial statements, implementation of
these policies from 1993 to 1995 would have led to a higher amount of loan provisions than the reported figures
and to higher debt-equity ratios. In 1996, in order to comply with the new Central Bank regulations, FEC made a
significant one-time adjustment on provisioning. Under the proposed project, loan provisioning would have to
comply with Central Bank regulations.
*  Accounting and audit arrangements. FEC's financial statements are audited by one of the Big Six international
accounting firms. Accounting standards follow generally accepted principles with the exception of accrual of
interest income. Given the small amount of loans in arrears, the overstatement of interest income has been
minimal. More importantly, FEC's future financial statements will be consistent with accepted accounting
principles since FEC will have to comply with the Central Bank's reporting requirements.

(b) The Challenge of integrating FEC into the Banking System
*  Financial prospects. FEC's projected financial statements are detailed in Annex 5 and reflect generally accepted
accounting principles. After a one-time adjustment on provisions in 1996, and other financial measures agreed to
as conditions of Board presentation, in particular the capital increase and the settlement of arrears (para. 11),
FEC's financial situation is projected to improve and remain adequate during the 1997-2000 period with a return
on assets averaging I percent and a return on equity of about 12 percent after 1997. FEC's continued sound
financial performance will depend primarily on its ability to increase the net intermediation margin above 2
percent (return on loans minus the cost of borrowed funds), together with a continued control over administrative
expenses and a careful selection of credit risk. This profitability threshold is needed to increase the return on
equity and provide added protection against an increase in bad loans, which would require higher provisions
(sensitivity analysis in Annex 5). FEC's flexibility to increase its net intermediation margin above 2 percent
might be limited by higher borrowing costs following the removal of the Central Government guarantee on FEC's
domestic bond issues in 1996. Since, at the same time, FEC's clients complain of high interest rates (currently 12
to 13.5 percent, one to two percentage points above commercial banks loans of comparable maturities), the
expansion of FEC's lending will increasingly depend on its ability to broaden the base and lower the cost of its
resources. For FEC, an important step towards gradually bringing its cost of funds closer to that of commercial
banks and offering competitive lending rates would be to gain access to municipal deposits. The issue of
liberalizing the mandatory placement of municipal deposits with the Treasury is being discussed among the
Government, FEC and the Bank, but currently faces opposition from the Ministry of Finance, primarily because
of budget constraints.
*  Sensitivity analysis. Bank capital adequacy and loan provisioning are the two most critical prudential standards
that FEC will have to comply with as a banking institution. A sensitivity analysis, presented in Annex 5, shows
that FEC is facing the typical conflict between growth and profitability. Depending on the changes in its cost of
funds, the quality of its loan portfolio and its future access to municipal deposits, FEC may have to constrain its
growth in lending operations. Diversifying sources of revenues will therefore become increasingly important to
maintain an adequate profitability. With the assistance of consultants, FEC is currently identifying possible
sources of nonlending revenues in the context of the institutional development study.

* Financial performance indicators. An appropriate balance between growth, profitability and capital adequacy
will be required if FEC is to operate as an autonomous banking institution seeking to minimize its borrowing
costs on the basis of its own financial credibility and to compete effectively with commercial banks in the
evolving market for municipal lending. FEC will have to comply with the following financial performance
indicators, which will be jointly monitored with the Bank. Any significant departure from the agreed indicators
will prompt discussions with the Bank with the view to FEC adopting corrective measures in order to maintain a
satisfactory financial condition.
FEC's Financial Performance Monitoring
Objective                            Indicator                             Target
Income generating capacity              Net intermediation margin          Minimum 1.9 percent
Capital adequacy                        Capital to risk-weighted assets    Minimum 8 percent
Control of administrative expenses      Administrative expenses to assets    Maximum 0.9 percent
(c) On-lending terms. See Annex 2: Detailed Project Description.
--------------------------------------------------------------__-------
15. Technical Assessment:
The technical viability of individual subprojects is assessed by FEC's staff. The Bank will review the larger projects with
subloans of more than US$2 million equivalent and those classified as environmentally sensitive under the new
environmental procedures (para. 18). No significant problems have been identified during the implementation of the
First Municipal Finance Project. FEC recently passed a convention with the Ministry of Public Works (which has a large
pool of competent engineers), which should facilitate and improve individual projects implementation.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a Executing agencies
(i) FEC's Role and Need for a New Strategy
* Until 1991, FEC was essentially a cash window with some technical expertise located at the state-owned Caisse
de Dip6ts et de Gestion (CDG) and providing long-tern finance to local governments. A first step towards
financial and managerial autonomy took place in 1992, when FEC was reorganized as a separate state-owned
financial institution with its own lending policies. The 1993 First Municipal Finance Project assisted FEC in this
first transition phase. In 1995, under the leadership of its general manager, FEC initiated a second transition
phase aimed at transforming FEC into a fully autonomous, market-based financial institution specialized into
providing financial services to the municipal sector. As a result, in mid-1996 FEC became a full-fledged bank
following approval of its statutory change by the Parliament. Its successful integration into the banking system
represents a major challenge for FEC. The necessary greater latitude given for lending and mobilizing resources
will increase financial risks, as detailed above (para. 14). At the same time, the new VAT formula (para. 6) has
increased the predictability of local government revenues and eliminated the ex-post budgetary subsidy
(subvention d'equilibre), which represented a quasi repayment guarantee for FEC. This means that municipal
creditworthiness analysis will become, in addition to project appraisal, an important part of FEC's credit risk
assessment.
* A set of actions to facilitate FEC's integration into a market-based financial system was discussed and agreed
upon with FEC and the Government (para. I1). In addition, an institutional development study with terms of
reference agreed upon with the Bank should be completed by the end of 1997. This study will identify FEC's
best strategic opportunities in an increasingly competitive municipal credit market and what institutional changes
are required to respond effectively.

b. Project management
FEC prepared, in consultation with Mol and MoF, a project implementation plan (PIP) which is available in the
project file.
----------------------------------------------------------------__-----
17. Social Assessment: n.a.
18. Environmental Assessment:               Environmental Category: B
(a) The proposed project has been classified as Category B. Most operations financed by FEC are geared toward the
improvement of infrastructure provision and the delivery of municipal services and are, therefore, expected to
contribute to the enhancement of living conditions in the beneficiary municipalities. Some of these municipal
infrastructure investments could possibly raise environmental concerns, if not addressed properly, especially in the
case of large-scale operations in areas such as: construction of slaughterhouses, market facilities, solid waste
disposal, sewerage and waste water treatment, major road construction, and neighborhood rehabilitation. To
guard against this, a new procedure has been established in the proposed project.
(b) In coordination with the Ministry of Environment, the Bank's project team assisted FEC in the design of an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This new procedure will be part of the appraisal process of the
subprojects, and their selection for financing will take into account compliance with environmental criteria. EIAs
will be carried out by the borrowing municipalities as part of the feasibility studies for the proposed subprojects.
Terms of reference for the ETA will be approved by FEC. The same applies to the clearance process for the EIA
results. Where needed, FEC will attach environmental covenants to the conditionalities of the subproject loans.
Donor funding is available (para. 9) to assist FEC and the municipalities in building adequate environmental
capacity. This EIA procedure and related appraisal measures were adopted by FEC and made part of its
Operational Directives in August 1997.

20. Sustainability:
A set of institutional and financial measures will facilitate FEC's integration into the banking system while strengthening
its position as the leader in Morocco's municipal credit market (para. 11). In addition, the joint mid-term review
scheduled for March 1999 will assess, on the basis of a report prepared by FEC and the Government, the progress
achieved in carrying out the project and agree, if necessary, on the corrective measures to ensure its efficient completion
and the achievement of its objectives.

develops.
Overall Project Risk Rating                  Moderate       The experience gained under the First Municipal
Finance Project and the set of regulatory, financial
and institutional measures to be introduced (paras.
II and 14) should enable FEC to implement the
project without delays and to improve its own
performance. However, FEC's transition to a
commercially viable, autonomous and financially
regulated institution represents a major challenge.
The Bank 's monitoring of the timely
implementation of these measures will therefore be
essential to ensure that the project meets its
development objectives and that FEC maintains a
sound financial performance.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Political Opposition: MoI and MoF are resisting some measures aimed at giving FEC more financial and managerial
autonomy. Also, in July 1996, several members of Parliament made clear that while approving FEC's statutory change
into a full-fledge bank, they would oppose any major departure from its original mandate of being Morocco's municipal
bank. The nature and timing of the measures to be implemented under the project were decided after extensive
consultations among FEC's general manager, the Government, and the Bank. They reflect an adequate balance between
the above political considerations and a necessary program of reforms.

23. Effectiveness Conditions: Standard conditions.
--------------------------------------------------------__--------------
24. Other
Actions covenanted in the legal documents are listed in para. 11 (b) and para. 14 (financial indicators). In addition,
standard reportinglauditing covenants will apply.
Block 5: Compliance with Bank Policies
[ ]   This project complies with all applicable Bank policies.
[X]  The following exceptions to Bank policies are recommended for approval: At the end of 1996, the Borrower, FEC,
did not comply with two of the financial covenants which were agreed upon under the First Municipal Finance
Project. The first one, the debt to equity ratio reached 16.5 at the end of 1996, compared to the agreed maximum
of 15 to 1. Following the DHI20 million capital increase, which took place early 1997 (para. 11), the ratio of
capital to risk-weighted assets is projected to reach 14.6 percent at the end of 1997 and to remain well above the
minimum level of 8 percent thereafter. This ratio has replaced the debt to equity ratio as an internationally
recognized measure of capital adequacy and will be monitored by the Central Bank and the Bank. The second
covenant, the return on assets ratio which measures profitability, remained below the agreed levels of 0.8 percent
and 1.0 percent in 1995 and 1996. It is projected to average a level of 0.9 percent in 1997-99. Under the project,
FEC's net intermediation margin, rather than return on assets, will be monitored as income generation capacity
will be critical to FEC's overall financial performance, including profitability, during project implementation
(para. 14(b)). The project complies with all other applicable Bank policies.

Second Municipal Finance Project (MA-5523)
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Municipal Infrastructure - US$110.0 million (total cost of component)
A US$70.0 million equivalent line of credit to FEC in two tranches of US$35 million and Ffr205 million will be
onlent to eligible beneficiaries to finance individual municipal infrastructure projects.
Eligible beneficiaries. All beneficiaries will have to comply with FEC's lending policies and environmental
guidelines, which are detailed in FEC's Policy Statement and are satisfactory to the Bank.'
On-lending arrangements. FEC will on-lend Bank funds to eligible beneficiaries at domestic, market-determined
interest rates with a maturity of not more than 15 years, including a grace period of not more than 3 years. As in
the previous loan (Municipal Finance I), the Moroccan Treasury will operate a foreign exchange risk coverage
system which is expected to be self-financing and will ensure the equalization of the cost of Bank funds with the
cost of long-term domestic capital. FEC will pay into an exchange guarantee fund the difference between the
interest rate on foreign borrowings and the market-determined cost of resources in the domestic market. A
reference rate will be used to equate the cost of domestic and foreign capital. This rate will be the weighted
average cost of 5-year Treasury domestic bond issues during the previous 12 months. It will be adjusted every
year. Hence, both FEC and the final borrowers will be indifferent to whether the funds are domestically or
externally borrowed. As a result, the Bank loan will neither crowd out domestic financial markets nor provide
FEC with cheaper resources than potential competing banks would need for term lending. Under the scheme, the
Treasury (or FEC) will reimburse any foreign exchange losses (or gains) accrued every year within six months
following the end of the year. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Treasury will maintain the
scheme under the project.
Bank financing. For eligible subprojects, the Bank loan will finance up to 70 percent of the investment cost of
individual subprojects. The maximum subloan for a single investment subproject will be US$5 million, since
projects requiring larger loans could be easily cofinanced by other sources. The project will finance about 100
investment subprojects.
Free limit and subloan approval. The Bank will continue to review a selected number of subprojects as a means
of strengthening FEC's internal capabilities. In view of the positive experience under the First Municipal
Finance loan, the free limit will be raised to US$2 million (from US$1 million). The Bank will also review
subprojects classified in the first category (the most environmentally sensitive) in the new Environmental Impact
Assessment procedure.
Project Component 2 - Institutional Development - US$0.3 million (total cost of component). FEC will
implement an institutional development plan based on the results of the strategy study. The study is financed by
FEC (one-third) and a grant from the French Government (two-thirds).
The guidelines include: (a) for local governments, maintaining a ratio of total debt service to total ordinary resources of not more
than 0.40; (b) for regies, maintaining a ratio of operating costs (excluding depreciation) to operating revenues of not more than
0.70. A new operational directive on environmental guidelines prepared with Bank assistance was issued in August 1997.

Economic Analysis of Municipal Infrastructure Projects
* FEC finances investments in water supply, power, urban roads and drainage, sewerage and wastewater
disposal, rehabilitation of neighborhoods, community facilities and neighborhood economic development
facilities. The proposed line of credit will have major benefits, including: (a) reduction in health hazards to
the local population through better water distribution and sewerage infrastructure; (b) improved
environmental conditions through the promotion of solid waste collection systems and disposal schemes; and
(c) increased competitiveness through the rehabilitation and expansion of existing road and power networks
and development of modern yet traditional distribution systems (markets, or souks, in particular).
* Under the proposed project, the economic analysis of subprojects will be strengthened. Currently, an
economic analysis is carried out only for revenue-generating subprojects and economic benefits are estimated
for urban roads. FEC's management has already shown a strong commitment to carry on more demanding
economic analysis, necessary to ensure the best allocation of limited resources. The following general
economic criteria will apply: (a) for all eligible subprojects, the least-cost solution adequate to meet
communities' needs will be selected through the analysis of technical alternatives; and (b) a minimum
economic rate of return equivalent to the opportunity cost of capitall for subproject with quantifiable benefits.
A comparison to operational benchmarks based on the Moroccan experience will be used to evaluate small
projects (project cost below DH15million) for which the quantification of economic benefits would require
large surveys. The criteria are presented by sector in Table I below and detailed in the Staff Assessment
Report entitled "Economic Evaluation - Guidelines and Criteria" (Annex 8).
. These criteria for economic analysis have been prepared and agreed upon with FEC. Drawing from the
experience of the First Municipal Project, it is necessary (a) to ensure that the least-cost alternative is chosen
for all projects, (b) to insist on the cost-recovery of operation and maintenance (o&m) expenditures as a
minimum, and (c) to require detailed economic analysis for large subprojects with quantifiable benefits. For
this purpose, FEC will gather sectoral surveys sharing information with its partners and strengthen its staff
abilities on economic analysis.
* The economic analysis of infrastructure investments according to the above criteria is expected to foster an
efficient allocation of the communes' scarce resources through the implementation of prioritized pluriannual
investment.
Estimated at 10 percent.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
The loan will finance the procurement of goods (including machinery, equipment, waste collection vehicles, etc.) and
civil works for infrastructure subprojects submitted by the municipalities. Given that subprojects have not been pre-
appraised, estimates for the breakdown of project expenditures by procurement categories may vary. Procurement under
the Loan will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The Bank's standard bidding
documents will be used for all procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
Civil Works. ICB will apply for all works contracts exceeding US$3 million. Works contracts below US$3 million will
be awarded following National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Based on the experience
with the First Municipal Finance Project, subprojects are expected to be relatively small and dispersed across the country,
and to be implemented by different municipalities. Grouping the contracts into large packages to attract international
bidders would not be feasible. NCB procedures have been reviewed by the Bank and, with some agreed-upon
modifications, have been judged acceptable. For contracts below US$150,000, quotations may be obtained from at least
three contractors.
Goods. All contracts for goods costing US$500,000 or more will be awarded following ICB procedures. Contracts
below US$500,000 will be awarded following NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts costing less than
US$150,000 may be awarded through local shopping after receiving quotations from at least three suppliers.
Review of Contracts. All contracts for civil works costing US$1.5 million and above, goods valued at US$500,000 and
above, as well as the first two contracts under each of the works and goods categories irrespective of the values, will be
subject to prior Bank review. All other contracts will be subject to random post review during supervision missions by
Bank staff. This is acceptable given that local procurement procedures have been judged to be acceptable to the Bank and
prior experience with FEC has been satisfactory.
Procurement Monitoring and Supervision. Responsibility for procurement of infrastructure investment subprojects
will lie with the municipalities or their designated agencies. FEC will have a monitoring function by reviewing the
procurement methods, bidding documents and the evaluation of bids. FEC will also submit to the Bank the procurement
files for prior review.

Disbursement
The proceeds of the Bank loan will be disbursed against 70 percent of the amount of individual subloans.
Disbursements against civil works contracts exceeding US$1,500,000 million equivalent and goods contracts
exceeding US$500,000 will be fully documented. For all other expenditures, disbursement could be made against
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents for SOEs will not be submitted to the Bank, but will be
retained by FEC and made available to Bank staff during supervision. FEC will record the contracts so that the Bank can
monitor them during prior or ex-post review as needed.
To facilitate project implementation, a Special Account in a financial institution acceptable to the Bank will be
established with an authorized allocation of up to US$5.8 million. This deposit will be based on estimates of project
financing needs and estimated Bank disbursement equivalent for an average of four months. Upon loan effectiveness, an
amount of US$2.9 million will be deposited to the Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available when
the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account and outstanding special commitments equal US$20 million.
In order to prevent delays in implementing subprojects submitted by local governments to FEC and because of
the difficulty of rapidly mobilizing alternative sources of funds, retroactive financing will be allowed up to an aggregate
of US$7 million for expenditures incurred since January 1, 1997. The closing date of the loan is December 31, 2001.
