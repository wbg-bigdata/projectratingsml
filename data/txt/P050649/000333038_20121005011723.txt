1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.   Context at Appraisal

1.     At the time of appraisal, road transport accounted for about 80% of both freight
and passenger trips in the state of Tamil Nadu, facilitating trade as well as generating
substantial employment in its own right. The demand for road transport was increasing
exponentially with a phenomenal annual growth (of 14%) in the vehicle registration
during the 1990s. The supply of road infrastructure was severely lagging and, even
among the State Highways and Major District Roads, more than 50% (about 8,700 km) of
the roads were of less than two lane width (7.0m carriageway); the remainder of the state
road network comprising Other District Roads (ODRs) and village and urban roads, too,
were generally single lane (3.5m carriageway).

2.      On the financing front, during the Ninth Plan Period (1997-2001), the road sector
expenditure constituted about 3% to 4% of total expenditure of the Government of Tamil
Nadu (GoTN). However, following a several fiscal crisis in 2001-02, the share of road
sector expenditure decreased to 2% of the total expenditure. Funding for road
maintenance used to be less than 65% of the estimated requirements. Moreover, a
substantial portion of this allocation used to be consumed for establishment expenditure,
reaching a high of 68% in 2001-02. As a result, the network was fraught with a
substantial backlog of capital expenditure and deferred maintenance and marked
deterioration of the structural condition and riding quality.

3.      On the institutional front, an independent review of the state’s Highways
Department (HD) – the main agency responsible for the development and maintenance of
state road network – identified the following major weaknesses: (i) mixed function
characteristics of the HD making it less amenable for applying clear lines of
responsibility for service delivery; (ii) ineffective funding mechanisms leading to an
inadequate, bureaucratically cumbersome and unstable resource-flow for asset
management; (iii) ineffective systems for collecting and analyzing the information
required for managerial decision making with regard to strategic, program and works
planning; (iv) obsolete processes for management of several core functional areas such as,
for example, information, environmental and social safeguards, financial management,
design, quality assurance and procurement; and (v) sub-optimal regulatory environment
due to out of date legislation and supporting regulations. As is the case elsewhere in India,
road safety was a major concern. Rapid motorization combined with inadequate
enforcement of driving and vehicle road worthiness regulations as well as inadequate
infrastructure led to a rapid rise in the number of deaths and injuries from road accidents.

4.      In summary, at the time of appraisal, the challenges being faced by the highway
sector in Tamil Nadu can be grouped under the following four broad categories: (a)
capacity expansion severely lagging behind demand; (b) inadequate allocation of funds in
general and to maintenance in particular; (c) organizational capacity of HD constrained
by a combination of ineffective/obsolete structures, systems and processes; and (d) lack
of a coherent strategy to address road safety issues.



                                             1
5.     Government’s strategy: To address the myriad problems outlined above, the
GoTN sought to undertake several initiatives including: (a) implementing reforms in the
HD in the areas of organizational structure, procurement, financial and information
management; (b) establishing a Road Fund including preparation of a Road Fund Bill; (c)
giving fillip to road safety enhancements through establishment of a Road Safety Fund
and creation of a unique position of Special Commissioner for Transport and Road Safety
as the nodal officer to implement the road safety action plan; and (d) improving
regulatory environment to facilitate greater private sector involvement. In addition, the
Highways Act enacted in September 2002 considerably strengthened the HD’s ability to
enforce its right of way; prevent ribbon development; utilize simplified land acquisition
procedures; and to enter into agreements with private companies to undertake road
maintenance and development. Also, the government increased the target for road sector
expenditure during the Tenth Plan period (2002-07) to an average of USD 291 million
annually, i.e., 115% more than the expenditure during the previous five years. During the
same period, the share of establishment expenses in the total sector expenditure was
sought to be decreased from 17% to 5%, thereby creating room for more maintenance
and investment expenditures on the state road network.

6.      Project Rationale: The project was designed to assist the GoTN in addressing the
aforementioned challenges in the state road sector, through a combination of road
upgrading and maintenance & safety components that respectively focused on alleviating
capacity constraints and maintenance backlog on selected routes, and an institutional
strengthening and policy development component closely aligned with the government’s
reform priorities. Furthermore, the project was envisaged to bring to bear the Bank’s
experience from similar projects in other states in the country, especially with regard to:
(a) accelerating the institutional and policy reform process; (b) ensuring that community
participation, social development and environmental concerns are fully reflected in
project design; and (c) achieving enhanced transparency, adoption of streamlined
procedures, pragmatic and timely implementation and dissemination of ‘best practices’ in
road construction and management.

1.2.   Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
       approved)

7.      The project development objective was to improve the quality and sustainability
of the state's core road network, that is, the state highways and the major district roads
being managed by the Highways Department of Tamil Nadu. This objective was to be
achieved through the following four outputs: (i) capacity and quality enhancement of
about 750 km of state roads in the core network with proper management of environment
and social impacts; (ii) major maintenance of about 2,000 km and accident black-spot
improvements at a number of critical locations; (iii) improvements to the management of
the state road network through institutional strengthening and Public-Private Partnerships
(PPP); and (iv) enhanced funding and improved allocation procedures for the road sector.

1.3.      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
          Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.        The PDO was not revised.

1.4.      Main Beneficiaries

9.      The target population of the project included road users, agricultural producers,
urban consumers, roadside communities, transport operators and tourists. These were
expected to benefit from: (a) better connectivity leading to higher levels of economic
activity and tourism and hence greater employment opportunities; (b) lower freight and
passenger transport costs enhancing the competitiveness of tradable sectors of the
economy, providing economic and social benefits to the communities; (c) improved
access to urban industrial consumption centers enhancing agricultural sector productivity
and incomes; and (d) better maintained and managed roads leading to lower life cycle
costs and more effective use of limited public funds for the road sector. In addition,
people living adjacent to project roads were expected to be direct net beneficiaries as a
result of their improved access to services, markets and information.

1.5.       Original Components (as approved)

10.    A summary of the main components of the project, together with their costs as
estimated at the time of appraisal, is as follows:

    Road Upgrading Component (about 750 km) (USD 320.97 million): This
     component primarily aimed at improving the capacity of the state road network
     through widening and strengthening of about 750 km of existing state highways
     (including 14 bypasses - some of which are new) to two-lane roads. It was expected
     to bring in medium to large sized contractors through international competitive
     bidding procedures for the execution of these works. The designs were proposed to be
     done by international consultants and works were also proposed to be supervised by
     consultants procured through international competition. This component also aimed at
     supporting upgrading and/or construction of state roads and bridges through sub-
     projects to be taken up through PPP by the GoTN. Appropriate environmental
     mitigation and resettlement action plans developed for these works were also
     proposed to be implemented to take care of the possible impacts.

      Road Maintenance and Safety Works Component (USD 110.72 million): Under this
       component the project aimed at addressing the periodic maintenance and safety
       related minor works needed to maintain a smooth, safe and comfortable flow of
       traffic on the core road network of the state. Maintenance of about 2,000 km of state
       roads was to be taken up over a four year period with the Bank's funding decreasing
       over the years. The work was to be implemented through a mix of conventional
       maintenance contracts and performance-based maintenance contracts, targeted to
       involve small to medium sized national contractors to help strengthen their
       capabilities. These were to be supervised by HD officers with a periodic technical
       review being undertaken by an independent consultant engineer. Similarly, accident


                                               3
       black-spots identified under the project were proposed to be analyzed and followed
       up with design and execution of suitable minor remedial interventions at up to 100
       locations.

     Institutional Strengthening and Policy Development Component (USD 14.83
      million): Under this component of the project the state government proposed to
      utilize the services of experts and consultant firms to help in the implementation of an
      Institutional Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP). The component also aimed at
      strengthening the road maintenance planning and implementation within HD through
      supporting the development and use of a maintenance management system and
      improving the capacity of agencies concerned with road safety in the state through
      technical assistance services and training. This component also aimed at helping the
      state in looking at PPP for road transport infrastructure development through
      appropriate technical assistance.

1.6.       Revised Components

11.       There were no major revisions to the project components.

1.7.      Other significant changes

12.     In May 2005, the Loan Agreement was amended to support the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of a few roads and structures damaged by the Tsunami that struck the coast
of Tamil Nadu on December 26, 2004. These changes constituted a relatively smaller
portion of the overall loan and there were no changes in the overall PDOs and the
performance indicators. In 2009, the project closing date was extended by one year, to
March 31, 2010, and the GoTN’s request for waiver of the covenant pertaining to
creation of Road Fund was accepted based on the plea that sufficient funds for
maintenance are being allocated through the budget.

13.     Additional financing (loan) of USD 50.7 million: In March 2010, an additional
loan amount of USD 50.7 million was provided to help finance the costs associated with
cost overruns in the project which were primarily due to: (i) increased costs of the
upgrading works due to delays and the consequent increase in the prices of key
construction materials; (ii) appreciation of Indian Rupee vis-à-vis the US Dollar; and (iii)
addition of a Tsunami affected bridge for which amendment to the Loan Agreement was
carried out. The additional loan approval also included extension of loan closing date to
March 31, 20123.

14.    Partial cancellation of loan proceeds: In 2012, since there were savings in the
loan, USD 11.65 million was cancelled. Thus the total amount of loan reduced from USD

  The additional financing loan was consistent with the November 2008 CAS (for the period FY 2009 –
2012) which was organized around the pillars of: rapid and inclusive growth, sustainable development, and
service delivery, with a cross-cutting focus on improving the effectiveness of public spending and
achieving results.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.     At the outset, it is important to note that the preparation for this project started
almost 15 years ago, in 1997, and its concept was reviewed in March 1999 but the
appraisal was completed nearly four years later, in February 2003. This significant time
lapse between the concept review and appraisal was reportedly due to serious differences
between the project coordination consultants and the implementing agency and lack of
effective leadership at the Project Management Unit (PMU). The Bank took a conscious
decision to “pause? the project preparation until both these issues were resolved.
Following the resolution of these issues, from 2002 onwards, the project preparation
regained traction and its development objectives and design acquired final shape mainly
during the couple of years immediately preceding the appraisal. Some of the factors that
had notable impact during this phase are detailed below.

16.      A simple, evidence-based and realistic approach to project preparation and
design: The team’s approach to project preparation and design was simple and fairly
methodical. First, a set of core sector issues/challenges were identified based on a robust
state-specific analysis that relied on existing data (reflecting the declining availability of
funds for the sector and neglect of maintenance), independent studies (highlighting the
limitations of the Highways Department and the priorities/expectations of the road users)
and the client government’s priorities (as ascertained through discussions as well as
review of various policies and other reform initiatives). Then, each of the identified core
challenges was sought to be addressed through a designated project component. In
specific terms, the project was geared towards addressing three specific challenges,
namely, inadequate capacity and quality of the core road network, maintenance backlog
and lack of attention to safety and weak institutional capacity of HD, respectively through
three components, viz., Road Upgrading, Road Maintenance & Safety works, and
Institutional Strengthening & Policy Development.

17.      The design of each of the project components, too, was closely aligned with the
findings of a strategic options study (in case of civil works) or the government’s
willingness and commitment (in case of institutional and policy development).
Furthermore, the scope and size of the components indicate a good appreciation of what
is realistically doable within the limits of the project budget and timeframe. This logical
approach seems to have paid off in terms of a project that is simple in design – with each
component/task addressing a fairly well-defined challenge/output and, in turn, linked to a
set of relevant outcome indicators – and, therefore, more amenable to effective
implementation and monitoring.

18.    Assimilation of experience and lessons from other projects: Some of the notable
lessons from other projects that were brought to bear on the design of the project – and
proven to be critical during the course of implementation – are as follows:


                                              5
   Implementation readiness: (i) By the time of project approval, all the upgradation
    projects, accounting for about 70% of the project cost, were nearly ready for
    invitation of bids; (ii) prequalification for four large civil works packages (totaling
    about USD 270 million) and selection of the supervision consultants was done before
    the loan negotiations, leading to issuance of contracts for four large civil works before
    end-2005; (iii) up-front preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and
    advanced initiation of land acquisition; and (iv) provisions for ensuring the payment
    of compensation and resettlement assistance to project-affected persons (PAPs) prior
    to handing over of respective road stretches to the contractors.

   Client ownership for implementing institutional development measures as reflected,
    for example, in the enactment of the TN Highways Act in 2000 (to empower HD) and
    the state government’s endorsement of the principles and concepts underpinning the
    framework for institutional development (in August 2001).

   Familiarizing the client with the Bank’s procurement procedures: During the project
    preparation, a number of seminars were organized to help the state road agencies
    familiarize themselves with the Bank procurement and disbursement arrangements.

19.     Identification and Mitigation of Risks: At the time of appraisal, the project was
assigned a rating of “Modest Risk? based on identification and analysis of a total of 18
risks with potential impact on the project’s financial, physical or institutional
sustainability. Of these, four risks were rated as “Substantial Risks?, viz., absence of
sustained commitment (of government) to sector reform; slow flow of funds from GoTN
to HD and delays in submission of audit reports; resistance of HD staff to change and
organizational restructuring; and delays in land acquisition and resettlement. In reality,
the “modest? risks of lack of effective senior management leadership, inadequate
performance of HD and delayed procurement turned out to be “substantial? at least for
some time during preparation and implementation.

20.     Major risks overlooked: Given the large upgradation works, delays on account of
utility shifting could have been recognized as a “substantial risk? and appropriately
mitigated. Yet, another major risk was the government’s willingness and commitment to
adopt the changes/recommendations emanating from the Institutional Strengthening
component. Interestingly, the importance of such commitment was reflected in a couple
of output indicators (nos. 4.2 and 4.3) but even there, the means chosen to assess them –
that is, outputs from the respective IT systems – were not sufficient indicators of the
intended results. Finally, the fact that the project required additional financing indicates
that price escalation and exchange rate could have been recognized as the potential risks.

21.     Ex-ante Agreement on Key Actions: At the time of appraisal/negotiations, a clear
and explicit agreement was reached with GoTN on a wide array of actions that were
identified as critical for effective implementation. These were related to: (i) project
management, coordination and oversight at various administrative levels (e.g.
constitution of Empowered Committee, Steering Committee, and Evaluation Committee,
maintenance and adequate staffing of PMU, etc.); (ii) data collection, management and
reporting; (iii) maintenance management; and (iv) environmental and social safeguard


                                             6
management. Many of these actions such as, for example, establishment of a dedicated
PMU (also referred to as Tamil Nadu Road Sector Project (TNRSP)), have indeed proven
to be critical in implementation phase.

2.2.    Implementation

22.     The project implementation started on a slow track and slipped into the
“Moderately Unsatisfactory? territory for about one year around 2006, but picked up pace
soon after due to concerted efforts from both the client and the Bank. Some of the factors
that had notable impact on implementation are as follows.

23.     Implementing Agency Leadership and Staffing: Although the government had
established and staffed PMU by the time of loan effectiveness, the implementation was
adversely affected for one to two years because of inadequate leadership. This led to
delays on several key fronts such as, for example, land acquisition and utility shifting. As
the government rectified this sometime around 2006 and thereafter ensured capable
leadership until the end, the implementation rating quickly moved up to “Moderately
Satisfactory? in 2006 itself and then to “Satisfactory? from 2007 onwards till the closing
date. Interviews with implementation partners such as contractors and independent
consultant engineers (supervision consultants) have underscored the critical role played
by the project leadership in: (a) keeping the communication channels open and creating
an environment of mutual trust, wherein the problems at the ground level as well as
suggestions for addressing them could be easily shared; and (b) resolving “knotty?
problems in a proactive and flexible manner. The project also continuously enjoyed the
benefit of adequate staffing with requisite skills in the areas of procurement, project
monitoring and management of financial, environmental and social safeguards.

24.     Ripple Effect of Initial Delays: In case of the four high-value contracts pertaining
to upgradation works, the significant time lapse between the design stage to beginning of
construction had a ripple effect, beginning with a substantive deterioration of structural
condition of the roads (accentuated by little or no maintenance of these stretches by the
HD and also the heavy monsoons and Tsunami in the interregnum). The deterioration, in
turn, necessitated sizeable design changes and the time taken in according approvals to
the design changes contributed to further delays and consequent cost over runs as the
prices of key BoQ items such as bitumen and steel had substantially increased during the
extended construction periods.

25.    Procurement and Contract Management: Barring the 12-16 month time taken
between the bid opening and contract signing in case of the three large upgradation
contracts, the project performed fairly well in terms of proactively managing the
contracts as reflected in relatively low levels of cumulative value of variations/claims4.
Also, contract conditions such as liquidated damages have been judiciously applied to


4
  The delays in these upgradation packages were mainly attributable to re-bidding (in case of one package
where the bids received were much higher than the estimated amount) and longer time taken for Bank’s
clearance for award (in case of another package, wherein the “winning bidder? was under an INT
investigation in some other project).


                                                   7
expedite compliance; most of them were upheld during the subsequent judicial process.
On the issue of compliance with agreed procurement procedures also, this was a
relatively better example, since not many deviations were noted during the post reviews.
The project was able to ensure that the staff assigned to procurement functions were both
adequate and suitably trained, which helped ensure better procurement and contract
management. Close supervision of procurement by senior officials (e.g. Project Director)
also helped in ironing out problems.

26.     Effective and Innovative Approaches to Land Acquisition and R&R: As in the
case of many other aspects of the project, the implementation of land acquisition and
RAP, too, was delayed during 2005-06 and the social safeguards implementation was
rated as moderately satisfactory and then moderately unsatisfactory due to non-
compliance with the safeguard policy provisions related to payment of compensation and
alternative resettlement prior to displacement.5 These problems, however, were resolved
soon after and, on the whole, the project made good progress on land acquisition and
R&R mainly on the strengths of: (a) sustained consultations with the affected
communities, with facilitation by NGOs and concurrent monitoring consultants,
throughout the planning, preparation, design and implementation phases; and (b) the
innovative approach of private negotiations (based on guideline values ranging between
159-209% depending on the severity of impacts). Another important feature of the
resettlement implementation was the additional assistance to severely affected people
through land purchase grants, house building allowances and severance allowance6.

27.      Appropriate Sizing and Phasing of Activities: Within the institutional/policy
actions, instead of attempting some “big bang? reforms, the teams focused on clearly
defined activities with potential to address some tangible, proximate challenges being
faced by the targeted users in their duties, e.g., road accident database management
system for recording and analysis of information related to accidents (to help police and
other departments to better manage various post-event and preventive aspects of
accidents), project financial and management system to track physical and financial
progress of projects (to help HD in better management of contracts) and road asset
management system for mechanized collection of structural data to determine road
condition (to help HD in better planning and budgeting). Also, during the preparation and
initial phases of implementation of the project, relatively stronger emphasis on expediting
large civil works contracts seems to have generated goodwill for the project and paved
the way for smoother implementation of the institutional/policy actions that needed
interventions beyond the realm of the PMU.

28.    Implementation partners, especially in large Civil Works: Once the project
implementing agency started proactively addressing major issues like land acquisition
and utility shifting, the contractors and independent consultant engineers (supervision
consultants) responded positively by mobilizing adequate resources for expediting

progress. While there were a few niggling instances such as delays in finalization of
structural designs, the PMU, contractors and supervision consultants have mostly worked
in unison to overcome the challenges through flexibility (as in paying some additional
compensation to expedite “last mile? land acquisition) and ingenuity (as in use of pre-cast
boxes to overcome the delay in shifting water supply lines).

29.    Coordination with other government agencies: A review of the delays in civil
works highlights the importance of effective coordination with other government
agencies such as, for example, the revenue department (for expediting land acquisition
and R&R activities) and Railways (for timely completion of Road-Over-Bridges).7 The
Road Accident Database Management System, on the other hand, provides a good
example of how the user (department) buy-in was achieved through securing the
commitment from the highest level (Secretary, Home Department) followed by intensive
discussions with the potential users to draw the system specifications during the
preparation of the Request for Proposal (RfP).

30.      The Mid-Term Review (August 2006) examined the project objectives,
implementation structure, project finances, and implementation of civil works and
institutional strengthening components and the action plans for resettlement and
environmental management. During the MTR, the status of implementation progress was
upgraded from “Moderately Unsatisfactory? to “Moderately Satisfactory.? The relevant
observations and findings from the mid-term review were used to build upon or
corroborate the ICR team's observations and analysis with respect to implementation
challenges and progress.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation: Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.     M&E Design: The outcome/output indicators listed at the time of appraisal were
fairly comprehensive and relevant for monitoring and evaluating the overall project
development objective and outputs/outcomes related to civil works components, that is,
Road Upgrading and Maintenance & Road Safety. The indicators for some of the
activities under the institutional and policy development component, however, could have
been more precise. For example, some of the indicators referred to either the occurrence
of events (as, for example, scheduled implementation of institutional development action
plan or functional reorganization of HD) or outputs from systems such as the Project
Financial and Management System (PFMS) and Road Asset Management System. Mere
occurrence/production of such events/outputs may not be a sufficient evidence of tangible
improvement in the functioning of the Highways Department. A more effective approach
could have been to measure how the Highways Department’s functioning had improved
in terms of say, time taken in preparing, awarding and implementing projects or the
efficiencies gained in capital and maintenance expenditure.




7
  For instance, during the course of implementation, Indian Railways objected to third-party construction of
all the Road-Over-Bridges (RoBs) and insisted that the same be constructed through the agencies
designated by them.


                                                     9
32.     M&E Implementation and Utilization: The project monitored various output and
outcome indicators through a judicious combination of: (a) regular sources such as the
annual reports of HD, Quarterly Progress Reports, and government’s plan and policy
documents; and (b) specially commissioned studies and surveys (for evaluating
resettlement impacts and road user satisfaction). Also, the project-supported IT-systems
have significantly added to the Highways Department’s ability to regularly monitor and
evaluate data on many critical parameters, viz., project & financial management, road
accidents, traffic and road conditions.

2.4.    Safeguard Compliance (Satisfactory)

33.     Social Safeguards. At the time of appraisal in 2003, the magnitude of land
acquisition and displacement triggered by this project – 572 hectares of land and impact
on about 15,000 households – was the largest among this type of state highway projects
financed by the World Bank in India. GoTN adopted a project specific Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R&R) policy and also prepared a project Resettlement Action Plan
summarizing the magnitude of impacts, results of baseline surveys and institutional
responsibility/capacity. The land area finally acquired for this project was 645 hectares
including 432 hectares of private land, 13% more than what was anticipated at the time of
appraisal. The number of affected people remained more or less the same at 14,757
including 3,646 non-title holders (25%) as projected at the time of project appraisal
indicating that the resettlement impacts were identified accurately at the outset. By the
project closing date, resettlement implementation was fully completed as all affected
families received their compensation and main entitlements, except some residual
benefits such as title to alternative houses in case of 52 families and electricity connection
to 53 families and extending additional benefits such a house building and land purchase
grants to those who had received compensation under the TN Highways Act. In all, more
than 90% of 11,121 land owners came forward to the private negotiations and as many as
62 small resettlement sites were developed to resettle 543 families including 40 shops.
One of the highlights of resettlement implementation is social inclusion. As many as
3,646 families, i.e. about one-fourth of affected families such as squatters and
encroachers were given assistance and support in the form of ex-gratia amounts for lost
assets, subsistence/shifting allowances and alternative houses/shop and support for
income generation activities. As regards community properties, 1,679 assets such as
school buildings, small temples, hand pumps, Panchayat offices, etc. were reconstructed.
In some cases the local villagers also came forward to contribute the money for
reconstruction of some of the affected communities such as worship places8.

34.    The land acquisition and resettlement implementation was largely successful and
the project closed with a satisfactory rating on social safeguards. Also, based on the
experience of this project and key provisions from the National R&R Policy, “Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Guidelines? were developed and are awaiting adoption.



8
  The total land acquisition and resettlement costs were 3.8% of the project cost (Rs. 733 million, against
the project cost of Rs. 22,350 million).


                                                    10
35.     Environmental Aspects: The overall Environmental Safeguards Management for
the project was complex and challenging due to a wide range of issues, with some of the
key issues being: (i) impacts on different environmental settings including highly
sensitive coastal areas and forested areas; (ii) road corridors passing through rich cultural
heritage areas (temples, shrines, mosques, tombs and churches), including temples like
Gangaikondacholapuram temple, a UNESCO World heritage site built during 1012-44;
(iii) project corridors passing adjacent to many community surface water collection
ponds9, and affecting some of them due to project interventions; and (iv) cutting of large
number of road side trees for road widening.

36.     During the preparation, the environmental issues were comprehensively addressed
through: (a) delineating various measures as well as institutional arrangements for
implementation of Environmental Management Plan (EMP); (b) extensive public
consultations; and (c) design and integration of environmental enhancement measures
into precise BOQs. Also, the project preparation included comprehensive tree plantation
measures with well-defined arrangements for implementation. In addition, the project
implementation plans included preparation of Environmental Management Policy under
the institutional development component.

37.     During implementation, although there were some initial slippages, over time,
TNRSP has taken relevant actions including enforcement of penal provisions under the
contract to ensure that the overall implementation of environmental measures was
satisfactory. In order to ensure environmental issues were effectively addressed during
the construction phase, appropriate provisions including costing for implementation of
EMP measures were incorporated in the construction contracts. The enhancement
measures included integration of cultural property enhancement measures; specific
actions to reduce impact of construction in the proximity of cultural properties; protection
and desilting/deepening of community ponds along the project corridors; landscaping and
enhancement of incidental spaces (“oxbow? areas) created due to geometric corrections;
and construction of roadside water recharge pits in dry and water scarce areas. Integration
of environment into contracts has helped in enhancement of community assets at one
third to one fifth of actual cost of implementation under “no project? scenario (see Table
1 below). Interestingly, for enhancement of ponds and cultural properties, the
communities have contributed, on an average, 3% and 8% of the project costs,
respectively; in some cases, the contribution percentage was as high as 15%.

38.     Tree Plantation: The compensatory tree plantation along the project corridors
has been carried out through a well-conceived plan, supported by growing nurseries early
in the project implementation. While there were poor survival rates initially (as low as
37%), TNRSP took special initiatives to improve the survival rate to 87% by the end of
the project implementation with 90,000 trees ranging from 2 to 3 years age. As per the
provisions in the MoU with the Forest Department, the maintenance of these trees will be
carried out till March 2013 which includes replacement of casualties. The project closed
with a satisfactory rating on environmental safeguards.

2.5.      Fiduciary Compliance (Satisfactory)

39.      Procurement. The project had four large civil works packages (for upgradation
of roads) procured through ICB and some relatively smaller works packages (mostly for
maintenance of roads) procured through NCB. In addition, there were several packages of
consultancies, some related to civil works (such as supervision) and the balance under the
institutional strengthening component. Some goods were also procured under the
institutional strengthening component. As already detailed in the earlier sections, despite
some delays, the procurement aspects, in general, were effectively managed and made
significant positive contribution to the preparation (e.g., pre-qualification for four large
contracts) and implementation (e.g., proactive contract management including
expeditious imposition of liquidated damages where appropriate) of the project. On the
whole, the procurement of works, goods, and services was carried out in accordance with
Bank guidelines and the procurement plan was updated each year and also as and when
necessary.

40.     Financial Management: The financial management performance of this project
has been satisfactory and there were no significant issues encountered during the project
implementation. This was mainly on account of: (i) simplified financial management
arrangements; (ii) use of government’s mainstream treasury systems; (iii) sustained
availability of experienced and qualified accounting staff in the PMU and field divisions;
and (iv) effective oversight and control by the PMU through institutionalization of the
internal audit wing for the road upgradation component. While the field divisions
maintained adequate expenditure records, the PMU was regular in the submission of


                                               12
monthly accounts to the Accountant General (Accounts & Entitlements) and expenditure
claims and audit reports to the Bank.10 These aspects resulted in submission of external
audit reports to the Bank, albeit with some delays. The PMU played an instrumental role
in guiding and following-up with the respective field divisions in resolving the issues
related to financial management, disbursement and internal and external audit. The one
area that needed better coordination between the finance and technical units in the PMU
was contract management, especially relating to contract variations. In addition the
decision by the Bank’s controller’s department to discontinue, mid way during project
implementation, the monitoring of disbursements against prior review contracts,
combined with project disbursements based on Statement of Expenditures (SoE), put
increased pressure on the team to monitor that variations beyond 15% have been
approved by the Bank at the time of reimbursement of claims. The implementation of a
standard IT based accounting system under the bank’s Loan Accounting Change
Initiative (LACI) which was mandatory for all bank projects prepared around 2003 was
unsuccessful since it remained a system parallel to the mainstream government
accounting system; however the project was largely timely in submission of quarterly
FMRs, based on a system developed in excel with aggregate expenditures reconciled to
the reports from the mainstream accounting system.

2.6.    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     TNRSP is currently focusing its efforts on completion of the residual civil works
such as two bypasses and one bridge and also on mainstreaming various IT-based
systems developed under the aegis of the project to improve the operational efficiency of
the Highways Department. Spurred by the successful implementation of the project, the
state government is now working on preparation of a larger project and intends to
propose it for funding from multilateral institutions. Going forward, HD could focus on
enterprise-wide mainstreaming of the following achievements under the project, viz., (a)
capacity acquired to better manage capex and maintenance projects (through
mainstreaming and up-scaling); (b) successful practices/approaches for better
management of social and environmental aspects; (c) road safety and enhanced use of IT
to improve operational efficiency with regard to planning, road asset management and
project financial & management; and (d) adoption of innovative contracts such as long-
term performance-based maintenance contracts and PPPs.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.    Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation (Rated: High)

42.     Relevance of Objectives: The project development objective of improving the
quality and sustainability of the state’s core road network continues to be relevant as this
network forms the crucial intermediate link bridging the primary network of national


10
   The audit report and the project financial statements for the expenditures incurred by the project under
the Original Loan and Additional Financing for the extended period of 16 months i.e. for the financial year
2011-12 including the grace period of 4 months have to be submitted to the Bank by January 31, 2013.


                                                    13
highways and the tertiary network of rural roads in the state. The challenges negotiated
with regard to civil works – that is, capacity expansion, maintenance and black-spot
improvement – continue to plague the rest of the state highway network. In a similar vein,
the institutional strengthening components aimed at improving operational efficiencies of
HD (through various IT-based interventions), road safety and increasing the role of
private participation have the potential to substantially improve the road services in the
state.

43.     The project was structured in line with one of the key objectives of the Country
Strategy at the time of approval, i.e., providing high quality infrastructure to promote
private sector led growth, which, in turn, was justified on the grounds that adequate
infrastructure and more effective governance could strengthen the enabling environment
for investment and sustainable growth, and thereby contribute to poverty reduction in the
state. From the sector’s perspective, the focus on improving the physical condition and
capacity of the state highway network through improving the effectiveness of the public
sector road agency is particularly relevant as it holds the potential for replication in many
other states facing similar problems.

44.      Relevance of Design: The project design had a balanced mix of civil works and
institutional strengthening components, which were closely aligned respectively with the
strategic options study and the government’s reform priorities. The project was structured
around three components targeting four fairly well-defined sub-objectives, which
together seem to have the sufficient weight/potential to achieve the overall PDO. The
project’s results framework is found to be logically consistent as the selected set of
sector-level indicators provided a fair metric for measuring the achievement of the overall
PDO. To measure each of these sub-objectives, too, the framework included appropriate
output indicators, except in case of some of the activities aimed at institutional change.

3.2.      Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Rating: Satisfactory)

3.2.1     Overall Outcomes (Satisfactory)

45.     The project achieved its objective of improving the quality and sustainability of
the state’s core road network, through improving the quality of riding as well as travel
time over nearly 2,200 km, which accounted for 21% of the state highways (and about
one-tenth of the network comprising state highways and major district roads). Through a
combination of upgradation, maintenance and/or black-spot improvement works over
these roads the project delivered better connectivity and improved access to targeted
beneficiaries. The project also laid a good foundation for sustaining these outcomes
through: (a) encouraging the government to increase the allocations for the road sector,
especially for maintenance; and (b) seeding organizational changes and information
systems for improving the functioning of the Highways Department. The project has
achieved – and in most cases, exceeded – the targets with regard to all the six
sector/project-level outcome/impact indicators as detailed below.

      In terms of overall user satisfaction at the End of Project, the TNRSP roads were
       rated at 4 (on a 5-point scale) whereas the National Highways and State Highways


                                             14
    were rated, respectively, at 4.1 and 3.8. These ratings indicate a significant
    improvement from the baseline surveys where the user satisfaction with both State
    Highways and National Highways was rated at 3 (on a 5-point scale);
   The percentage of core road network in poor condition reduced from about 35% at
    appraisal to 8% (as against the target of 10%) at the end of the project;
   The travel time on two selected corridors, namely, Nagapattinam-Tuticorin and
    Arcot-Nagapattinam, reduced, on an average, by about 40% (as against the target of
    20%);
   Number of fatalities from road accidents per 10,000 registered vehicles reduced from
    19 to 10.27 (as against the target of 14%);
   Actual expenditure for maintenance of total road network, as a percentage of 11th
    Finance Commission norms, increased from 63% in FY 2001-02 to 100% (as against
    the target of 80%) in FY 2004-05. From 2006-07, the government expenditure on
    maintenance from its own funds has been consistently above the normative levels (i.e.
    100% or more); and, in years where it received grant-in-aid from the central
    government, the expenditure was about 50-70% above the norms;
   Institutional Development Action Plan was implemented largely along the lines
    envisaged at the time of appraisal, albeit with varying degrees of delays in completing
    some elements such as, for example, the PFMS;

46.    Ex-post EIRRs for the four major upgradation packages were found to be in the
range of 32-58%, vis-à-vis the estimates at the time of appraisal (EIRR for Upgrading –
30%; Maintenance – 43.5%; Total > 30%).

Sub-Objective/Output 1: Capacity and quality enhancement of about 750 km of state
roads in the core network with proper management of environment and social impacts
(Satisfactory)

47.     As part of the Road Upgrading component, 724 km of roads (including 14
bypasses) were widened and strengthened to specified standards, with due attention to
environment and social impacts. In addition to reduction of travel time, all the upgraded
roads were also assessed for road safety and HD is planning to undertake remedial
measures suggested by the consultant. The quality of the project roads was substantially
superior to the non-TNRSP roads of similar vintage in the project vicinity; the
International Roughness Index (IRI) was 2.88 as compared to 5.28 on a selected sample
of 240 km of non-TNRSP roads. Keeping in view the quality of outputs with respect to
adherence to technical, environmental and social standards/guidelines during construction,
riding comfort, safety interventions, and reduction in travel time, the achievement with
respect to this component is rated as “satisfactory?.

Sub-objective 2: Major maintenance of about 2,000 km and accident black-spot
improvements at a number of critical locations (Moderately Satisfactory)

48.     Of the two activities under this component, road maintenance fell short of target
but black-spot improvement far exceeded the target levels. In case of black-spots, as
against the target of improving 75 black-spots, the Highways Department improved 282
black-spots and the work on improving 25 more black-spots is in progress. As regards


                                            15
maintenance, 1,030 km were covered under traditional, annual maintenance contracts and
an additional 300 km were under multi-year performance based contracts, and all of them
were in conformity with the prescribed quality and environmental standards. In terms of
seeding innovative approaches, although the project supported only one multi-year
performance-based contract, the government has been convinced of the merits of this
approach and is planning to expand it throughout the state; even the maintenance of the
724 km of upgraded roads developed under the project is slated to be done through two
performance-based maintenance contracts.

49.     In physical terms, the project’s achievement of maintenance of 1,330 km implied
a shortfall of 33% (as against the target of 2,000 km). This shortfall is mainly due to
increase in the actual costs of O&M vis-à-vis the estimate. Also, with the general increase
in the outlay for maintenance, many of the targeted roads were reportedly covered
through contracts with the government’s own funds. Accordingly, the physical shortfall is
considered as a moderate shortcoming and performance for this component has been
rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

Sub-objective 3: Improvements to the management of the state road network through
institutional strengthening and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) (Satisfactory)

50.     This component comprised several sub-activities ranging from restructuring and
enhanced use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) aimed at
improving the functioning of the Highways Department to interventions related to road
safety and increasing the role of private participation. All the sub-activities, except the
PFMS, have been completed well and within the project timeframe.

51.     As part of restructuring, a post of Director General was created to achieve better
coordination among different functions and new divisions/departments were established
to enhance focus on critical areas such Planning, Quality Assurance and IT. The staffing
norms across work units were rationalized in line with the functions/workload. In
addition, various systems and procedures were streamlined and ISO Certification was
done for five selected offices, that is, 2 Circles and 3 Divisions. The government is
proceeding with the process of achieving similar certification for the remaining Circles
and Division with their own funds and the same is expected to be achieved in the next
two years. As part of staffing rationalization, over an eight-year period, the staff strength
was reduced from 7,884 to 6,935. The establishment costs as a percentage of total
expenditure have been reduced from 9% in 2001 to 5% in 2011-12 (as against the target
of 5%).

52.     The project goal of enhancing the use of ICT, too, was accomplished through: (a)
strengthening the IT infrastructure11; (b)imparting of basic IT training to staff at different
levels; and (c) introducing specialized software/systems for: (i) Road Accident Database




11
   This was done through installation of software and hardware (1,717 desktops, 10 servers, 9 laptops, 620
printers, 30 scanners and 450 webcams) across various offices and levels of HD.


                                                   16
Management (RADMS); (ii) Road Asset Management System (RMS)12; and (iii) Project
Financial and Management System (PFMS). The specialized software is being further
integrated through a Geographical Information System (GIS).

53.     Road Safety. Over the project period, there has been a notable reduction in the
overall number of fatalities in road accidents as a percentage of number of registered
vehicles in the state. The key interventions supported by the project to improve road
safety included: (a) approval and dissemination of the Road Safety Policy; (b) Road
Safety Audit & Assessment Training to HQ and field based staff of HD and also police
officers; (c) road safety awareness programs for about 1,200 three and four-wheeler
drivers in ten districts and also for about 400 school children; and (d) development and
operationalization of the RADMS. RADMS is currently being used by the Police, Traffic
and Highways Departments and is also widely recognized by several state and central
road agencies and external experts, as a best practice example that is worthy of emulation.

54.     PPP Facilitation. As part of an attempt to encourage GoTN to harness the PPP
approach for delivering improved services to road users, the project supported assessment
of nine roads for their amenability to development as PPP projects and, thereafter,
preparation of techno-economic feasibility reports for roads that were found to be
amenable. A notable achievement of this technical assistance was the award of the Phase
I of the Chennai Outer Ring Road Project on a PPP basis, with an innovative structuring
wherein the traditional annuity-model was modified with about 35% of the project cost
payable by the government during the construction phase, thereby making the project
more attractive for the potential private players. It is also noteworthy that this was a fairly
large project with an estimated cost of about Rs. 8.6 billion (USD 170 million) and was
awarded during a period when the project finance market was going through a great deal
of uncertainty in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

55.     Ideally, the ICR team would have preferred to complement the aforementioned
analysis of outputs of the institutional and policy development component with an
assessment of their impact in terms of quantitative improvements in operational
efficiency of the HD. In the absence of such measures in the monitoring framework and
also because most of the activities were completed in the later stages of project
implementation, a qualitative assessment was attempted through the questionnaire survey
and interactions with the officers of the Highways Department. The survey and
interactions have pointed out to quite a few positive changes in the functioning of the
Highways Department, which are summarized in Section 3.3.2 on Institutional
Strengthening/Change. Keeping in view the quality of outputs under various activities
aimed at institutional strengthening as well as the positive directional changes in the
functioning of the HD, the performance under this objective is rated as “Satisfactory.?




12
   With the fully functional road asset management including adequate equipment for data collection, the
Department now has enough capacity to collect and update road condition data for the entire road network
(including Other District Roads) in the state, every year.


                                                  17
Sub-objective 4: Enhanced funding and improved allocation procedures for the road
sector (Satisfactory)

56.     The overall outlay and expenditures for the state road sector have significantly
increased over the years. During the Ninth Plan Period (1997-98 to 2001-02), the
government on an average spent Rs. 6.5 billion (USD 135 million) per annum on the
sector13. As against this, in the year 2011-12, the government spent nearly Rs. 39 billion
(USD 780 million) 14 . Within this overall increase, maintenance has been receiving
allocations that have progressively moved up to match 100% or more of the normative
levels. With the adoption of IT-based Road Asset Management system developed under
the project, the allocation of these expenditures is expected to be made on a more rational
and consistent basis taking into account the road conditions.

57.     In summary, barring a shortfall in meeting the physical targets under the
maintenance component, the project has successfully delivered on all activities under
various sub-components/objectives and met targets on all key outcome indicators.
Accordingly, the project has been rated “Satisfactory? with regard to achievement of
overall outcomes and major outputs.

3.2.2 Efficiency

58.      Economic Analysis: The end-of-project EIRRs of the four discrete sections of
major upgradation roads under TNRSP (with a total length of 712 km) are in the range of
32% to 58%, which indicates that the project is economically viable even with increased
construction cost. In all the road stretches, the NPV discounted at 12% is positive
confirming the economic justification of the project. All the road stretches have almost
same or much higher EIRRs than at appraisal, which was 30.2%. Even in the sensitivity
analysis, considering a 20% reduction of yearly benefits for the analysis period, the
EIRRs obtained for road stretches are in the range of 29% to 53%. For a more detailed
description of the Economic Analysis, including the methodology, assumptions and
results, please refer to Annex 3.

59.      Other Indicators of Efficiency: In terms of calendar years, the project took three
more years than the original schedule of six years. The time overruns in major civil works
(that is, road upgradation contracts), too, seem quite large ranging from one to three years.
Interestingly, these overruns do not necessarily imply inefficient implementation because
a substantive portion of disbursements had been made (with corresponding physical
progress in civil works) by Q4 of year 201015. For example, the financial progress data on
the four major upgradation projects – which constitute a bulk of the total project cost –
indicates that these projects together achieved a progress of 92% and 98%, respectively

15
   Here, it is noteworthy that the calendar dates indicated for completion of works are linked to issuance of
“taking over? certificates, which are usually prone to administrative delays and hence, to that extent, the
reported time overruns may be prone to overstatement.


                                                    18
by the end of March 2010 and March 2011 (based on Table A3-7 in Annex 3 on Project
Economic and Financial Analysis). In terms of construction phasing too, by the end of
March 2011, work on all the project packages was nearly complete (based on Table A3-9
in Annex 3 on Project Economic and Financial Analysis)16.

60.    In terms of cost variations, three upgradation packages had cost overruns of 40%,
51% and 77% respectively. However, it is noteworthy that these packages together
covering about 330 km constitute less than half of the major upgradation component.
Also, all these variations were not necessarily on account of inefficiency in
implementation; they were partly attributable to design revisions necessitated on account
of substantial deterioration in road conditions (due to prolonged time lapse from design
preparation and also partly on account of the Tsunami in December 2004) and the
subsequent steep escalation in prices of high value items such as bitumen and steel.

61.     In view of the above, the project’s efficacy in achieving the PDOs and in
implementing the works and institutional development and policy components is rated as
“Satisfactory?.

3.2.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

62.    In summary, the project has been rated “high? with regard to its relevance, design
and implementation. The project’s performance regarding PDOs and implementation of
various sub-components has been satisfactory barring a minor shortcoming (shortfall) in
achieving physical targets for maintenance. The efficacy with which these
accomplishments were achieved has also been “Satisfactory?. Keeping all these in view,
on balance, the overall outcome of the project is rated as “Satisfactory.?

3.3.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.3.1    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63.    As envisaged, the project delivered on the promises of better connectivity and
improved access to main beneficiaries, by significantly improving the quality of riding
surface as well as reducing travel time over nearly 2,200 km of the state’s core road
network. In particular, the nearly 700 km long corridor developed through the
upgradation component, running mostly parallel to the east coast and connecting several
places of cultural and religious importance, is expected to give significant boost to
tourism, which was identified as one of the four potential areas to make Tamil Nadu a
“leading state?17. The improved infrastructure created through the project thus is expected


16
   Construction of TNRSP packages 03 and 04 was 100% complete by March 2011 and that for packages
01 and 02 was 97% complete.
17
   In 2002, a study conducted by the Centre for International Development of the Harvard University’s
Kennedy School of Government, for the Government of Tamil Nadu, identified health, education, tourism
and biotechnology as four critical areas of importance to make it a “leading state?.




                                                 19
to have a positive impact on poverty alleviation through the value chain of higher and
more efficient economic activity including in tourism and the consequent increase in
livelihoods and employment opportunities.

64.     Social Development: As indicated earlier, despite the large magnitude of land
acquisition and displacement, the project closed with a satisfactory rating on social
safeguards. Nearly 94% of the 623 titleholder displaced families had chosen self-
relocation with the support of house building grants. In addition, 133 families were
assisted in re-establishing their livelihoods through purchase of income generation assets.
Two resettlement impact evaluation studies conducted by the Highways Department, in
consultation with the Bank, confirmed that the project had not caused any significant
adverse impacts on the livelihoods, and the PAPs had improved their living standards.

65.    The environmental measures benefited the communities. TNRSP documented the
achievements in the form of systematic case studies and photo documentation as well as
compiling villagers’ perception of benefits to the communities. This documentation,
along with the integrated perspective with which the project sought to address
environmental management, is an interesting value-add that could be put to good use
while designing similar road projects in future, by GoTN as well as the Bank.

3.3.2   Institutional Change/Strengthening

66.      The project has completed all the planned activities aimed at improving the
functioning and operational efficiency of the Highways Department. Of these, road safety
audit and assessment and the RADMS have already been mainstreamed. The quantitative
impact of the remaining activities, however, could not be ascertained in the absence of a
baseline and a comprehensive assessment of the Department’s functioning and efficiency
across various levels. However, a qualitative assessment based on a questionnaire survey
and interactions with various officers of the Highways Department indicated several
notable positive directional changes especially in the areas of procurement and contract
management, viz., (i) the department’s upgradation and widening projects are
progressively moving away from small, 10-20 km/year interventions to larger-size
contracts and corridor-based approach; (ii) planning of works within the network are
being prioritized based mostly on conditions of the roads; (iii) strong intent to increase
the use of multi-year performance based contracts for maintenance; (iv) inclusion of
escalation clauses in contracts; (v) increased use of external experts to bridge the
skill/resource gaps within the HD, especially in the areas of engineering design, traffic
studies, and preparation of detailed technical and/or feasibility reports; and (vi)
widespread use of computers/IT systems in day-to-day working (Refer Annex 5 on
Beneficiary Survey Results).

67.    The project also made good progress in implementation of the Governance and
Accountability Action Plan (GAAP), which was introduced only at the time of additional
financing, especially with regard to: (a) dissemination of project related information
including contract awards, status reports, expected dates of completion and complaint
handling systems, through its website in both English and Tamil (local language); (b)
appointment of officers to monitor compliance with social and environmental safeguards;


                                            20
and (c) developing database to ascertain/track contractor capacity/performance during the
procurement and implementation phases.

3.3.3   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.     There were no noticeable negative impacts and on the positive side, at least three
practices from the project – namely, private negotiations for land acquisition, road
accident database management system, road safety audit & black-spot improvements –
have received wide recognition as good practice examples worthy of emulation by other
road development agencies.

3.4     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Surveys

69.     Key findings of the Road User Satisfaction Survey and a questionnaire-based dip-
stick survey among various officers of the GoTN, HD and TNRSP, both carried out at the
end of project, are placed in Annex 6 and Annex 6(a), respectively.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

70.     Roads improved through upgradation and maintenance contracts under the project
are likely to be sustained in the immediate future as the government has been making
adequate allocations for maintenance of the entire road network. In case of institutional
strengthening activities, too, some positive directional changes in the functioning of HD
especially in the areas of procurement and contract management (detailed above) suggest
that the project’s outputs and achievements will be progressively mainstreamed. For
instance, the department is currently focusing its efforts on mainstreaming the GIS and
PFMS into its working and the GoTN is attaching high priority to such integration. The
recent launch of all these systems by the Hon’ble Chief Minister – under an umbrella
program, entitled e-Pathai (Electronic Project, Administration, Traffic, Highway Assets
and Information Management System) – indicates that the government fully appreciates
the need – and is committed – to implement these systems in an integrated fashion.

71.     To sum up, the early indications are that the government is keen to take advantage
of and build on the aforementioned positive developments/outputs from the project.
Realizing this intent, however, requires a substantive change in mindset and functioning
across several layers of HD and the government. Also, the government should pay
particular attention to preserving the capacities acquired by the PMU for preparing and
implementing large and complex construction and maintenance projects and harnessing
them to achieve similar efficiencies in spending the rapidly increasing allocations to the
road sector. Keeping the aforementioned indications and uncertainties in view, the risk to
development outcome has been rated as “Moderate.?

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance: Satisfactory




                                           21
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Moderately Satisfactory

72.     The Bank’s performance during the preparatory period was satisfactory with
regard to strategic relevance and approach, technical, financial and economic analysis,
and paying adequate attention to fiduciary and safeguards and monitoring & evaluation
arrangements. The team’s interaction and inputs at this phase have played a significant
role in arriving at a project design that was focused on key challenges at that time and
choice of components/actions that directly addressed these challenges within the project’s
budget and time limitations. During this phase, the Bank’s decision to “pause?
preparation had resulted in a nearly 2-year delay but it seems to have finally worked in
favour of the project as it led to not only infusion of effective leadership at entry but also
the Highways Department stepping up its involvement and thereby building up
competencies in project preparation.

73.     On the other hand, as the preparation resumed after a two-year gap and
withdrawal of the project preparation consultants, in some of the upgradation contracts,
the road and sub-soil conditions at the time of implementation were such that the designs
had to be modified from mere strengthening to reconstruction. Since this is the first
project of this size and complexity with multilateral partnership for the client government,
as a more ‘knowledgeable’ partner in development, the Bank could have alerted the
government to this shortfall and encouraged them to review and update the designs. The
absence of such review had resulted in subsequent time and cost overruns in – and to that
extent had exerted downward pressure on achievement of the outcome of – a major
project component, namely, road upgradation. Considering this as moderate shortcoming,
the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?.

(b)    Quality of Supervision. Satisfactory

74.     The Bank had been fully engaged with the client during the implementation of all
planned activities, paying due attention to the client’s priorities and preferences as well as
the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards requirements. Adequate numbers of staff with
requisite skills and expertise in technical and safeguards’ functions were engaged in
supporting implementation including through missions at regular intervals. The mission
management letters and aide-memoires suggest comprehensive attention to all major
components, duly highlighting the achievements as well as areas of concern, along with
suggestions for addressing the proximate challenges. It is particularly noteworthy that the
supervision has been fairly alert and responsive to unforeseen developments such as the
need for addressing road sections damaged on account of Tsunami in December 2004,
and also to relatively more common “housekeeping? needs such as extending the closing
date and additional financing. Major problem areas such as, for example, delays in land
acquisition and in according approvals to design changes were identified early on and
persistently followed up through to their satisfactory resolution. The key issues in
implementation were also regularly brought to the attention of the sector and country
management through the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and the guidance
received was promptly acted upon. The ISR ratings assigned to the quality of
implementation provide a fairly accurate reflection of the project’s performance in the


                                             22
corresponding periods, e.g., rating downgrades in 2005 and 2006. Finally, the level and
quality of the Bank team’s support during the implementation was uniformly appreciated
by the PMU, contractors and consultants. In view of this, the Bank’s performance during
the implementation was rated as “Satisfactory.?

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance.

75.     Normally, a combination of “Moderately Satisfactory? and “Satisfactory? rating
of performances, respectively, in ensuring quality at entry and during implementation,
would have lent itself to an overall performance rating of “Moderately Satisfactory?. Yet,
here it is important to recognize that, despite the moderate shortcoming of delays during
the entry period, the project has finally achieved an overall “Satisfactory? outcome.
Keeping in view this final positive outcome and the Bank’s notable contributions during
the implementation in achieving the same, the Bank’s overall performance has been rated
as “Satisfactory?.

5.2.   Borrower Performance: Satisfactory

(a)    Government Performance. Satisfactory

76.     Through the project preparation and implementation, the project received
requisite level of support from the Government of India (GoI). GoTN, too, extended full
support to the project through most of the preparation and implementation phases,
especially in lining up reasonable level of skilled resources and fully endorsing the
broader institutional and policy agenda including bracing itself up to tough challenges
such as, for example, rationalization of manpower, devolution of more powers and
autonomy to the Highways Department and increasing budgetary allocations to the sector.
A notable exception is the lack of effective leadership at the PMU during two periods of
two-years each, respectively during the middle-phase of preparation and around two
years into implementation. The government eventually addressed the above limitations
by assigning the implementation leadership to senior civil servants from the Indian
Administrative Service, thereby adding a greater degree of autonomy and empowerment
to TNRSP; these senior civil servants were able to muster better cooperation/compliance
from other government agencies involved in key functions such as land acquisition, R&R
and utility shifting. Also, as the Government has highlighted in their comments on ICRR,
this was the first externally aided project in the road sector in the state, with a relatively
huge outlay, larger size of contracts and new procedures, all of which have contributed to
a rather steep learning curve in the preparation and initial phases of implementation.
Keeping this in view, the periods with paucity of effective leadership are considered as a
minor shortcoming and, accordingly, the Government’s performance is rated as
“Satisfactory.?

(b)    Implementing Agencies Performance. Satisfactory

77.    The project was implemented by a dedicated PMU (also referred to as TNRSP)
under the aegis of the Highways Department. The waxing and waning of the project
progress in tandem with the presence of effective leadership at the helm suggests that the


                                             23
next level leadership at the PMU is inadequately empowered. Also, anecdotal accounts
suggested that the Highways Department’s involvement in the project has been rather
tepid especially during the preparation and early stages of implementation. Despite these
limitations, the PMU, on the whole, had been fairly effective in expediting preparation
and implementation of all activities.

78.    Here, it is important to note that this is a first World Bank supported road sector
project in the state and it comprised relatively large-size civil works with “new?
norms/processes for managing social and environmental aspects, new IT-based systems
and novel contracting approaches such as use of supervision consultants, performance-
based maintenance contracts and PPPs. Consequently, the PMU staff responsible for
these activities often had to go through a rather steep learning curve and, to their credit,
they mostly rose to the occasion and enthusiastically built up their capacities and
acquired new skills. Interestingly, some of the PMU officers equipped with this
experience were subsequently hand-picked to undertake similar tasks with equal or more
complexity in the Chennai Metro Rail project and have performed well there as well.

79.    Most importantly, the implementing agency fully bounced back from earlier
setbacks and completed the major civil works components substantially in time and also
delivered on the maintenance, safety and institutional development and policy
components, with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Keeping these achievements in view,
the implementing agency’s performance is rated as “Satisfactory.?

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance.

80.    Considering that the performance of both the Government (of Tamil Nadu) and
the implementing agency has been “Satisfactory?, overall performance of the borrower
has been rated as “Satisfactory.?

6.     Lessons Learned

81.    Some of the notable lessons from the project are summarized below.

82.      Staffing and Leadership: A dedicated project unit with an empowered leadership
supported by an appropriate skill mix can be very useful in managing large projects
spread over several years and seeking to introduce new approaches on multiple fronts.
Yet, it is important to recognize that the units that are put together just for the sake of the
project tend to lack full empowerment and leadership from within and often rely on the
strength of individuals assigned to lead them. Hence, the Government, implementing
agency and the Bank should pay more attention to enhancing the leadership and
empowerment of dedicated units at multiple levels.

83.     Replication of Best Practices and Preservation of Capacities: A salient aspect of
the TNRSP is that it has clearly demonstrated that the GoTN and Highway Department
have the inherent potential to successfully prepare and implement large-scale civil works
that deliver roads with better riding quality and reduced travel time. It is important to
recognize that this was made possible mainly through adoption of various best practices
(such as, for example, channeling funds to large-sized projects based on their economic


                                              24
potential and adopting more efficient contracting approaches like performance-based
maintenance and PPP contracts) and gradual enhancement of the skill sets of their own
staff. Accordingly, going forward, the government could consider progressively shifting
its own allocations to the road sector – which are substantive and increasing – in a
manner that replicates these best practices and harnesses the skills built up within their
cadres.

84.     Management of Interdependencies: Large “linear? construction works such as
upgradation of roads require cooperation of several stakeholders for expediting critical
activities such as, for example, statutory clearances, land acquisition (project affected
persons and revenue department), utility shifting (agencies responsible for electricity,
telecom and/or water networks), construction (contractors) and supervision (independent
consulting engineers). The experience from the most effective periods of progress in
TNRSP underscores that cooperation from these stakeholders is likely to be most
effective when they are engaged: (a) as early as possible in the activities in which they
have an important stake and better knowledge & control; and (b) in a manner that
encourages frank exchange of perspectives and is equitable in sharing risks,
responsibilities. In case of utility shifting, the government could consider according an
ex-ante, omnibus approval for the authority to take a lead role as it seemed to have done –
with successful results – in case of Chennai Metro.

85.      Robust planning and preparation: The organizational structure and culture of
most of the works departments seem to willy-nilly attach relatively less priority to
planning and preparation activities such as design, including land acquisition, R&R and
utility shifting. Inadequate attention to these activities, as highlighted in TNRSP, is likely
to have negative ripple effects. Hence, utmost priority should be given to complete
planning and preparatory activities within a reasonably tight schedule. Also, if there is a
significant time lapse from preparation to implementation, care should be taken to
suitably update the designs and to ensure reasonable level of maintenance in the interim
to avoid acute deterioration of road structure.

86.     Contract Management – Civil Works: Well-written contracts are a necessary but
not sufficient condition for achieving good results. In order to deliver the intended
outputs, contracts need to be effectively administered by the implementing agency.
Specifically, the agency should be prompt in responding to developments such as design
changes (by taking decisions and according approvals without undue delay) and lax
performance by contractors (by promptly enforcing various remedial provisions available
in contracts including liquidated damages where necessary).

87.     Consultants – Civil Works: The responses from the TNRSP and HD officers
during the dip-stick surveys and from some of the contractors during one-to-one
interviews suggest an apparently widespread feeling that the consultants associated with
civil works components – for DPR preparation and for supervision – should be made
more accountable for their outputs, say, through imposition of rather strict
penalties/damages in case of lack of progress. While it may not be fair to make the
consultants liable for items such as lack of progress and faulty construction, which are



                                             25
beyond their control, it may be useful to require them to provide “enforceable?
guarantees for diligent and timely performance of their duties.

88.     Re-thinking indicators relating to achievement of institutional development: In
a project with a strong institutional development agenda, the teams may consider
choosing more granular targets/indicators to measure achievements and impacts. Such
targets, ideally, should relate not only to mere completion of all sub-
activities/components but also to the actual improvements achieved in project
implementation and other operational efficiencies (e.g., reduction in time and cost
overruns; reduction in per km costs of construction and maintenance, etc.).

89.     Land acquisition through private negotiations, coupled with innovative
approaches to valuation, appears to offer significant promise to expedite land acquisition
in a timely and amicable manner18. This lesson was already highlighted in a World Bank
dissemination note19 building upon the experience from four State Highway projects (in
the states of Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat) and a hydroelectric power
project (Himachal Pradesh).

90.     Environmental Safeguards – Early Planning, Integrating with Contracts, Right
Sequencing and Inclusive Approach: The implementation of environmental measures
during the construction stage is likely to be more effective if they are identified early on
and integrated as part of the construction contracts, with provisions for related BoQ and
incidental items and penalties to address non-compliance. Similarly, early initiation of
landscaping and tree plantation activities (starting with raising nurseries) as part of
project implementation could lead to good results, instead of differing the implementation
of plantation. Also, an inclusive approach in consultation with local communities could
help harness opportunities to create valuable community assets and also generate positive
response and good will, which could be leveraged for important aspects such as traffic
management and road safety awareness where citizens can play a very important role. A
key learning through the TNRSP project has been to make communities and road users
part of the road landscape through cultural integration which adds the sustainability
dimension to the overall project development objectives.

1.0    Summary of Results and Conclusions from the Economic Analysis at the End
       of Project

1.      Economic evaluation was carried out for all the TNRSP upgraded roads totalling
712 km length, excluding two bypasses. In the analysis, the ?with project? improvement
alternative was compared with the ?without project? alternative of minimum
maintenance of the existing road: “Do Minimum? i.e., (a) Base case (without
improvements and with annual “Do Minimum? maintenance), and (b) Improvement
Alternative (with improvement/rehabilitation and annual “Routine Maintenance?
supplemented by a Periodical Maintenance at five year intervals). The results of the
economic analysis conducted considering: (i) final completion costs, (ii) implementation
period and (iii) achieved traffic on upgraded roads and sensitivity analysis considering
20% reduction in benefits are summarized in the following table:

2.      The end-of-project Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRRs) of the above road
stretches of TNRSP are in the range of 32% to 58% which indicates that the project is
economically viable. In all the road stretches, the Economic Net Present Value (ENPV)
discounted at 12% is positive confirming the economic justification of the project. All the
road stretches have almost same or much higher EIRR than at appraisal, which was
30.2%. Even in the sensitivity analysis, considering 20% reduction of yearly benefits for
the analysis period, the EIRRs obtained for road stretches are in range of 29% to 53%.

3.      The sections in TNRSP 02 have higher EIRRs than all other stretches due to
comparatively higher traffic volumes supported with higher traffic growth rates achieved
during the implementation period (2003-2012) and comparatively less increase in the
project cost.

4.      The first reason which explains the differences in the EIRR is the relative increase
in construction costs compared to the higher increase in VOCs and savings. The second
reason is that the roads deteriorated between the time the initial economic analysis was
carried out (2003) and the time the works were completed and roads were improved


                                             32
(2012). The third reason is the higher traffic growth pattern the project road sections
achieved during the project implementation period (2003-2012). This resulted in higher
savings on VOCs than estimated at appraisal, further confirming that the
upgrading/improvement of the roads was justified.

5.      Conclusions: The above results show the robustness of the economic feasibility
indicators under normal and adverse sensitivity scenarios including significant decrease
in benefits, significant increase in costs or the worst scenario of both occurring
simultaneously. The end-of-project EIRR for all the above packages justifies the project
investment with more risk absorption capacity. However, this sensitivity is unlikely to
happen as: (a) traffic is expected to grow to accompany the current economic growth, (b)
there is no uncertainty on the cost of the works as all the contracts are completed, and (c)
VOCs are unlikely to be reduced in view of the past trend for the price of inputs such as
fuel, lubricants, tires, and salaries. Also, the estimated economic feasibility results are on
the conservative side as the qualitative project benefits like tourism development,
increased road safety, better highway environment are not considered in this analysis.

2.0    Summary of Previous Rounds of Economic Analysis

6.      At the time of appraisal of the project, economic analysis was carried out for 743
km of upgrading roads. The existing carriageway configuration of all roads was single-
lane/intermediate-lane. Very few sections had two-lane configuration. Under TNRSP, all
these project roads were proposed for upgrade to two-lane configurations. The economic
viability of project road sections due to upgradation was obtained considering reduction
in vehicle operation cost and saving in travel time cost of passengers with respect to “Do
Minimum? project road sections. The overall EIRR for these roads was 30.2% with an
NPV, discounted at 12%, of Rs. 26,233 million.

7.      Subsequently during the additional financing process in 2009-10, the economic
analysis was again carried out in which four homogenous/typical stretches in TNRSP 01
and two stretches each in all the other roads have been considered. Ten sections totalling
279 km of the completed upgradation works, which works out to 40% coverage, were
considered for economic analysis. The EIRR for all the sections was more than 12%.
Some of the sections had higher EIRR than at appraisal. Table A3-2 presents the results
of the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis considers a 20 percent decrease in
benefits.

3.0     Approach and Methodology for the Economic Analysis for ICRR

8.     The economic analysis carried out in 2003, at the project appraisal stage is
updated for the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) with actual data
as on completion of works. For this, complete TNRSP project roads totalling 712 km
road length, are considered, and analysed using the Highway Development and
Management Model (HDM-4).

9.     The details of TNRSP Roads and their improvement proposals are presented in
Table A3-3. In total, all TNRSP roads totalling 712 km length, excluding two bypasses,
have been considered for analysis.

10.    Economic analysis is carried out for the upgrade roads because there were cost
overruns in these works. The following Tables A3-4 to A3-8 present the variation in costs
in the contracts for upgrading roads at different stages from processing (2003) to
additional finance (2009-10) and further to project completion (2012).

    11.     Approach: The economic evaluation has been carried out within the broad
    framework of social cost-benefit analysis assuming the analysis period of 25 years
    including the achieved construction period. There will be reduction in road user costs of
    motorized traffic (MT) upon the improvement of the existing road. The economic savings
    at significant levels in Vehicle Operating Costs (VOCs) and in journey time of passengers
    and goods are expected to occur due to improvement of the existing roads.

    12.     The economic analysis has been based on comparison of costs and benefits under
    two scenarios: ?without the upgradation project? and ?with upgradation road project?. All
    costs and benefits are valued in monetary terms and expressed in economic prices to
    obtain the analysis on resource based framework. The analysis is made package-wise and
    the results are expressed in terms of EIRR and ENPV.

    13.     Construction Program: The analysis period of the project has been taken as 25
    years including construction time. The completed construction program for TNRSP road
    network is Table A3-9, in which the actual construction period is only considered by
    leaving the spill over works in the beginning and end. For the purpose of analysis, it is
    assumed that traffic is opened in 2012 on completion of all construction activities for
    TNRSP 01 and TNRSP 02; 2010 for TNRSP 03 and 2011 for TNRSP 04.

14.   Procedure for Estimation of Benefits: The following procedure has been
employed to estimate the aforesaid benefits:

          Estimation of present traffic volume on the completed road sections/packages
           from field surveys
          Estimation of traffic growth rate – adopted from the ‘initial base analysis of
           2003’
          The time values are used in the VOC estimation
          Usual maintenance provisions and costs in ‘with’ and ‘without’ conditions
           have been considered
          The model used for analysis is HDM-4
          EIRRs of the sections have been estimated with HDM but the EIRR of the
           packages and subsequently for the entire project has been obtained also taking
           together all the sections
          EIRR and NPV Estimation with the sum of benefits from (i) VOC savings;
           and (ii) Time savings

15.     Components of Cost: From the financial costs of completed packages of TNRSP,
the economic cost has been worked out by multiplying the financial cost by a factor of
0.9, and is presented in Table A3-10.

20.     The Residual Value: Considering the remaining life of the construction items the
Residual value (salvage value) has been assessed at the end of the analysis period. For
structures, the life is assumed to be 50 years. Values of the selected construction items
such as LA, structures, sub-base, social displacement cost etc. are included in the
economic analysis as residual values at the end of the analysis periods. These residual
values are considered as benefits to the project in the analysis. The value has been taken
as 10% for the present analysis.

21.     Volume of Traffic and Growth Rates: The AADT traffic on different road
sections during the period 2003 to 2012 is given below. For analysis, the AADT adopted
during the initial analysis (2003) is adopted. However, based on the AADT arrived from
the post completion surveys (2012), the actual growth rate achieved during the
implementation period (2003-2012) for different vehicle categories has been adopted for
the present analysis. Accordingly the AADT and the periodical growth rates adopted for
the analysis are presented in Tables A3-13 and A3-14.

23.     Project Benefits

24.     VOCs for traffic in each vehicle category on each selected road with and without
improvement. The model estimates VOC in both the with- and without-project situations
taking into account the speed and travel time including surface quality and road
congestion. The model comprehensively predicts the performance and operating costs of
motorized vehicles in the selected fleet. Motorized vehicle performance predictions
include speeds (free flow and congested conditions) and consumptions. Predictions for
vehicle operating costs include fuel, oil, tire and parts costs, crew and maintenance labour
costs, capital depreciation, borrowing costs, and overhead costs.

25.    Travel Time Saving: The model estimates the Value of Travel Time (VOTT) for
passengers and goods in transit in both the with- and without-project scenarios taking into
account speed and travel time including surface quality, road congestion etc.

26.     Accident Cost Savings: There can be some anticipated reduction of accidents due
to improved signing and engineering intervention; however, the benefits deriving from
this rehabilitation project are deemed to be moderate and consequently the accident-
related benefits have not been discounted in the analysis. As a result the actual economic
return in respect of increased Road Safety would be expected to be nominally higher than
the rates of return presented in this report.

                         Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


1.        Resettlement Impact Evaluation Surveys. Two impact evaluation studies were
carried out during the project implementation to assess the impact of R&R
implementation and make mid-stream alterations through remedial measures as
appropriate. The first one was carried out in 2009-10 and study findings indicated that the
proportion of families living below the poverty line has decreased by 10%, and that about
70% of the PAPs reported that they have more incomes now compared to the previous
situation. Most of the people who have received alternative houses have expressed their
happiness since these houses have facilities such as electricity connection, separate
kitchen and bathroom which were not available in their previous houses. However, they
also reported leakages in their houses, absence of adequate arrangements for timely repair
of hand pumps and non-availability of individual electricity connections in some of the
sites. The study also reported that the people have improved their asset ownership such as
possessing a refrigerator, two wheeler, phone connection and cooking gas. The study also
reported increase in savings but also that in indebtedness. The report also identified some
remedial measures such as assistance for getting electricity connection though
Government schemes, motivation of people for use of toilets provided to them,
construction of boundary walls, improvement of drainage provisions and issue of land
title in three sites, and these additional measures were largely implemented.

2.       The end term impact evaluation conducted in March, 2012 confirmed that 90
percent of PAPs who were provided alternative houses have expressed satisfaction with
the new houses which have facilities such as electricity connection, drinking water
facilities and individual toilets. The proportion of families living below the poverty line
has reduced from 28 to 24% and the average income increased by 29% from Rs. 4,424 in
2002 to Rs. 5,717 in 2012; as many as 87 reported that their incomes have increased
during the post impact period due to increases in wages in the project areas, availability
of jobs under National Rural Guarantee program, more business opportunities and
improvement in the local economy. However, two-thirds of the land owners have
expressed their dissatisfaction with the compensation paid to their land and other assets.
The study also indicated that the unskilled employment opportunities under the
contractors have benefited the local people. 68% of the unskilled man days generated by
all contracts (1.52 million man days) went to the local people. The study also confirmed
that the household asset ownership has improved, with 88% people owning phone/mobile
now compared to 18% at the pre-project level. The proportion of those using refrigerator
went up to 28% from 10% and those who use cooking gas increased to 63% from 24%
earlier. The grievance redress mechanism has helped people to address their grievances.
In all, 184 formal grievances were fielded and out of these 108 received favorable
decisions (59%). The grievances mostly relate to compensation, provision of alternative
sites, change in alignments, etc. Some of the successful outcomes of the grievance redress
mechanism include enhanced compensation for affected fish pond (revised almost twice)
and additional compensation in some cases for unmeasured structures in the original
survey. The issue of land title is another important outcome. In all about 450 non-title
holders received house titles to their allotted houses which had a significant empowering



                                            44
effect on the resettled PAPs and their ability to access the formal sector. These titles were
given in the joint name of wife and husband.

3.       Some of the feedback from the local people and PAPs is summarized below:

        Value of land has increased, travel time reduced and agriculture products were
         transported quickly to the markets and access to schools improved due to good
         quality of projects roads;
        Due to increased land prices along the project. some of the farmers could sell part
         of their land and repay their debts;
        As a result of good roads, children went to better schools to nearby towns/cities
         and thus the standard of education has gone up in the areas around the project
         roads.
        The non-title holders expressed that the biggest benefit that they received from the
         project is the title to their houses and improved basic amenities; and
        Compensation amount received is generally low and the alternative shops allotted
         to the affected shop owners were far away from the villages and were not
         considered suitable to run businesses successfully.

                 Annex 6. Findings from Road User Satisfaction Survey

  1.     At the End of Project (EOP), TNRSP engaged National Institute of Technical
Teachers’ Training & Research, Chennai, to conduct the third Road User Satisfaction
Survey (RUSS, 2012). The specific objectives of this round of RUSS were as follows: (i)
to elicit views on public perceptions of current sector outcomes, HD’s performance and
Government’s policies related to the road sector; (ii) to document the views in a
comprehensible format suitable for comparison over time; (iii) to compare findings of the
survey with RUSS 1 and RUSS 2; and (iv) to present the findings of the survey to the
senior decision makers in GoTN, stakeholders and the general public. The study
comprised both quantitative (structured interview) and qualitative (in-depth interview)
methods and was carried out during the months of June and July 201220.

2.     The key findings of the survey – drawn from the draft report of the consultants –
with respect to user satisfaction with roads included:

        Awareness and use of different types of roads: The awareness of most types of
         roads (NHs, SHs, MDRs and ODRs) remained the same in the second and third
         rounds of RUSS; however, the awareness of VRs declined steadily (from 98% to
         96% to 94%) over the three rounds. Usage of different roads remained largely
         same in rounds 2 and 3 except for a marginal decline in usage of VRs from round
         2 to 3;
        Overall satisfaction levels with TNRSP roads: On a 5-point scale (with “5? being
         “very satisfied? and “1? being “not at all satisfied?), the overall level of
         satisfaction of users was found to be “4? on TNRSP roads compared to “3.8? for
         SHs and “4.1? for NHs. Overall, 37% of users were satisfied with TNRSP roads
         and 27% were very satisfied;
        Reduction in travel time on TNRSP roads: 30% of users were very satisfied while
         38% were satisfied with reduction in travel time on TNRSP roads – thus 68% of
         road users were at least satisfied with the reduction in travel time on TNRSP
         roads. Only 4% of users were not at all satisfied;
        Safety aspects on TNRSP roads: About 20% and 30% of road users (i.e. about
         half) surveyed were very satisfied and satisfied respectively with safety aspects on
         TNRSP roads. 28% of users were only somewhat satisfied while 14% were not
         satisfied and 8% not at all satisfied. Safety aspects seem to be an issue on TNRSP
         roads given the likelihood of over speeding due to smooth roads;
        Road signs: 18% of users were very satisfied and 40% satisfied with the quality of
         road signage on TNRSP roads. About 18% of users were not satisfied and 6% not
         at all satisfied;
        Enabling lower congestion: As many as 36% of users were very satisfied with the
         impact of TNRSP roads on reducing the level of congestion on roads; another


20
   The quantitative method consisted of a large scale survey among the general population (sample=7,650)
and the qualitative method comprised in-depth interviews with road user and stakeholder groups to elicit
views and opinions on specific concerns related to road safety and policies (sample=350). The quantitative
survey covered the target groups – main users, vulnerable users and school students.


                                                    46
         30% were satisfied with this result – which meant that 66% of users were at least
         satisfied with the project roads’ impact on reducing congestion. About 10% and
         4% of users respectively were not satisfied with reduction in congestion levels;
        Riding quality: 32% of users were satisfied with the improvement in riding
         quality on TNRSP roads while as many as 44% were satisfied – totaling to as
         many as 76% of users who were at least satisfied with improvement in riding
         quality on TNRSP roads. Only a small proportion (6% of users) was either not
         satisfied or not at all satisfied with improvement in riding quality but this appears
         to be a minority.

3.    The key findings of the survey with respect to the functioning of the Highways
Department included:

        On a 5-point scale (with “5? being “very good? and “1? being “very bad?), nearly
         one-third of road users rated the performance of the HD21 as “good?;
        The overall performance of the Department has improved over the three rounds of
         the RUSS and fell between “satisfactory? and “good? in all three rounds;
        The mean score for environmental management increased compared to that for
         emergency management over round 2, which may be due to the impact of TNRSP
         roads which have been upgraded with due consideration to the environment also;
        The main priorities for the Department as rated by users included “remove
         encroachments? and “enforce road rules? perhaps indicating that these aspects
         should also be taken care of in other road projects of the department apart from
         TNRSP.


4.      Some of the general suggestions for road improvement from all three surveys
included the need for widening of roads, better road geometrics, improving the quality of
construction and maintenance, providing signs and markings, providing good drainage,
filling up potholes, and finally facilitating private participation in the road improvement
programs.




21
  Users were asked to rate the performance of the HD in terms of: (i) adding new capacities through road
widening and bypasses, (ii) maintenance of roads/bridges, (iii) dealing with public, (iv) removing
encroachments, (v) disaster/emergency management and (vi) environmental management.

    Annex 6A. Questionnaire-based Dip-stick Survey of Government Stakeholders

1.0       Introduction

1.      A questionnaire-based dip-stick survey to obtain feedback of officers across
various levels of GoTN, HD and TNRSP, on various components and sub-activities of
the project. Specifically, the feedback was sought on the performance of different types
of civil works contracts and all major institutional & policy development initiatives.
Components, and on the project’s overall design and implementation and lessons and
suggestions for the future. In all, 32 officers from the administration and engineering
functions responded to this questionnaire. (A copy of the questionnaire is appended at the
end of this Annex, as Attachment 1). The number of respondents constitutes just about of
2% of the total staff in HD and the sampling was not structured. Accordingly, it would
be appropriate not to attach too much of “statistical? significance to the survey. However,
the survey did provide a fairly good indication of the trends/perceptions, especially in the
areas where many of the respondents providing similar ratings. Also, the open-ended
questions have elicited a large number of suggestions which merit consideration.
Accordingly, the key findings and suggestions were incorporated as appropriate in the
main text, and this annex has been included to document the results/feedback for future
reference.

2.0       Performance of Civil Works Contracts

2.      The overall performance of civil works components has been rated ?Satisfactory?
or ?Moderately Satisfactory? by: (i) 100% of respondents for Upgrading Contracts; (ii)
88% of respondents for Routine Maintenance Contracts and Black-spot improvements;
and (iii) 69% of respondents for Performance-based Maintenance Contracts. The fact that
all aspects of civil works have scored         Assessment of the overall performance of civil works components 
fairly high positive ratings indicates the                                    under the TNRSP

3.      The critical success factors indicated for implementation of upgrading contracts
(table A6A-1) included –(i) creation of dedicated unit at HQ and field divisions for
Project Management; (ii) quality of preparatory activities, viz., land acquisition, R&R,
utility shifting; and (iii) selection of contractors. Some of the other factors listed by
respondents include e.g. quick dispute resolution; quality of technical staff of contractors;
quality of staff as well as Head of the Project Management Unit (PMU); continuous and
focused training of PMU staff; integrated continuous documentation of lessons learned


                                                              48
from the project; and special attention to address R&R with emphasis on the loss of
livelihood.

4.      Further about 78% of respondents indicated that they would be able to replicate
the top 3/4 critical factors in their regular capital/upgrading contracts. The reasons why
(the remainder 22% of the) respondents said that replication is not possible include:

         Other departments mostly non responsive in case of LA and utility shifting
         Difficulty in maintaining a dedicated team due to the policy of transferring staff
          frequently /superannuation
         In many cases, payments not made in time for want of approval from competent
          authorities
         Introducing independent engineers affects the performance, experience, and
          dedication of departmental engineers
         Non availability of Project Coordination Consultant (PCC) during implementation

5.       For implementation of Regular Maintenance Contracts under TNRSP, the critical
factors indicated included: (i) creation of a dedicated unit at HQ and field divisions for
Project Management; (ii) packaging of contracts with reasonable size and quality; and
(iii) selection of contractors. Some other factors mentioned included e.g. provision for
cost escalation of works; excise duty exemption; active participation of departmental
field staff; reduction in time taken from DPR preparation to award of contract; and
focused training provided to staff. About 93% of respondents felt that the top factors
indicated could be replicated in their regular maintenance contracts. According to the
remaining respondents, replication may not be easy because of the difficulties associated
with (i) employing an independent technical review consultant to audit and support the
HD in implementation; (ii) changing the mind-set of the department not geared towards
scientific implementation and project/contract management; and (iii) maintaining this
level of fund allocation for maintenance of road to such higher specifications as in
TNRSP.

3.0       Institutional strengthening component

6.     Awareness: While all respondents are fully aware of the IT-related interventions
and restructuring of HD, some of them are not familiar with the ISO certification (16%)



                                                49
and staffing rationalisation (23%), indicating a need for more communication with regard
to these sub-activities.

7.      On the restructuring of the HD, while 66% of respondents felt that such
restructuring is appropriate/desirable, about 22% felt otherwise on the following
grounds, viz., (i) implementation of the IS plan not executed to the full extent as
envisaged; (ii) absence of specialized divisions for Planning, ICT and Training functions;
and (iii) no perceptible initiatives to reduce the work load.

8.     On the extent of training/exposure visits, 62% of the respondents felt that the level
of training/exposure visits was “not sufficient? or “highly insufficient?, which
corroborates with the extent of unutilized training budget.

9.      As regards the hardware for IT, all the respondents are aware of this activity and
majority (84%) of them also felt that the quantum of hardware provided was sufficient.
However, only three-fourths of the respondents felt that the divisional and circle officer
regularly use the hardware/software, indicating the need for further propagation of IT
usage in these offices. A sizeable number of respondents felt that the level and number of
staff covered under IT training is insufficient.

10.     On the RMS, awareness is 100% and the perception of comprehensiveness and
user-friendliness of the system, too, is high at 87%; As regards the use of RMS outputs
for decision making, although only 23% of respondents felt that the system is currently
being used, a broader cross section (69%) of respondents felt that in the system would be
used more regularly in future.

11.     Awareness of the Road Accident Database Management System is also 100% and
the system is rated as comprehensive and user-friendly by as many as 97% of the
respondents. Further, survey findings indicate that the system is being regularly used by
the Traffic Police and Highways Department (as stated by 59% and 66% of respondents
respectively). Awareness about the Project and Financial Management system is also
100% and the system was rated as comprehensive and user-friendly by 81% of
respondents. The same percentage felt that the system will improve HD efficiency. On
whether the staff will use it, only 44% felt that they would do so “regularly?, with 38%
stating that they may use it “sometimes?. This perhaps indicates scope for some
improvement in encouraging usage of the software.

12.     On road safety activities, awareness of both road safety policy and road safety
awareness campaigns is 100% while 81% felt that the policy is comprehensive and
effective and 88% stated that awareness campaigns have been comprehensive and
effective. The most critical factors highlight by the respondents for sustaining the road
safety awareness activity included: (i) creation of a dedicated Unit for Road Safety,
followed by – (ii) adequate allocation of resources and inter-departmental co-ordination.
Suggestions for improvement included: (i) conducting aggressive regular campaigns; (ii)
imposing fines and penalties for violation of traffic rules; and simply – (iii) “it has to be
continued?.




                                             50
13.     On PPP facilitation, awareness of the PPP transaction advisory support provided
in TNRSP is 100%; however only 38% of respondents felt that the support is
comprehensive and effective, with an even larger proportion (44%) stating their opinion
as “Don’t Know?. On whether PPP capacity built during the project would dwindle or be
used by the department to do more PPPs again most responses were ambivalent. This is
perhaps understandable because the government’s broader intent and policy push towards
increasing the use of PPP is yet to gain momentum.

4.0       Overall Project Design, Implementation, Utility & Sustainability

14.     On overall Project Design, Implementation, Utility & Sustainability, an equal
number of respondents (50% each) rated the overall objectives and design of the TNRSP
project as ?Satisfactory? and ?Moderately satisfactory?. In terms of implementation, the
level of satisfaction has been highest with respect to the upgrading component, followed
by the maintenance and institutional development & policy components. According to the
respondents, the project has been successful in bringing notable innovations and/or
improvements in the following processes/functions:

         Creation of a dedicated unit from the beginning to the end with independence to
          the PMU for taking decisions
         Optimal utilization of manpower and expertise by selecting 10-15 dedicated staff
          from different wings and preparing them to take the lead in project activities
         Quality & specifications, IT implementation, planning and budgeting tools
         Road safety
         Contract management and exposure to international contracts
         Ensuring timely payments
         Road investment prioritization
         Development of RMS, RADMS, GIS, and P&FMS
         Improved quality of roads with environment and social management in line with
          the standards for such projects
         Deployment of Contract Management Advisor. This role should be enlarged to
          include development of an effective implementation plan.

15.     Also, a majority of the respondents felt that most of the above lessons are likely to
be internalized by the department, subject to adequate deployment of staff at various
levels and sustained emphasis of the senior management to continue the change
management agenda, say, through creating a dedicated team of 15-20 officers who could
act as catalysts for change.

16.    Some specific comments/suggestions on how the project objectives/design aspects
could have been improved include:

         Regular interaction between contractor, consultant, Independent Engineer and
          departmental engineers with open minded, problem oriented discussion




                                             51
      Thorough document vetting and checking of the design at the DPR stage to avoid
       needless arbitration later and holding the DPR consultant responsible for
       structural design and recommendations made by him till the work is completed
      Imposing penalties on the Independent Engineer for deficiency of service and
       holding him responsible for the quality and quantity of work; avoiding random
       checking for quality control
      Appointment of consultants before signing works contract and introducing clauses
       in consultancy services contracts to impose penal charges in contract conditions if
       consultants do not perform services as per the contract
      Standardized documents for the project and guidelines to be followed need to be
       prepared at the initial stage and updated to achieve the objectives efficiently
      Expeditious land acquisition - should be completed before avoiding the contract.
       Timely decisions on contracted issues
      Exposure to international produces and practices especially in the procurement of
       highly technical goods which requires specialized staff with related technical
       backgrounds
      Improved co-ordination and interfacing with various stakeholders to facilitate
       participation and use of expertise


17.     Some of the notable suggestions on how the Bank could have made a more
effective contribution included:

      Further reduce the time taken for issuing NOCs and resolving issues;
      Ensuring compulsory training in use of procurement procedures to all engineers;
      Providing model TORs for various services;
      Moderation in respect of R&R/Social/Environment covenants to suit Indian
       conditions;
      In consultant selection guidelines/contracts, include stronger deterrents for
       deficient service delivery, say, through penalty clauses.

Brief Description of Major Components of the Project and Key Performance
Indicators
A)       Civil Works Component: This component consisted of (a) capital expenditure
contracts (widening and strengthening of 724km of roads, including 14 bypasses, through
7 contract packages); (b) traditional maintenance contracts (covering 1030 km of roads);
(c) improvement of 50 black-spots and road safety audit and assessment of 750 km of
roads; and (d) performance based maintenance contract (covering 300 km). As on date,
all the capital expenditure contracts, except a bridge and two bypasses, and all the
traditional maintenance contracts are completed. After improving the 50 block-spots
initially targeted, the Highways Department had taken up 307 black-spots; of these, 282
are already improved and the work on the remaining is in progress. Works for
improvement of about 300 km of roads on performance-based maintenance contract are
currently in progress.
     Key Performance Indicators

B)       Institutional Strengthening and Policy Development Activities
        Organizational Restructuring: The Highway Department has been restructured
         along the functional areas of focus (e.g., creation of positions of Chief Engineers
         for “Construction and Maintenance? and “Quality Assurance and Research? in
         place of two other CE positions) and a post of the Director General was created to
         achieve better coordination among different functions. In addition, steps were
         taken to streamline/standardize the systems and procedures; towards this end, ISO
         Certification was done for 2 Circles and 3 Divisions and the remaining Circles
         and Division are expected to achieve ISO Certification in the next two years.
         Concomitantly, staffing has been rationalized and redundancies were brought
         down; over an eight-year period, the overall staff strength of the Department has
         been reduced from 7884 to 6935.
        Enhancing use of ICT: The project supported purchase and installation of various
         software and hardware (1717 desktops, 10 servers, 9 laptops, 620 printers, 30

    scanners and 450 webcams) and provision of basic IT training to staff at various
    levels of HD. Using the “IT-platform? thus created, the project has been inducting
    other specialized software/systems as detailed below.
   Road Accident Database Management System has been developed and
    operationalized and is currently being used extensively by the Police, Transport
    and Highways Departments. Government of Tamil Nadu is now taking steps to
    further improve this system through procurement of handheld devices and
    ensuring uninterrupted internet connectivity.
   Road-Asset Management System (RMS) has been strengthened through purchase
    of four sets of data collection equipment. With these, the Department now has
    enough capacity to collect and update road condition data for the entire road
    network (including ODRs) in RMS every year.
   Geographical Information System and Project & Financial Management Systems
    have been developed and are being tested for user acceptance.
   Road Safety. Road Safety Policy was approved and disseminated. Road Safety
    Audit & Assessment Training was imparted to HQ and field based staff of HD
    and also police officers. Road Safety Awareness campaigns were conducted for
    1200 three and four-wheeler drivers in 10 districts and 400 students through
    educational institutions.
   PPP Facilitation. The project supported engagement of transaction advisory
    services to examine nine roads for their amenability for development as PPP sub-
    projects and, thereafter, in preparing techno-economic feasibility reports for
    selected roads and in successful bidding and awarding of one road (Chennai Outer
    Ring Road Project) on PPP basis.

1.1    Objective, Design, Implementation and Operational Experience

2.     The Tamil Nadu Road Sector Project (TNRSP) has been implemented with World
Bank assistance of $398 million (original loan of $348 million and additional financing
of $50 million); the overall project cost initially estimated at $450 million, has been
subsequently revised to $510 million. The project comprised three components, viz.,
Road Upgrading, Road Maintenance & Safety Works and Institutional & Policy
Strengthening. A total of 101 contracts (goods, works and services) were taken up under
these components. The achievements of the project in terms of outputs with respect to
each of these main components are summarized in Table A7-1 below.

    Table A7-1: Component-wise Achievement of Outputs (as of March 31, 2012)
 Component         Output Description                      Achievement
 Up-gradation      7 contracts, with a total length of 724 99.86% Completed
 including 13      Km (including 16 major bridges, 67
 Bypasses          minor bridges and 1600 culverts), at a
                   total cost of Rs.1,540 Crore
 Enhanced Periodic 39 contracts, with a total length of 100% Completed
 Maintenance       1,033 Km, at a total cost of Rs.425
                   Crore
 Institutional     RMS, RADMS, GIS, P&FMS, Road Safety activities completed.
 Strengthening

3.      Enhanced Periodical Maintenance (EPM) works were taken up in a phased
manner over four years. They were taken up for a total length of 1,033 km of roads and
completed as per the following program: (i) 597 km taken up and completed under the
first year program; (ii) 252 km taken up and completed under the second year program;
(iii) 184 km up and completed under the third and fourth year program. Independent
technical review services for EPM works were carried out utilizing the services of the
consultants.

4.      The Environmental Guidelines and R&R work prepared during the DPR stage
have been implemented successfully in separate wings in the TNRSP PMU. A tree
planting strategy was worked out under the control of a separate unit under the leadership
of the Assistant Conservator of Forest, and trees were planted on all project roads.




                                           61
5.     The PMU followed the procurement guidelines of the World Bank, which helped
achieve competitive rates and significant savings. The TNRSP Engineers got trained in
World Bank procurement guidelines with the help of ASCI, Hyderabad.

6.      Frequent staff change among the consultants was an issue which constantly arose
during the project duration. Replacements of the same caliber were not found from the
original staff and on many occasions, it was observed that the personnel employed by the
consultant were project specific and not belonging to the regular establishment of the
consultant. Such project specific personnel lacked allegiance towards work, therefore the
quality of work suffered. Certain activities handed over to NGOs which were not
functioning properly lead to some penal activities against the NGOs who were not
performing their duties as per the contract.

7.     Some of the other challenges faced in implementation and the way they were
handled are highlighted below:
    Audit objections were raised on many issues by the Auditor General Office.
       Many of the objections were raised due to non-awareness of FIDIC conditions in
       the TNRSP contracts. These audit objections were cleared with the help of a
       separate unit under the control of the Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts
       Officer (Audit Department). The audit certificates up to 31.03.2011 have been
       received. After the completion of all the contracts, the TNRSP is facing about 40
       arbitration cases across the five packages.
    TNRSP 04 encountered difficulties initially in mobilization of laborers,
       machineries and mixing plant, and was almost on the verge of termination. After
       the World Bank Implementation Support Mission and discussion during
       September 2007, the contractor gave certain assurances and made a remarkable
       turnaround in the execution of the works. TNRSP and the Team Leader of the SC
       on their part quantified every item of pending work and monitored it very closely
       on a day-to-day basis which had a very salutary effect on the progress. The way in
       which the contractor rose to the occasion and completed the work in an exemplary
       manner was commendable.
    TNRSP 06: The project was not progressing well in the initial phases mainly due
       to lack of competency of the then Supervision Consultant (SC-04) and,
       accordingly their services were terminated in July 2011. But for this timely
       termination, the reconstruction of the Tsunami Affected Bridge connecting
       Keelamanakudi and Melamanakudi villages and work on Kumbakonam bypass
       extension would have suffered further in terms of delays and technical quality.
       The order of termination was upheld by the Madras High Court thanks to the
       meticulous documentation after review at every stage by TNRSP and strict
       adherence to laid down procedure.

1.2    Assessment of Outcome

8.     The internal rating of the TNRSP project compared with the other projects taken
up by Government of Tamil Nadu is more than satisfactory, and this is overall a
successful project. The project has been completed and received good appreciation in all


                                           62
the activities performed under the loan component with able assistance from the World
Bank and contributions from Highway Department Engineers, Land Acquisition Wing,
Finance Wing, Audit Wing and Forest Wing. This TNRSP project is now the role model
project for other road infrastructure projects. The achievements of the project in terms of
outcomes are summarized in Table A7-2.

1.2.1   Next Steps

9. A description of proposed arrangements for future operations of the project for
TNRSP – II is summarized below:

       A Techno Economic Feasibility Study has been carried out by IITM, Chennai for
        2,477 km length roads from the core road network of the state, chosen and
        prioritized based on the traffic and road condition data from RMS.




                                            63
         As per the study, a project for Rs. 1500 crore is viable under Public Private
          Partnership (PPP) mode and a project for Rs. 6500 crore is feasible under EPC
          with a good Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR).
         GoTN initiated a proposal to take up the Rs.1500 crore of viable roads under PPP.
          In respect of roads which have good EIRR, the project will be posed for funding
          to external funding agencies through the DEA (GoI) for Rs. 6500 crore, of which
          20% will be borne by the Government. For posing the project to the external
          funding lending agency, GoI has been addressed to indicate the appropriate
          agency.

1.3       Evaluation of Borrower’s Own Performance

10.     The TNRSP PMU unit has grown and gained confidence and enhanced its skills
for executing Externally Aided projects. The PMU unit officers were actively involved
(some directly and some indirectly) during project execution in Land Acquisition and
R&R activities, monitoring of works, Environmental, Social issues in order to take up the
project effectively. This helped the project earn a good rating among the other road
infrastructure projects executed by GoTN.

1.3.1     Suggestions for Borrower’s Effectiveness

11.    The structure for the implementation unit, along with delineation of roles and
responsibilities of the line departments of GoTN at different stages, should be finalized at
the time of negotiations with the Bank.

12.    Active involvement of Highways Department (HD) engineers during construction
supervision: During the construction phase, the Construction Supervision consultant is
designated as “Engineer?, and he and his team are actively involved in works execution.
During this period, the HD engineers have no active role to play. In order to transfer
technology it is suggested that the HD engineers should also be actively involved during
construction supervision of work along with CSC. The Bank should evolve a system
whereby the HD engineers are actively involved in construction supervision. This should
be agreed on during the loan negotiation.

13.    It would help in future works contracts to specify the role of the Divisional offices
and the limits of authority as delegated by the Chief Engineer. In other words the
Employers’ representatives and their respective authority should be clearly defined.

14.    The Engineer’s power stated in the contract document should prevail over the
delegated powers.

15.     Government Auditors are not exposed to FIDIC contract conditions. To address
this limitation, training should be imparted to groups of Auditors before the start of
project implementation.




                                             64
1.4     Evaluation of Performance of the Bank

16.    The World Bank support missions were of a generally high standard and
beneficial to the project. The Bank Implementation Support Missions inspected the site
every six months and issued detailed guidelines about the progress and quality of works.
The missions never failed to point out defects and the slow progress of works.

17.    During the Implementation Support Mission wrap up meetings, the Bank used to
suggest some immediate remedies to rectify the defects if any and give suggestions to
speed up the work. The comments and suggestions in the Aide Memoires helped in
solving problems that arose. For future projects, the Bank may consider the Annuity
based mode of implementation besides the normal EPC contract.

1.5     Overall Lessons and Suggestions

18.    Some of the notable lessons from the project and suggestions for the future,
organized in line with various phases of the project life cycle are listed below:

1.5.1   Project Preparation

19.      Suggestions for Design and DPR stage: (i) Traffic diversions wherever required
during execution of work should be reviewed practically with respect to the particular site
conditions and should be determined at the design stage itself; (ii) The ToR for the
project design should allow for detailed inspection rather than visual inspection only of
the existing structures. This should include non-destructive testing, taking of core
samples, proper bearing inspection etc., so that the full scope of work required can be
detailed and properly priced by the bidders; (iii) Stronger pavement in designs is required
for corridors carrying high or even moderate volumes of industrial traffic; (iv)
Introduction of formal safety audits at the design stage is commensurate with
international practice for subsequent projects; (v) While preparing the longitudinal profile
plan, adequate care should be taken to avoid environmental impacts due to cutting and
filling. (vi) Joint verification with revenue personnel should be carried out prior to
finalization of LA plans; and (vii) Marking of RoW.

20.     Land Acquisition, Fixing of RoW and Shifting of Utilities: (i) Effective and
vigorous public consultation regarding realignment and bypasses should be conducted on
proposals to incorporate stakeholder views and local requirements; (ii) The proposal for
shifting of utilities coming in the right of way should be made based on proper surveys
and consultation with concerned departments and be made part of the contract; and (iv)
The work of land acquisition and shifting of utilities should be well planned and
coordinated. All preconstruction activity should be completed before award of work.

21.    Engaging NGOs for Social Safeguards: Involvement of NGOs and Sociologist in
the Project Management Team at the field level is a prerequisite for bridging the
communication gap between the PAPs and the project for effective management for R&R
and other social issues. The deployment of NGOs in the field level is a very sensitive



                                            65
matter and the decision on deployment should be taken based on broad enquires about the
performance of the NGOs in similar projects.

22.    The time gap between project preparation and implementation affects the
Resettlement Action Plan and quantities in the BOQ items such as Earth works, GSB, etc.,
and, hence, should be minimized as much as possible, say, to one year.

23.       Suggestions for improving Project Coordinating Consultant’s Services:

         Performance of the design consultant/PCC should be monitored. The
          ToR/Agreement should incorporate suitable clauses for: (i) Quality assurance on
          detailed engineering designs included in DPR; (ii) Quality audit and safety audit
          on detailed engineering designs carried out by the design consultant; (iii)
          Responsibility for accuracy of design with economy/aesthetics; (iv) Disincentives
          and deterrent action for deficiency in designs and consultancy services; and (v)
          Performance appraisal report
         In civil works contracts and consultancy supervision contracts the role and
          mandate of the project coordinating consultant needs to be defined clearly.
         It may be desirable that the PCC is retained as the Supervision Consultant also.
          This will enable quick decisions, early processing of design changes and ensure
          reduction in variations.
         More than one design consultant should be engaged for preparation of feasibility
          report and detailed engineering designs including DPR.

1.5.2     Contract Documents and Procurement

24.     Some of the suggestions with respect to various types of bidding and some parts
of the contracting documents are listed below26.

      Table A7-3: Suggestions with respect to contract documents and procurement
       International Competitive Bidding         National Competitive Bidding
      Under FIDIC conditions of contract  A condition should be included in GCC
       and COPA, time limits are not             (NCB) which should mean as under:
       prescribed for rectification of defects   the contractor will deploy at site only
       noted or identified during the defect     those key personnel who are approved
       liability period. According to Clause     by the "Engineer". Non deployment of
       49.4, in case of default on the part of   key personnel at the work site would
       the contractor in carrying out such       attract penalty as stated in the contract
       instructions within a reasonable time,    data.
       the employer will rectify the defect at  The employer should be empowered to
       the risk and cost of the contractor.      recover of a specified amount per



26
  ICR Team’s note: Some of these suggestions are already appear to be present/covered in the extant bid
documents. Yet, given that the Borrower chose to include them in their report, the same are included in this
summary.


                                                    66
 “Reasonable time? is a very vague             person per month if the approved key
  term. Because of this ambiguity in the        personnel remain absent from the
  contract conditions, contractors often        works site without valid reasons
  avoid timely rectification of defects,        exceeding a period of 7 days in a
  causing inconvenience to the public.          month.
  To avert such a situation, it is             According to Clause 38, the Engineer
  suggested to include the following            will adjust the rate of an item if its final
  provisions in COPA: “every time               quantity differs from the quantity
  notice of defects is given, the               stated in the BOQ by more than 25%
  contractor shall correct the notified         provided the change exceeds 1% of the
  defect within the length of time              initial contract price. In order to adjust
  specified by the Engineer’s notice?.          the rate, the Engineer may ask the
                                                contractor for a detailed cost break
                                                down of any item in the BOQ. A clear
                                                cut mechanism for adjusting the rate
                                                should be incorporated in the contract.
                                                Moreover, the limit of the change
                                                exceeding 1% is on the lower end
                                                especially for road maintenance
                                                contacts, for which it should be 10%.
                                               If the contractor's quotation for the
                                                variation item is unreasonable, the
                                                Engineer will make his own forecast of
                                                the effects of the variation on
                                                contractors' cost. The mechanism to
                                                forecast the effects of contractors' cost
                                                should be included in the contract.
                                               According to Clause 47, Price
                                                Adjustment in 18 months' contract time
                                                escalation is not allowed. Escalation
                                                should be applicable for government
                                                controlled items even for small
                                                contracts.
                                               According to the Retention Clause
                                                (Clause 48), during the defect liability
                                                period, only 50% of the retention
                                                money in the form of bank guarantees
                                                remains with the employer. Since the
                                                amount retained with the employer is
                                                not substantial, the contractor avoids
                                                timely corrections of defects. The total
                                                amount of retention money (5% of the
                                                actual cost of the project) should be
                                                retained with the employer during the
                                                defect liability period. The refund
                                                should be made in a phased manner

                                                    according to the performance of the
                                                    contractor and response time taken by
                                                    him in correcting the defects during the
                                                    defect liability period.
                                     Instructions to Bidders
   A condition may be incorporated in the prequalification documents and the ITB
    stating that unofficial sub-contracting of work either in part or whole is prohibited.
    Further, a condition to this effect should also be included in COPA or GCC whereby
    if during execution it is discovered that a contractor has indulged in the practice of
    unofficial sub-contracting, he would be summarily disqualified for future tendering
    in the World Bank financed projects. Maximum limit for subcontracting a work
    stated in the contract conditions, instructions to be done.
   In order to encourage joint ventures of local firms with foreign firms, the price
    preference for domestic bidders should not be included in the ITB Clause.
   Joint Venture partners who abscond from their responsibilities should be subject to
    punitive action. A condition in ITB and COPA/GCC should be incorporated stating
    that the JV partners would be considered as one entity and should respond to the
    needs of the contract as and when required. Responsibilities of JV partners should be
    clearly defined.
   The contractual power for checking and verification of Financial Statements of Joint
    Ventures should be given to the employer, even when the contract is in force.
   A specific limit for the clarification process should be incorporated in the ITB within
    which if a bidder fails to provide the required information, his bid should be
    considered non-responsive.
   A position of planning and Chief Quantity surveyor should be included in the list of
    contractors' key personnel. All key personnel should be employees of the main
    contractor.
                                       Conditions of Contract
   The basic requirement to satisfy “substantial completion? should be defined in the
    documents.
   It is suggested that instead of full release of BG it is extended for an agreed “full
    completion? period for a reduced amount to cover the value of outstanding works.
   The submission of as-built drawings (COPA Clause 6.6) should not be linked to the
    issue of taking over certificate. It would be better to revise the wordings of this
    clause to give a specific time limit (e.g.: 14 days after issue of the TOC) and specify
    remedies available to the employer in case of non-compliance.
   It is suggested that the performance BG should be released on submission of
    approval of “as-built drawing?.
   “As built drawings? should be submitted in the format/template as standardized by
    the employer. The standard format/template should be uniformly applicable for the
    entire project duration. Such a template/format should be part of the bidding
    document.
   New and improved codes and specifications developed in the Indian construction
    industry from time to time should reflect and incorporate best practices. However if
    need be, the use of foreign codes should be permitted as a source of guidance in



                                            68
   cases where Indian codes or specifications are found inadequate.
  The power of attorney clause should be deleted from the GCC.
  The contractor should provide insurance agencies well-defined costing of works to
   be insured, especially for temporary works. Such mandatory provisions shall be
   effected through COPA so that the contractor avoids any ambiguity with respect to
   temporary work damage valuation etc.

25.     During the evaluation of the bid documents, the verification of contractors’ pre-
qualification statement is a must. It is often found that the information submitted by the
prospective bidder for prequalification on “paper? bears little resemblance to his actual
capabilities. The evaluation of the bid documents and verification of contractors’ pre-
qualification statement should be confirmed with the agencies, submitted by the
prospective bidder for prequalification on “paper?. The bidders should be blacklisted if
found wrong.

26.     Role of Project Coordinating Consultant: The contract conditions should be
amended in the civil contract, CSC contract, and PCC contract to fix the responsibilities
of the project coordinating consultant and the timelines for requirement of PCC contract.

1.5.3     Civil Works Implementation/Contract Management

27.      The major problem during execution of works is traffic, and the diversion of the
traffic is essential to complete the work with good quality in a fixed time. This requires a
pre-planned land acquisition beyond the RoW, for a temporary period.

28.     Environment Management is an aspect of the contract which is very difficult to
control with widespread abuses by the contractor, who is ruled simply by cost vs. profit.
Most of the bidders will not make sufficient allowance in their price and do their best to
avoid or minimize the expenditure on EMP compliance after contract award.

29.    Most of the contractors have not deployed the key personnel mentioned in the bid
documents at the work site. Sometimes, the contractors’ foreman or junior technical
personnel was found to be managing the day to day construction activity at the site. This
has an adverse impact on the quality of works. Contract conditions should be amended to
penalize the contractor for not engaging the already identified key staff in the bid
document.

30.     In the civil works bid documents and in construction supervisory contracts, the
role of the project coordinating consultant has to be clearly defined.

31.       Suggestions for improving Supervision Consultant’s services
         The mix of staff with strong international experience and local staff should be
          more balanced if international consultants are to be employed; otherwise the
          benefit of employing an international consultant is diminished.
         Replacement staff must be equal in caliber to the outgoing incumbent and should
          be in place in a timely fashion. Such replaced person(s) should be inducted only


                                             69
          after approval by the client. The remuneration should be reduced to 90% for such
          replacement each time.
         The procedure for monitoring the performance of CSC should be evolved and
          incorporated in the ToR of CSC.
         It is suggested that consultants’ personnel posted onsite supervision works should
          belong to the regular establishment of the consulting firm.
         Accountability and liabilities of CSC and PCC have not been clearly laid out in
          the ToR of Services. The ToR should include this aspect also.
         In the event of emergencies such as floods, earthquakes etc. the CSC should play
          an active role in getting the project cleared and making the corridor traffic worthy
          through the contractor. Such conditions should be incorporated in the ToR of CSC.

1.5.4     Contract Completion/handover phase

32.       Safety Audits were felt inadequate at the completion stage.

33.     The basic requirements to satisfy substantial completion are not clearly defined in
the bid document. This “substantial completion? is necessary at the time of completion of
the project to avoid time and cost overruns. “Substantial Completion? of the project
should be defined clearly in the bid document and should be part of the contract

34.   The value of EMP compliance with respect to the BOQ items in the bid
documents should be carried out before completion of work.

35.     Tenure of the Project Coordinating Consultant: Disputes regarding excess
payment for the works executed are notified by the contractor only after the completion
of the work. At the time of arbitration, after completion of the work, the CSC has already
demobilized the contractor’s establishment from the project. The decisions taken during
execution with respect to contract conditions are taken independently by the CSC. The
employer is ignorant about this matter and is required to defend the same before the
arbitrator. Therefore, the timelines for the PCC should be fixed till the end of the legal
processes, such as in the case of arbitration in the High Court.

2.        Comments of Borrower on ICR Report

36.    Borrower’s comments on the Bank’s draft ICRR, received vide their letter
no.536/2012/TNRSP dated 27.08.2012, are listed below:

37.    The draft ICR for the TNRSP prepared by the World Bank has been reviewed and
found to be acceptable on almost all topics. While appreciating the efforts taken by the
ICR task team in bringing out the various status of the project right from its formulation,
implementation, lessons learnt, it is submitted that our views on the ratings on enhanced
periodical maintenance and Government’s role may be considered.

38.     Comment on the analysis and “Moderately Satisfactory? rating for Sub-
objective 2, that is, enhanced periodical maintenance: Unlike the upgradation works,



                                              70
which had been tendered at the inception stage of the project itself, the maintenance
works were programmed to be taken up in a phased manner for four years. Hence, the
planned physical target could not be achieved because of the hike in the bitumen price
during the project execution, which pushed up the cost of the maintenance works. This
resulted in reduction of length from the originally planned physical target. However, the
allotted financial target under this component was achieved. Further, about 350 km length
of roads was proposed for execution during the fourth phase to comply with the physical
target under this component, utilizing the savings amount in the project cost. Since the
World Bank did not agree during the discussions, the same was dropped. Hence,
considering the above points, taking the physical target alone into consideration for rating
this component would not be prudent as this component objectives have been fully
complied with, including all aspects like good procurement processes, well administrated
contracts, capacity enhancement of the HD in technical review of works independently
by HRS and PMU of the third and fourth year maintenance works. Hence it is requested
that this may be rated as “SATISFACTORY?.

39.     Comment on the “Moderately Satisfactory? rating for the Government’s Role:
It is prudent to note that TNRSP was the first Externally Aided Project (EAP) in Road
Sector in the state. Such a new system of external funding with a huge outlay, new
international procedures in formulation of the project and follow up, the preparation of
massive DPRs utilizing the HDM and related international standards and procuring
international consultants for project preparation were all new introductions to the sector.
All these led to the initial delay, which in any sector is inevitable. Although initial delay
as mentioned was there, the government took the necessary steps to make the changes
required for course correction in the department and succeeded, which is exemplified by
the fact that the project was a major success, considering its complex nature and
sustainability issues of the interventions in the institutional development. Taking into
account the Government’s commitment and success in achieving the physical & financial
goals as well as institutional development, it is requested that this may be changed to
“SATISFACTORY?.
