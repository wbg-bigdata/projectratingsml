MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed credit to the People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen for SDR 13.1 million (US$16.8 million equivalent) is sub-
mitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and
would help finance a road maintenance project. Parallel co-financing of
about $5.1 million is expected from the Arab Fund&for Social and Economic
Development.
2.       Background.  Since Independence in 1967 a prime objective of the
Government policy has been to integrate the country and to lessen the depen-
dence of the economr on Aden port and refinery by developing agriculture and
fisheries. The vital supporting role of adequate communications for the
achievement of these objectives was recognized and intensive efforts were
made to build up a transport system, particularly roads, as well as institu-
tions and policies to operate the system on a country wide basis. IDA was
closely associated with these efforts through four highway projects and a
Roads Flood Reconstruction Project, which: (a) provided assistance to esta-
blish and build-up the Highway Authority (HA); (b) helped to establish a
concept for the rational development of the road system; (c) helped to
prepare and later to finance (including attracting cofinancing from other
agencies) priority road investments; (d) in view of a lack of interest by
international contractors in the past to carry out road works in PDRY at
reasonable costs, assisted in tLe development of local construction capa-
city; and (e) through a transport sector study, idet.tified actions to
increase productivity of transport operating agencies. Physical expansion
of the paved road system--from about 400 km in and around Aden at Indepen-
dence to about 1900 km today-has been impressive, but outpaced the HA's
capacity to administer and maintain the system properly. Thus, while system
expansion continues to gradually link the remaining isolated yet productive
areas, increased attention has to be given to establishing appropriate road
maintenance systems together with the necessary training and workshop infra-
structure. Accordingly, based on studies carried out under earlier projects,
the recent Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1617-YDR of October 4, 1985)
includes the start-up phase of a road maintenance program, the thrust of
which is included under the proposed project. As a follow-up to the trans-
port sector study, the Fourth Project also includes a road user charge study;
other recommendations from the sector study are the subject of the ongoing
dialogue with the Government. The Fourth Project is over a year behind
schedule mainly due to the disruption caused by the 1986 civil distur-
bances. However, implementation of all project components is now firmly
underway. In March and April 1987, PDRY was hit by heavy rainfalls which



-2-
caused significant road damage. In response to a Government request, a road
flood repair component has been included under the Fifth Highway Project to
help the Government deal with the emergency situation.
3.       Project Objectives.  Following up on the Fourth Highway Project,
'this Fifth Project specifically aims at: (a) completing the establishment
of an effective road maintenance organization; (b) creating an efficient,
well trained, HA workforce; and (c) creating a sound basis for planning the
future development of the road systems.
4.       Project Description.  The Project covers the 1987-89 time slice of
a Five-Year road maintenance program, comprising routine maintenance-' and
periodic maintenance. To carry out routine maintenance, three maintenance
districts are being established at Aden, Shuqra and Mukalla under the Fourth
Highway Project which provides for buildings at the different maintenance
centers and sub-centers; workshop equipment; an initial tranche of road main-
tenance equipment requirements; equipment for a radio communication system,
maintenance management systems, and road planning data collection; and
technical assistance. The Fifth Highway Project includes: (a) periodic
maintenance, comprising a total of 193 km of overlays and 173 km of reseals;
(b) the bulk of the road maintenance equipment; (c) furniture for offices
and staff accommodations; (d) materials for the production and installation
of traffic signs and for road marking; (e) reconditioning of an existing
Vocational Training Center and provision of training equipment and materials;
(f) construction of a new Central Workshop complex in Aden and provision of
some additional workshop equipment; (g) continuation of technical assistance
to help with the initial operation of the road maintenance planning (includ-
ing pavement management) and cost accounting systems, and the implementation
of the road maintenance and training programs; (h) the preparation of a road
master plan; and (i) road flood repair works. The capital cost of the pro-
ject is estimated at US$31.0 million equivalent, of which $24.0 million will
be in foreign exchange. Including recurrent costs during the 1987-1989
period, the total project cost is US$36.9 million equivalent. Tne proposed
credit for SDR 13.1 million (US$16.8 million equivalent) representing about
452 of the project's total cost, would meet about 652 of its foreign
exchange cost. The Government has made a request to the Arab Fund to nelp
finance foreign costs of US$5.1 million, and the Arab Fund confirmed its
intention to make a loan for the project in 1988. Government would meet
about US$2.1 million of foreign capital cost, the local capital cost, and
all recurrent costs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in PDRY are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. Staff Appraisal
Report No. 6477-YDR dated May 15, 1987, is being distributed separately.
1/ Including the recurrent costs of routine maintenance.



5.       Rationale for Association Involvement.  Road transport is now the
country's most important made of transport and has been instrumental in
unifying the country, gmobilizing production resources and building a
national economy. The Project is the logical extension of IDA's previous
assistance in road construction as it is needed to preserve the achievements
made so far. Improved road maintenance together with sound planning of
further system development through the road Laster plan and its annual
reviews under the Project will rationalize road expenditures in an environ-
ment of increasingly tight public funds. Lastly, the proposed Project would
enable IDA to continue the dialogue with the authorities on institutional
and operational efficiency in the road subsector and the transport sector at
large.
6.        Actions Agreed.  During credit negotiations, the assurances
obtained from the Government under the Fourth Highway Project have been
reviewed and the Development Credit Agreement is being amended with a view
to: (a) completing the road user charge study by March 31, 1988; (b) estab-
lishing the new road maintenance and training organizations and the cost
accounting system by January 31, 1988; and (c) preparing by June 30, 1988,
for review by IDA detailed plans for the implementation of the Road Main-
tenance Program and the Training Program. Apart from the regular covenants
regarding project execution and management of the Fifth Highway Project, the
Government has agreed to the followipg main points: (a) to update and
furnish for IDA's concurrence each year until the closing date: (i) the
periodic maintenance program proposed for the following five years; (ii) the
routine maintenance and training programs proposed for the following year;
and (iii) the budget allocations for the implementation of these programs
during the following year; and (b) prepare by April 30, 1989, a draft road
master plan for review with IDA and thereafter update the Plan by October 30
of each year for review with IDA, finalize it by December 31 of each year
and carry out the activities agreed to with IDA. Special conditions of
credit effectiveness would be: (a) the signing of consultants contracts for
the technical assistance in road maintenance and training and the road user
charge study under the Fourth Highway Project; and (b) the selection of
consultants for the road master plan study under this project. IDA would
reserve the right to suspend credit disbursement in case: (a) the cofinan-
cier's loan is not effective by June 30, 1988, and no acceptable substitute
funding is Available from other sources; and (b) allocations for road
maintenance and training acceptable to IDA have not been included in the
budget.
7.       Justification.  The building and equipment investment under the
project is an integral part of the total investment in the road maintenance
organization. This investment is considered well justified since the
improved routine maintenance program has a high economic return. Based on
forecasts of road deterioration and vehicle operating costs under existing
and improved maintenance oractices, the incremental benefit/cost ratio of
the 1987-1991 maintenance program is estimated at 1.5:1. Based on savings
in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs, the economic returns



on the pavement strengthening works under the project have been estimated at
between 17S and 142X. The composite rate of return of the project is 76X.
Benefits of the technical assistance and training not directly associated
with the road maintenance program and the road masterplan have not been
quantified. However, since these investments contribute to increased
administrative and operational efficiency and to improved resource alloca-
tion they are deemed eminently justified. The benefits of the emergency
road flood repair works are self-evident and have not been quantified. Not
only would these works restore normal and safe driving conditions, but
repair of the damaged sections is required prior to commencement of the
project overlays.
8.       Risks.  The main risk to efficient project implementation and thus
to realization of the full project benefits, is financial. IDA has actively
supported the Government in its search for cofinancing, and commitment from
a cofinancier to meet the foreign financing gap of the capital costs of the
project has been received. However, the recurrent budget for road main-
tenance and training needs to be doubled and be sustained at this high
level. The Government considers that it can finance the budget increase
from its own resources despite its tight financial position. The
Government's strong commitment to the project and the monitoring procedures
and remedies built into it, mitigate the risk of delays in the provision of
funds.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
