MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:         Project Completion Report on Korea - Second Technology Advancement
Project (Loan 3202-KO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Korea - Second Technology
Advancement project (Loan 3202-KO, approved in FY90), prepared by the East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office. Part II was prepared by all five beneficiary institutes.
In its quest to join the ranks of the industrialized countries, Korea has, in the last two decades,
been pursuing a focussed and intensive program of human resource and technology development. In
addition to expanding and strengthening vocational, technical and tertiary education in science and
engineering, the Government created an elaborate institutional framework which, through the Ministry
of Science and Technology (MOST), played an important role in coordinating and carrying out R & D
programs, provided incentives for the private sector to expand investments in R & D, expanded the
provision of credit to finance R & D programs in the private sector, and placed special emphasis on
developing technology-based small and medium scale industries.
Through its lending to the education sector and for technology development, the Bank has been
closely associated with the technological advancement of Korea. This loan which aimed at providing
funds for the purchase of modern equipment by five prestigious national institutes to expand their
research and development efforts, achieved its objectives fully. The availability of the new facilities
has made it possible for the institutes to increase their research activities, the number of joint projects
(frequently with private industry) and their scientific and technical publications. The Korea Advanced
Institute of Science and Technology, for example, has increased its intake of post-graduate students
from 955 in 1990 to 1339 in 1994 while its contribution to international academic publications has
grown from 1117 to 1524 in the same period.
Considering the success of these institutes in improving their laboratories and achieving results,
the outcome of this project is rated as satisfactory. The project has had substantial institutional
development impact and its sustainability is rated as likely. It is important to note that the Bank's long
association with successful technology development in Korea has provided the Bank with many lessons
of experience for the design of technology development projects in other countries.
The PCR is of satisfactory quality. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3202 - KO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Technology
Advancement Project in Korea for which Loan 3202-KO in the amount of US$31.6
million was approved on May 22, 1990. The loan was closed on schedule on June
30, 1994. The loan account books were kept open to honor applications
received before October 31, 1994. The last transaction was made on August 31,
1994. The loan account was closed on August 31, 1994 with a total
disbursement of US$31,572,875.49 million or 99.9% of the loan amount.
The PCR was prepared in November/December, 1994 by EA1HR (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).  The Borrower's Ministry of Finance was
requested to act as the coordinator for the five parts of Part II of the PCR.
Preparation of this PCR was started in June 1993 when a Bank mission
requested the five institutions concerned to complete and return Project
Review from Borrower's Viewpoint (Part II) and Bank-prepared pro-formas for
the preparation of Part III of the PCR. The May 1994 Bank mission followed up
with reminders on the pro-formas and the obligations of the borrower for
submission of Part II of the PCR to the Bank. Based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement dated August 10, 1990, the Amendment to
the Loan Agreement dated March 3, 1992, supervision and progress reports,
correspondence between the Bank and Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda and
documents, Bank staff prepared the PCR in November/December 1994.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3202 - KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
OBJECTIVES
(i) The objectives of the project were fully met (paras. 5 and 14). In
general the broad aim of the project was achieved in improving the quality of
education in a center of excellence in science and engineering education and
enhancing the R&D capacity of selected institutions in the fields of
biotechnology, standards measurement, energy and resources development and
conservation. The impact of the project was positive in all five project
institutions (paras. 14 and 15).
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
(ii) Overall implementation experience was highly satisfactory. The project
closed on schedule with no cost overrun. There were two physical components
equipment financed by the loan and equipment-related civil works, which were
financed by the Government. Equipment procurement was very close to target
with disbursements of US$31.57 million out of loan proceeds of US$ 31.6
million. Thus actual disbursements were 99.9% of the loan amount. A grace
period of four months after the original Closing Date, June 30, 1994, was
granted for disbursements on eligible expenditures. There was some delay in
equipment procurement at the initial stage of project implementation but this
was resolved and did not prevent the timely completion of the project.
Cooperation between the Bank and the project institutions was highly
satisfactory. This can be attributed to the strong start-up assistance from
the Bank and the high quality of local implementation officials. Despite
changes in the institutional setup, project implementation was carried out
successfully.
RESULTS
(iii) The equipment procured under the project was directly relevant to the
project's objectives. The quality of research has been strengthened at the
Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). This has enhanced
the quality of graduate programs by expanding the opportunities for graduate
students to become involved in advanced research. The R&D capacity of the
Genetic Engineering Research Institute (GERI) has been strengthened to provide
greater support to the biotechnology industry. The Korea Research Institute
of Standards and Science (KRISS) has enhanced its capacity to design and apply
national measurement standards, which contributes to improving the quality of
industrial products. The quality of resource survey techniques and R&D in
energy conservation has improved at the Korea Institute of the Energy Research



- iv -
(KIER) and the Korea Institute of Geology, Mining and Minerals (KIGAM)
These institutions now contribute to a more efficient utilization of scarce
resources, especially those related to energy generation.
SUSTAINABILITY
(iv) The project institutions are prestige institutions in Korea and receive
strong support from their parent ministry (paras. 16 - 19). KAIST is one of
Korea's leading education and research institutes in science and technology.
Thus it will continue to receive strong financial support and to recruit high
quality faculty, thereby ensuring the sustainability of the project's
investment. GERI plays the role of training center for Korea's high-level
research personnel and as a think-tank for policy-making in the field of
biotechnology. KRISS is the central authority of the national standards
system. Its crucial role in conducting comprehensive activities related to
measurement standards and measurement technology provides vital services to
industry. Since Korea is not well-endowed with natural resources, KIER and
KIGAM play a significant part in ensuring self-sufficiency in energy sources
during rapid industrialization. The high profile of these five institutions
with respect to Korea's technology development priorities will ensure
continued strong support for them which, in turn, will reinforce the
sustainability of the project's investments.
FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
(v) Project design was consistent with sectoral objectives and with previous
Bank lending in technology development and science and technical education in
Korea. Project design focused on hardware (equipment and civil works), which
was appropriate in view of the well-developed state of the project
institutions. They were well-managed, staffed and financed. There was a need
for upgrading the teaching and research laboratories to permit the highly-
qualified staff to work more effectively. Given the straightforward nature of
project design and its successful implementation, there were no major lessons
to be learned. Nevertheless, some insight can be gained. Strong initial
start-up assistance from the Bank and the dedication of competent local staff
enhanced the prospects for successful implementation. Project institutions
participated effectively in preparing Part II of the PCR.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3202-KO)
PART I. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Project Identity
- Project Name:   Second Technology Advancement Project
- Loan No.:        3202-KO
- RVP Unit:        East Asia and Pacific Region, Country Department I
- Country:         Korea
- Sector:          Education
- Subsector:       Science and Technology
B.    Project Background
1.        Sector Development Obiectives.  In support of the Government's
industrial restructuring policy, the objectives of the science and technology
sector were to:
-    develop and utilize technology to the fullest;
-    gain continued improvements in productivity;
-    expand high value added output which is technologically
sophisticated, energy efficient and strongly export-oriented; and
-    enhance the role of small and medium industry (SMI) for reducing
industrial concentration and over-dependence on imported parts and
materials.
In line with these priorities, the education sector's objectives were: to
develop R&D capacity in both educational and research institutions; to develop
indigenous technology to overcome the increasing difficulty of importing
technology from abroad; and to upgrade and restructure the skill mix
requirements for meeting the demands of an increasingly technology-intensive
industrial sector.
2.        Policy Context.  The Government placed heavy emphasis on the need
for restructuring industry towards more technology-intensive fields as the
prospects for further expansion of labor-intensive industries became more
limited. To achieve this objective, the Government created an elaborate legal
and institutional framework which established an important public sector role
in coordinating and carrying out R&D programs, provided incentives for the
private sector to expand investments in R&D, strengthened and expanded the
provision of credit to finance R&D programs in the private sector, and placed
special emphasis on developing technology-based small and medium industries.
3.        Research and Development.  The growth of R&D in Korea underwent
three major changes. First, the emphasis in the early stage on Government
expenditures changed to the predominantly industry-funded contributions



following the introduction, in the 1970s, of incentives for the private sector
to expand R&D expenditures. Second, the total R&D expenditures increased from
0.6% of GNP in 1980 to 2% in 1986 and are planned to reach 3% by 1995 and 5%
by 2001. Third, the ratio of scientists and engineers (the basic human
resource for R&D), is planned to increase from 13 per 10,000 population in
1986 to 30 per 10,000 by 2001. Further, the National Project scheme has been
introduced to develop broader technological infrastructure in priority areas,
strengthen linkage between industry and public R&D institutes, and promote
research on industry-initiated topics under joint ventures between SMI and
contracted research institutes.
4.        Science and Technologv Education.  In Korea, the development of
education at the secondary and higher levels has generally borne a close
relationship to the country's economic development, especially in relation to
industrial growth and restructuring. The shift from labor-intensive to
capital-intensive and increasingly to technology-intensive industry has been
accompanied by appropriate changes in the education system. Early emphasis
was placed on vocational and technical education to produce skilled workers.
This was followed by an expansion of junior technical colleges to train
industrial technicians. As the economy moved towards more technology-
intensive production, greater emphasis was placed on undergraduate science and
engineering programs to produce professional scientists and engineers.
Priority was also given to graduate education in these fields to supply key
R&D personnel.
C.   Project Objectives and Description
5.        The broad aim of the project was to reinforce the Government's
strategy for technology-intensive industrial development by improving the
quality of education in a center of excellence in science and engineering
education and strengthening the capacity of selected R&D institutions.
6.        The project financed specialized equipment associated civil works
and equipment-related consumable materials and O&M expenditures for KAIST,
GERI, KIER, KIGAM and KRISS. The equipment lists were reviewed rigorously in
each institution. More specifically, project inputs aimed to:
improve the quality of research at KAIST by updating research equipment and
providing state-of-the-art equipment to strengthen its research programs;
strengthen the R&D capacity of GERI and the quality of its support to the
biotechnology industry; enhance the ability of KIER and KIGAM to undertake
resource surveys, strengthen R&D in energy conservation and provide technical
support to industry; and enhance the ability of KRISS to improve national
measurement standards and to provide technical support to industry. Civil
works for GERI and KRISS to house some of the equipment were financed by
government.
D.   Project Desiqn and Orqanization
7.        The project was based on previous Bank support for technology
development in Korea during the last decade, focusing on financing R&D
projects through financial intermediaries, strengthening those intermediaries
and the development of technical and scientific education. At the time of



preparation, the Bank had financed projects in electronics technology,
industry promotion (including Small and Medium Industry) and the first
Technology Advancement Project. The Bank had assisted technical and science
education through seven loans which supported industrial development.
Finally, the Bank had also provided general support for industrial development
through a series of loans to local development banks and through an IFC loan
to assist the commercialization of new technology. The conceptual framework
for the project reflected this Bank experience, and it was clearly stated in
the SAR. The project was designed over a fifteen month period, with inputs
from the Government's central planning authorities, participating ministries/
institutions and Bank staff/consultants. Following the Bank's approval of the
project, there were no significant changes in project design.
8.        The scope and scale of the project were appropriate since it
continued to offer support in those areas in which the Bank had previous
experience while addressing the needs of five national institutions which the
Government had identified as requiring additional quality-improving
investments. The development of these institutions (KAIST, GERI, KIER, KIGAM
and KRISS) further strengthened the research capacity of Korea's leading
graduate school in science and engineering and improved R&D capacity in the
fields of biotechnology, standards measurement and in energy and resources
development and conservation. The project design's focus on hardware
(equipment and civil works) was also appropriate. The project institutions
were found to be well-staffed by highly-qualified researchers, efficiently
managed and well-financed. Their objectives were clearly stated and these
were closely related to Korea's education and technology development
priorities. The main weaknesses were in the physical aspects of laboratory
provision and these were addressed under the project. Upgraded laboratories
were viewed as essential to increasing the effectiveness of teaching and
research staff.
9.        The design of project management centered on the five institutions,
each of which was responsible for the implementation of its part of the
project, under the budgetary oversight of the Ministry of Science and
Technology (MOST). All five institutions excelled in their coordination with
the Bank during project implementation, and also during the preparation of the
PCR. Based on lessons learned from Ln. 2427-K10, the Bank requested that the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) coordinate the preparation of Part II of the PCR.
This was carried out successfully and all five project institutions submitted
their respective Part IIs on schedule.
E.   Proiect Implementation
10.       Comparison of "Planned" versus "Actually Performed" in Project
Imnlementation. There were two physical components in the project. One was
civil works which was financed by the Government; the other was equipment
which was financed by loan proceeds. Equipment is dealt with first. For
'In para. 8 of Part I of the PCR for Ln. 2427-KO dated May 17, 1991, it was
stated that there was a need for a coordinator to oversee the preparation of the
PCRs for projects dealing with more than one institution.



- 4 -
KAIST, procurement of 376 items of equipment was planned with an estimated
cost of $12.0 million. GERI selected 61 items of priority for procurement and
the estimated cost was $4.0 million. For KAIST, the "Actually Performed"
figure was 370 items and the contract cost was $11.99 million. For GERI, the
"Actually Performed" figure was 83 items and the contract cost was $ 4.00
million. For KIER, 23 items were planned whose estimated cost was equivalent
to the estimated loan allocation of $3.2 million. Procurement of 25 items at a
cost of $3.19 million was achieved. The difference was also minimal. For
KIGAM, 32 items were planned whose estimated cost was equivalent to the
estimated loan allocation of $6.4 million. Procurement of 33 items at a cost
of $6.39 million was achieved. KRISS procured 61 items, and the contract cost
was $5.99 million, which was within KRISS's loan allocation of $6.0 million.
As a whole there was no cost overrun. Out of the total loan amount of $31.6
million, $31.56 million was spent on equipment. There was also no time
overrun on equipment procurement, as evidenced by the on-schedule loan
closing.
11.       For civil works, the physical facilities required to house the
equipment procured under the project already existed at all institutions, with
the exception of the KRISS and a few laboratories at GERI. On the basis of
available data, it was not possible to compare "Planned" with "Actual"
achievements for the civil works component for KRISS and GERI. However,
supervision missions found that construction at both institutions were
completed in time for the installation of equipment.
12.       Proiect Risks.  There were no major risks foreseen during
appraisal. No major problem occurred during implementation. The amount of
loan cancellation was $27,124.51, or about 0.09% of total loan amount, and
this can be regarded as negligible. A minor problem occurred in 1991 when the
original Korean Institute of Energy and Resources (KIER) separated into two
institutions, one for energy (Korean Institute of Energy Research - KIER) and
one for resources (Korean Institute of Geology, Mining and Minerals - KIGAM).
These structural changes led to a small delay in disbursements. The Special
Account of the defunct institution had to be closed and separate Special
Accounts established for the two new institutions. However, due to the low
balance amount of the Special Account in the defunct institution, there was an
urgent need of funds to finance contracts already signed. As a result, the
two new institutions faced temporary financial difficulties in obtaining
replenishment from the Bank before the establishment of the two new Special
Accounts. However, this did not affect the timely completion of the project.
The disbursements were completed during the four month grace period. There
was also no problem regarding compliance with covenants (Table 9), submission
of audit reports including separate opinion on statement of expenditures
(Table 9) and timely submission of progress reports (Annex 2).
13.       There were no unforeseen factors which affected project
implementation, and there were no actions or decisions taken which affected
implementation negatively. There were three changes of names and
jurisdictions, namely:



a)   Korea Research Institute of Energy Resources (KIER) split into:
i) Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER), and
ii) Korea Institute of Geology, Mining and Materials (KIGAM); with
jurisdiction for both institutions still under MOST.
b)   Genetic Engineering Center (GEC) became Genetic Engineering
Research Institute (GERI), but still under the jurisdiction of
MOST.
c)   Korea Standards Research Institute (KSRI) became the Korea Research
Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) which remained under the
jurisdiction of MOST.
These changes were unforeseen events and did not produce any adverse
effect on project implementation.
F.   Major Results of the Proiect
14.       Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project were met.
-    The quality of science and engineering education and research at
the KAIST has been strengthened. This has enhanced the quality of
graduate programs by expanding the opportunities for graduate
students to become more involved in advanced research.
-    The R&D capacity of GERI has been strengthened to provide greater
support to the biotechnology industry. KRISS has enhanced its
design and application of national measurement standards which
contributes to improving the quality of industrial products. The
quality of resource survey techniques and R&D in energy
conservation has improved at KIER and KIGAM. They now contribute
to a more efficient utilization of scarce resources especially
those related to energy generation.
-    The equipment procured with the loan proceeds was relevant to the
project's objectives and has increased the research capacity at
KAIST, GERI, KIER, KIGAM and KRISS. The loan financed 572 key
pieces of research equipment, virtually all of which had been
installed and were being used by all institutions at the time the
project closed.
15.       Impact of Project.  The impact of the project is positive on all
five institutions. The assessment is as follows:
(a) KAIST
KAIST is an elite graduate school in Korea. The high quality
engineering training at KAIST cannot be achieved without sound experimental
work in laboratories and solid practical work in workshops. Well-equipped
laboratories and workshops are prerequisites for the attainment of this goal.



- 6 -
The 370 pieces of equipment supported by the project has contributed to the
increasing volume of research projects from Won 14.4 billion in 1990 to Won
32.8 billion in 1993. In additional, the increasing trend is also evident in
the number of published articles from 1,117 in 1990 to 1,524 in 1993.
(b) GERI
In addition to what was stated in para. 14 above regarding GERI,
the research capacity, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, has also
been enhanced. Equipment financed under the project, concentrated in the
Division of Technology Service (DTS), has contributed to strengthening both
GERI's own research capacity and research in the broader field of
biotechnology through DTS' technical support services to outside research
institutes in the universities, government and industry, especially the SMI
sector. The US$4.0 million of equipment has assisted GERI in improving its
capacity for product testing and associated data processing, strengthening
identification and storage capacity for micro-organisms, and improving quality
control in the production of biological specimens. The equipment supported a
generally expanding trend in GERI. The number of publications increased from
65 in 1990 to 130 in 1993. The annual allocation of the R&D budget was raised
from USS 5.4 million in 1990 to US$ 14.0 million in 1994, and the number of
R&D projects increasing from 160 to 210 during the same period.
(c) KIER and KIGAM
For both KIER and KIGAM, the project has positively supported the
full range of their major activities. KIER has strengthened its focus on
energy conservation including the development of more efficient furnaces,
boilers and air conditioning systems and on energy utilization. R&D
activities have been increased in areas of new and renewable energy sources
such as solar, wind, methane gas, etc. KIGAM has improved its work on
geological mapping, oil and mineral resource surveys and the development of
improved methodologies related to these activities. R&D capacity has also
been enhanced in mining technology, especially related to coal. The equipment
supported by the project has contributed to the increasing volume of research
projects from Won 10 billion (194 projects) in 1992 to Won 16.3 billion (214
projects) in 1993. In additional, the increasing trend is also evident in the
number of contract research projects which grew from 73 in 1992 to 81 in 1993.
(d) KRISS
KRISS's strategic role has been strengthened to maintain national
measurement standards and develop improved measurement standards and
techniques. With the modern equipment financed under the project, it has been
able to focus effectively on developing techniques for measuring, testing and
analyzing properties and defects of materials. KRISS's research publications
increased from 294 articles in 1990 to 409 articles in 1993. The number of
patents produced also increased from 12 between 1977-1990 to 18 between 1991-
1994. As a result, KRISS is making a strong impact on ensuring product
quality, safety and environmental standards, all of which are vital to Korea's
technological advancement.

G.   Prolect Sustainability
16.       The Government's continued high priority on science and technology
will ensure the sustainability of all five project institutions. The
Government's dependency on KAIST to produce the highest level scientific and
technological manpower and to serve as a major research institute, assures the
sustainability of this institution. The strong support of MOST for the well-
being of KAIST, one of Korea's most prestigious institutions, further
guarantees that KAIST will not face adverse conditions, such as lack of
budgetary provision. The high prestige that KAIST has enjoyed in the last two
decades in Korea will also ensure that it will continue to recruit high-
quality faculty without difficulty.
17.       To enter the ranks of technologically advanced countries, the
government is placing strong emphasis on upgrading the research capacity of
the national institutes, the very foundation of technology development. This
is to achieve the objective of reinforcing local creative abilities in science
and technology which in turn would strengthen Korea's capacity for
technological innovation and reduce dependence on imported technology. GERI
was established to lead this effort in the area of biotechnological research.
Its valuable technical support services to outside research institutes in the
universities, government and industry assure its sustainability.
18.       In the midst of rapid industrialization, Korea is poorly endowed
with natural resources. The need to seek alternate sources of energy is,
therefore, critical. The strong support for KIER and KIGAM is evidenced by
the creation of these two new institutions from the original KIER. KIER's and
KIGAM's vital functions in energy conservation and development will make them
sustainable in the future.
19.       To ensure competitiveness abroad, KRISS's role in conducting R&D
activities on measurement standards and measurement technology lie at the
heart of this effort. Quality control and increasingly complex technology
require continued improvements in measurement standards. KRISS, therefore,
plays a strategic and pervasive role in Korea's technology advancement.
H.   Bank's Performance During Project Cycle
20.       Major Strengths and Weaknesses.  Bank's performance on this project
was in general satisfactory. Design and implementation of the First
Technology Advancement Project (TAP I) have led to the development of
standardized documentation for project preparation and implementation. This
reduced substantially the number of staff weeks required for project design,
processing and implementation, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of
project activities. The time spent on the early part of the project cycle,
from identification in mid CY89 to loan signing in late CY90, is below
average. The staff input during this period was 16.5 staff weeks, which is
significantly lower than 33.5 staff weeks for the first project. Bank staff
assistance during project implementation was effective in providing timely
advice on procurement issues and ways to avoid extension to the Closing Date.
This was achieved with total staff input for supervision of about 12.6 staff
weeks (Table 10) as compared to 23.7 staff weeks for TAP I. The success of



- 8 -
the project also reflects the strong cooperation the Bank received from highly
competent local officials. The Bank's estimates for the completion of
components and loan disbursements were overly optimistic (Tables 3 and 4) but
this did not pose a problem since all project activities were completed by the
Closing Date and within the grace period for disbursements.
21.       Lessons Learned.  Given the successful implementation of the first
project and the simplicity of this project design, there were no major lessons
to be learned.
I.   Borrower's Performance During Project Cycle
22.       Maior Strengths and Weaknesses.  The performance of all five
project institutions was outstanding. Both KRISS and KIGAM successfully
completed implementation by mid 1993 which was far in advance of the other
institutions. All institutions made significant progress per Bank's advice
and the disbursement process was finalized within the grace period. Work on
the PCR was also excellent. There was neither cost nor time overrun. With
the exception of KAIST, all of this was achieved without any prior experience
in Bank project implementation. Moreover, the cooperation with all Bank
missions during the whole project cycle was impeccable. KAIST had prior
experience with Bank project implementation and therefore only a minimal
effort was required from Bank visiting missions.
23.       Lessons Learned.  Again, there were no major lessons to be learned.
However, two points are worth noting: 1) institutions without prior experience
with implementation of Bank projects can perform well; and 2) despite
structural and jurisdiction changes of project institutions, implementation
can still be effectively carried out without any delay. This may have
resulted from effective start-up assistance and timely support from the Bank,
and the dedication of competent local implementation staff.
J.   Project Relationships
24.       Impact of Relationships on Project Implementation.  The
relationship between the Bank and the five institutions in this project was
excellent throughout the project implementation period. Early emphasis by
Bank staff on implementation requirements and the receptiveness of competent
local staff to this advice contributed significantly to the successful
outcome. Close coordination of MOF with all project institutions provided
prompt submission of Part II of the PCR. The relationships, such as those
between the Bank and MOST and those between project institutions and industry
were satisfactory.
K.   Consulting Services
25.       There was no technical assistance in this project.  There were also
no studies or fellowships.

L.   Project Documentation and Data
26.       Adequacy of Staff Appraisal Report, Major Working Papers and the
Legal Agreement. There is no evidence of any inadequacy in the Staff
Appraisal Report, the working paper or the Loan Agreement.

Project Completion Report (Loan 3202-KO)
1. Objective of the Project
The objective of this loan project was to meet increasing need for procuring
equipment which are required for educating a growing number of students. Since the
relocation of the institute from its Seoul campus into Taedok, KAIST has undergone
substantial expansion in terms of the size of the campus and of the number of student. The
number of student increased from 3,128 to 5,820, as a result of merging, with undergraduate
levels. The size of the building, from 58,051 sq.m to 295,389 sqxa., and the entire campus
size, from 109,787 sq.m to 1,213,198 sq.m. The prerequisites for such expansion was to
acquire research/academic facilities and equipment enough to tain its students, and this has
necessitated KAIST, in consultation with the Korean government, to launch and IBRD loan
project in the amount of U$12,000,000.
The loan, thus granted to KAIST, was applied to financing the acquisition of
research/academic facilities for the 20 departments, computer center, and joint research
labs. Prior to loan application, KAIST has undertaken a sufficient study in handling and
scheduling the fund supply.
However, the fund of U$12,000,000 was not sufficient enough for KAIST to fulfill
adequately the rising facility/equipment demand. Thus, KAIST is continuously seeling
financial means to upgrade its academic faciliti es.
2. Effect of the Loan Application
As a result of effective fund application, KAIST was able to achieve a favorable result

3. Effect of the Project
The loan project has helped KAIST to upgrade its ability to perform world-class
research activities; its students are actively participating in cutting-edge researches in basic
science and applied engineering.
The loan was applied to finance acquisition of equipment of 370 kinds which were
mainly distributed to 20 departments, computer center, and joint research labs.
Consequently, it may be assessed that the increase in lab equipment per professor is
equivalent to US40,000 in value, US2,200 per student.
The loan has enabled KAIST to increase its enrollment and output of students, to
recruit sufficient number of faculty members which resulted in increased number of thesis
publication.

As a result of the loan, the faculty result output has increased remarkably.
Accordingly, faculty's technology assistance to government and industry sponsored research
activities has increased, too.
In 1993, the research outcome has amounted to a worth of U$41 million (32.8 billion
won), and the amount is on the rise. The recent research outcome is as follows:

4. Conclusion
The loan project has been successfully implemented, and we are grateful to IBRD and the
Korean government for their cooperation. The loan of U$12,000 has brought forth
procurement of lab facilities which rendered a more favorable research environment, and as
a result of this, KAIST was able to establish interdisplinary cooperation network among
industry, academies, and research institutions. In addition, the loan project has helped
tremendously to recruit greater number of students while supporting quality research works.
Now, KAIST is continuing in its effort to train higly talented students who will later lead
the scientific and technological advancement of the nation and of the world.
5. Reco=mendations
It would be helpful for executing the loan if the deposit limit in the special account is
upgraded from 10% of the total loan amount to 20%.
It is recommended that the total amount requested by the borrower be deposited into
the special account by the closing date, and the arnount is not withdrawn from the special
account since the closing date.

1. Summary of the Project (Part B)
The objective of this loan project was to improve GERI's biotechnology R&D
capacity through acquisition of specialized equipment and consumable materials.
As the main institute in Korea for life sciences and biotechnology. GERI's rnission
is to develop relevant technologies, strengthening the foundation of research. training
researchers and personnel. and significantly raising the level of national biotechnology
research capability.  Since the relocation of the institute from Seoul into Taedok
Science Town. GERI has undergone substantial expansion in terms of the size of the
building and of the number of researchers. The number of researchers increased from
120 to 143 and the size of the building was enlarged from 777 sq.m to 8,604 sq.m.
And this has necessitated GERI. in consultation with the Korean government. to
launch an IBRD loan project in the amount of US4.000.000 to accomplish the mission.
The loan. thus granted to GERI. was successfiully allocated to financing the
acquisition of R&D equipments necessary to fulfill the R&D projects of GERI.

1. Objective of the Project
The objective of this loan project was to procure the latest research equipment for Korea Institute
of Energy Research(KIER) to successfully carry out its assignment of technology development
in the sector of energy.
2. Scope of the Loan Applications
The project started in August 1990 and ended in June 1994.  The total loan amount made
available to the former Korea Institute of Energy and Resources was S9,600,000. A
oovemmental action in November 1991 to reorganize the Institute created two new research
organizations. In this context, the government reallocated S3,200,000 to KIER and 6,400,000 to
Korea Institute of GeoloCY, Mining and Materals(KIGAM) out of the said amount.
The loan money was not earnadced for KIER's addition of new facility construction, and the
whole was expended in purchasing research equipment and devices.

4. Conclusion and Recommendations
It is viewed that the MBRD loan project has been successfully completed, and we would like to
return our deep thanks to the Bank and the Korean government for their loan arrangements and
other cooperation. We think that the loan equipment will greatly help upgrade research
effectiveness in energy sector with reference to technology diversification and energy
conservation.
The ordained rule, when executed, of placing equipment orders through the Korean Office of
Supply (OSROK) took too long a time of delivery, sometimes, up to more than 12 months. This
would result that responsible users could not meet the need of putting them into operation in a
timely manners. It is desirable to leave to users' discretion in placing orders, say, direct orders
with suppliers, as the case may be.
It is also recommended that the Bank include an item of equipment training money so that
practical operators could learn suppliers' techniques on how to operate them prior to delivery. In
fact, the trainees, sometimes, had to go to suppliers' site for that purpose at the expense of their
own research budget. In view of a research budget constraint, we think that this pattern of
technical training for operators would be undesirable.

consultant's kind and timely assistance rendered to us in the implementation of
our project, particularly when we encountered some kind of difficulties, has
turned out to be very helpful and workable.
Thanks to his guidance and advice to the point of appropriateness, progress of
our loan project has been satisfactorily well in terms of contracting, purchas-
ing and disbursement. Now, we will glance at the implementation of our project
in several ways.
1) Project Costs
Because of split of the old KIER into the KIGAM and the KIER(new) under the
same Part D, LN 3202-K0, it is believed difficult to compare estimates and
actual costs as different from other institutions.
However, although the KIGAM project and the KIER project have both proceeded
well in schedule, it may still be useful to show a cost table as a whole,
based on the Staff Appraisal Report of April 23., 1990.
Project Costs   (US S million)
I Appraisal Estimate Actual Cost(KIGAM) Percentage
Component
Local    For'n       Local | For'n    Change of Total
KIER(old)        0.9        9.7       0.3        6.4        - 30%
M Yost of the local costs was for customs clearance fees and in-land transpor-
tation and storage fees.   Big  differences  seen in local funding cost are
believed to have come from wider ranges of duty and tax exemption and tax
decrease effected recently.

A. Objective of the Project
The purpose of the IBRD Loan Project, 3202-KO, for KIGAM, was to put a strong
spur to its efforts to beef up its research capabilities in terms of acquirement
of sufficient as well as up-to-date research equipment.
The component of the loan project valued at U.S.S 6,400,000 has provided KIGAM
with a total of 33 items of equipment, which account for about 254 of the 128
major research equipment now on hand.
In 1993 and into 1994, the 33 IBRD-funded equipment, wh-ich have all been deli-
vered and installed in time, have been untilized in a wide range in carrying out
KIGAM's  major  reseurch programs  numbering roughly 100.   For exam:le, the Gas
Isotope Mass Spectrometer, one of large equipment by the loan fund, has played a
significant role on the project, 'Determination on Stable Isotopes of Carbon and
Hydrogen in Natural Gases.'
As seen by a  factual example,  the strong  input of the  33 IBRD equipment into
KIGAM's research capabilities has, in fact, begun to bear fruit and willicon-
tinue, in the years ahead, to be of great contribution toward KIGAM's research
revitalization efforts.
B. Performance on Implementation
Throughout the project execution period from late 1990 to mid-1994, our com-
ponent of LN 3202-KO has been well in  progress,. with  international  biddings,
shipment and delivery of supplies as well as disbursements experiencing no big
difficulties.       We  would  like to mention in these  connections  that IBRD

2) Timeliness of Performance
On the whole, the KIGAM component of LN 3202-KO has shown steady progress
as scheduled although there were a couple of instances where we, had trouble
receiving disbursements in time to our Special Account. Otherwise, all
phases of the project implementation have been very much in schedule.
Following is a bar table showing each phase of the implementation planned
and drawn in late 1990, which at present in June 1994 almost come true to
the fact.

4) Technical Difficulties
No particular technical and/or managerial difficulties or shortcomings have
been undergone by the KIGAM Procurement Section throughout the implementation
period, which had full  responsibilities for the Loan Project.    There were,
however, a couple of cases where the Special Account with Korea Exchange Bank
was pressed hard for disbursement requests, while applications to IBRD for
disbursements were put in for approval and payment action. We would like to
mention in these connections again the kind and appropriate assistance and
consultations provided by the IBRD mission represented by Mr. S. Z Sung
throughout this loan implementation period.

C. Benefits from the Project
Most of the IBRD-funded equiment were brought in in 1993(one-third in 1992
2-thirds in 1993), and it is rather difficult to see tangible henefits brought
about by the IBRD equipment.
However, many of the equipment have already been utilized in research projects.
Now, we will find out about the  major, high-cost  IBRD equipment utilized in
research projects and increased number of research programs believed caused
partly by the IBRD equipment as can be seen between 1992 and 1993.
1) Utilization of the Equipment
The IBRD equipment worth more than S200,000 and effectively used in research
projects are as follows
(a) Electron Probe X-Ray Micro-Analyzer
The EPMA, which  is essential in qualitative and quantitative analysis of
various kinds of cinerals, is now of great use in the carrying out of the
research projeCt. *Metal Deposits Survey.'
(b) Electron Beaz Melting Furnace
The EB Furnace, which is used for remelting and making ingots and purifi-
cation of metals and rare metals in particular, is at present playing an
important role in the related project,  High Purity Rare Metals Develop-
ment Project.'



- 33 -
(c) Large Rock Mechanics Testing System
The system is now engaged effectively in the research activities on the
shallow and deep-lying underground rocks to identify their dynamic pro-
perties and behaviors.
(d) Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer
The ICP-MS, which has upgraded the micro-analysis from the previous ppm
or sub-ppm to ppb-ppt, is expected to contribute greatly toward the deve-
lopment of high-purity industrial materials as well as the solution of
environmental problems.
(e) Gas Isotope Mass Spectrometer
As brifly described above in the Objectives of the Loan Project, the
Spectrometer is now valuably utilized in resources exploration and geo-
chemical analysis activities.   Related research Project, Determination
on Stable Isotopes of Carbon and Hydrogen in Natural Gases.
We have just  looked at several  major IBRD equipment and their utiliza-
tion status in our research activities.   These equiment, however, along
with other IBRD  equipment,  will be  utilized more  intensively in  the
future years, showing greater. results on KIGAM's research achievement
that is'ultimately aimed at highly industrialized Korea.



-34 -
2) Enhancement in Research Activities
Many of the IBRD-funded  equipment began  to be imported in 1992, and it is
considered somewhat early to measure the effect of those research equipment
on the research  performance and achievement of KIGAM.   However, it may be
worthwhile  to see the  increasing trend in the number of research projects
during 1992-1993, if not all thanks to the IBRD equipment.

a Figures in parentheses indicate the number of projects
The increasing trend can also be seen in the sector of contract research
from the outside ; increased from 73 projects in 1992 to 81 projects in 1993.
With the passage of years, a strong thrust of the IBRD-funded research equip-
ment which accounts for about 25% of all high-cost equipment will be more
conspicuous and improve the research quality as well in the years to come.

2-4. Managerial difficulties and some suggestions
As shown in the above tables, approximately 90 % of the fund allocated was
used for the purchase of equipmernts in the year of 1992 and the project was
successfully ccmpleted 6 months earlier than expected date on the Loan Agreement
However, the limited amount of deposit in te specia! account (10%o of tota.
allocation cont-acted) concentrated on the short period had made it difficult to pay
for tNe purchase of equipments.
It can be suggested therefore that the limited amount cf deposit in the special
account be  increased  up  to 20 %  of the  total allocation  for the smooth
performance of the project
3. Benefits f.om the Project
It is ra-i,er difficult to ca!-ulate nurerically the benefits from this loan project
at present. But most of the equipments has been utilized in many R & D projectz
for the imrrovernent of the national measurement standards. Mlore particular
achievements can be evaluated in te long-term point of view.

4. Conclusion
For the improvement of the national measurement standards which plays a key
role in modem  high-tech industry aand for carrying out corresponding R &  D
activities, advanced facilities should be first equipped.
However, purchasing theses facilities requires a good deal of fund. In this
respect, we trusa the IBRD Loan Project was a great help for KPISS to fufil! its
functions of irnproving, maintaining and dissemrnnating the national measurement
standards as well as providing technical support to industry.

F. PROJECT RESULTS
Table 8. DIRECT BENEFITS OF PROJECT
a) KAIST
The 370 items of equipment for KAIST to form the cornerstone of the
laboratories and workshops for 20 academic departments, a computer center, and
joint research labs. The increase in lab equipment per professor is equivalent
to US$40,000 and US$2,200 per student. The total number of faculty increased
from 298 in 1990 to 329 in 1994.
The number of research activities sponsored by government agencies and
industry amounted to Won 32.8 billion and continues to increase. KAIST faculty
published 1,524 articles in 1993 as compared to 1,117 articles in 1990.
b) GERI
The US$4.0 million of equipment supported by the project has assisted GERI
in improving its R&D capacity.

c) KIER and KIGAM
For both KIER and KIGAM, the project has positively supported the
full range of their major activities. The 25 items of new equipment represent a
key factor in strengthening the quality of KIER's research programs, especially
in areas of new and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and methane
gas. KIGAM has improved its work on geological mapping, oil and mineral resource
surveys and the development of improved methodologies related to these
activities. R&D capacity has also been enhanced in mining technology, especially
related to coal. The 33 pieces of equipment supported by the project has
contributed to the increasing volume of research projects from Won 10 billion
(194 projects) in 1992 to Won 16.3 billion (214 projects) in 1993. In
additional, the increasing trend is also evident in the number of contract
research projects which grew from 73 in 1992 to 81 in 1993.

d) KRISS
The newly equipped laboratories have enhanced significantly the quality of
research work at KRISS in ensuring product quality, safety and environmental
standards. Its research publications increased from 294 journals in 1990 to 409
journals in 1993. Similarly, the number of patents produced also increased from
12 between 1977-1990 to 18 between 1991-1994.
