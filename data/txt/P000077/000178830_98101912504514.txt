I.  BACKGROUND
A.   Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      The People's Republic of Benin covers 112,600 km2 between
Nigeria in the east, Togo in the west, and Upper Volta and Niger in the
north; it has a southern seaboard of some 150 km and a north-south exten-
sion of about 700 km. The terrain is mostly flat or rolling except in
the north-west, where the Atacora mountains are located. The country's
river systems are important; they comprise those of the northern part
of the country (Pendjari, Mekrou, Alibori and Niger) which define most of
the borders with Upper Volta and Niger, and those of the centre and south
(Oueme, Zou, Okpara, Kouffo and Mono), the fertile floodplains of which
are areas of considerable agricultural potential but present obstacles
to east-west transport. Five natural regions can be distinguished in
Benin:
(a) a narrow coastal belt of flat sandy soil lying between
the ocean and the lagoons, typical of the West African
coast;
(b)  an intermediate zone consisting of fertile plateaux of
ferruginous silty clay, intersected by river valleys and
marshy depressions;
(c) a central zone (200-300 m above sea level) consisting
of plateaux of ferruginous sandy clays, requiring
controlled agricultural practices if the continuing
fertility of the land is to be retained;
(d)  the basement complex of the Atacora Mountains (600-800
m above sea-level) forming the watershed of the river
systems and where the Oueme, Pendjari, Mekrou and
Alibori rivers rise;
(e) the Niger plains (100-150 m above sea-level) consisting
of fertile clay soils supporting a savannah type of
vegetation.
1.02      Climatically, Benin can be divided into two zones:  the south
where two rainy seasons (May-July and September-October) provide average
annual precipitation of 1,300 mm, and the north, where a single rainy
season (July-September) averages 1,000 mm p.a.
1.03      Benin's economy has grown on the average about 4% p.a. in the
1970s, and the country remains among the poorer nations in Africa with
an estimated GNP per capita of US$230 in 1979. Natural resource endow-
ment is limited, although recent off-shore exploration for oil has
discovered a small field near Seme which, with Norwegian assistance,
will shortly enter production at an expected rate of 8,000 barrels
daily. There is also active prospecting for gold and phosphate in the
north, but none of the deposits found are as yet being commercially
exploited. The mainstay of Benin's economy remains agriculture. Since
rainfall is insufficient for high-value tree crops like coffee and cocoa,



-2-
only less remunerative crops such as palm products, cotton and groundnuts
are grown for export. Agricultural production has fluctuated in recent
years without any steady trend.
1.04      On balance, the primary sector has stagnated over the past decade.
The basic strengths of the Beninese economy are an industrious, although
insufficiently trained, workforce, skilled traders, and a reasonably ade-
quate main transport network that offers competitive transit links for
Niger and Nigeria. Between 1972 and 1976, in response to buoyant Nigerian
demand, the secondary sector showed a temporary growth of 10% and the tertiary,
over 5% p.a. Both have since returned to a status lacking growth and similar
to that of the primarv sector.
B.   Demography
1.05      Preliminary results of the population census carried out in 1979
indicate a total population for Benin of 3.3 million inhabitants. The majo-
rity (1.8 million) are concentrated in the three coastal provinces of
Atlantique, Oueme and Mono, where population density reaches 154/km2.
These provinces also have the highest proportion of urban dwellers 42.5%. 1/
The corresponding figures for the centre province of Zou are population
densities of 30 persons/km2 of which 13.5% are urban, for the northern
provinces of Borgou and Atacora 12 persons/km2 of which 11% are urban.
The annual rate of population growth since 1961, the year of the last
complete census, averaged 2.6% overall, with over 8% in the urban
and 1.3% in rural areas. The population decrease between 1977 2/ and 1979
in the Zou and Mono provinces is attributable to emigration to econom-
ically more attractive neighbouring countries such as Nigeria.
C.   Agriculture
1.06        Over 70% of the total population of Benin depend on agriculture
for their livelihood. Most work on small family farms of 1.75 to 3 ha.
Maize, sorghum, yams and cassava are the staple foods, and increasingly,
these crops (particularly maize) are being produced for sale in city and
neighbouring country markets. Traditional export crops have been palm
products, groundnuts and cotton.
1.07       Although Benin maintained a positive food balance throughout the
1970s, the official statistics suggest that foodcrop production was stagnant.
This confusing situation largely reflects the major element of unofficial
international trading in foodstuffs. Industrial crops showed a declining
trend for cotton, but increasing output of groundnut and palm products.
Irrigated crop production has been introduced recently, and can be expectd
to have an increasing effect on improving the bottomlands rice produc-
tion and the modern irrigated sugar plantation, and on the refinery being
established at Save in the Zou province. In 1979, the country imported
72,000 tons of grain, mainly wheat and rice.

mainly on CARDER data (1978/1979).
1.08      Livestock rearing is traditionally important in the north of the
country and a small net increase in cattle numbers is estimated to have
occurred during the past decade.
1.09      Fisheries outputs, traditionally a very important food item
in the south of the country, have declined in recent years, mainly due to
over-fishing in many lakes and lagoons and deterioration of the facilities
for industrial (ocean) fishing. To reverse this trend, the construction of
fish-ponds is being promoted in many rural communities; no production
statistics on this effort are available as yet.
1.10      A total of 2.1 million hectares are classified as forest, of
which the majority are in the north, with Borgou containing 64% and Atacora
29% of the total.   Some of the forest areas in the south have only recently
been formally gazetted and for most afforestation is only at a planning
stage. The main species planted is fast-growing teak for for local consump-
tion and fire'ood.
1.11      The Government has been increasingly concerned about the poor
performance of the primary sector where agriculture accounts for 70% of
employment but contributes only about one third of GNP 1/. This reflects the
fact that only 10% of agricultural land is cultivated and emphasizes the scope
for increased labor productivity throughout the sector. The Government's
objective of emphasizing investment in rural development and infrastructure
should contribute significantly to reversing this situation.

-4-
1.12     The current Three-Year National Plan (1978-1980) stresses the attain-
ment of self-sufficiency in food and to achieve this priority is being given to
agriculture and rural development investments. The principles of current
development policies are:
(a)  import substitution and the attainment of self-sufficiency in
foodstuffs, concomitant with improvement in standards of
nutrition;
(b) to stimulate the domestic market by increasing the purchasing
power of the rural population; and
(c)  to develop a dependable exportable agricultural surplus to
finance the import of manufactured goods and equipment.
Implementation of this policy for accelerating rural development requires
considerable investment in inputs, extension services and rural infrastructure.
The proposed project would make an essential contribution to this objective.
1.13      IDA has financed four projects in the rural sector.  The first,
Hinvi Agricultural Project (Cr. 144-DA, US$5.2 million, 1969), consisted
of planting 6,000 ha of oil palm, preparing 6,000 ha for annual crop
production, and constructing an oil mill. The project has been completed
and although project output has been lower than appraisal estimates, planta-
tion maintenance has been good, and strong Beninese project management is a
positive aspect.
1.14      The second project, Zou-Borgou Cotton Project (Cr. 307-BEN, US$6.1
million, 1972) performed disappointingly. During the project period, cotton
output declined drastically mainly because of Government's policy switch,
specifically to discourage cotton production and, to a lesser extent, due to
bad weather and low producer prices. However, fooderop production in the area
increased in compensation, and this trend has continued under the stimulus of
higher free market food prices relative to controlled producer prices for
cotton.
1.15      The third project, Technical Assistance (Cr. 716-BEN, US$1.7 million,
1977) has the objectives to institutionally strengthen SONAGRI and the CARDER
and to prepare proposals for future agricultural investment projects. This
project has achieved little in its institution-building objective but has been
instrumental in preparing studies for rural development projects in the
Borgou and Zou provinces.
1.16      The fourth project is a Rural Roads Project (Cr. 717-BEN, US$5.5
million, 1977), ongoing. Its purpose is to establish a feeder road planning
and construction capability in the then Ministry of Equipment, now Ministry
of Public Works), to improve some 845 km of rural roads and to maintain
another 425 km of roads improved under the Zou-Borgou project. Performance
under the project is summarized in paras. 2.05 ff.



- 5 -
1.17      The Bank is currently appraising the Government's proposal for
the Borgou Province Rural Development Project, for which roads are included
under the proposed project. The main objectives of the Borgou project are
the expansion of foodcrop and cotton production, and raising farmers' incomes
and living standards, through provision of assistance and support services,
improvement and better utilization of cotton infrastructure, mainly ginneries
and transport. The expected cost is about US$41 million, excluding feeder
road costs included in this proposed project, the rate of return is estimated
at 15-20% including feeder road costs. Preparation of a similar project for
Zou province will be completed by March 1981, but appraisal is unlikely before
1982.
D.   Transport
1.18      Transport plays a significant role in Benin's economy and conti-
nues to be an important source of foreign exchange and employment. To
remain competitive as a provider of transit facilities for Niger and Nigeria,
the country's primary transport system has been well developed and reason-
ably maintained.
1.19      The country's only international airport in Cotonou handles some
2,000 commercial flights and a similar number of other aircraft movements
annually. The yearly number of passengers (excluding transit) has fallen
from 44,000 in 1973 to 39,800 in 1978. Freight handled, on the other hand,
has increased from 2,400 tons to 3,900 tons over the same time. Air Benin
has 2 Fokker Friendship planes to provide connections to five very summarily-
equipped provincial airfields as well as to Togo, Nigeria, Niger and Upper
Volta. Benin is a member of Air Afrique, which serves as the country's
international flag carrier.
1.20      The country has a modern deep-water port built in 1965 that handles
an important share of the mainly bulk imports destined for Niger (235,000
tons in 1978 and growing) and Nigeria (263,000 tons in 1978 and declining).
Originally equipped with four general cargo berths, a jetty for bulk cargo,
a transit area with storage sheds and a fishing port with one berth and
deep-freeze storage facilities, it almost reached its estimated annual capacity
of about 500,000 tons of general cargo and the same amount of bulk cargo in
1976. To accommodate the increasing volume of transit traffic which, in 1979
accounted for almost 60% of a total volume of 1.5 million tons handled, a port
extension project involving construction of an additional 610 m of general
cargo berths with transit sheds, hardstandings, roadway, railway and services,
and the construction of a new cut-off breakwater is currently in progress.
Its total cost is estimated at US$50 million; the project is jointly fi-
nanced by IDA (Cr. 826-BEN, US$11 million, 1978) and seven other multi-
lateral and bilateral agencies. A worrisome decline in port operation
efficiency in Cotonou, only partly imputable to the construction works, and
combined with increased capacity at Lome and Lagos, has in the past two
years resulted in considerable diversion of general cargo traffic to these
last two ports.
1.21      Road services are by far the dominant form of transport.  They
are estimated to account for about 70% of domestic freight, as well as for
the bulk of domestic passenger traffic. The road sector is dealt with
in Chapter II.

II. ROADS AND ROAD TRANSPORT
A.   The Network
2.01      Benin has a road network of reasonably adequate extent.  It
consists of about 7,270 km, of which 3,500 km or just under half are
rural roads. Of the 3,770 km of interstate, national and secondary roads,
some 900 km are paved, 2,700 km are laterite-surfaced and the remainder
are earthroads. Average road density for the country is 65 m/km2 but
there is considerable variance between provinces ranging from 44 m/km2 in
Borgou to 139 m/km2 in Atlantique. It is estimated that roughly half
of the rural roads are unimproved earth-tracks which are impassable to
four-wheel traffic during most of the rainy season. A further 4,000 km
of local roads are hardly more than footpaths and are not considered
part of the network. A detailed breakdown of the distribution of roads
by province and by surface-type is given in Table 1.
B.   Road Administration
2.02      The Directorate of Roads and Bridges (Direction des Routes et
Ponts, DRP) of the Ministry of Public Works, Construction and Habitat (Mini-
stere des Travaux Publics, de la Construction et de l'Habitat, MTPCH) is
responsible for road construction and the maintenance of the 3,770 km of
interstate, national and secondary roads, and some 1,200 km of feeder roads.
While the responsibility for maintaining the remainder of the (mostly unclas-
sified) network nominally lies with the Ministry of Interior and local author-
ities, this will gradually be assumed by DRP. The Ministry, under the First
Feeder Roads Project, has created a Feeder Roads Division (Division de
Routes de Desserte Rurale, DRDR), which is now well established and has
become the focus for the hitherto uncoordinated rural roads activities.
Further, the Ministry intends to establish an Administrative Division to
improve and accelerate processing of purchases, payments, analytical ac-
counting and of other routine matters. However, staffing is a severe
constraint; this is expected to be overcome gradually as trainees under the
Third Highway and First Feeder Road Projects become fully operational, and
more are trained under the proposed Second Feeder and Fourth Highway
Projects.
C.   Road Maintenance
2.03      Maintenance of the interstate, national and secondary road net-
works is the responsibility of the Maintenance Division (Division de l'
Entretien Routier, DER) in DRP.  Main road maintenance has improved over the
years as a result of the Association's three highway projects, but is still
hampered by shortage of equipment, poor equipment maintenance and insuf-
ficient local funds. The proposed Fourth Highway Project currently under
preparation will address these shortcomings. Rural road maintenance will
have to be reorganized under the DRP since underfunded local authority
efforts have rarely been able to assure all-weather utilization of feeder
roads, and the rural road network has deteriorated to the point where less
than half of the rural communities are accessible by vehicle transport
throughout the year. The proposed project will, inter alia, provide DRP with



- 7 -
the slhort-term capacity to give financial support and supervision to labor-
intensive maintenance work carried out by workers to be drawn from the local
communities, while a new organization of road maintenance activities is being
established in conjunction with the proposed Fourth Highway Project. To
ensure continued maintenance of the improved rural road network, the Govern-
ment is currently examining possible means of raising funds for this purpose,
e.g. by including a small levy for road maintenance in the official pricing
schedules (baremes) of cash crops.
D.   Road Planning
2.04      The Directorate of Studies and Planning in the Ministry of Transport,
assisted by previous Bank projects, is responsible for data collection and
analyses of transport problems, investment plans and policies. The Ministry
of Plan makes the final decision on the investment plan to be pursued.
2.05      The First Feeder Road Project included financing for establishing a
comprehensive data base for rural road planning and for developing a metho-
dology for establishing road improvement priorities. DRDR has established a
system to collect province-level data on population, agricultural production
and social infrastructure relevant for rural road evaluation. The regional
development authorities (CARDERs) will, in the future, provide indicative road
improvement priorities to DRDR for its economic evaluation and establishment of
annual construction programs to be presented for approval to an Inter-minister-
îal Technical Committee (ITC), on which the technical ministries involved in
rural roads are represented. This process has been initiated for the three
CARDERs (Mono, Zou, and Atacora) where road improvements are currently being
carried out by DRDR and will gradually be expanded to cover the entire country.
E.   Road Engineering and Construction
2.06      The Service d-Etudes Generales is responsible for project pre-
paration and the Division of New Works for the supervision and execution of
new projects. The country lacks local contracting organizations of suffi-
cient capability for major works which are undertaken by foreign contractors.
Most projects financed by foreign aid agencies are prepared and supervised by
consultants. However, improvements to secondary roads and of feeder roads
are carried out by force account by DRP, both by equipment intensive and
labor intensive methods.
F.   Feeder Road Construction
2.07      Feeder road construction and maintenance is being actively sup-
ported to enable an increased agricultural output. The European Develop-
ment Fund (EDF) is financing a 220 km program in the Atacora province, being
carried out by an equipment-intensive brigade. The UN Capital Development
Fund (UNCDF) is financing a 120 km program in the same province. IDA's First
Feeder Road Project was the most ambitious; its objectives were:
(a) reinforcing the ability of the Ministry of Public Works
to improve motorized access to rural areas by assisting in
the creation of a Feeder Roads Division (DRDR) within
the Ministry;



-8-
(b) the establishment of a feeder road project evaluation, planning
and monitoring capability, with the aim of promoting optimal
investments for a continuing rural road improvement and main-
tenance program;
(c)  the development and implementation of appropriate rural
road construction and maintenance methods, based on care-
ful comparison of the technical and economic effectiveness
of alternative construction technologies; and
(d) the construction of about 845 km of feeder roads, and mainte-
nance of about 425 km over 3 years.
2.08      The First Feeder Road Project has succeeded, albeit at a slower
pace than anticipated at appraisal, in establishing the DRDR as a func-
tioning entity in the DRP. The slow start was mainly due to cumbersome
administrative procedures which greatly retarded the setting-up of the
new Division and delayed the start-up of road construction activities by
some eighteen months. In addition, the almost complete absence of Beni-
nese counterpart staff initially resulted in extensive reliance on tech-
nical assistance (Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick and Partners, SWKP, UK), who
will have provided a total input of 192 man-months by December 1, 1980,
58 more than foreseen at project appraisal. These difficulties were
gradually overcome and since early 1980 DRDR has been working with a full
complement of Beninese staff. Further, the DRDR has assumed responsibi-
lity for the organization and supervision of the UNCDF brigade and would
shortly take over the FED brigade currently directed by the Atacora CARDER.
2.09      Specific feeder roads were selected by the Government and agreed
upon by IDA to be included in the first of the three annual construction
programs. The second and third-year programs were indicative only, to be
finalized by the new Feeder Roads Division. Consistent selection and evalua-
tion criteria have been established for priority ranking of works being
undertaken by all brigades and the original DRDR work program has been
reshaped accordingly. Whereas institution-building thus finally shows solid
signs of success, the delays in project start and supply problems have had
very adverse effects on physical production: out of 845 km planned to be
improved, only 300 km are expected to be completed when project funds are
exhausted by mid-December 1980. The dollar devaluation, from about CFAF 245
at appraisal to CFAF 210 in 1979, has further meant a loss of about CFAF 192
million, or almost US$1 million at prevailing exchange rate. However work
is now proceeding satisfactorily. DRDR employs close to 1,000 staff and
laborers, or about 50% of the total employed by DRP. All four of the IDA-
financed brigades (2.labor-intensive, 1 intermediate, 1 equipment-intensive)
are operational on worksites in widely dispersed locations.
2.10      The appraisal of the First Feeder Road Project asserted that
rural road construction by labor-intensive methods could be economically
competitive with equipment-intensive methods. It was estimated that at
annual production rates of 45 km, 75 km and 135 km for the labor-based,
intermediate and heavily equipped brigades respectively, per-kilometer
costs of road improvements would be the same. Consequently, three dif-



- 9 -
ferent types of brigade were set up. After close to a year of operation,
output rates by the labor-based brigades are on target or have slighly
exceeded it. Intermediate brigade output has attained 70%-80% estimated
output, while heavy brigade production has been only about half that pro-
jected at appraisal. The shortfall for the intermediate brigade stems
largely from the difficulties inherent in organizing mechanized works in
conjunction with labor-intensive ones. The shortfall for the mechanized
brigade is mostly caused by problems with supply of fuel and spares. Recent
experience from mid-1979 shows, however, that these essentially admini-
strative problems have been overcome and while the original estimates may
have been optimistic, the mechanical brigade is now functioning satisfactorily
with a production rate of over 10 km/month. By contrast, labor is readily
available at the prevailing wages paid by DRDR (currently FCFA 9,867/month)
in sufficient numbers throughout the year and its productivity is good.
Since labor-based methods have thus (i) proved economically competitive,
(ii) are relatively insensitive to the supply and repair problems of the
mechanized brigades, and (iii) have the additional advantage of returning
a considerable amount of construction costs in wages to the local economies
the roads are going to serve, the DRDR will in the future reduce reliance
on equipment and expand the utilization of labor-intensive technologies.
2.11      There are three major tasks for the DRDR in the coming years:
(i) on-the-job training of the Beninese counterpart personnel to phase out
reliance on technical assistance; (ii) consolidation of the road planning
capacity and collaboration with the CARDERs, and (iii) improvement of brig-
ade outputs and the development of an appropriate maintenance organization
that will safeguard the rural road investment.
G.   Financing of Road Construction and Maintenance
2.12      Foreign sources have contributed about 85% of funds for road con-
struction over the last decade; the part of foreign participation has remained
stable in this period. Road maintenance funds are mainly local. To ensure an
adequate level of funding for road maintenance, a Road Fund was set up in
1970. CFAF 4 per liter of fuel is earmarked from the fuel tax, and the
Covernment contributes from its general revenues remaining funds to arrive
at an appropriate budget. However, funds become available only after long
delays not allowing the budget to be fully spent, and no provision is made for
equipment renewal. The Ministry of Finance has agreed in principle to deposit
quarterly the allocations in the Road Fund; this should greatly improve
liquidity. The Ministry of Works will prepare the 1981 budget including an
equipment provision, and will discuss with the Ministry of Finance whether the
fuel tax contribution, or the tax itself, should be increased. At present,
prices to consumers are CFAF 130, 127 and 104 per liter of super, regular
gasoline and diesel-oil respectively, including taxes of CFAF 30.85, 30.3 and
18.65. Alternative sources of funds for rural road maintenance are also
being explored (para. 2.03). Past expenditures on roads are summarized in
Table 2, and those of the DRDR, in Table 3.

H.   Road Transport and Road Transport Industry
2.13      Size and composition of Benin's vehicle fleet can only be approxi-
mately determined. Official statistics since 1970 have added new registra-
tions to the then existing park but do not "deregister" cars that have come
to the end of their useful lives. On the assumption of an average eight-
year vehicle life, the vehicle fleet would seem to have almost remained
stationary in numbers at about 13,000, but its composition has changed
passenger cars and pick-ups decreased from 83% (1970) to 56% (1979); light
trucks (up to 7 tons) increased their share from 7% to 25%, and heavy trucks
and trailers from 8% to 18%. Fuel consumption has grown at an average rate
of 4.5% per annum between 1970 and 1978 which is partly attributable to the
changes in vehiele fleet composition, but also indicates an increase in
vehicle utilization rates.
2.14      The road transport industry in Benin consists of a number of
semi-public and private enterprises. The most organized among these are
the state-run companies such as TRANS-BENIN, and the provincial transport
companies. Some of the large public sector companies also have a sizeable
transport fleet. To-date, most of the interstate and national transport is
still handled by private transporters. Local short distance is the domain of
small operators who own four vehicles or less.
2.15      Traffic on feeder roads comprises (a) agricultural products
destined for local and national markets; (b) agricultural inputs and con-
sumer goods flowing from centres of production or importation to the rural
areas; and (c) passengers. No systematic traffic counts have been under-
taken on feeder roads in Benin, but large variations in traffic can be
observed. Typically, feeder road traffic in Benin will vary from two or
three vehicles per day on most roads to about 40 v.p.d. in the densely-popu-
lated southern provinces. Bush taxis and "buses" (up to 2.5 ton utility
vehicles) carry passengers and small loads of produce; for major commodity
movements, 7-10 ton trucks are most commonly used. There also is consider-
able mobylette and bicycle traffic, especially in the vicinity of larger
villages and towns.
2.16      Freight and passenger tariffs are set by inter-ministerial decree
and were revised in April 1980 from their very inadequate 1974 levels, but
do still not provide transporters sufficient margins to allow for proper
equipment maintenance and renewal. 1980 freight tariffs and estimated
vehicle operating costs compare as shown in Table 4. However, private
transporters do not strictly adhere to official tariffs, and it is rather
supply and demand and road conditions which determine rates.

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives and Project Content
3.01      The objectives of the Second Feeder Roads Project are:
(a)  to continue the development of the DRDR inside the DRP
organization thus reinforcing the MTPCH's competence for
planning, construction and maintenance of the feeder road
network;
(b) to construct the roads identified as necessary for successful
implementation of the proposed IDA-financed Borgou II Rural
Development Project (about 300 km);
(c) to construct some 400 additional kilometers of priority feeder
roads, part of the Government's countrywide program;
(d) to program and carry out maintenance of all roads improved
under the Project as well as those improved under the First
Feeder Roads Project (about 300 km), the Zou-Borgou Project
(about 160 km) and the FED and UNCDF-financed roads in Atacora
Province (about 340 km);
(e) to identify and evaluate the roads necessary for successful
implementation of further rural development projects being
identified and prepared during the project period.
3.02      To these ends, the project will provide for:
(a) procurement of a limited amount of equipment and spare parts
ta continue optimal utilization of existing equipment throughout
the project period;
(b) procurement of equipment and tools for two labor-based brig-
ades;
(c) construction of two simple equipment maintenance sheds and
procurement of a limited amount of equipment maintenance tools;
(d) operation of road improvement and maintenance brigades
during a three-year period;
(e) technical assistance in operating DRDR and training DRDR
staff;
(f) implementation of a pilot monitoring and road impact study
in one province.



- 16 -
B.   Improvement Program
3.03      The road improvement program under the project will provide
construction of about 700 km of feeder roads representing 300 km in support
of the proposed Second Borgou Agricultural Development Project, and about 400
km of high-priority feeder roads in other parts of the country. Although the
first feeder road project did not meet its construction targets current
indications are that teething troubles have been overcome and production
rates of both the labor-intensive and mechanized units should be able to
substantially comply with the proposed production of 45 and 100 km per year
respectively. The proposed works consist of roadway shaping, provision of
selected surface material where required (expected on about 70% of total
length) and construction of drainage system.
3.04      The First Feeder Roads Project specified essentially uniform design
standards which have proven to be reasonably adequate. The only change
proposed for the Second Project is a reduction of platform width from 6 m
to 5 m where justified by soil conditions and projected traffic levels.
Gravelled surface width, where required, would be 4 m with gravel thickness
varying from 10 cm to 20 cm as deemed appropriate by DRDR and the consultants.
Clearing width would remain at 8-10 m and drainage would be held to a minimum
consistent wîth reasonable all-weather service. Every effort will be made to
accommodate the alignment to terrain conditions which will avoid excessive
cut or embankment work. Standards were agreed at negotiations.
3.05      Work programs have been established by the DRDR for all its opera-
tions for the first two years of the project period, representing the 1980/
81 and 1981/82 work seasons. The work program until the end of 1981 has been
approved by the ITC, and the 1981/82 program has been evaluated for presenta-
tion to the Committee. The roads were selected on the basis of either:
(i) their importance for planned or presently active agricultural projects,
or (ii) individual evaluation of economic feasibility. For the third year a
tentative program has been drawn up; in the final establishment of this
program, identical criteria and procedures will be applied. The project
would account for about 60% of all DRDR operations during the project period
(Tables 1 and 2).
C.   Road Maintenance
3.06      The Project roads will be maintained under the Project.  In addi-
tion, it will establish maintenance capabilities for the roads constructed
under the First Feeder Road Project and for those built under the FED and
UNCDF-financed feeder road projects that are underway or will start shortly.
One maintenance brigade will be established in Atacora. Equipment maintenance
facilities will be provided for within existing maintenance shops or in new
installations to be provided under the proposed Fourth Highway Project.
Additionally, mobile workshops will be provided under the proposed highway
project to provide routine field maintenance. The proposed Fourth Highway
Project will also support the Government's commitment to improve secondary
road maintenance. This maintenance work and the feeder road improvement
program will be closely coordinated by DRP.



- 17 -
D.   Technical Assistance
3.07      The technical assistance being provided under the First Feeder
Road Project will continue through the first year of the proposed project.
Whereas the first feeder road project relied heavily on technical assistance
to establish and operate the DRDR, under the Second Feeder Road project the
main object of the technical assistance is consolidation through staff
training, of procedures introduced in the DRDR under the first project, for
planning, administration, execution and supervision of works. Since all
Beninese counterparts under the first project have been in post since early
1980, phasing out of technical assistance will commence as soon as the
counterparts have received sufficient training to assume full responsibility
for their tasks; this is expected to happen about 12 months after the start
of the Project.  Training of personnel will be mainly on-the-job, but short
theoretical courses are to be provided as well. To keep technical assistance
costs at a reasonable level, a Dutch volunteer is employed in the position
of economist throughout the project period.
3.08      The technical assistance will also assist the DRDR in (i) imple-
mentation of the improvement and maintenance programs, (ii) continued
identification and economic evaluation of roads to be included in the work
programs for the third year of the Project and for subsequent years, (iii)
project monitoring, and (iv) the introduction of a project impact evaluation.
3.09      The experts  job descriptions and required qualifications for the
technical assistance, and the duration of the assignments, are given in
Annex 3. During appraisal, agreement was reached with the Government on
the content of technical assistance; this was confirmed during negotiations.
Assurances were also obtained from the Government that it will continue to
assign qualified counterparts to the technical assistance.
E.   Monitoring of Road Impact
3.10      The project planning and evaluation unit in DRDR will carry out
a program of impact monitoring on the roads improved under the First and
proposed Second Feeder Roads Projects. This will consist of regular (3-4
times annually) traffic counts and origin-destination surveys on the majo-
rity of project roads, and a more detailed investigation of population
movement, cropping patterns, marketing activities and utilization of social
service facilities for a small sub-sample of roads in one province.
F.   Execution
3.11       The MTPCH will be the executing agency for the Project.  The
three existing subdivisions of the DRDR in Mono, Zou and Atacora will be
augmented by a fourth in Bourgou which was originally established under the
First Bourgou Agricultural Project. This fourth subdivision will concen-
trate on necessary road works for the support of the Second Bourgou Agricul-
tural Development Project scheduled for board presentation in April 1981.



- 18 -
3.12      Physical execution of the Project will start in December 1980
and be completed by November 1983 (Table 3). All works will be carried out
by force account in accordance with declared Governnent policies. Occasional
plant hire may be employed for temporary replacement of equipment under repair.
3.13      Three techniques were employed under the first project, fully
mechanized, intermediate and labor-intensive. Although the fully mechanized
brigade failed to meet its construction rate target, this was primarily due
to administrative bottlenecks which have now been substantially overcome
(para. 2.08), and henceforth, a target of 100 km per year should be attain-
able. The labor-intensive units were the most successful, particularly as
the supply and quality of labor was higher than expected. Per km construc-
tion costs were comparable for the labor-intensive, the intermediate and the
fully-mechanized units. The intermediate units, although making substantial
approach to target production rates, suffer from inherent problems related to
coordinating labor-intensive techniques with relatively high equipment inputs.
To avoid this problem, while at the same time recognizing that some equipment-
intensive effort will continue to be necessary, the mechanized brigade will
continue in operation under the project, while equipment from the present
intermediate brigade will be used to (i) reinforce the mechanized brigade and
(ii) establish a maintenance brigade.
3.14      In the labor-intensive brigades, clearing, raising of formations,
shaping and initial spreading of materials will all be done by hand.
Transportation of materials, final shaping, watering and compaction will be
done by mechanized means. Based on present experience, each labor-intensive
brigade is expected to construct about 45 km of road per year. The fully-
mechanized brigade is expected to yield a yearly output of 100 km. Al-
together, one mechanized and four labor-intensive brigades will be in
operation under the Project.
3.15      Maintenance operations will essentially be done manually, with
assistance by a grader. Routine maintenance will be organized on a labor-
intensive basis as road construction works proceed. Also, a mobile grader
unit for routine grading and occasional repairs will be formed by end-1981
partly with equipment from the present intermediary brigade.
3.16      The work program for the 1980/81 work season, which is acceptable
to the Association, has been approved by the ITC. The 1981/82 program, duly
prepared by the DRDR and agreed to by the ITC, will be submitted to the
Association for its approval not later than June 1, 1981. The DRDR will
continue evaluation of roads to be included in the Project for the 1982/83
work season (October to June), for presentation to the Inter-ministerial
Technical Committee (ITC) which was set up under the first project, and to
the Association, for approval (Table 1).
G.   Procurement
3.17      The majority of equipment purchased or rehabilitated under the
first project will remain in service throughout the Second Feeder Road
Project. Supplementary equipment will be required to (i) replace worn-out



- 19 -
equipment; (ii) equip the two additional labor-intensive construction
brigades and the maintenance brigade. The Project also provides for the
purchase of materials (steel, cement and timber) for construction of drain-
age structures and for spare parts and supplies such as fuel, lubricants,
tires and office supplies.
3.18      Equipment and vehicles for the new brigades will be purchased in
accordance with the Association international competitive bidding guidelines
utilizing bidding documents and detailed specifications prepared under the
first project. Replacement items and supplementary equipment of which the
DRDR already possesses some units will also be purchased in accordance with
international competitive bidding guidelines, but bidding documents will
note that for this equipment, additional weight will be given to the desir-
ability of standardization with existing equipment. Rand tools will be
acquired under current Government local procurement regulations which are
deemed acceptable. Goods manufactured locally would be given a preference
margin up to 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever, is less. Table 4
lists equipment to be purchased. Fuel, construction materials and supplies
will be purchased through Government distributors, free of tax. During
negotiations, confirmation of these purchasing procedures was obtained from
Government.
H.   Cost Estimates
3.19      The total cost of the Project, net of taxes and duties, is esti-
mated at US$8.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of US$4.3
million equivalent. As was the case for the First Feeder Roads Project,
all Project acquisitions, with the exception of office supplies and mate-
rials, will be made free of taxes. Below follows a summary of costs; more
details are given in Table 5.
Net of Tax Costs, as of May 1980
US$ thousand            of Foreign
Local     Foreign      Total        Cost
A.  Feeder Road Improvement         3,008.3      2,231.2    5,239.5        42.5
B.  Feeder Road Maintenance           382.4        347.3       729.7       47.5
C.  Sheds and Tools                    11.7         27.3        39.0       70.0
D.  Technical Assistance               163.9       929.8    1,093.7        85.0
Sub-total                   3,566.3      3,535.6    7,101.9
E.  Contingencies                     904.4        738.1    1,642.5
Total                        4,470.7     4,273.7    8,744.4        48.9
3.20      Estimates of equipment and tool costs are based on suppliers'
quotations to the DRDR from April/May 1980. Operating costs are based on the
latest available cost accounting data of the DRDR, dating from April 1980.



- 20 -
Average cost of road improvement, excluding tax and technical assistance,
is CFAF 1.9 million per km (US$9,300 per km) at April 1980 prices. In-
cluding all technical assistance, this cost rises to about CFAF 2.3 million
(US$11,200 per km).
3.21      Technical assistance is estimatd to cost US$l.1 million equivalent
and is assumed provided by a consulting firm. It will total about 10 man-
years of engineers and senior technicians. The average man-month cost
is estimated at US$10,200 including fees, outstation allowance, local and
international transport, housing and subsistence, and company overheads and
profits, and is based on present cost of providing consulting services in
Benin. In addition, three man-years of economist's time will be provided by
Dutch volunteer aid. There is a possibility that Dutch volunteer aid may
replace some senior technicians, leading to a reduction in the cost of
technical assistance; this is being pursued with the Government.
3.22      Physical contingencies of 5% on equipment purchases and 10% on
other items have been included to allow for increase in quantities. Price
increases are estimated at 10.5% in 1980, 9.0% in 1981, 8.0% in 1982 and
7.0% in 1983.
I.   Financing and Disbursement
3.23      The proposed credit of US$7.0 million equivalent will finance
about 80% of total Project cost, net of taxes and duties, i.e., all foreign
costs (US$4.3 million equivalent) and US$2.7 million equivalent of local
costs. The remaining local costs of the Project, US$1.7 million equivalent,
will be financed by the Government. During negotiations, confirmation
of this commitment was obtained from the Government. The disbursement
of credit funds will be on the following basis:
(i)  100% of expenditures for equipment, tools, spares, fuel
and lubricants;
(ii) 60% of wage cost incurred by the DRDR in Project execu-
tion;
(iii) 70% of office supply costs and equipment repair and hire
charges;
(iv) 90% of the cost of technical assistance.
3.24      Expenditures to be financed in the period between exhaustion of
funds under the First Feeder Roads Project and signature of the Second Feeder
Roads Project for the cost of operating field brigades and the DRDR head
office will initially be financed by the Government. To this end, the Govern-
ment will establish an advance account in the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement
(CAA), to which the sum of US$175,000, estimated to cover one months operating
cost of DRDR, will be deposited monthly starting December 15, 1980. During



- 21 -
negotiations, the Government and the Association agreed on retroactive
financing of these expenditures up to an amount of US$0.7 million. Expendi-
tures on technical assistance during this period will be made with funds from
the Second Highway Project (CR. 415-DA). Requests for disbursements against
all items will be fully documented. Any funds remaining undisbursed at
the end of the Project would be cancelled. Estimated disbursements are
given in Table 6.
3.25      An IDA revolving fund of US$300,000 equivalent will be established
as under the First Project; it will be replenished on the basis of the
regular Government reimbursement applications.
J. Project Control - Financial Auditing and Progress Reporting
3.26       To provide the Government with appropriate control over expen-
ditures and the relationship between costs and physical progress of the
project, a basic accounting and progress reporting system will be estab-
lished as part of the Project's management routines. Auditors acceptable to
the Government and the Association will be employed to ensure the Project's
adherence to good financial management through regular audits of DRDR's
accounts as prepared for submission to Caisse Autonome in support of re-
quests for replenishment of the Revolving Fund. Presently employed physical
progress reporting procedures will be consolidated to relate directly to the
accounting records so as to provide management information on comparative
costs and related information in connection with the construction and
maintenance of the Project roads.
3.27       The Association and the Government agreed at negotiations on the
extent and detail required in the accounting, auditing and progress reporting
material.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Benefit Estimation
4.01      The proposed project will finance a three-year slice of a longer-
term feeder road improvement program the realization of which is a neces-
sary, although not in itself sufficient, condition for increasing agricul-
tural production and improving the level of living of the rural population
in Benin.  While a firm construction program for the first two years of the
project has been evaluated, it is understood that road improvement priori-
ties for the second and later years may change, if changes in regional
development projects so dictate. To be included in the investment program,
a road must have a minimum estimated economic rate of return of 10%, estab-
lished in accordance with the methodology used for evaluating the original
program.
4.02      The roads to be improved under the project essentially support
local agricultural or rural development actions and schemes. In some of the
CARDERs they are part of integrated rural development projects financed by
IDA; in others they will support and complement development efforts financed
by regional authorities or other agencies. Since project benefits are
therefore practically everywhere attributable jointly to agricultural and
road improvements, the economic evaluation of the feeder road improvement
program has been based on estimated producer surplus (PS) or net incremental
value added (NIVA).
4.03      To establish producer surplus "without" and "with" the road
improvement and other investments, the following procedure has been employed:
(a) population in the road-influence area (RIA) (5 km to
each side of the road, unless geographical obstacles
indicate otherwise) is established from the 1979
census;
(b) present (without-project) value of production is estimated
based on provincial averages developed from production
statistics established by the Ministry of Rural
Development;
(c) "without the project" agricultural production is assumed to
remain at the traditional level (i.e. little change in
production technologies) and increase only at the rate
population increases;
(d)  "with the project" two different sets of assumptions are
applied depending on whether the RIA is a densely or
sparsely populated area. The latter is defined as popu-
lation being less than 350 inhabitants per km of road
or per 10 km2 of RIA. For densely populated areas,
adoption of improved agricultural technologies will
result in production increases above previous levels,



- 31 -
and the road will ensure that all of the surplus above
farmers' subsistence needs can find its way to the
market reliably and at reasonable cost. For sparsely
populated areas of good agricultural potential, the
same assumptions apply; but in addition, a larger than
average population increase in the RIA is postulated
up to the point when 350 inhabitants/km or road are
attained. There is thus a second part of incremental
production in the RIA due to road-induced population
growth. It is assumed that migrants will come from
among those who would otherwise have left areas of
population pressure on the land for the cities, where
employment prospects are scarce.
4.04      While it would be correct and desirable to include road user
savings on non agriculture-related traffic, traffic data for rural roads in
Benin are presently so uncertain that it is considered prudent to omit this
component. However, for each of the roads evaluated, an estimate of future
traffic based on expected surplus marketed from the RIA is established. The
proposed program of impact monitoring under the project (para. 3.10) will
establish traffic and transport cost levels connected with both agricultural
and other activities on a representative sample of project roads and endeavor
to establish the distribution of road user savings between producers, trans-
porters and consumers.
4.05      For the roads included in the first and second year construc-
tion program, economic rates of return were thus estimated on the basis of
net incremental value added only, and assuming a ten-year project life.
Besides the quantified benefits derived from increased crop production for
the market, some 175,000 rural inhabitants will benefit from better access
to administrative and social services, and will thus be more effectively
integrated into the regional and national community.
4.06      Greater reliance on labor-intensive construction methods will
provide a larger number of communities, from which labor is drawn, with
the cash-earnings that will allow farm households to pay for the improved
agricultural tools and inputs needed for more intensive exploitation of
their lands. The economy as a whole will benefit from foreign exchange
savings on reduced grain imports and higher foreign exchange earnings on
increased production of traditional export crops such as cotton and groundnuts.
B.   Costs
4.07      The road construction and maintenance costs used in the economic
evaluation are based on the actual costs of operating equipment and employing
labor experienced under the first project updated to August 1980, net of
taxes. No shadow pricing of local labor was applied, since there are alter-
native, if somewhat less well remunerated, employment opportunities in
local agriculture. The costs of improved agricultural technologies are taken
into account in the estimates of net incremental producer surplus. They include



- 32 -
the estimated cost to the farmers of ox-drawn cultivation and more intensive
use of modern inputs; Government subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides;
and an estimate of the incremental capital costs associated with higher input
use and improved extension services.
C.   Rates of Return and Risks
4.08       0f the 470 km of roads retained in the program through individual
economic evaluation, 24% show ER between 10% and 14%, 41% between 15% and
24%, and 35% in excess of 25% (Table 1).  An additional 312 km of roads in
Borgou province have been justified as part of the proposed Borgou Rural
Development Project II.  Preliminary estimates indicate an economic return of
this project of about 18%. The overall economic rate of return for the
project as a whole is estimated at 19%, neglecting any salvage value of the
roads after the 10-year evaluation period.
4.09      There are three major areas of risk which may prevent the project
from realizing the anticipated level of benefits:
(a)  the quality of road maintenance after construction is
completed;
(b)  the level of producer prices set by Government for diffe-
rent agricultural products and their competitiveness with
those prevailing in neighboring countries; and
(c)  adequate supply of agricultural inputs and extension
services.
4.10      Since the project includes an initial maintenance component and
technical assistance for developing appropriate maintenance procedures,
and Government is in the process of establishing new sources of financing
for rural road maintenance (para. 2.03), the first risk should not be a
serious one. After several years of stagnating producer prices (which
resulted in a considerable volume of illegal product sales to Nigeria and
Togo where higher market prices prevailed), the Government of Benin has, in
the past year, increased producer prices for cotton, maize and rice, and
implicitly accepted "free" local market prices for fooderops. There is thus
some movement in the direction of providing price incentives to farmers.
Adequate supplies of inputs and appropriate extension support will be provided
at least in some of the CARDERs through proposed rural development projects,
although they may remain deficient in some regions. On the whole, therefore,
the risks associated with the project are acceptable.
4.11       Sensitivity of estimated ERs to cost increases or shortfalls in
benefits has been tested: a 20% increase in road construction costs would
reduce the ER to 16%; a 20 % shortfall in benefits would drop the ER to 15%;
the combination of the cost increase and benefit shortfall would still leave
the project viable with an ER of 12%. The ER would fall below ten percent--
the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Benin--if road construction costs
increased by 65% or benefits decreased by 41%. If benefits lagged by one year,
the most likely rate of return to the project would fall from 19% to 14%.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations the following items were discussed and agreed
upon with the Government:
(a) design standards to be employed in feeder road improvement
and construction works (para. 3.04);
(b)  job description and qualifications required for the techni-
cal assistance (para. 3.09);
(c) continued assignment by the Government of qualified Beni-
nese staff to the DRDR (para. 3.09);
(d)  timely submission of annual work programmes for the
Association's approval (para. 3.16);
(e) procurement procedures for equipment and supplies (para.
3.18);
(f) Government's commitment to provide local funds (paras. 3.23
and 3.24);
(g) retroactive financing (para. 3.24); and
(h) accounting, auditing and progress reporting (para. 3.27).
5.02      As agreement has been reached and confirmed with the Government
on the items mentioned in para. 5.01, the proposed Project would be suitable
for a Credit to the People's Republic of Benin in the amount of US$7.0
million on standard IDA terms.

ANNEX 1
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
POPULATION DATA FOR PROJECT EVALUATION
1.        Many of the rural roads to be improved under the project will
open up hitherto sparsely settled areas with good agricultural potential
for settlement. "Without" and "with" road population growth estimates are
therefore an important parameter of road benefit estimation. This annex
summarizes the population data and assumptions used in the economic evalua-
tion of the project.
2.        During the past twenty-year period, two population censuses were
carried out in Benin: the first in 1961, the second in 1979. In between,
a number of sample censuses were undertaken but their reliability is less
good. Table 1 below shows province-by-province population g&owth rates
for the 1961-79 inter-censal period and compares them to the presumed
growth rates indicated by mid-period sample censuses. Overall, the popula-
tion of Benin has increased at a rate of 2.6% p.a. between the two offi-
cial censuses but there is considerable variance around the mean in the
different provinces (lowest: 1.7% in Zou, highest: 4.6% in Atlantique
which includes the major city Cotonou). The apparent population losses
in some provinces between 1977-79 are at least in part due to over-estima-
tion in the 1977 data. The global trends, however, which show a loss
from the centre to the southern regions and a close to average growth in
the north are consistent with observation.

3.        As is true for most developing countries, Benin has experienced
sharply different growth rates between urban and rural populations. Table
2 compares urban population in 1961 and 1979, taking into consideration
the change in localities classified as "urban" in the respective years.
Since the administrative definition of the "urban" group includes many
households who depend on agriculture for their livelihood and whose consump-
tion patterns differ very little from those of the inhabitants of "rural"
areas, an attempt was made to distinguish the "truly" urban (i.e. non-agri-
cultural-dependent) population from the total living in urban districts.

ad (c)    1961 as (a).  1979 as (b) minus estimated proportion of
population living in urban districts, but depending on
agriculture (cf. Annex, Table 1).
For the purpose of the present project evaluation, it is thus assumed that
the rural population has grown from 1,896,000 in 1961 to 2,375,000 in 1979.
This implies an average annual rural growth rate of 1.26%. Table 3 below
gives urban/rural population growth rates by province, based on estimate (c)
of urban population.

4.         It is these provincial averages of rural population growth that
are used in establishing "without" and "with" road population development in
the influence area of the roads evaluated for inclusion into the annual
improvement programs. A distinction is made between sparsely and densely
populated areas. The former are defined as road bands (5 km each side of
the road) with a population of less than 350 persons per km of road (or, at
an average size of household of seven persons, of less than 50 households
per 10 km2 of road influence area), which implies that about 10% of the
available land area is cultivated. Where population density is between
350/km and 700/km, growth is assumed to take place at the provincial average.
Areas with more than 700 persons/km are assumed to remain stationary. In
sparsely populated areas of good agricultural potential, population is
assumed to grow disproportionately: one family of 7 persons per km of road
improved will move into the road influence area in the year following
reconstruction; subsequently, population will grow at 2.6% p.a. until 350
persons per km of route are attained. At that point growth will decline to
the provincial norm in annual decrements of 0.2%.

2.        To estimate project benefits assumptions have to be made con-
cerning:
(a) production increases achievable in the RIA as a function of:
(i) increases in area cultivated
(ii) increases in yields
(iii) reduction of on-farm losses
(b) size and marketability of surplus produced in the RIA, as a
function of:
(i) the amount of self-consumption
(ii) market accessibility throughout the year
(iii) the price obtainable by producers for surplus production
in local/regional/national/international markets.
3.        To take into account all relevant project costs, it is necessary
to establish:
(a) the incremental costs of improved production technologies; and
(b) the cost of providing market access, i.e. of constructing the
road and maintaining it throughout its life (10 years).
Assumptions Concerning Production Increases in RIA
4.        In changing from subsistence farming to production for the market,
the Beninese peasant farmer's first option is to increase area under crop
since cultivable land is not yet a scarce factor in most places. Statistics
on area cultivated per head of rural population (cf. Agriculture Annex
Table 1, Project File) show a consistent value of 0.3 ha/rural inhabitant in
the south; a high 0.45 ha/rural inhabitant in the center and a low 0.25
ha/rural inhabitant in the north. At prevailing (traditional level) yields,
the 0.25 ha cultivated per inhabitant in the north suffices to assure food
self-sufficiency (at 217 kg grain equivalent per person p.a.), whereas the
higher figures in the center and south indicate some surplus production for
the market. This is made possible by the existence of two cropping seasons
over which labor inputs can be spread, whereas in the north available family
labor is the main constraint on the amount of land a farmer can cultivate in
a single crop-season.

5.        To alleviate the labor constraint a change in production techno-
logy has to take place. The most feasible for Benin is adoption of animal
traction, which is already being introduced by farmers in the north where
cattle raising is an important traditional activity, while it is being more
slowly adopted in the south of Benin. The economic evaluation assumes
increased adoption of animal traction by farmers living near improved roads
who will most benefit from improved extension services promoting new tech-
nologies, and who will have assured access to market for any surplus produc-
tion. Adoption rates will be lower in the south than in the north; they are
assumed to vary by province as shown below.

by year 10
Borgou     >   50% of all RIA farmers will have adopted
Atacora    )             by year 10
6.        Adoption of animal traction will allow farmers to extend their crop
areas by about 15% overall.  Conservatively, it is assumed that farmers will
continue with their established cropping patterns, and devote a similar
number of their own labor days to the cultivation of each crop as they did
traditionally. (Table 7 of the Agricultural Annex in the Project File
details comparative labor-day inputs per hectare and crop for traditional and
animal-drawn cultivation, and the estimated increase in area planted to each
crop which was used in the analysis).
7.        In addition to extension of area under cultivation, CARDER efforts
to promote modern inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and improved seeds
are expected to result in increases in yields. Table 1 below summarizes the
assumptions retained for estimated crop yield increases, the time period over
whieh they are expected to be attained as well as associated input costs to
adopting farmers in the six provinces.  Yield increases have been conserva-
tively estimated at only about a third of yields achieved in research in
Benin or neighboring countries. Full potential for most of the traditional
foodcrops is expected to be reached over a five-year period, while for cash
crops fully improved yields are assumed to be achieved--in equal annual
increments--over a ten-year period only. Incremental costs associated with
modern input use include the cost to the farmer of animal traction, fertilizer
and pesticides; Government subsidies on the latter, an annual amount of FCFA 500/ha
cropped, over the full project period, to account for increased extension
service coverage, and FCFA 1000/ha cropped, in years 1-3 of the project
period, to account for the estimated costs of capital investments associateG
with the provision of larger quantities of modern inputs and improved seeds.

8.        Based on 1978/79 volumes of agricultural production and prices, a
value of agricultural production per rural inhabitant was estimated for each
of the six provinces (cf. Tables 3-4, Agricultural Annex in Project File).
Assuming annual per capita consumption of some 217 kg of grain equivalent per
person, 1/ the shares of production needed for self consumption and available
for marketing were also established for each province (cf. Agricultural Annex
Table 6 in Project File). These are summarized below:

9.        "Without the project" agricultural production technology in the
RIAs would remain virtually unchanged, since neither extension services nor
modern inputs would be able to reach most of the farmers in the absence of
improved access. The growth rate of agricultural production is therefore
assumed to equal the rate of population growth in the RIA. What little
marketable surplus may be produced often cannot be sold for lack of access to
markets.
10.       "With the project," a certain percentage of farmers (cf. para. 5
above) are expected to gradually adopt improved production technologies 2/
and to increase the share of their production for the market, which will
have become accessible the year-round at a significantly lower cost than
previously. Total incremental volume and value of production in the road
influence area is estimated as a function of differential population growth
in the road influence area, of improved technology, and of higher shares of
marketable surplus actually marketed; the latter are a function of access
road condition and, in general, are assumed to vary as follows:
1/   cf. "West African Foodgrain Study," IBRD Report No. 1252-WA, 1976,
Table 1.5.
2/   For province-by-province estimates of incremental producer surplus
per rural inhabitant due to adoption of improved technology over years
1-10 after road completion see Table    , Agricultural Annex, in Project
File.

E.   Passable by 4-wheel drive vehicle
in dry weather, impassable in wet
weather; new construction required                    20
11.       To establish the net incremental value added (net return to land
and labor) "with the project" the incremental costs associated with higher
input use, better extension, etc. are subtracted from the sum of incremental
self-consumption and of production marketed, both valued at local market
prices which, in the absence of official prices, are considered as producer
prices. Net incremental value added or producer surplus is then compa;rcd c.o
the cost of constructing the road and maintaining it over a ten-year period
to determine the economic rate of return to the road and agricultural package.
12.       Producer surplus is thus based on province-level data for the
population and agriculture parameters used in the analysis. These present a
considerable improvement on the national averages, on which the First Feeder
Road Project appraisal had to rely. But additional refinement of the data
base is necessary to more closely reflect production conditions in the
various ecological sub-regions of the country. Work on this is currently
ongoing as part of the final establishment of next year's annual construction
program; it will be further intensified--especially with regard to traffic
and transport cost data in rural areas--as part of the monitoring and road
impact study foreseen under this project.

SECOND FEEDER ROAD PROJECT
Technical Assistance to the DRDR
1.        The DRDR will continue to require considerable technical assistance
during the initial year of the project period, after which the Beninese staff
in post would gradually take over operational responsibility.  Since the tech-
nical assistance is a considerable additional expense to the Project, bilateral
voluntary aid is being solicited for the provision of specialists to the DRDR.
One economist has been obtained from Dutch voluntary assistance for two years,
and Dutch voluntary aid is actively trying to recruit additional staff to the
DRDR; if this effort is successful, it would diminish the Project's require-
ments for technical assistance, which at present stand as follows:

work programs in close cooperation with the chief of the
DRDR;
(iii) supervise the consolidation of adequate accounting and
reporting procedures;
(iv) supervise, in detail, the on-the-job training being provided
by other members of the technical assistance team to their
Beninese counterparts, and draw up theoretical training
courses of short duration as required for the Beninese staff
in view of experience with the on-the-job training.
Qualifications:
Civil Engineer (minimum 10 years professional experience, with
experience in (i) planning, construction and supervision of
