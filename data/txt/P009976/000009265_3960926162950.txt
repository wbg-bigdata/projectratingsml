MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION LIMITED (INDIA)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF INDIA, ACTING BY ITS PRESIDENT
FOR A HOUSING FINANCE IROJECT
1.       The follow.ng memorandum and recoinendation on a proposed loan to the
Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (India) with the guarantee of India,
acting by its President, for US$250 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20 year. maturity including
a five year grace period and will support a housing finance project.
2.       Background.  The project assists development in the housing and finance
sectors in India. To help meet the vast housing demand, it would facilitate
construction which has been constrained by lack of housing finance. At the same
time, by supporting the innovative efforts of the Housing Development Finance
Corporation (HDFC) to make mortgage financing available at market rates, the pro-
ject would be consistent with orderly liberalization of the capital markets.
3.       Housing investment in India hag declined as a share of gross domestic
product (GDP) from 5% in the late 1960s to 3% at present, despite continued rapid
growth in urban populations and incomes. A critical factor has been government
policy to direct credit to 'pricrity' sectors like industry and to public
enterprises, and to effectively ration out borrowers like households. Public
housing programs have been very limited, heavily subsidized and, frequently,
poorly designed to make the best use of real resources.
4.       The relative decline of housing investment has coincided with a stagnat-
ing share of savings in all financial assets, and a generally inefficient financial
system. The Government is currently moving to deregulate the highly centralized
capital markets and increase competition for funds through less directed credit.
However, the transition period is likely to be difficult, and new sectors like
housing finance may be in a disadvantaged position. Growth of market-oriented
housing finance could help mobilize resources from households for the financial
system, as well as increase investment in housing, the nations's single largest
form of wealth.
5.       With growing acceptance that urban development is an important part of
economic development, the Government of India (GOI) has made urban housing a
priority under the Seventh Plan. The GOI now maintains that: (a) private housing
finance is crucial for meeting the housing demand; (b) public spending should focus
on providing sites and services for lower income groups; and (c) public policy
should reduce regulatory disincentives for the private sector to participate in land
and housing development. In order to foster growth of housing finance within
changing capital markets, there is an apparent need for an enabling regulatory
environment where the recently created National Housing Bank (NHB) should play a
central role. It is still being debated if NHB's primary emphasis would be as an
apex source of directed credit or as a regulator of a diversified sector. The
latter function would be more conducive to competitive housing finance and the
entry of new institutions necessary for establishing a national mortgage market.
The proposed loan would encourage a more market-oriented function for NHB.

6.       HDFC is the only significant private housing finance company in India.
Founded in 1978, with the active participation of IFC, it hcs provided long-term
housing finance at market rates to the largely unserved middle-income group; 352 of
beneficiaries earn below the urban median income. The lending program has grown at
over 352 a year to finance about 50,000 units in 1987; the average loan of Re.
40,000 (about US$3,000) covers about 45Z of the total housing cost. Currently,
HDFC's average cost of funds is 11.62 overall and 12.52 for long-term borrowings,
and its average interest income is 14.1% on outstanding loans. Without a supportive
environment, RDFC has cultivated productive niches in the capital market, and
maintained strong profits of over 202 on net worth, low arrears and a near balance
in the maturity of assets and liabilities. While its extraordinary early growth
will slow, HDFC will .emain a driving force fc; competitive housing finance.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Housing finance issues are being discussed
broadly for the first time in India, and HDFC is a well-functioning institution
prepared to advance market-oriented initiatives and standards. Providing Benk
support to this new sectoral approach, during a period of change and increased
competition in the capital markets, helps stabilize HDFC's short-term program and
ability to expand service geographically and develop new mortgage instruments for
lower-income lending. At a key point in the Government debate, the project helps
HDFC underscore the viability of the market-oriented alternative versus traditional
approaches of more directed credit. Given the size of its program and HDFC's
current role in housing finance sector policie,, it is appropriate that the Bank
become involved. Consistent with the Bank's financial sector goals for India, the
project supports more efficient and equitable financing patterns.
8.       Project Objectives.  The main project objectives include:  (a) support of
HDFC's lending in a period of transition in the capital markets in order to extend
the benefits of market-oriented housing flnance to a wider geographical area and to
a broader group of middle and lower-income beneficiaries; (b) further institutional
development of HDFC's roles as an innovator and advocate of market-oriented finance,
and as sector leader assisting the entry and development of similar institutions;
and (c) development of a supportive regulatory framework to promote the financial
integrity of housing finance institutions and their capacity to mobilize resources
at market rates.
9.       Project Description.  The proposed project finances about 70,000 mortgages,
equalling a maximum 30% of HDFC's mortgage lending program over a 3-1/2 year period
(including six months of retroactive financing). HDFC will legally bear the
exchange risk of the loan, and current projections indicate it is capable of doing
so. However, since its operations are handled entirely in local currency, HDFC is
making financial arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, to cover the exchange
risk. In the context of sector development, the loan would be eligible for
disbursement in two tranches. The condition for the first traniche, initiation of a
regulatory environment for housing finance, has been met through the creation of
NHB, and US$150 million would be available when the project is mliade effective. The
second tranche for the remaining US$100 million is planned for early 1990,
conditional on: (a) the implementation of regulations, si .isfactory to the Bank, to
ensure the fiduciary responsibility of housing finance companies and to promote
competi)ive resource mobilization in the sector; and (b) submission to the Ministry
of Finance of recommendations by a sitting committee, representing diverse interests
in the sector, on measures to reduce mortgage credit risk. Technical assistance
supports HDFC's institutional development, branching to new geographical areas and
development of new mortgage instruments, particularly for lower-income groups. The



project also supports HDFC's own technical assistance to other emerging housing
finance corporations for establishment of procedures and control systems. The .otal
cost of the project is estimated to be US$840.8 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$1.1 million. The cost table and financing plan are shown
in Schedule A; the procurement and disbursement schedules in Schedule B; a timetable
of key project processing events in Schedule C; and the status of Bank Group
operations in India in Schedule D. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report No.
7081-IN, dated January 19, 1988, are also attached.
10.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the tranche conditions
referred to above. HDFC has agreed on the following actions; (a) utilization of at
least 50% of the loan proceeds to benefit households with income below the urban
median; (b) continuation of the financial covenants agreed with IFC (a maximum
debt/equity ratio of 17.5 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 1.2), as well
as limitation of administrative costs to not more than 1.5% of outstanding loans,
and of arrears over 12 months to not more than 0.4% of outstanding loans; (c) in
lieu of mortgage insurance, maintenance of a provision for contingencies equal to at
least 0.4% of outstanding loans; (d) confirmation to the Bank of branching plans at
the beginning of each fiscal year; and (f) finalization of plans, by June 1989, to
broaden lending to lower-income borrowers.
11.      Benefits.  As the lead agency in the sector, HDFC is expected to extend the
benefits of market-oriented housing finance through its own expansion of branching
and lending to lower-income groups, and through the promotion of similar
companies. The development of sector policy is expected to allow more competition
in the financial markets, ':ith households gaining greater opportunity to bid for
resources; to encourage more savings in financial assets; and to promote a greater
variety of housing finance services with lower risks and lower costs. The economic
rate of return (ERnR) for urban housing investments is estimated to be betwecn
20-30%. The project would finance mortgages for about 70,000 households, with at
least 50% of the Bank loan benefitting households with income below the urban
median.
12.      Risks.  Given HDFC's record, there is little institutional risk associated
with its ability to disburse the loan or meet the project covenants. Although there
is some risk that the implementation of the conditions relating to sector
development could be delayed by political or economic considerations, the project is
designed to be consistent with policy developments underway by GOI. Intentionally,
the loan disb'irsement is based on HDFC's ability to mobilize at least 70% of its
resource requirements; the loan cannot be drawn down as projected unless the sector
enjoys an enabling environment where funds can be raised competitively at market
rates. The project supports the emergence of such an environment.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.

1/ IDA Credit amounts for SDR-denominated Credits are expressed in terms of their
US dollar equivalents, as established at the time of Credit negotiations and as
subsequently presented to the Board.
2/ Undisbursed amounts for SDR-denominated IDA Credits are derived from cumulative
disbursements converted to their US dollar equivalents at the SDR/US dollar exchange
rate in effect on September 30, 1987, while original principal is based on the exchange
rate in effect at negotiations. This accounts for the fact that in some cases, the
undisbursed balance as shown in US$ equivalcnt is higher than the original principal.
