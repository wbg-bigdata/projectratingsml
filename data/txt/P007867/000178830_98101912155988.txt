APPRAISAL OF RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I.   GENERAL
1.01      The Paraguayan Government has requested Bank financing for a
proposed rural water supply and waste disposal project. The estimated cost of
the works is US$9.7 million and a Bank loan of US$6 million is proposea to
finance 100% of the foreign exchange requirements, including interest during
construction. The loan would be made to the Republic of Paraguay. The
execution time for the project would be four years. This would be the first
Bank Group financial operation in this sector in Paraguay.
1.02      The executing agency will be SENASA, a specialized department of the
Ministry of Public Health, which prepared the project with the assistance of
the Pan American Health Organization (WIHO/PAHO).
II.   THE SECTOR
A.   Background
2.01      Paraguay is a landlocked country situated approximately in the
center of South America (see attached map), bordered by Brazil and Argentina
on the east, south 2and west and by Bolivia on the north. The country, with an
area of 406,700 km , has vast areas of unutilized lands well suited for
agriculture or livestock.
2.02      Estimated population in 1976 was 2.6 million, of which 37% (some
960,000) was urban and 63% (approximately 1,640,000) was rural. The census
defines urban population as the population of all municipal districts (cabece-
ras municipales) with 100 inhabitants or more; the remaining population is 2
considered rural.  The average population density is 5.8 inhabitants per km
one of the lowest on the continent. This density is even lower in the western
region, El Chaco, where there are only 0.3 inhabitants per square kilometer.
The average annual rate of population growth is 2.6%, with 3% in Asuncion and
2.4% elsewhere.
2.03      The country, divided administratively into 19 Departments, has
161 towns or medium size cities, excluding Asuncion, with more than 100
inhabitants. Distribution of urban population on the basis of 1972 census is
as follows:

Population Range               No. of Towns       Inhabitants      Urban Population
100 -   4,000                  134              191,700             21.8
4,000 - 100,000                   27              296,100             33.6
100,000 - 500,000                    1              392,800              44.6
Totals                        162              880,600            100.0
2.04      Recognizing its enormous hydroelectric potential, largely on the
Parana river which forms its eastern and southern borders, Paraguay has
reached agreements with its neighboring countries for joint international
development of these resources by undertaking several large hydroelectric
projects. Construction operations to exploit its water resources together
with the recent rapid expansion of land under cultivation have resulted
in increased economic activity, expanded investment in infrastructure
and new patterns of population migration and settlement in the country.
2.05      The effect of increased economic activity is reflected in the
recent growth of per capita income from 1.2% p.a. for the 30-year period
before 1972, to an annual 5.8% during 1972-76. Per capita GNP for 1975
at market prices is estimated at US$570, which is still one of the lowest in
South America.
2.06      The implementation of major land reform and colonization programs by
the Government and the construction of new hydroplants have placed heavy
burdens on the relatively poor existing infrastructure (transport, education,
health, etc.). The Paraguayan Government has already identified this problem
and intends to improve and extend basic facilities in order to guarantee
continued economic development and productive investment by new settlers.
B.   Sector Development
2.07      Sector development has been slow.  The first water supply system
came into operation in 1959 to serve part of the city of Asuncion. Until 1963
it was the only one in existence. Since then, this system has been expanded,
and a program financed by the IDB to serve nine additional medium-size towns
is under execution. In the rural sub-sector, activities have been limited to
case-by-case solutions without a general or sector approach. Only 10 out of
161 towns in the country (excluding Asuncion) had partially developed water



- 3 -
supply systems in 1976. Recently, however, the Government has tried to
establish a systematic, planned program for the sector, as evidenced by in the
National Plan of Health 1976-1980 (see para. 2.10).
2.08      Service levels in the water supply and sewerage sector are among
the lowest in South America and are low in comparison to other sectors of
Paraguay's infrastructure. In 1973, the Ministry of Public Health estimated
that only 17.3% of the total population had access to any organized water
supply system (about 8% through house connections). In the urban sector,
36.2% of the population was served, and only 6.1% of the rural population had
water supply service. The remaining population relies mainly on contaminated
surface sources, water holes, and some inadequately protected dug wells. Only
Asuncion has water treatment; water supply in other cities is based on raw
water of dubious quality, without even chlorination. Service levels for water
supply have not changed substantially during the past three years since no
major waterworks have been recently completed.
2.09      In 1973, 16% of the urban population, mainly in Asuncion, was served
by some sanitary sewerage system; individual solutions for excreta disposal,
mainly latrines, prevail, serving some 70% of the total population. Some
improvement in the sanitary sewer figures is expected for Asuncion, where the
sewerage system has recently been extended. A summary of levels of service is
shown in Table 2. Although the figure for population served with individual
excreta disposal solutions shows as high as 85%, many of the solutions are
completely inadequate against generally accepted standards. SENASA's recent
local surveys point to a lower percentage.

/1   Figures in this column differ from the ones shown in Table 1 due to
slight differences in the definition of urban and rural population
between the census and these estimates prepared by the Ministry of Public
Health.
C. Sector Policies
2.10      In 1972, the Latin American Ministers of Health met in Santiago de
Chile and agreed to set goals for 1980 (Plan Decenal de Salud para las Americas),
namely: (a) in the urban sector, to provide 80% of the population with
house-connected water supply or to reduce by 50% the population without this
service; (b) in the rural areas, to provide 50% of the population with piped
distribution of water or to reduce by 30% the present population without this
service. The Paraguayan Government has adopted these goals as their own,
and they have been proposed as part of the National Plan of Health for 1976-80.
This is a comprehensive program for the Public Health Sector and is part of
the National Economic and Development Plan prepared by the Secretariat of
Technical Planning of the Presidency.
2.11      Although the National Plan of Health does not specifically mention
coverage goals in terms of percentage of population served, its action
programs for the rural sub-sector would reduce by 30% the present rural popula-
tion without service by 1980. This objective means providing water to some
additional 500,000 rural inhabitants before that year. This seems to be an



-5 -
unattainable aim in terms of time, annual investment, and execution capa-
bilities required. New more realistic objectives have to be established for
the next decade (see para. 3.03).
2.12      The urban sub-sector service goal of reducing by 50% the population
without service before 1980 would require provision of water to some additional
315,000 inhabitants. Ongoing programs (see para. 2.14) could attain this
objective, a clear indication of inbalance between recent improvements in the
urban sub-sector and the relatively slow development of the rural sub-sector.
2.13      The Government is highly concerned to meet the need for water
supply and waste disposal solutions, since rates of morbidity in the country-
side due to water-related diseases as well as infant mortality (75% of the
cases caused by diarrheas and enteritis) are the highest in South America.
The Government which has made rural water supply programs a first priority and
an essential part of the National Health Plan's investment program, has
requested financial and technical assistance for institution building from the
Bank and other agencies like PAHO and UNICEF.
D.   Sector Organization
2.14      The present institutional organization of the water sector in
Paraguay began in 1954 with the creation of the Corporacion de Obras
Sanitarias for the city of Asuncion. Since 1966 the Corporacion de Obras
Sanitarias (CORPOSANA), an autonomous and publicly-owned agency, has been
responsible for the provision of water and sewerage services in all towns of
more than 4,000 inhabitants. This represents 29% of the country's total
population. CORPOSANA now supplies water in Asuncion through some 40,000
house connections (50% of the city's population) and is constructing systems
in nine towns for a total of 54,000 new house connections. CORPOSANA operates
under the coordination of the Ministry of the Interior.
2.15      Since 1972 the rural sector has been administered by the Ministry of
Public Health through a specialized agency, the Environmental National Sanita-
tion Service (Servicio Nacional de Saneamiento Ambiental-SENASA) (see Chapter
IV). SENASA is responsible for the water supply and sanitation services
in villages with 4,000 or fewer inhabitants and similar services for the
dispersed population, in addition to industrial hygiene, food quality control
and general sanitation (which includes solid waste disposal, vector control,
pollution control, etc.). The bulk of SENASA's operations are, however,
concentrated in the water sector.
2.16      The Juntas de Saneamiento (Sanitation Committees) are bodies respon-
sible for the administration, operation, and maintenance of rural water
systems in those localities where systems are under SENASA's jurisdiction.
SENASA, in association with local municipalities, is active in establishing
these committees throughout Paraguay. They work under SENASA's supervision
and assistance and should cooperate in programming, financing and construction
of new systems. Their authority is derived from Law No. 369/72 which estab-
lished SENASA, and Decree No. 8910/74 which approved regulations governing
their formation and responsibilities. Sanitation Committees have legal status



- 6 -
conferred on them by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare.  Their
5- to 9-member Board of Directors is elected by public vote and consists
of a Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer, and from 1 to 5 other
voting members.
2.17      After villagers have indicated their desire to have a potable water
system, the village is required by SENASA, with its assistance, to form a
Sanitation Committee, usually composed of civic leaders and prominent citizens.
This committee discusses with SENASA the type of system the community would
like constructed. The committee raises contributions to the initial cost,
partly in cash and materials, and organizes the contribution in labor during
construction. When construction is completed, the system is operated and
maintained by the committee with SENASA's assistance. At that time, a contract
is signed between SENASA and the Committee establishing, among other things,
amortization and replacement installments, to repay SENASA part of the initial
investment and to constitute in addition a replacement fund for future major
repairs and expenses. In addition, the committee collects the monthly tariff
revenues and connection fees, and keeps the accounting records for the system.
This approach to village organization is working successfully in 10 already
completed systems and will be followed for future projects.
E. Past Finances and Prospects
2.18      During the past 5 years (1971-75), the total investment in the
sector has been approximately ¢ 2,800 million (US$22 million) of which only
3% has been executed by SENASA, and 97% by CORPOSANA. Programmed invest-
ments for the period 1977-81, totalling ¢ 7,502 million (US$59 million), are
indicated in the following table:

- 7 -
Investment in the period 1971-1976 in the water supply sector represents 7% of
the total public sector investment. Investment programmed in water supply and
waste disposal for 1977-1981 would also be 7% of total public sector investment
(excluding investments in Itaipu), but in absolute terms it triples the
1971-76 amount. The total for the water supply sector includes the proposed
investment in the SENASA's rural project, amounting to ¢ 1,222 million
(US$9.7 million), of which the proposed Bank loan would finance US$ 6 million.
2.19      Past external financial assistance to the sector has been basically
channeled to CORPOSANA, and amounts to US$29 million as follows:
Year                Amount           Financed by Loans from
(in millions)

1976               US$10.0                      IDB
Total              US$29.0
Sector sources of funds for the next 5 years are planned to be approximately:
(i) internal cash generation 15%; (ii) external loans 60%; and (iii) govern-
ment contribution 25%. External support for the rural water sector has been
scarce, limited to technical assistance and small donations of equipment and
machinery from agencies such as PAHO, UNICEF, USAID, and other bilateral
agencies.
3. THE PROJECT
A. The Project Area and Existing Facilities
3.01      The Project would serve 42 rural communities with populations between
100 and 4,000 inhabitants in the Departamentos Central, Paraguari, and Cordi-
llera (see Map), where 36% of the country's population lives (excluding
Asuncion). These Departamentos are the most densely populated with 137 and
43 inhabitants per square kilometer respectively, compared to 5.8 inhabitants
per square kilometer for the country as a whole. The main activities are
agriculture (around 75% of the population), handicrafts and small industries.
According to SENASA's socioeconomic survey, yearly per capita income averages
around US$200 in the villages to be served. This figure is much lower than
the US$570 annual per capita income for the country as a whole in 1975.
3.02      Since SENASA's formation in 1973, it has added seven systems to
three existing systems. In another 22 villages throughout the country
systems are partially completed or under construction (six of them in the
project area). Typically, water is supplied from a drilled well, six to ten
inches in diameter and distributed through a plastic pipe network. On the



-8 -
average, 50% of the houses are presently connected to the systems, and the
remainder is served through public standpipes or individual dug wells. At
present some 25,000 people (3%) out of a total of 800,000 living in the
project area are adequately supplied with water; the remainder of the popu-
lation relies on individual wells or often contaminated surface sources.
B. Project Objectives
3.03      The project's main objectives are:
(a)  To provide safe water to around 63,000 inhabitants by the end
of 1981. That figure represents approximately 30% of the
urban population within SENASA's jurisdiction or 4% of the
total rural population of the country. Of the population
served, 60% on the average will be served through house
connections and 15% through public standpipes. This amounts
to 75% of the inhabitants of the villages to be served by the
project.
(b)  To provide adequate individual waste disposal solutions to at
least 50% of the houses connected to water systems;
(c)  To strengthen the managerial and operational capabilities of
SENASA and the communities by means of a technical assistance and
training program;
(d)  To promote community participation in the project and to improve
sanitation and public health through educational programs on
water uses and basic public health.
(e)  To ensure a financial policy consistent with the capability of
the beneficiaries to contribute to services rendered through
community participation in initial investment and tariffs
designed to cover operation, maintenance and partial recovery of
investment.
C. Project Description
3.04      This project is the first stage of a National Sanitation Plan
(Programa de Accion Concentrada - P.A.C.) prepared by SENASA in 1976 and in-
cluded as part of the National Plan of Health 1976-1980. SENASA has selected
42 communities which have requested construction of a new water supply system
of which have partially constructed systems. At appraisal time, SENASA had
prepared detailed engineering designs and socioeconomic reports for 20
villages which were reviewed and found technically sound and acceptable.
Reports and detailed designs for the remaining villages will be prepared
on a timely basis within the first two years of project execution and will



-9-
be submitted for Bank review before construction begins. SENASA will do the
basic field work for data collection and will design the systems with its
own staff since its experience in carrying out the already completed 20
systems has been very satisfactory. SENASA will receive technical assistance
from external consultants or specialized agencies in matters such as procure-
ment and general project management and supervision areas in which previous
experience is limited.
3.05      From its own past experience and with the assistance of PAHO  i>XiASA
has developed a set of practical criteria to select communities for the project.
Main criteria are: (i) population size and density; (ii) possibility to
develop easily and economically a reliable source of water; (iii) desire and
initiative of the community to obtain water supply and excreta disposal
systems; together with community organization (formation of the Sanitation
Committee) to participate actively in planning and construction of the system
and to care for future administration, operation and maintenance; (iv) willing-
ness and ability to contribute to construction costs with a minimum of cash,
labor, materials, etc., (para. 3.24) and to pay for the required periodic
charges for system operation, and to maintain the system in proper operative
condition. Community interest and participation are considered an essential
condition for inclusion of a system. In addition to these criteria the per
capita subsidy for each subproject will be computed before initiation as a
means to guarantee that this subsidy remains within reasonable limits. The
Bank will request additional justifications in those cases where subsidy is
over 80% of the estimated average per capita cost (US$50 at 1977 price level)
of the the whole water supply component of this project. Annex 1 gives a list
of preselected communities; their grouping according to population range is as
follows:
Table 4
Distribution of Size of Population of the Villages Included in the Project
Population Range (1976)                  Number of Communities
Under 1,000                                   5
1,000 - 2,000                                22
2,000 - 3,000                                 6
3,000 - 4,000                                 9
Total            42
3.06      Although SENASA considers that the communities included in the list
given as Annex No. 1 fulfill the requirements of the selection criteria,
eventual failures in meeting the initial commitments can happen, and a few of
them could be replaced by others not now included. Assurances should be
obtained during negotiations that different villages will be brought into the
program only if the Bank concurs in the decision.

3.07      The components of the project are as follows:
(a)  Construction and extension of water supply systems in 42
preselected villages. A typical system would consist of:
(i)  A drilled well 80 to 120 m deep adequately equipped
with pump and motor (diesel or electric);
(ii) A storage tank 20 to 100 cubic meters in capacity
depending on the village size;
(iii) A feeder line and distribution network;
(iv) A chlorination system;
(v)  Household connections serving 50% to 80% of the
population, depending on the local conditions of
each village, and public standpipes for the
remainder of the villagers;
(b)  Execution of a pilot project for individual waste disposal
solutions, including approximately 4,500 tile fields (privies
provided with septic tanks and percolation systems to the
ground) and 2,000 sanitary units (small units provided with
shower, toilet, lavatory and laundry facilities).
(c)  A technical assistance program for SENASA in the areas of
management, operations and financial administration. The
program is basically oriented towards in-service training
of the office and field personnel required for the execution,
future operation and management of the project. This program
would include the following aspects:
(i)  Consulting services for project management (43 man-months),
financial management (6 man-months), general administra-
tive matters (6 man-months), commnunity organization
(2 man-months), tariffs (1 man-month);
(ii) Local courses and seminars for various levels of SENASA's
personnel in water supply planning for the rural sector,
financial analysis, basic sanitation, well construction,
training for sanitary inspectors and auxiliaries, plumbing
in the rural areas;
(iii) Overseas training for SENASA's personnel in hydrogeology,
drilling techniques, communications and community pro-
motion;



- 11 -
(iv) Specific consulting services, totalling 20 man-months,
in well construction, drilling equipment selection,
procurement, basic health education for communities,
public relations, water quality monitoring and control
and other areas as required;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that consultants
will be employed according to the following schedule:
- Project Management - Before loan effectiveness
- Procurement - No later than June 30, 1978
- Basic health education - No later than June 30, 1978
(d) An education and promotional program in basic public health,
both during preparation to stimulate village participation,
and during execution to ensure that project benefits are
fully realized. This program would include seminars for
Sanitation Committee members on basic administration and
operation of rural systems, operators' training, seminars
and lectures to housewives and school children in the
villages on water uses and their benefits, and basic sanitary
practices. A total of eleven courses are planned in the four-
year period for operators and members of committees, and at
least one course for each village for housewives in addition
to the regular promotional activities. Purchase of required
material and equipment is also included in this component.
A detailed implementation schedule for the education component
of this program will be submitted by SENASA to Bank approval
no later than December 31, 1978.
(e) Acquisition of miscellaneous construction equipment and
shop tools.
3.08      Upon completion of construction SENASA will provide assistance to
the communities and sanitation committees in the areas of administration,
operation, and maintenance of the systems. SENASA has already prepared
and implemented simple and practical standards and models for accounting,
billing and collection. Operation and maintenance manuals for use of villages
are being prepared. In addition, SENASA will prepare plans for (i) the
coordination of purchase and distribution of supplies and spare parts;
(ii) attendance to major repairs; (iii) training for operators and administra-
tors. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SENASA will retain
the services of qualified external consultants or specialized agencies,
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, for the preparation and
review of these plans and manuals, as well as for the community education
programs. The final plans will be presented to the Bank for approval no later
than December 31, 1978.

D. Cost Estimates
3.09      Detailed project cost estimates have been based on the 20 designs
already prepared, taking into consideration the latest data from the Paraguayan
Construction Chamber as of December 1976. Data from recent SENASA contracts
were used for checking.
3.10      The total project cost is estimated at US$9.7 million and includes:
(i) 8% of construction costs for supervision and administration; (ii) 12% of
the base cost for physical contingencies; and (iii) 33% of the base cost for
price contingencies (10% per annum for local costs and 7.5% for foreign costs,
consistent with Bank guidelines).
E. Financing
3.11      The total financing requirement for this project during the 1978-1981
period will be US$11.0 million, US$9.7 million for project investment, US$0.9
million for interest during construction, and US$0.4 million for an increase in
SENASA's working capital needed to properly execute the project. About 55%
of this would be financed by the proposed Bank loan, 15% by communities' con-
tribution, and the remaining 30% from government contributions. The proposed
financing plan is shown in Table 6.

3.12      The basic assumptions for this financing plan are:
(a) An IBRD loan of US$6.0 million (with 7.9% interest rate and
total maturity of 17 years including a grace period of
4 years).
(b) Communities' initial contribution of 15% of the total project
financing requirements in the form of cash, labor and materials;
(c) A Government contribution estimated at US$3,150,000 equiv-
alent;
(d) Other minor sources of funds e.g. from PAHO and UNICEF
under existing cooperation agreements.
3.13      Community participation in initial investment has been considered
a basic element in the future success of the project. Since SENASA's forma-
tion in 1972, community contributions to the capital cost of village water



- 15 -
supply systems have averaged 33% of the total. This amount includes
(i) cash (mainly through connection fees and donations) and (ii) labor and
materials. It is apparent that the bulk of donations come from relatively
wealthy farmers in the region and from natives of the communities living in
Asuncion. It is, however, unrealistic to assume this level of contribution in
the future because of: (i) the increase in capital cost of projects now
planned in comparison to completed projects. In Paraguay construction costs
have been rising rapidly due to the ongoing execution of large hydroplants and
other projects. (ii) the inclusion in the project costs of components such as
more elaborated waste disposal solutions, technical assistance, community
education, etc., not always provided in previous projects. (iii) the relatively
low savings capacity of the villages to be served in the future and the diffi-
culties of estimating contributions from people living outside the community.
Estimates made during appraisal based not only on the experience of SENASA's
construction engineers and Juntas de Saneamiento but also on an assessment of
the tasks that can be performed and materials provided locally, led to the
conclusion that overall communities initial contribution would total about
15%. The figure for each village can deviate from the average according to
local conditions and system's costs. However, a minimum contribution of 10%
to the initial investment will be required from the community to be eligible
for financing under this project.
F. Implementation
3.14      The project will be executed during 1978 - 1981 according to the
construction schedule shown in Figure 1. However, some preparatory activities
will be anticipated and carried out during 1977. These preparatory activities
are not proposed for retroactive financing under the Bank loan. The estimated
annual investment is given in Table 7.
3.15      Due to its relatively reduced experience in project implementation,
SENASA will require assistance in several execution areas. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that SENASA will employ suitable qualified
consultants or will request proper assistance from specialized agencies
acceptable to the Bank to assist among other things in: (i) project manage-
ment; (ii) preparation of bidding documents; (iii) analysis of tenders;
(iv) construction supervision; (v) construction programming and control.
An estimated 55 man-months of consulting services will be required for these
tasks. Appointment of the consultant in project management will be a con-
dition of loan effectiveness. In addition to this SENASA will look for
assistance in training, community education and other specific fields as
detailed in paragraphs 3.07(c) and 3.07(d). Estimated total cost for these
consulting services is at US$220,000 with an average of US$4,000 per man-
month. A summary of consulting services costs is shown in Annex 2. Annex 3
presents a summary of terms of reference for major consulting works.

G. Procurement
3.16      All contracts for the purchase of materials and equipment or for civil
works with an estimated cost of US$30,000 or more (estimated at US$4,000,000)
would be awarded under international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines for procurement. Contracts under US$30,000 equivalent
may be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding locally advertised and in
accordance with local procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank, provided
however that the aggregate cost of the contracts does not exceed US$300,000.
Local manufacturers will be given a 15% margin of preference of the c.i.f.
value or the applicable custom duty, whichever is the lower. Pipes and cement
supply are the only items expected to be supplied by local manufacturers.
Consulting services would be awarded on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. Bank procurement practices and policies were discussed with SENASA
officials, explained to them and accepted by SENASA.
3.17      Since a necessary condition for the success of rural projects is com-
munity participation in the form of labor, materials, transportation, storage
areas, cash contributions, etc., it is more practical to execute part of the
civil works through small local contractors combined with voluntary community
work and force account in some cases where other systems are not feasible.
SENASA intends to do around 75% of the well drilling through private contrac-
tors, (estimated at US$675,000). Contracts will be awarded by competitive bid-
ding locally advertised according to para 3.16 and to the Bank's guidelines
and practices and will be open also to foreign contractors. The remainder of
the well drilling will be done by SENASA's own personnel with adequate technical
assistance, to improve their capability and skills in this aspect of the
wo rk.
3.18      An annual purchase program starting no later than March 31, 1978
(and yearly thereafter) for the materials required by the project, will be
agreed upon between SENASA and the Bank according to the requirements of the
project schedule. Consequently, successive bids would be invited according to
the needs.

- 20 -
3.20      The loan would be disbursed over a four-year period against the
estimated foreign component according to the percentages shown in paragraph
3.19. The estimated quarterly disbursements are shown in Table 8. The
closing date for the proposed loan would be June 30, 1982.
3.21      As a condition of disbursements for Categories I, II, and III, SENASA
should sign contracts with Sanitation Committees of at least 10 of the
communities included in this project, establishing a minimum community contri-
bution to the construction cost of 10%, and an initial downpayment of at least
5% of this cost, unless the Bank and SENASA agree on a different figure. In
addition, it is also required, as a condition of disbursement for these cate-
gories, that the Bank agree upon the purchase program mentioned in para 3.18.
IV. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A. General
4.01      The project would be carried out by SENASA.  SENASA was formed in
in 1972 by Law 369 as an agency within the Ministry of Public Health and
Social Welfare. SENASA is responsible for planning, promoting, financing,
executing, administering, and supervising the water supply and sanitation
services for villages with fewer than 4,000 inhabitants as well as for the
rural dispersed population.
B. Organization, Management, and Staffing
4.02      As shown in the organization chart (Figure 2), SENASA's structure
includes seven departments under the responsibility of a Director, who reports
to the Minister of Health. Four of the departments deal with general sanita-
tion, industrial hygiene, food inspection, and community relations and training.
Another is responsible for SENASA's general administration and accounts. The
two last departments are technical and dedicated to engineering and project
design, project implementation and operations. Although shown in the organi-
zation chart, there is no permanent legal advisory section. When required,
SENASA uses the services of a legal consultant of the Ministry of Public
Public Health.
4.03      SENASA's Director is required to be a civil engineer with speciali-
zation in sanitary engineering and is appointed by the Government upon proposal
of the Ministry of Health. He is in permanent control of SENASA's technical,
administrative, and financial activities. Closely dependent on the Ministry
of Health, he has very limited management autonomy, particularly in SENASA's
budget administration. According to Law 369, the Director should be assisted
by an advisory committee whose members, all civil servant specialists, would
be appointed by the Government upon recommendation of the Minister of Health.

4.04      The Government has already initiated actions to guarantee that
SENASA's budgetary operation and financial administration are in agreement
with the requirements for sound project execution. The aim is to:
(i) Simplify the disbursement procedures once the funds are
formally allocated to SENASA.
(ii)  Give sufficient authority and implementation to SENASA's
director to manage the funds, to administer the accounts,
and to authorize payments up to a certain amount, satis-
factory to the Bank and compatible with sound administration
practices.
4.05      SENASA's staff to date includes 165 civil servants among whom there
are engineers (8), draftsmen (2), calculators (2), topographers (1), chemists
(2), psychologists (1), promotion specialists (3), sanitary educators (2),
and audio-visual technicians (1); administrators (2); accountants (3) and
administrative clerks (13); sanitary supervisors (3), inspectors (62), and
assistants (17) and 43 in charge of the general services; workshop drilling
equipment, repairs, and maintenance. The qualification of employees is satis-
factory particularly for engineers and specialists. Their number, however,
will have to be increased in the technical and administrative departments to
meet the expansion of works resulting from implementation of the project.
SENASA will prepare and submit for Bank approval the final detailed plans
for:
(i) Staffing for project execution and future operations, no
later than June 30, 1978.
(ii)  Organization of training and technical assistance for the
communities, no later than December 31, 1978.
4.06      Staff recruitment is relatively easy for administrativ, personnel,
clerks and inspectors, but difficult for engineers and specialists who find
more attractive salaries in private companies. Newly recruited personnel
are first trained on SENASA procedures in training centers of the Ministry
of Health and then they receive practical instruction through work in SENASA
services. Some trainees are sent abroad for a few months to specialize in
particular fields.
4.07      To properly execute the project, SENASA will require additional
staff to be hired and trained over the execution period. A summary of the
estimated additional staff by departments and specialties is given below:

Engineers                            2

Mechanics                            2
Plumbers                             5
Auxiliaries                          5
Drillers                             1
Drivers                              2
Secretaries                          2
Sanitary Inspectors                                12
Sanitary Auxiliaries                               30
Specialists in Community Education                  3
Accountants                                                         2
Accounting Auxiliaries              _2
Total                         22             45               4
Part of this personnel would be assigned to work in Asuncion headquarters but
the majority will be in the field where three regional supervision and con-
struction offices would be established under a chief engineer. The proposed
organization and staffing plan prepared by SENASA are acceptable and it is
considered adequate to execute and operate the project with the proper external
assistance as planned.
C. Accounting System
4.08      SENASA's financial operations are recorded under the single entry
budgetary accounting system. There is no journal, no ledger, and no period-
ical trial balances or annual balance sheet as in commercial accounting.
4.09      Except for annual summaries of resources and utilization of re-
sources submitted for 1975 and 1976 to the Ministry of Health, no statement
of SENASA's financial position is available. SENASA has no adequate detailed
chart of accounts and sometimes SENASA and community expenses are registered
in the same account.
4.10      SENASA's present accounting weaknesses could be eliminated by a
thorough revision of records and a more detailed chart of accounts. Consider-
ing the enterprise nature of SENASA's activities and their expected signifi-
cant expansion under project implementation, a commercial bookkeeping system
would be needed. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SENASA
will implement before June 30, 1978, commercial accounting practices satisfac-
tory to the Bank. Project accounts would be kept separate from SENASA's other
accounts. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SENASA will
retain the services of consultants or specialized agencies to assist in plan-
ning and installing the system and training accountants and bookkeepers in the
new accounting procedures, under conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The



- 25 -
accounting system will be such as to permit SENASA to produce yearly balance
sheets, income and cash flow statements.
4.11      The Communities (Juntas) bookkeeping has been well organized under
the commercial system and is supervised by SENASA's senior accountant who
periodically inspects the Junta records and presents a constructive report
conducive to adequate improvements and clearer understanding of accounts.
Records consist of one journal, one cash book, and one ledger. Payments
and collections are supported by discharged invoices or receipts. Accounts,
however, were not up to date at the time of the appraisal. It was agreed
during negotiations that SENASA will reinforce its junta supervision and
guidance team to cope with the increased number of communities provided
with water supply systems.
D. Audit
4.12      SENASA is under two different controls:  (a) internal control
carried out by the Ministry of Public Health once a year, and (b) control
by the General Audit Department, at the Ministry of Finance level, also exe-
cuted once a year. Both cover the administrative and financial aspects of
SENASA's activities.
4.13      The control carried out by the Ministry of Public Health is under
reorganization. The controller would have his office on SENASA's premises.
He would be in permanent control of all operations and would check (rather
than spot-check) all vouchers. He would report quarterly to the Minister of
Public Health.
4.14      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SENASA will
submit yearly a report on the records and accounts mentioned in para 4.10
prepared by accountants acceptable to the Bank, no later than four months
after the end of each such year. The first of such reports should cover
fiscal year 1978.
V. FINANCE
A. SENASA's Past and Present Position
5.01      Apart from an initial Government grant of ¢ 16.3 million to be
utilized when required for office buildings, furniture and equipment, engi-
neering and laboratory equipment, workshop and central stores, SENASA has no
resources of its own. Administrating and operating expenditures as well as
investments in water supply and sanitary units are financed by the Government
budget and an earmarked tax on beer consumption (on the basis of ¢ 1 per liter
of locally brewed beer and ¢ 2 per liter of imported beer) to complement



- 26 -
regular government budget funds. Annual budgeted resources correspond to
the annual general expenditures and investments as budgeted by SENASA. When
supplementary resources are needed for an unbudgeted program, the authoriza-
tion of the Minister of Finance is required.
5.02      SENASA's annual budget is submitted by the Director to the Ministry
of Public Health for its consideration. Once reviewed and discussed with
SENASA, it is included in the general budget of this Ministry which is submit-
ted to the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance for final approval and
presentation to the Parliament.
5.03      As shown in Table 9, SENASA's resources have almost doubled since
1973 to reach an estimated ¢ 63.3 million (US$502,000) at the end of 1976.
Financial resources have been drawn from the following: (i) earmarked beer
tax (53%); (ii) direct government grants (45%); and (iii) communities' repay-
ment of debt to SENASA (deposited in a special revolving account) and fees
charged to communities for drilling and workshops services (2%).
5.04      The beer tax has increased from ¢ 20 million (US$160,000) in 1973
to 0 32.6 million (US$259,000) in 1976 (annual average increase of 16%). Debt
recovery from the communities began to operate in 1976, having been of no
importance in the past.
5.05      The cost of community water supply and sanitary systems is pre-
dominantly financed by SENASA's budgeted resources in addition to community
and municipal contributions, and donations from UNICEF, USAID, Catholic
Relief Funds, and other similar agencies to the communities or to SENASA.
Once works are completed and the system is operational, SENASA (in consul-
tation with the Ministry of Public Health and with local socioeconomic
conditions in mind) determines which part of the funds advanced will have to
be repaid and which part will be considered as government grant. The amount
of the grant depends on the cost of the system, the number of house connections
and the community's ability to pay. The portion to be repaid has averaged 25%
of the total cost in the past (see Table 10).
5.06      In addition to the loan amortization and interest, communities have
to deposit with SENASA a monthly provision for assets replacement, that
represents a reserve which is immediately available for meeting major repairs
or maintenance expenditures without resorting to credit. Provisions for
replacement are registered by SENASA as a deposit made by communities.
Assurances were obtained that SENASA would keep this account separate from
other recoveries deposited in the general revolving account. SENASA should
arrange to deposit communities' replacement funds in an account productive of
interest.

5.07      Community down payments, monthly loan installments for principal and
interest, and monthly provisions for asset replacement are paid against
receipt in a revolving account, opened for SENASA at the Central Bank. This
revolving account is credited, also by law, with resources coming from inter-
national or national institution loans, donations without specific object, and
any other extraordinary resources. Funds available from the revolving account
are, by law, reinvested to finance SENASA programs as long as reimbursement is
not claimed by the Government to meet its borrowing commitments for the same
programs.
5.08      Except for the initial grant of ¢ 16.3 million in 1973 which was
exclusively allocated for SENASA installation, resources from the Government
budget and from the beer tax are both utilized for two groups of expenses:
(a) SENASA's current administrating and operating overheads, and (b) capital
investment in communities for water supply and waste disposal construction
as well as in SENASA for mechanical equipment and workshops. Use of these
resources is not strictly demarcated. Construction materials, for instance,
can be financed by resources belonging to group (a) expenses or by those of
group (b), and may be related to SENASA's own constructions as well as to
those of community schemes.
5.09      SENASA's investments in construction of water supply systems have ab-
sorbed to date not more than 15% of the total allocated resources as shown in
Table 9.  Most of these resources went to SENASA administrative expenses (63%)
and installation and equipment (20%). This high percentage for administrative
expenses includes costs of project preparation and engineering. Due to its short
existance (four years) SENASA has been under consolidation process, and invest-
ment, has been reduced in comparison to other expenses. Among water supply systems
financed as of December 31, 1976, eight were partially completed for a total
cost of e 30.3 million (US$240,000) of which 0 7.9 million (US$63,000) was
repayable under SENASA loan terms and ¢ 22.4 million (US$178,000) was sub-
sidized by the Mfinistry of Public Health, UNICEF, USAID, Catholic Relief Fund,
or by communities' contributions in cash and kind (see Table 10). Table 11
shows the recovery performance for the eight above-mentioned loans, which
is considered satisfactory, with the exception of Rosario and General Artigas.
B. Finances at Community Level
5.10      Tariff levels are agreed between SENASA and the Sanitation Committee
(para. 2.16) for each community on the basis of the local ability to pay and
the resources required for the system operation and ordinary maintenance. In
all cases, tariffs should cover these costs as a mirimum. In addition, as
mentioned above, the community is required to deposit in SENASA a certain
amount for replacement and major repairs. In most cases, the community
amortizes part (25% in the average) of the initial nvestment. Tariffs are re-
vised periodically, usually yearly, by the Committee with the assistance of
SENASA to keep them compatible with the system's requirements of funds. The

rates are fixed as a basic amount for a patio connection plus an additional
charge based on the number and type of sanitary fixtures in use in each house.
Normally, this assures that rates and ability to pay are in close relation.
Tariffs range from 0 300 (US$2.40) to ¢ 400 (US$3.20) per month for house
connections and from ¢ 50 (US$0.40) to $ 75 (US$0.60) per month for public
standpipes. Annex 4 shows the system by which tariffs are established.
Monthly tariffs represent around 7% of average monthly family cash income
in the region. This has been the level of tariffs attained in the past with
almost zero default. In addition reductions in the standards and levels of
service provided for in the project are not advisable according to generally
accepted sanitation practices.
5.11      The amount charged to the community in addition to operation and
maintenance expenses includes the following:
(i)  The house connection costs which have to be repaid in not
more than 8 to 12 monthly installments; financing is free of
interest;
(ii)  The loan itself, the balance of which, after a variable
down payment, is redeemable in 10 to 20 years by equal
monthly installments at a rate of interest of 6% per
annum and a penalty of 2% in case of late repayment
(para. 5.05). In the past the loans have represented
in average 25% of the total investment.
5.12      The system of setting tariffs is considered satisfactory and assur-
ances were obtained that it will not be changed without the Bank's agreement.
It was also agreed upon during negotiations that SENASA and the communities
will at least once a year review the rate for the water supply services, and
will take the necessary steps to set and maintain tariff levels to produce for
every system revenues in such amount to cover at least: (i) operation and
maintenance costs of the systems; (ii) debt service commitments with SENASA
according to the contract signed between this agency and the Sanitation
Committee; and (iii) provision for major repairs and assets replacement as
agreed in the contract signed with SENASA. It is expected that tariff revenues
and initial contribution will cover in total at least 20% of investment cost
except in cases where the Bank approves justification for a lower figure (very
small and poor villages). It is expected also that in the average communities
will repay 25% of total investment (18% at present value).
5.13      The interest rate charged to the communities (6%) for the loan
compares to about 4% which is the weighted cost of funds available to SENASA,
if government funds are considered free. If local funds are considered at
opportunity cost capital in Paraguay, the interest of the combined funds would
be around 10%. It is not possible to charge higher rates to the communities
unless the proportion of the investment to be recovered as a loan is reduced
to keep periodic payments at similar levels since the ability to pay is very
limited. Extensions in payment period are not advisable beyond the economic



- 32 -
life of the systems due to difficulties that would arise to finance replacement
of worn out assets. Interest rates could be modified in the future once
income levels, and consequently ability to pay, reach higher levels. The
present system of assessing the amount to be charged as a loan to the communi-
ties and of establishing interest, based on ability to pay, seems satisfactory
and practical. It has the benefit of creating consciousness in the villagers
of the cost of capital and of the need of recovering capital investment.
5.14      The Committees are responsible for billing and collecting water
service charges. Practices vary from village to village, but there are
basically three systems:
(i) Billing and later collection by a collector;
(ii) Collection by a collector house by house with issuance of
a receipt;
(iii) Billing and payment in the local bank.
In the case of public standpipes, collections are the responsibility of a
Junta sub-committee constituted by the users. In other cases, the standpipe
is installed in the patio of a house and a list of users is kept by the owner
of the house who collects the money periodically. In all communities, there
are practically no delinquent payments. This is basically due to the high
level of community feeling and cooperation that exists as a consequence of
educational and promotional programs. In addition, the Juntas exercise firm
controls over anyone falling behind payment.
5.15      Taking the actual figures of costs and revenues for a typical com-
munity of about 1,500 inhabitants, the income statement would be as follows
(at December 1976 price level):

ing water and waste disposal facilities.
C. SENASA's Financing Plan
5.16      Table 13 shows SENASA's financing plan for the four-year period of
1978-1981. The major assumptions made for this projection are the following:
(i)  Beer consumption in volume will increase at 8% per year in
accordance with estimates prepared by the Secretariat of
Technical Planning of the Presidency. In addition, it was
assumed that the beer tax will increase at 0 0.25 per liter
and per year to reach 0 2.00 per liter in 1981.

(ii)  According to the project's objective to assist SENASA
carrying out future investments in the sub-sector, it is
assumed that the revenues from recovery of loans after
1980 will be retained by SENASA, and that the Government will
repay the debt to the Bank.
(iii)  General SENASA overheads will increase 20% in 1978 with the
commencement of the project and 8% annually in 1979-1981;
(iv)  SENASA's investments in other programs different from water
supply and waste disposal will increase at 20% annually
during 1978-1980.
5.17      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government
will take the appropriate steps to provide SENASA with funds in sufficient
amount to execute the project.
5.18      Government contribution to this project during construction and for
the first five years after project completion would be as follows:
--------- Construction -----    ---------- Debt Service ------------
Year    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986

Contributions during construction include revenues from beer taxes.
These government contributions during project execution would cover SENASA's
expenses in community promotion and organization but excludes: (i) SENASA's
general overheads (Administrative Department) and (ii) contributions to other
programs different from water supply and waste disposal.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Environmental Impact and Health Benefits
6.01      The proposed project has been considered by the Paraguayan Government
as a basic and essential part of the National Health Plan of 1976-1980. In fact,
it is recognized that although difficult to quantify or to express in economic
terms, the most important benefit from improving the quantity and quality of
water supplies and waste disposal is an improvement in public health. This
program, combined with the basic public health education component and the
complementary measures considered in the National Health Plan, like immuniza-
tion, better medical services, nutritional program, etc., will lead to a
general improvement in health conditions in the rural sector as well as
contributing to the eradication of certain endemic diseases. It is too early



- 36 -
to draw meaningful conclusions from the figures available for the villages
already served, but according to the local doctors in two of the completed
systems (Villeta and San Jose de Los Arroyos), the number of cases of
hepatitis and infant diarrheal diseases during the dry season in the past two
years has been reduced between 60% and 70%, compared to the number of cases
before system operation.
6.02      According to the National Health Plan the major causes of general
mortality in Paraguay in the period of 1964-1974 were diarrhea and enteritis;
75% of the cases and 71% of the deaths were recorded in the infant population
less than one year old. Infant mortality is among the highest in Latin
America (85 per thousand).  Ankylostomiasis has an estimated prevalence of
70% in the rural population followed by other parasitic diseases like
ascariasis and oxyuriasis. These figures show that the water supply project
could be one of the most cost-effective components of the National Health Plan
and that investment in prevention of water related diseases is among the most
urgent needs in the country.
6.03      In addition to the health benefits, this project will strengthen
the operating and executing capabilities of SENASA to undertake future tasks
in the sector. Community organization and fostering of local leadership
will help in the execution of other rural-oriented programs in the future.
6.04      Systems' design using underground water is the least cost solution
for the levels of service planned. Other alternatives based on treatment of
surface waters proved to be more expensive approaches mainly because of high
treatment and conduction costs. In addition sophisticated operational tech-
niques might be required.
6.05      No attempt is made to quantify the economic benefits of the project
since it is not possible to isolate adequately benefits from water supply only
to public health, when other public health measures are being taken simul-
taneously.
B. Risks
6.06      The main risks are related to SENASA's short experience in project
implementation, timeliness of the initial contribution by the communities, and
organization for future in-operation assistance to the communities. However,
project size has been tailored to maintain these risks at a reasonable
level and adequate assistance to SENASA has been included and financed to
guarantee permanent support during execution. In addition, community contri-
butions have been estimated conservatively to prevent potential shortfalls of
local funds. The overall risk of not achieving the project objectives is
judged medium.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following agreements were reached or confirmed during negotia-
tions:
A. Management and Operations
(i) SENASA will retain the services of qualified consultants or will
request proper assistance from specialized agencies acceptable
to the Bank to assist the institution in project management,
analysis of tenders, construction supervision, and construction
programming and control during project execution (paras. 3.04 and
3.15);
(ii) An annual purchase program for the materials required for the
project, starting on March 31, 1978 (and yearly thereafter)
will be agreed upon between SENASA and the Bank (para. 3.18);
(iii)  A condition of disbursement would be that SENASA sign contracts
with Sanitation Committees of at least 10 of the communities
included in the project and that the annual purchase program
including the expenditures of these 10 communities be approved
by the Bank (para. 3.21);
(iv) SENASA will prepare and submit for Bank comments no later
than June 30, 1978, final detailed plans and implementation
schedule for staffing, and training (paras. 4.05, 4.07
and 4.11).
B.   Financial Aspects
(i) SENASA will sign a contract with the Sanitation Committee
before construction commencement of any individual system,
specifying the works that would be carried out by SENASA, the
community's contribution to the initial investment, and the
formula to be used for tariffs and connection charges. In
any case, the contribution to the initial cost would not be
less than 10%; and, unless the Bank otherwise agrees, SENASA
will cause each Junta to make an initial downpayment of 5% as
a condition of implementation of the works at the village
level (para. 3.21);



- 38 -
(ii) SENASA will adopt before June 30, 1978, commercial accounting
practices satisfactory to the Bank and will employ consul-
tants or specialized agencies to assist in planning and
installing the system. The accounting system will be such as
to permit SENASA to produce yearly balance sheets, income and
cash flow statements (para. 4.10);
(iii) SENASA will submit yearly beginning in 1978, a report on its
records and accounts prepared by accountants acceptable to the
Bank not later than four months after the end of each fiscal
year (para 4.14); and
(iv) Unless the Bank agrees otherwise, SENASA will not introduce
changes in the present system of establishing tariffs.
SENASA will review at least once a year the rates for the
water supply services, and will take the necessary steps to
set and maintain tariff levels so that every system will
produce revenues to cover at least: operation and main-
tenance costs of the systems; debt service commitments with
SENASA; and provisions for major repairs (para. 5.12). It is
expected that tariff revenues and initial contribution will
cover in total at least 20% of investment costs except in
cases where the Bank approves a justification for a lower
figure.
C. Project Execution
(i) All subprojects will be submitted for Bank review. A basic
list of communities (Annex 1) has been agreed during nego-
tiations. Inclusion of any other community, different from
those agreed during negotiations, into the project will
require prior approval by the Bank (paras. 3.04 and 3.06);
(ii) Detailed implementation schedule of the community educational
program mentioned in para. 3.07(d) will be submitted for Bank
consideration before December 31, 1978 (para. 3.07);
(iii) SENASA will employ consultants acceptable to the Bank according
to the following schedule (para 3.07);
-  Procurement - No later than June 30, 1978
- Basic health education - No later than June 30, 1978



- 39 -
(iv)  SENASA, with the assistance of external consultants or
specialized agencies acceptable to the Bank, will prepare
plans for technical assistance to the communities during
operation. The plans will be submitted to the Bank together
with the implementation schedule before December 31, 1978
(para. 3.08 and 4.05);
(v)   Appointment of a consultant in project management, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, is a
condition of effectiveness (para. 3.07).
7.02      Provided the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$6.0 million for a term of 17 years in-
cluding a grace period of 4 years.

WATER TARIFFS
1.        Tariff levels and structures in villages being served by SENASA are
based on financial considerations, and are established and designed for each
village using the same consistent methodology. They are always agreed upon by
SENASA and the local Sanitation Committee.
2.        Tariff levels are determined by the funds necessary to keep systems
operating properly and the villagers' ability to pay.  The necessary operating
funds are estimated on the basis of:
(i) Operation and routine maintenance costs, labor, fuel or
electricity, lubricants, spare parts, office supplies, and
communications and miscellaneous;
(ii) Contributions to the replacement funds for major or extra-
ordinary repairs or replacement of worn out parts. This is
calculated on the basis of the economic life of pieces of
equipment and parts subject to more frequent replacement
(usually pumps, motors, and related equipment);
(iii) Debt Service: Amount to be repaid to SENASA, variable
according to initial community contribution, ability to pay,
and systems size. Ability to pay is estimated on the basis
of the socio-economic surveys carried out by SENASA for every
village.
3.        In the past, the average amount repaid by the village to SENASA has
been 25% of the total cost. This proportion is expected to be maintained in
the future.
4.        For the purpose of determining tariff levels, SENASA has prepared
the following table in which a weight (Unidades) is assigned to every sanitary
fixture.

villages hav,. ome industrial consumers, Villeta for example. A typical
tariff structure is as follows:

additional 5 units
Commercial Consumption

6.        Tariff levels are revised every year with the assistance of SENASA
to keep them adequate to the financial needs of the system.
