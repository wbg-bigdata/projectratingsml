Dabuangshan-Urumqi north section, The starting point of east ection is located at
Turpan Putaogou, passes througb Turpan, Dabancheng, Salt Lakc Chemical Plant,
Cauiwopu, The Forkroad of Xinjang Chemical Fertilizer Plant, the cnding point is
Urumqi Wulapo (178S964km). Putaogou to Xinjang Chcmical Fertilizer Plant (157.09km)
wction with second-grade is planned, Xinjang Chemical Fertilizcr Plant to Urumqi
Wulapo (19km) with first-gradc highway for vehicle use is to be constructed in this section
(Complet grade separation, complete confinement), The starting point of north section is
located at the Fork of Xinfu road in Dahuangshan, passcs through Fukang city, Miquan
County and ends in Urumqi Kashi East Road's fork, Icngth is 107.456km. Dahuangshan to
the entrance of Tianchi road section (52.37km) with second-grade to be constructed, the
entrance of Tianchi road to Urumqi Xashi East Road's fork (55.086km) section is planned
with first-grade to be constructed (completc gradc separation, complete confinement). To-
tal length is 286A6km.
The evaluating district is to be divided into 8 units in the light of to ecological envi-
ronment of the areas along the T-U-D section.
Unit 1. Putaogou  , Turpan-Baiyanggou (67km) is complex district of agriculture,
husbandry and tourism.
Unit 2. Baiyanggou-Thc seventh brigade Dabancheng (29km) is a mountain ridgcd
and hilly sction.
Unit 3. Thc sventh brigade-Xinjang Chcmical Fertilizer Plant (62km) is a complex
district.
Unit 4. The fork road or Xinjang Chemical Fertilizer Plant-Urumqi Wulapo
(20.6km) is the assenbling arca for industry and inhabitant activities.
Unit 5.    Entrance of Xinfu road, Dahuangsban to Ganhezi (27km) is industry, ag-
riculture and husbandry complcx district.
IJnit 6. Fork Tianchi road of Dahuangshan-Ganhezi (25km) is agriculture and hus-
bandry district
Unit 7. The cntrnce of Tianchi road-Erdaogou (30.8km) is agriculture and husband-
ry district.
Unit B. Erdaogou-the north entrance of Hetan road of Urumqi section 24.491km is
urban and country compound distric.
After an all-round study on the current cnvironment impacts of relevant social, physi-
cal, ecological. noise, air quality, cultural rclic and historic site along the highway corridor
with an assessment year limit in 2018 and with an assesmmnt scope of 200-1000m within
both sides of the highway, an Environmcntal Assessment Report has been presented.

1. Assessmcnt content
(1) Air quality and influence upon air circumstance by vehicle's tail gas.
(2) Acoustic environment and influencc upon it by traffic noise and construction noise.
;3) Grassuland, agriculture present conditions and impacts of the project on it.
(4) Wild animal and impacts of the nroject on it.
(S) The project influence upon surface watcr.
(6) Social economy and to bc effected.
(7) Analysis on risk of the bigbway projccL
(8) Analysis on economic profit and loss of environmental influence of the projecL
2. According to the findings of the monitoring and tests, significant finding of the
study are as follows.
(1) The status quo of the air quality is good, the capacity of atmospheric cnvironment
is big. The avcrage consistency of NOx. CO in one day is not exceed the standard of air
quality. TSP consistency in majority spot are not exceed standard except Wulapo.
Dacaotan and Chaiwopu.
(2) Along the highway, cxcept little section's acoustic Cnvironment is effected by old
:road mralic noise and people's living noisc, acoustic environmental quality are good. The
background value in day is lower than 50dB, in night is lower than 40dB. In thc 47 noise
sensitive spots, only the acoustic environmental quality of Wulapo. Salt Lakc Chemical
Plant, Technical School of Turpan. Turpan 20th Hospital is worse.
(3) The ground vcgetation cover is lowcr, but the community is steady, and is mainly
xic or supa-xenc subshrub and fruticous, In the scope of 200m witbin both side of the
old road, the lead content in the soil and herbage is lower, it is within background and safe
kvl, and wheat, riee, maze lead content is rather low, not be polluted.
(4) Surface water quality is good, soil erosion is slight.
(S)Therc arc no large, rare animals in region along the highway. There arc small-sized,
common animals such as bird and rodent which are widely-dispersed and adaptability,
which are little affected by the project.
3. Recommened actions are devised into those in the period of design. construction
and operation. Ae to their individual treatment, please refer to Appendix I.
4. In acccrdance with the state policy laws, after constractor consulted with govcrn-
ment and inhabtants, the special action plan on resettlement and land requisition are com-
piled.

6. As to relationsip betwecn the local EP department and the WB, pleasc rer to
Appezdix n1:
31 . Project Descriptiom
1. The alignment design and borrow sites should avoid as much as possiblc townships
and dense population area. Both unit 6 and unit 7 of the highway have compared and roc-
ommcnd&d scheme. The compared scheme is designed along the old highway, to be wid-
ened on the basis of the old highway. The recommended scheme passes through small hilly
land in the south of local railway by way of Ganquanpu to Erdaogou, shortened by
4.744km in comparigon with the old highway. By comparison in the same degree of econo-
my and technology (see TabU) and in consideration of the environmcntal protection items
of the recommended scheme are less than those of the compared scheme (eg. the snsitive
noise points of the former are twenty-two less than those of the later), it is more reasona-
ble to adopt the recommended scheme.
2. The environmental impact of this project is mainly noise pollution
3. The project occapies 665 ha desert grassland, the area of each class gassland is
scn in Tab.2.

The projct occupies 130S6 ha farmland, which focus on unit 6, unit 7, unit 3 and unit
4. Along the whole line, 62448 trecs are cut, 21609 buildings are demolished, 682 people are
resettled, among them. 85 people are due to noise effect
4. The highway's 1km wl pass by Wulapo Ancient City beyond S00m away from
south of it. Thus, the impacts can be eliminated, see Appcndix m.
1. Baselie Data
1. The proposed highway is situated in the central part of Eurasia, which is far from
the ocean, The evaporation is tong, and prCcipitation is rather small. Wintcr is long and
cold, summer is vcry Lot. The meteorological conditions along the highway ares will be
secn in Tall3.

2.  The highway is mainly situated in alluvial plain ( except Baiyanggou and
Ganquanpu is mountaLin ridged and hilly area) and situated at 6-7 degree intensity
earthquake area. Thc arca along the highway has three water systems: Baiyanggou, north
slopc of Tlanshan Mountain and Urumqi River. The water quality is fairly good. The
fishery and aquatic resources are mainly amassed in the water areas of Chaiwopu Lake, big
and small Salt Lakc. Thc forcst resource is the secondary forest of Baiyanggou, grapc trecs
or Turpan City, ecological forest of Chuiwopu and some artificial forcst in other sections.
The main zonal vegetation is desert of xeric shrubs and hemi-shrubs, which constitute the
deset pasturc. The Peregrinus make up the majority of wild animal species without endan-
gerd or precious species in the area along the highway. Except cities, towns and viages,
the area within the evaluation range is gobi or dcsert landscape and sparsely populated.
3. The highway to be built is an important part of'cros' main line ofXiniang com-
munications, the key section that Urumqi, the capital or Xinjang Uygur Autonomous Rce
giun, links up with East, Soulb and North Xinjang, and one of the important component
parts of 'Eurasia Bridge'. Many large and middle sized key industries, mineral enterprises,
energy bases, agriculture and husbandry processing bases distribute along the line. The
population in the area along the highway is 2.1 million. The operation of the highway will
improve the backward conditions orXinjang communcations and invesbnent environment
and play an active role in the developmcnt of industry, agriculture and tertiary industry of
-6-



this arca. Aftcr the compleLion or -hc highway, the annual economic bcncirt will bc at Icast
224.9436 million yuan (RMB), and there will bc conciderable indirect economic and social
bcnerfts. Te payoff periocl is 18 years (including fivc yearec construction)according to the
ten-percent and twenty-percent decrease of traffic volnum in the class-I and clss -!
section respectively on condition of toll. The payoff period Is 16 yes (including flve years 
Coortruction) on condition of toll free (without decrease of traffic volume: in thc enow
highway).
IV. Expected Envlroantal Inipacts
1. In general vehicle volumc, concentration or thrce terms (NO1, CO and C,1H) ac-
cord with the standard in various ection in every forecasted year. In peak vehiclc volumc,
all is not excess the standard in varions section in 1999 and 2005, except slight exceeding
standard in Miquan and Fukang when wind dirction is perpendicular to highway, whose
angcs is within 4dOm and 30m, respectivcly. NOxand Tch exceed standard in Wulapo (only
when wind direction and highway moct at right angles), Fukang and Miquan section, its
range is within 40; In Fukang section when wind direction is perpendicular to the highway,
its exceeding standard range of NOxis within 120m, Tchis within 90m, when wind direction
is paralel to the highway, threc terms is not cxcred standard; when both mcet at 45 ', the
rnge of NOxis with-in 50m, T ,is within 30, During peak vehicle volume, in Miquan
whosc pollution is most serious among various section, when wind direction is perpendicu-
lar to the highway, concentration of pollution are respectively: NOxis 0.2467mg / m3, or as
0.64 times as the standard; T,,is 0.2353mg/ rn3, or as 0.47 times as the standard; CO is
02165mg/s3. n . ge fil.l-r Teaciral probabi I Ity of exceeding the stancard: <.L%
2. In construction period, noise impacts is grat  Blasting mountains, sorts of
machinical noise will impacting on people's living and working, at night specially.
Thc forecast results of noise in 30 sensitive districts along recommended scheme within
aessment scope in forecast period in scrvice phase is can been secn at Tab.A. 5C. c i. m
3. Vegetation and soil erosion: Obvious soil erosion won't occur if ciefctive mcasures
are taken in deign and construction. The operation of the highway will have small effect on
agrculture. Water quality may go down due to pollution of surface water or river during
construction, but this effect is temporary and small.
4. Because of small precipitation of Xinjang, the rain watcr ponding an the road
sue fs very maUi, so, the drainae of highway wi not affect frm irrlgation system.
S. Asphalt mixing sites can affect air quality.
6. Accident probability may exist but small in construction. Risk of traffic accident
and hazardous materials transport in particular exists during operation period, due to car
ying a large quantity of building materals in construction phace, iraffc volume certainly

V. Management of Mltigation Meaurea
As to miLigation measures to important impacts, they will vary according to diffcrent
conditions in ensitivc pionts with environmcntal impacts. For instance, the adoption or
sound barriers, recettlement, trec planting and seection or pavement design will be taken to
reduce noise. The transport of hazardous matcrials will be controlled. And for some
unexpected accidents, they will bc mitigated by cmergency rescue measures.
1. Set up sound barnies, plant trees or resettle in accordence with different situations
of sensitive noisc poinu such as scbools, inhabiant areas and other dense population areas.
2. Set up traffic signs both in chinese and in Uygur to call driver'c attention to traffic
sfety and reducing noise in dense poulation area.
3. Trees planted are poplar, elm and somc narrow-leaved oleaster, or somc willow in
suitable place, which can beautify environment besidcs reducing noisc. Sct sound barriers or
sound insulating windows and doors to ensurc noise conform to the standard if land for
planting trees is in short supply.
4. In Miquan County, the consistency of NOxcxceed the standard in middle and later
forecasting operation period, expand the requisition land scope, plant trees and grass to re-
duce the pollutanL
S. Avoiding planting vegetables with rhizome (eg.: potato ect.) within 50m, along
both sides or the highway to prevent them from lead pollution.
6. Resettlement should be taken into account if houscs quite near the highway (less
than 6Gm) in lens population area.
7. The estimated cost or environmental protection is about 11.6368 milion yuan
(RMB). see Tab.5.

S. Constructor should strictly observe the regulations related to environmental protc-
tion during construction. as follows.
(l)Noisc
Working time should be properly arrangcd in the vicinity or resident area, big noisy
work should be done in day time (9: 00- 22: 00), and forbiddcn at nightLNoisy work
bhould bc arranged after school or during vacation when construction sitc ncar chools. Dc-
tuminc the placc for sites, asphalt mixer and matcrials transport which is over SOOm far
away from acoustic scnsitive points.
(2) Dust and Asphalt Smoke
Sprinkle road surface with watcr to rcducc dust in contruction. According to related
materials, the dust can reduce by 50-70 percent irwater is sprinklcd I or 2 times L day. This
- , -,ican be used to control dust near source orwater and in dense population areas such
as Turpan, Salt Lake Chemical Plant, Wulapo, Fukang and Gumudi, Also, sprinklc earth
heap with watcr to reduce dust cause by wind whilc sprintle road surface. Advanced tecb-
nology should be adopted for asphalt melting and mixing, its sites should be far away fron
deae population area and its chimmey should be proper high.
CD Ecological Environment
a. Strictly limit cutting trees and pressing grassland. In the section of Turpan street, the
grapc trces of local resident should bc protectcd. In the scction of cutting, trecs should be
planted and recovcr orginal state as much as possiblc after construction.
b. During construction of Baiyanggou section, earth and stone or excavation should be
transported away to protect the secondary forest and Baiyang River.
C. Contractors should be educated to protect natural resourse and wildlives. Hunting
is strictly prohibited.
VI Analyss f fAltermatne
This route of highway is selcted from three schemes, reflects various opinions of local
people and government, and is considered as the best scheme in viCw of enviromncntal pro-
tetion.
1VI. Supervision and Anessunt
1. The supervision organizations arc Xinjang Environmcntal Protection Burcau and
the related cnvironmental protection bureaus of prefccture, city and county, their funcLtions
are to review and appraise the environmental impacts and the EIA report Contractor en-
trusts the Engineer of the Supervision Division of Xinjang Communications Dcpartment
with the supervision.
2. The supervision and monitoring will focus on noise, atmosphere (TSP, NOx), qual-
ity of crop and herbage, lead contents of soil and plant, cultural relics, quantity of wild-
and migration of livestocks.

'11. Insuttution and Training
1. Set up an environmcntal group subsidiary to Xinjiang Communications Depart-
ment to meet the rcquiremcnts or environmcnt protcction and mitigation mcasures. This
group includes 8 stalls who have know-how and cxperience of environmental protection, 6
staff. arc in Urumqi, Turpan and Fukang, 2 stafrs arc in charge of the wholc line. Funds of
uperviction and monitoring is supplied by the Projct Ofrice or Xinjang Communications
Departmcnt, the annual cost of both construction and opcration period arc 200 thousands
yuan RMB ecach, the lump-sum payment of instruments, equipmcnts, and vchiclcs is 2 mil-
lion yuan RMB, and the cost of acident supervision is 200 thousands yuan RMB.
2. Set up management and cxecutivc system of environmental protcction and cnvi-
ronment supervision system.
3. Send one person and six persons to the environmental institution abroad and at
home, rcspectively, for two-month training of environmental supervision, monitoring and
ascement conccrned with communications
K Involvement of Affected Groups and Non-Governmental Organization
The affected groups and NGO,along the highway to be built, and the peoplc of
resettlement or land requisitioned in particular, havc bcen consulted or polled intensively to
understand their opinions on the highway. Thc. consulting itcms are wether or not they ap-
prove thc project, the intcnsity of the cffect on them, and the advantage and disadvantage
of the project, cct. Thc total of person-times consulted and poled is 1,004, among them,
150 person-times by polling, 300 pcrson-times by tcelphone consulting and 554
person-times by consulting meceting. Among the pcrsons, peasants and herdsmcn account
for S0 percent, the other 50 percent are workers, urban inbabitants and people of individual
industry and commerce, The minority nationality (mainly Uygur and Huizu) accounts for
53 percent of the total. As a result, 30 percet considered that the project has considerable
effect on their normal work and lives, 45 percent considered that the project has small effect
on them and 25 percent considred that the project has no effect on them.
55 percent aproved the construction of thc highway, and considered that the higbway
would improve their traffic condition and spur the econoic development of their region,
and there would bc nothing but advantage; 29 percent considered that the project had noth-
ing to do with them and there would be ncither advantage nor disadvatage; 16 perccnt dis-
approved the construction of the highway and considered that the higway would damage
their farmland, grassand, forcst or buildings and change thcir normal life styles. Among
them, 15.5 percent would approve the project if govenment reovwer their damage, the othcr
0.5 percent had an intranigent attitude, for cxamplc. the private managers or board and
lodging or Dabancheng section considered that the changed route of the new highway
would reduce their incomes because of the loss of customers, and government could not ful-
ly recover their damagcL
-11I-



Having heard the negative opioniou, designer altered and revised the design and construction
plan. e. g. to get additioual passageway. set up sound barriers, adiust schedule of construction
with noise, and supervise to put the design and method mentioned above into effect by the envi-
ronmental supervise engineer. For people who do not want to be moved, should talk to them pa.
tiently to bring them round, show advantages and disadvantages, or try to persuade them to be
moved. If they remain the same, should be forced to be moved as the locl stipulated concerned.

Report on the Archaeological Investigation
near the Ancient City of Wulabo
(Xinjiang Institute of Archaeolosy, June 10.1993)
The archaeological near The Ancient City of Vulabo was done by
XinJians Institute of Archaeolosy as an emergency archaeological
investigation for the proposed of finding out if there are any
historical sites buried underground to the south of The Ancient
City of Wulabo, where a new high grade highway will be built in
1994 by Xinjiang Hish Grade Highway Construction Autlhority. The
archaeolosical investisation was finished in June 6,1993.The
situation and the results of the archaeolosical investigation are
presented as follows:
1.We  have  chosen  exploration  ditch  as  our   investigation
method.There have been dug a total of 14 narrow ditchs and 4
square ditchs in a range of 350 meters alongside the proposed
highway alignment,shorter than the lensth of the south wall of
the ancient city.The investisation area is 550 meters to the
south of The Ancient City of Wulabo, where the ground is rela-
tively hisher and is reckoned a possible place the out-of-city
building may be buried. There is an interval of 5--20 meters be-
tween every two ditchs.
2. After field reconnaissance we have found very few historical
relics, e.g. pottery sherds etc.. on the ground to the south of
the ancient city where the proposed highway will cross. The
stratisraphical section of the ditchs shows that there is a layer
of sand gravel or sand clay at the top and a layer  of  primitive
loess below. There are no historical remains found in the ex-
ploration ditchs except a piece of Uisurian bronze coin found in
the sand layer in one of the exploration ditch.
3. The field investigation has reached us the conclusion that
the possibility there are any historical remains buried under-
ground to the south of The Aicient City of Wulabo, where the
proposed highway will cross, is rather lower, and that the
proposed hishway can be built along the designed route on
schedule.

Effects of this Pro ject on
Present Traffic During Construction
I . Maim Impact factor
1. Cutti-'- .:a mountain and lasting for pavement will effects and block traffic in
this -- ., obviousely ,in Baiyanggou section. Its impacts on ceoloicalc nvironment been
..;azioncd ahead. Carrying the disused earth and stone will lead to increase volume of tua-
ric in Baiyanggou section.
. A great qun+ti of building-road materials will be carried through old road. It will
.c.ad to increas voiu:-. of traMfc and jam on the old road.
3.Planning road will in-._c.ct with present road in some section. It will lead to hin-
drance of road and jam of trafric in section during construction.
I. Transport and site of building-road materials.
1. Cubic metre of earth
A part of fill, or borrow earth, will carry by motor vehicle, which lead to increa  vol-
ume of trafric, transport distance is 2-3Kml,OKm at most.
2. Sand and stone*
(1) Grvel: Gravels that use in roadsurface and concrete are drew from local guly,
flood land and gobi along the highway in T-V section. Gravels are extracted concentrately
at matcrial sitc in flood land or Ganhczi, Fukang, Miquan and Urusnqi in D-V section, its
carrying quantity is relatively largcr.
(2) Stone and crushed stonc:There are a great quantity of boulder and cobble at
Ganhezi and Fukang. Slice stonc, lump stone and crushed stone are cxtrauctd, carried or
bought from south or Fukang city ,suburbs of Urumqi, Mciyaogou, Baiyanggou (Hougou),
iushugou and Wulapo, etc..The farst transport distance is 38Km and 28Xm(Mciyaogou,
Shuangiagou), the most part of it is I-SKm.
3. Water
There are Kzi  and irrigation canal in TurpanThere are Baiyang river in Baiyanghe
mountain urea- Water in irrigation canal are uscd for construction in Dabancheng and
Caiwopu. Near Urumqi water can be drew from Wulapo reservoir, Youth canal and Peace
canal. Baiyang rivcr, Nanquan rivcr and Ganhczi river arc pcrcnnial river in Fukang. There
ar many motor-pumped well near highway in Fikang and Miquan region.

(1) Cemcnt:Cemcnts arc supplicd mainly from Urumqi. Miquan and Ganhezi do so.
(2) Gcacral asphalt They are suppli:d from Kelaunayi, Dushanzi Rcfinery, Xinjaing.
Transport distance is 385-426Km.
S. Oil: They arc supplied from Urumqi petroleum works, transport distance are
23-106Km.
6. Coal: There are some coal minc such as Meiyaogou, Bucrian(Tuokcxun),
Donggou,Urumqi, Miquan, Tiechanggou, Xiaohuangshan and Dahuangshan etc. along
highway, its transport distance are 32-129Km.
Distribution state of materials site mentioned abovc thow that because drawing local
zemouroGs and carrying nearby, increase of trafric vulamc in one section do not efTect that in
others section cxept that of stcels.
m. Quantity of building-road materials and Its trafric effects In vaious section
dug contuctlom
Quantity of building-road matcrials and its traffic flow( vchicles /day) in various
sectiom during construction sce table 8-1.

vehilc
3)carrying time of 1-12 is 900 day, that of 13-20 is 300 day.
Judgcd by type of carrying, frcight volumc of earth and stonc is the overwhclming ma-
jority. Takc Xinhua-Wolapo section as ceample, the trafic fow cause by carrying earth
and stonc is 6263, others matcrials is 36.8. Thus,-traflic impact during carrying carth and
stonc would bc mainly considcred.
Judged by highway gradc of various section, the frcight volume in grade I section is
morc than grde I[ section. Take earth with far-carrymg as xample, freight volume in I
gade section is 1981.7, that in II grade section is 1212A; Take cement as example, that in
I grade sction is 155.6, in 11 grade section is 78.7. Thus, tra' iC impact in I grade scction
would be emphaticaly considered.
To sum up, suppose aD materials arc carried at the same time, in Xinhua-Wulapo sec-
tion, the increased total nlow is 663.1; F section is 1038.9, D section is 2463.5. In
Turpan-Xinhua section, the increased total now is 20252.3; A section is 282.2, E section is
374.7, they are 10%-30% more than the forecasting now in 1994. But it must bc paid at-
tention to that the trnffic flow incrcased by carrying matcrials in various section is total sum
at every part in this section. For some point in this section, its flow is far inferior to this
nmerial value. Only a few vchicles pass through all this scstion, because that the carrying
distance is diffcr for each matcrials, and there are many borrow sites in this section.

By mcans o1 analysing tabic B-1 and tablc 8-2, in thc light of rcsizdcnal arca and ma-
terial site, it is thought that increase of trafric volume at Turpan, Saitlake chemical plant,
Xinjpang chemical fertilizer plant, Wulapo, Nortben entrance or Hetan Road,Urumqi and
cntrance of Tianchi Road (Fukang) (sec Fig.8-1) section during carrying earth and stonc
would be particularly paid attention to and appropriate measures would be taken to miti-
gpte trfic impact. In other sectionbecause old trafic is not saturated, increasing limitedly
traffic volume does not cause jiam of traffic.

1V. Effects of the disused earth and stone and Its trasport on traffir
There arn mainly the disused earth and stone in Baiyanggou mountain section. Cubic
metre of earth are 381101 m3 and cubic metre of stone are 460240 m3 in it .Total sum are
841314m3. Thus, freight volume of 6232 vehicles/ day will be increased during carrying
earth asd stone. It is little effect traffc of old road(see table 8-2). As long as directing trar-
lic in good timc, road can be unblocked in this section.
State of road cros ae table 3.

fic safety staff must be provided, and traffic sign must be instaled, in order to trafic afety
and unblocked, such as Putaogou, Xiaocaihu, Salt lakc, Xinhua, Wulapo, Trinchi Road
and Kashi East Road. If exceptoral case (c g..fmfric accident, a rush construction) is en-
countered, public notice would be issued and the staff would be augmented in time, to keep

VI. Measures
1. As far as possible local materials are used, forbiding long-distance-transport, es-
pecially, in carrying earth and stone. Of course, appropriate centralized excavation cannot
be ruled out, for the purpose of environmental protection.
2. Having consulted with communications and public security department, contractor
wouWd direct specialy traffic in construction period. Partically, in these section such as
Putaogou, Xiaochaohu, Baiyanggou, Salt lake chemical plant, Xinjang chemical fertiL;zer
plant, Chaiwopu, Wulapo ,Fukang, Tianchi Road, Kashi Road, etc.(see Fig. B-1), trafric
post would be strengthened or set up. Under special cirumstances, in these forks and other
fo*r-. Lraflc safty staff would be scnt or augmenLed,to disperse people and motors in thcse
cctions.
3. Large quantities of concentratcd transport would bc away from transport peak in
oid road, as far as possible at early morning or night.
4. Makeshift road of construction would used to the full, so as to mitigate cffccts on
traf lic.
S. In section located old road, propct would be constructed after subsidiary road has
been completed and has transport service.
'C. Wind Erosion and its countenreasr
The most serious section of wind erosion is K650-K660 section, where it is snooth
terrain and few peoplc. It is suggested that low embankment about lm shall be dopted, gen-
tie slope with 1:3 is in edge of roadbed, and cobble layer is paved in roadshoulder and
sdeslope, so as to miligate ecffet of wind erosion on the highway.

Investigation Rpniorr. or Land Reuisition and Resettlemcnt alonigi TUDII.
Between April aritl . iune 19)93 efforts Il,il beeci yfiven t.n   t! i-ueveSt.i;i   tir
preparatory  work on thle land recquisition and resettlement alon't TUDU.  Tbe ful-
lowing is a report to the investgation.
1. The Objective and Hethod of Inyestimition
The objective of t.he investgation is 1.o get a general informatiorn as to tthc
inhabitants and units to be resettled. and to avail necessary information for
the forth-cominis requisition, compensation and resettlement.
A combanation of person-to-person interview anm questionaire was adopted in
the investigation.  According to the preliminary survey statistics, 22 units and
88 families need to be resettled.  12  units  aiid  34  families  are  taken  for
investigation,  respectively representin¶' 54.55X of the total number of units to
be resettled'and abutit 182 of the familii?s to be resettled.  46 copies of ques-
tionaires were collected,  each of which :as valid.  The result of investigation
is truthful as propeur irivestisation met.hol has been adopted and the ratin of
sampling  was high.Moreover,  8 informal discussinns have been held anid about: 50
people composedl of cnncerned persoftnels and inhabitants took part in thin.
IJ.Hain Achievemenit.s of. the Investigation
1. Information abouit units and inhabitants affected by construction removal
and resettlements.
As shown in the investigation result. out of the 34 families to be resettled.
3 are individual operaters,  2 are workers of township factory,  2 are  township
and villase primary school teachers. the rest are farmers. Among the 34 families
to be resettled 8 are of Hui nationality, 8 are of Uygur nationality,  eacui rep-
resenting  23.52..  the  rest  18  are nfBRan nationality,  which took 53X.  Tlhe
average constant. polulation for each family is 5.61 persons (That for  t.he  Xin,-
jiang Region is 5.67 persons )with 9 pi!ntlle as t.tle largest-populatinn famnily nml
2 pcople as thie soallesL. The avcrage f ll anrd half labour force for eacR racily
is 2.5 people (That for the Xinjians Region is 2.88 people). The tntal ciii-
tivated land operated by the famers is 398.8mni.  ]n, 1992  the  family  wiLli  the
largest  annual  t.olal income got R1B 1 t'i0O Y whiile the lowest got RHO 9l0Y.  To
divide that among thie population, the hiLhest average annual income per capita
yields RHB 20OY whiereas the lowest yieldls RNB 142.9Y. Of the 34 families. 21
are well-nff with avera!-e inencme per raviita exceeds RHN 50Yly. represent.iliq
61.82; 2 are especially poor families with average income per capita below RHB
200Y.  represeuitiiit, 5.a2;.  The averase  rnnrual inrnnme per capita rcir the rest  of
25



the families is tbetween RHH ZODY and RHO 5DOY.  representing 32.42.  The averagle
income per carita for all the investigated families is  RNB  723.82Y,  which  is
very close to that for the whole Xiniiaiau Region.
Vitwinr  frrom [hi! rirtaamst.ance of restl.tlement,  5814.Z9s.m land area,  465.lm

of l[he 34 families i'h!dti:'l. to rfilfill tile resettlement ona time,  a figure repre-
seritinig 79.42, ZO omit, of the 27 families, howerer worried that the compensation
will be umder level.  Fnr the new residential base,  6 families expressed  their
unwili inslaess  lute  to  the  inconvenience  in  daily  life brought forthi by the
ilrolongation of the adistance between the new  base  and  places  as  farm  land.
walter-source  anil sounls.  Elne family wished that the new base should proville at
least as good accomw;:lation as the old dwelling did.  None nf the  remaining  27
families save any comments.
Also can be concluded trom the investigation result is that most of the units
and inhabitants needL  resettlement  welcome  and  support  the  construction  of
higig!irade  hiiytlway.  of  ttic 34 families investsated,  only 3 were of the opinon
that it dloesn'r. make any difference tc construct the hishway,  while the remain-
ing  ;11  families  Ihliiak  it  very necessary to construct the highway.  The per-
cenit.aues to cticent aLtitude and indifferience attitude towards  bonstruction  of
highway are 9i1.2. an:l 1.82 respectively. The blind, 67-year-old Pang Jianjun in
Shangjshane vil la'Ic NWianR couMty,  toaetrher with his 63-year-old  wife  leads  a
poor  life  only  on  1the aid from his married daughter and his son who is doing
small-profit businiess.  However reali=inrg the great importance  of  the  overall
situation, more than once he expressed his great favor in highway construction
and he would move his house on time. Near the subarb of Turpan city, 39100 trees
rieed to be cult.  Thu municipalsuburbment of Turpan stated in an active mood that
construction of hilhway is of great significance to the econonic development of
the city, arii' they will orsanize cardres and citizens to produce niew forest
1t.irou'hl volualt.ary ltabutur 1.o compensate trte loss of old forest in tile coutntry-
sicle affected h'.-
2. SiLt al.io n ina 11w country-side affected by lard requisition.
Constuction  or  TUDH  will  occupy  1958.2  mu  cultivated  land and 6.2mu
vegetable fieldl and affect 524 inhabitants. After time investigation we feel it
relatively easier to solve the problem of cultivated land occupation, because
(1)  Thob ibhm: ciitLivated land or each coiunty and city is contracted by thie
farmers, it. st-ill is owned by the colleclive.
Apart frnm the land contracted tcy farmers, each village also owns a por-
t.ion of *oi,ile laJa.i IJo be contracted iii a different system. The villacge group
26



can dispatch a part (if Ihis land to farmers whose  land  had  been  occupied  by
constriuction of hijuitly, much to thri convinience of land requisition and
resettlement work. Take Hiquan county as an example.  the whole land requisition
ol' tI-it  Colirily  is  cona,centrated on Hri!Oade 3,  Shanshatie villauc  in Giurmi towrL.
I I i Lway  ngnst.rIlmI.ionII i I ake up 23.4  mIJ lanid  of  that  Brigade.  Since  t{he
tbrigalde  still owns l'5I mu mobile land.  it can compensate some of the affected
farmirs ly d1ist.riir ivi Iiiis landc.
(Z) Ttic mobile l;zu,l in  each group is olperated by the birdrade itselr but
managed  by  the villa-jc.  If a birdge bas difficulty in compensating farmers hy
mobile land(heccause i-i has none mobile land), the village an still set mobile
land from oL.ter brig;adis to compensate.
III Problems and Proposals
1. Inhabitants suould be informed of the resettlement by formal written
notice.
z.  A cnnsrtriction-  reriod of at least. 2 months for new  resident  accommoda-
1.ions is neecied and ciansLruction during winter is impossible . Furthermore.  to
ensure a good narvest.  it is better to arrange conistruction  period  at  winiter
seasons when farmers are less busier with farming.

TLe Study Report on Migration Route along
Turpan--Urumqi--Dahuangshan Highway
Between the end of May and mid -June of 1993,High Grade Highway Resettlement
Monitolrind revelant personels made, upon request of the World Bank's  iang High-
way ProjeC.Peappraisul Mission Aide Memoire an on-the-spot investgation. People vi*-
ited during the investigation were leaders, working staff in concerned local departments such
as transport burcaus and animal husbandry hurcaus and some of ladi rcsidents. A substn-
tial unerstanding to the migration route along TUDH has been reached through fce to faL
talk and on-the-spot investigation.
Along the high Grade Highway, industry is much advanced compared to agriculture,
which represents a relatively low proportion. The rural economy basically takes the form of
planting,concurrently with animal husbandry. The ratio of stock rmsing output to agrinul-
tural total output is sl5% for Miquan conty, which is a little lower, and about 31 /frr U-
rumqi conty, which is muchhigher. The over whelming majority of herdsman is KaakIh.
Flocks of herds professionally owned by state and collective pasture and scattered herds
rased by private farmers and looked after collectively in a contracting out system by herding
groups of 2-3 people, A couple of stocklives raised in each famiy are only allowed to herd
by the rigdes or in harvested field, but not permitted to 62cr the pasture. The category of
herds flock is predomnwated by sheep with few cattle, horses and camels. There are genrally
150-200 sheep within a flock. Seen from tthe actual situation of the 3 counties, the migra-
tion of herds is strongly season bound. It is highlighted during the early spring and late an-
tum.
There are coliectivey140 thousand herds in the state owned fukang stud farm and Xao-
quan and Shuimogou pastures. The stud farm and Xlaoquan pasture cover the area of frms
such as Shanghugou Ziniquamd, Erdachezi and Tudunzi Whch are all to the north of the cx-
isting highway, somethig bke 20 km east to the Poplar River.
In these areas, Baishaw pasture 40km to the north of the original highwy is a winter
pasture areas 10-20km down south frnm the existing highway to the Tianshan mountain is
sunmner pasture, while the spring and antunm  pastmes are distrbuted alog the hllMy terrain
to the south of the existing highway. Evry year after March herds will be migrated frm
Baishaw to the spring-autumn pasture down south across the highway, .nd*ter the May
sheer of Sheep (lasts about 10 day:) they will so an to the summer pasture even down south
into the moun. Every year afgcer August the herds will begin to move down from the
mountin, enter into summer pasture and cmsequtly move northward across the highway
into the winter pasture. Shumoagou pasture is definitely located between Ganquanbao to
31



Tianchi junction which is to the south of the existing highway. The summer pasture of it is
in the hilly land to the south of the existing highway, while its winter pasture is south--
word into the mountain, thus there is no crossing the hzghway in migration.
There is noly on village engaged in animal husbandry, i. e the Poplar River village.
There are 2 stork raising teams in the village and if taken into amount the scattered herds in
Wutongwozi and Hongllu vlllages there comes up a total of 40 thousand large and small sin-
gle herd. 2/3 of these herds wil be herded in the spring and summer pastures along the two
sides of the existing highway during March, April and May. In September, however, they
will be migrated to the Baishawo winter pasture to the west of the existing highway. During
this course, the g km long segment of highway between Erdaogou and Ganquanbao is the
segment most fequented by the cressing of herds over the existing highway.
The proposed highway wMl travel through the spring -autumn pasture in Urumqi con-
ty. Nearly 10 thousand herds from Tianshan pasture, Wulapo pasture and Tuoli pasture and
herded there.
Historically there has been few road accdents Posed by vehicle or herds flock advacing
on the road. Moreover the flood period of the region is about June to August every year and
the rest df the year the region is rather dry. During the flood period the migration of herds is
alrcady completed and they are all in the summer pasture in mountain. Therefore during the
dry season the culverts and flood way will save as good and convent passwayy for the mi-
gration of herds.
With sufficient consideration of the need from the herds., men-s life and migration of
herds. the designers of the proposed highway had already designed at proper interwals nu-
meous large, medium and small bridger as well as calverts with practical side long the align-
ment of the proposed highway especially in segments Close to pasture and with extensive
sland alongside-Wh 1 F          ndiotheestern smgf PqIlarrpK50O)
which is propway 8 is e,    ti            s     bidges s well as culverts with e
-sPan4m-6m will be proposed for the passage of people and a-inias Among these only small
bridge has a cleaWheight of 2. 6m whl the rest age of clear height aepVe 3m, whill allows
passage of tall animals and i.bicles. Within Miauan in herds densely distributed areas from
S      _nquanbao interhagezo Erdaogou interchange((K560-K568) 15 large and small passway
and culverts are proposed.Except for 1 bridge crossing  aute, othelr bridges and cu-
luerts are ofi2-16m span and 4 are of 1. 49-1. 9m clear height a     pac: for
sheep 3 are of 2-2. 49m clear height, acmWdaling  passage for horses, and 7 are of ceark
GL.wV3m afommodating for passage isnels and uehiclSAccording to the invtigation, however,
the local people chaimed that only 2 such passages are sufficient. There are 2 large bridges,
4 medium bridges, 46 small bridges and 730 culvurts in the 158 km distanee farm Putagou
Turpan to the fork In niang Chemical Fertilizr Pant, averaging 1. 5 passages within each
}lkieter, As for Urunmqi county-s Caiwopao herds, 34 large and small passages with apen-
32



tureC-20m are provided, among which there is one 20m-ap41ture, 7. BSn-clearance over
pas b?ldge, at the interchange of highway and railway the rest of the passages are of above
1. 4m average clearance, acoodating for passage of flock ofjbhwp There are also 4.
Trough the 1Sy we see that the main concerns form each palis as tn the issue of the
relation between proposed highway and migration route is that the passageAhould allows the
pass of common vehicles. This aspect had been wcll considered by the highway design deo-
partmets and correspondingly given proper measures. The fact that the proposed highway
will open even more practicl, more convenient and greater number of anous passages com-
pared to the cxltAng highway, and also the fact that some sections of the proposed highway
will be all-sealed which will reduce the risk of herds crossing over the highway, wi  consid-
erablely increase the safety ooefficency of herds crossing over the highway.
In brief, It is consistently believed that the Onstruction of highway wi be a benefit
both to the kighway authority and to animal husbandry. To take a microscopic view, the
construction of high grade highway will promote the development of animal busbandryalong-
sde the highway.
