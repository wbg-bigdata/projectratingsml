compulsory, free primary education. Despite i t s relatively strong human development indicators
and commendable strides in achieving universal primary education, the Government o f Tonga
recognizes the need to improve the quality o f education i t i s delivering in order to meet the
challenges o f a globalized market economy as well as the aspirations o f its large proportion of
unemployed youth (the unemployment rate i s around 30 percent among youth in the 15-24 years
age group, while the total unemployment rate i s around 13 percent). Accordingly, the
Government has recently developed, through a two year long consultative process, an
"Education Policy Framework 2004-2019" (EPF) to provide a vision and strategy for
undertaking comprehensive reform and improvement o f i t s education system over the medium to
longer term.

Available Ministry o f Education (MoE) data indicate that the primary net enrollment rate (NER)
i s close to 100 percent in Tonga - a commendable achievement, especially relative to other
Pacific island countries (PICs). Similarly, unlike some PICs, there are no apparent gender
disparities evident in primary schools enrollment. While these achievements are commendable,
emerging evidence suggests a problem o f education quality in Tonga, especially in terms o f
readiness o f school graduates for productive employment in a market economy. The levels o f
basic numeracy and literacy (particularly English) o f young adults emerging from Tonga's
education system are questionable. An analysis o f unemployment rates disaggregated by levels
o f education shows that unemployment rates are highest among those with primary and
secondary education (around 15 percent), in comparison to those with no education or tertiary
education (World Bank, 2005). I t is also supported by qualitative data from interviews with
village residents and youth who suggest that English language skills, in particular, are not
sufficiently developed-- a situation the parents report as worsening in recent years.

Inequities in education are most apparent in Tonga at the secondary level due to the varied
quality o f education provided by government and non-government schools. Restricted access to
elite government run secondary schools has resulted in around 70 percent o f secondary school
children studying in non-government schools. There is a widespread perception within the
country that the quality o f education provided in non-government secondary schools i s lower
than that provided in the state schools, despite the higher fees charged. Equity concerns also
emerge when looking closely at accessibility o f lower-income families to secondary education.
For instance, analysis o f the 2000/01 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data
suggests that the existing system o f education finance at the secondary level i s regressive, with
students receiving the bigger subsidy coming from more affluent households and lower income
families o n average being under-represented in government secondary schools (see Annex 9 for
more details o n inequities). Some equity concerns have also emerged at the primary level where
conditions are often difficult in smaller schools in the poorer outer islands (virtually no materials,
deteriorated facilities, lack o f qualified staff etc.). Outer islands also have lower pass rates from
primary to secondary school, and the majority o f these students receive no education beyond
primary.

                                                  1
The above equity and quality issues result largely from weaknesses in the Government's public
expenditure management and policies. Government expenditures o n education in Tonga have
been in the range o f about 3.5-4.5 percent o f GDP since the late 1990s-a reasonable range by
international standards. However, expenditures on education, as a percent o f total national
budget, have declined from almost 18 percent in 1999/00 to just over 14 percent in 2004/05.
W h i l e the overall education budget dropped (in real terms) during the last four years, expenditure
on established staff increased by over 15 percent, placing severe pressure o n other expenditure
items. The main weakness in public expenditure management concerns allocation o f resources
across expenditure categories. For instance, government finding for non-salary recurrent inputs
are inadequate at both the primary and secondary levels, with staff costs consuming 96 percent o f
the primary and 94 percent of the secondary recurrent budget in recent years. This has resulted
in a severe squeeze o n the resources available for operations and maintenance (less than one
percent o f the recurrent budget has been allocated to maintenance in recent years) as well as
learning-related inputs. Qualitative data indicate the burden for materials, basic maintenance and
related inputs have fallen increasingly on parent and community groups such as Parent Teacher
Associations (PTAs). Support for learning-related inputs has eroded significantly and there i s
virtually no allocation at the primary level and minimal allocation at the secondary level (see
Annex 1).

Between 2002 and 2004, the M o E engaged in a broad consultative process to align the education
sector with the demands of the 21st century and meet the objectives o f the national Strategic
Development Plan 7 2001-04 (SDP7). Restructuring for higher sustainable economic growth,
ensuring financial stability, and investing in people are the key themes o f SDP7, which places a
specific emphasis on the role o f the education sector in promoting the country's growth. &    I
Education Policy Framework 2004-201 9 (EPF), was developed by M o E ' and approved by
Cabinet in M a y 2004(see Annex 1 for details and assessment o f EPF). The three goals o f the
EPF are to: (i)  improve equitable access and quality o f universal basic education up to Year 8
(primary education is currently years 1 through 6); (ii)  improve access and quality o f post-basic
education; and (iii)  improve the administration o f education and training. The first three years o f
this framework, which has been further developed in the MoE's Corporate Plan 2004-2007,
focus o n "transition" and "capacity building" required for Tonga to achieve its long-term
objectives. A five-year Tonga Education Support Program represents the first phase o f the
implementation o f the EPF. The proposed Tonga Education Support Project (TESP) is a critical
part o f that program (see Section B. Project Description).

2.      Rationale for W o r l d Bank and NZAID Involvement

The Government o f Tonga (GOT)has requested an IDA Credit to complement N e w Zealand
Agency for International Development (NZAID) funding to implement TESP. These funds will
provide bridge financing (see Table 1 below) until other donor financing is secured for
implementation o f the subsequent phases o f EPF, and the Government's longer-term objective of
budgetary self-reliance is met. I t is expected that GOTwill revise the costings o f EPF to reflect a
greater emphasis on school-based initiatives and substantial technical assistance, as reflected in
high donor investments in Year 1 o f TESP. I t is also anticipated that NZAID will continue to
finance Tonga's Education Support Program in i t s second cycle o f donor assistance beginning in
2008/09. The European Union (EU) and other agencies (including AusAID) are following keenly
the development o f this emerging sector wide approach that TESP i s piloting, with a view to
possible participation in the future. The Government and donors recognize and value the Bank's

 Technical assistance t o the MOE was funded j o i n t l y by the W o r l d Bank and NZAID.

global knowledge o f reform in this sector. The Government has signaled i t s intention to draw
lessons for other line ministries from this innovative approach which involves collaborative
donor support direct to the budget, around an agreed sector development framework. Finally, a
joint donor project will create a model for improved donor collaboration thought the Pacific. I t
will also give the World Bank an opportunity to improve i t s project supervisory capacity, reduce
transaction costs and increase its presence and visibility among international education partners
in the Pacific.

3.       Higher Level Objectives to Which the Project Contributes

TESP is fully consistent with the Government's strategic approach to aligning the education
sector with the demands o f the 21St
                                   century and emphasizing education's critical role in
promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. TESP supports programs to improve the
quality o f schooling, improve education outcomes, strengthen public expenditure management
(especially with a view to more equitable resource allocation), policy making, and monitoring
and evaluation within the MoE.

W h i l e there i s no Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tonga, the new World Bank Regional
Engagement Framework 2005-2008 for the Pacific Islands guides the Bank's approach in the
country. This strategy emphasizes the critical importance o f assisting governments strengthen
policies and institutions affecting delivery in health and education. A major emphasis in the
strategy is strengthening the effectiveness o f public expenditures in social sectors. The Bank's
support through TESP in Tonga is fully consistent with this.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lending Instrument

The lending instrument i s a Specific Investment Credit (SIC). The Govemment o f Tonga has
signaled its preference for moving towards a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) in education. At
the heart o f this approach i s the intention to coordinate and align all official aid to education
within the EPF program. T o this end, NZAID and IDA will provide ear-marked budgetary
support to the M o E using a parallel financing model. The parallel financing will comprise o f (i)
                                     i)
an IDA credit of U S $ 1.O million; ( ia NZAID funded Trust Fund o f U S $ 3.82 million managed
                           i iNZAID grant hnds o f approximately U S $ 6 million.
by the World Bank; and ( i )

K e y characteristics o f the TESP are that: (i)
                                               project management will be embedded in existing
line units within Government; (ii)   Government systems will be used for disbursement and all
aspects o f financial management; and ( i )i ipartner hnds will be advanced periodically in
accordance with expenditure needs and will be accounted for as part o f regular budget reporting.
The simplicity o f these arrangements and the benefits o f a straightforward development partner
coordination mechanism provide a strong rationale for interveningthrough budgetary support.

2.      Program Objective

The first three years o f the EPF, which has been further developed in the MoE's Corporate Plan
2004-2007, focus on "transition" and "capacity building'' required for Tonga to achieve i t s long-
term objectives. To achieve the EPF goals, a 15-year program, summarized in Annex 1 has been
set out by the Government. TESP is part of the first phase o f this program and, in particular,
focuses o n improving the quality o f primary and secondary education, the equitable delivery o f
services and resources, and a strengthening o f management, policy making, and monitoring and
evaluation within the sector. W h i l e the institutional responsibility for implementing the EPF
program rests with MoE, its success will be contingent upon considerable support from other
government agencies (most notably MoF) and also the numerous providers o f education in the
non-government sector.

Table 2 shows the estimated costs o f the EPF 15-year program by component (total cost U S $
48.2m). Although TESP finances a relatively small number o f activities, each i s designed to
contribute to the foundation upon which EPF will be established: capacity building,
strengthening sector management, policy and program prioritization, more equitable allocation o f
public resources and improving the quality o f schooling. In recognition o f the institutional
constraints that exist in the sector, the TESP preparation team has agreed with the Government
that these activities are adequate to establish the feasibility o f EPF as it i s currently structured. A
thorough monitoring and evaluation process within TESP will examine these expectations.

The Tonga Education Support Program and TESP

The first five-year phase o f GOT'S EPF program i s supported by two clusters o f activities
collectively referred to as the Tonga Education Support Program. Cluster 1, financed by an IDA
credit and a N e w Zealand-financed, World Bank-managed Trust Fund, focuses on establishing a
mechanism at the school level to ensure equitable provision o f universal basic education. Cluster
1 activities are those in the Tonga Education Support Project (TESP) - the project that i s
described in this document. TESP i s a major initiative under the Universal Basic Education
reforms o f the EPF (see Table 2 above).

The second part o f the Tonga Education Support Program, Cluster 2, consists o f activities that
are financed directly by a grant from N e w Zealand to the GOT. Cluster 2 activities are
complementary to the activities o f Cluster 1 and include reforms in teacher education, curriculum
development, and student assessment (see Annex 14 for a full description o f Cluster 2).




*The 2005 up-date o f the rolling Corporate Plan i s expected to detail a modified expenditure plan with increased
emphasis on school-based initiatives, encompassing both primary and secondary, government and non-government
schools.

3.     Project DevelopmentObjectives and Key Indicators

Development Objective

The development objective o f TESP is to establish a consistent and equitable mechanism that
will empower schools and communities to improve the quality o f schooling, producing an
upward trend in educational outcomes.

To achieve this objective the project is financing changes in the way the education system i s
managed, monitored and resourced. Improvements in educational outcomes are expected to
translate in the longer term into broader social and economic benefits. Proiect beneficiaries will
be primary and secondary school children in Tonga, particularly those who are disadvantaged in
terms o f access to quality schooling.

K e y Outcome
The key outcome o f the project will be a tested mechanism in place that supports the equitable
provision o f a quality basic education. As mandated under the Universal Basic Education
reforms in the EPF, a policy supported, grants-based school financing system will be established.
This will lead to the empowerment o f schools and their communities, and provide the necessary
conditions and incentives for improved and more equitable outcomes for primary and secondary
schoo1 students

The project will improve sector management by supporting a more critical process o f assessing
policy options in key areas and more substantially linking policy to expected benefits and costs.
As it moves to more directly finance schools, the GOTwill gradually transfer a portion o f the
responsibility for system outcomes to that level. By institutionalizing results-based management
and financing to schools and to the sector, TESP provides the impetus for sector programs to
reach beyond the provision o f services to the establishment o f quality services and improved
outcomes.

While targeting the neediest schools will be a challenge, the first year o f the project will be used
to conduct the policy and data analysis necessary to identify where the needy schools are located,
as well as devise the funding formulae to be used to ensure equity improvements. Further
analysis o f the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES 2000/01 and the planned
HIES in 2007), as well as in depth qualitative analysis, will help identify needy schools and the
extent o f financial assistance that i s needed to equalize standards. Grants will be provided to
primary and secondary schools -both government and non-government - to finance the inputs
necessary to improve the quality o f services they provide. The TESP Tonga School Grants
Program (TSGP) will create an environment in which resources available to a school can be used
to finance locally (school and community) determined needs. The provision o f grants will be
phased, with priority given to the needy schools, and a disproportionate share o f grants provided
to such schools.

K e y Proiect Indicators
As a five year project, TESP offers the Government the opportunity to assess movement towards
meeting i t s objectives over a reasonable timeframe, though it may be unrealistic to expect



                                                  6

                                                                                ~
TESP, policies, resource allocations and anticipated outcomes will be expressed in a
policyhinancing matrix that will be used by project monitors to guide regular appraisals o f the
policy environment, expenditures and resultsS4I addition, six general indicators will gauge
                                                 n
progress towards achieving the development objective and guide project monitoring and
evaluation, discussed in detail in Annex 3:

         Policies and mechanisms are adopted that provide all schools with access to School Grants. A
         school financing policy framework will be developed to include policy and guidelines on School
         Grants, school-level multi-year planning and budgeting, and funding formulas that provide access
         to funds adequate to equalize services across schools (primary and secondary).
         Management capacity i s strengthened at the MoE and school levels to: (a) assess school needs;
         (b) determine and prioritize policies and allocate budget thereafter; and (c) implement and assess
         the progress under the project and communicate with stakeholders.
         Quality assessment systems are established. The minimumservice standards (MSS) are
         established and applied at primary and secondary schools. The procedures and capacities for
         assessing compliance with M S S are developed.
         Resources are allocated more equitably. MoE's capacity i s strengthened in public expenditure
         management, policy making, and monitoring and evaluation.
         Performance based programming i s established. Schools manage resources effectively to meet
         MSS.
         An upward trend in educational outcomes, both academic and non-academic, for students in
         schools. The upward trend i s monitored by indicators, such as net enrollment rates, repetition,
         dropout, and transition rates, and student test performance,

TESP i s results focused. Investments under TESP are directly targeted at establishing a results
oriented system.




  The establishment and credible maintenance o f an education management information system (EMIS) in the M o E will be a vital
part o f TESP's contribution to the MoE, and will be the basis for monitoring the key outcome indicators such as net enrollment
rates, repetition, dropout and transition rates, student test performance etc.

  K e y to the successful application o f the policy matrix for this purpose w i l l be: a commitment to key TESP policies and
practices, equity-based school grants, for example; regular reporting o f the full costs o f education in both the government and
non-govemment sectors; student achievement measurement and monitoring; system performance monitoring; and a commitment
by the Govemment to realizing system efficiencies (less costly student to teacher ratios, for example).

TSGP in year 5.

Component 2 - School Grants (US$3,802,000)

This component will establish the Tonga School Grants Program. Through TSGP, the TESP will
finance improving the quality o f schooling and removing inequities in access to quality
schooling by way o f a program o f grants that allows schools to: (i)gradually meet Government
imposed school quality standards (MSS); and (ii)   finance non-salary inputs that they and their
communities determine necessary to improve school and student performance output. All
primary and junior secondary schools will, over the course o f the EPF, participate in the results-
based TSGP. The amount o f each School Grant will be governed by a funding formula that

three year rolling development plan. In the first years o f TSGP awards, the funding formula will
substantially favor the most disadvantages school by financing investments in school quality
items (books, teaching aids, short-term teacher training, etc) and facility rehabilitation.

Sub-component 2.1 - TSGP Management (US$998,000)
This subcomponent will finance: (i)   technical assistance and local staff to design and initially
manage TSGP; ( ithe development o f program guidelines; (iii)TSGP public awareness
                  i)                                              a

and (vi) TSGP operating costs including annual program review with school representatives.

Sub-component 2.2 - Grants to Schools (US$2,804,000)
This component will finance TSGP grants to schools. Grants will be distributed at the start o f
each school year, beginning in 2007. Cluster 1 contributes US$2,776,000 to the grants program
over project years 2 to 5. In addition, direct funding from NZAID to GOTwill contribute an
additional US$950,000 over project years 2 and 3, with currently undetermined amounts
allocated for project years 4 and 5 (to be decided at the TESP Mid Term Review in December
2007).6

5.      Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

The project design has benefited from the following lessons learned from the Bank's regional
and international experience:

     The World Bank's review o f human development in the Pacific (World Bank, 2005) reveals
     disappointing outcomes o f education in several Pacific Islands countries, despite
     considerable attention from both donor and governments themselves to the sector. Factors
     accounting for this include: (i)
                                    donor activity that was not meshed with national sector plans;
       i)                                   i iweak accountability linkages, particularly between
     ( iill-coordinated donor efforts; and ( i )
     school communities and the education system. TESP addresses these factors through: (i)   its

 The Mid T e r m Review i s scheduled early to coincide with NZAID's planning process with GOTfor i t s second
cycle o f assistance.
                                                        9
         sector wide approach and support for the national EPF; (ii)strong focus on school and
                                                                         a
         community empowerment for school improvement; ( i )       i iaccountability mechanisms
         regarding the use o f resources at all levels; and (iv) constructive guidance and monitoring
         programs for the TSGP.

         The private sector can be a good partner in the provision o f school services, but experience
         shows that it fiequently responds to purely market demands (at the expense o f learning
         needs) and/or to influences such as religious affiliations or schools' governing bodies. In
         some cases, private providers lack a mechanism to support broader equity concerns. TESP
         addresses these issues directly by providing private providers substantial incentives to focus
         o n the national education agenda, including equity. TESP, through the Tonga School Grants
         Program, will actively promote a broad equity agenda while providing the means for both
         government and non-government providers to develop their o w n mechanisms to cater for the
         disadvantaged students in their communities.

         A combination o f school-based management and grants to schools have been shown to foster
         better learning environments, better informed and more participatory school management,
         increased local responsibility for school development, better motivated teachers,
         improvements in the quality o f teaching and learning, improved student participation, better
         planning and more efficient use o f resources, a better response to locally perceived needs,
         and a setting o f more school-specific, and therefore, usually, more realistic goals. However,
         to achieve these outcomes, experience has taught the following: (i)   technical support i s
         critical to schools as they work through the process o f engaging in School Based
         Management (SBM), grants management, and setting and meeting realistic targets; (ii)
         constructive monitoring assists schools to assess their processes and outcomes; ( i )i iwhere
         community contributions are required, expectations and demands must be adjusted to the
I

         poverty level o f the community; (iv) grant amounts must be adequate to make the difference
         that is expected and they must be known in advance to facilitate planning; and (v) longer-
         t e r m grant programs are more productive and have a greater long-term impact than high
         amount, one-off grants. TESP has taken each o f these lessons into consideration and each is
         reflected in the spirit and intent o f the project.

    6.       Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection

    A standard project-finance operation was considered by the team at the very early stages o f
    preparation. However, given the GOT'S  strong commitment to i t s EPF and preference for a
    SWAP model using earmarked budgetary support by the donor community, the team discounted
    the conventional project approach. An initial joint NZAIDNVorld Bank Financial Management
    mission in September 2004 established unequivocally the preparedness o f M o E systems for such
    an approach.

    The task team considered the possibility o f using pooled financing instead o f parallel financing.
    However, concerns regarding the MoE's institutional and procurement capacity caused the team
    to conclude that moving more gradually towards a SWAP would be preferable, using earmarked
    budgetary support with parallel financing during the transition stage.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership Arrangements

TESP is financed by IDA and N e w Zealand, involving: (i) IDA credit; (ii)Bank-managed,
                                                              an                 a
N e w Zealand-financed Trust Fund; and ( i )i idirect N e w Zealand grant aid. The two agencies
have collaborated during and before project preparation, providing technical assistance to M o E
for its sector policy development and planning. Design and appraisal o f TESP has been through
joint missions and through a single set o f design and appraisal documents. Legal agreements are:

     A Credit Agreement between IDA and GOT;
     A Grant Agreement between IDA and GOTregarding Trust Fund arrangements;
     A Trust Fund Administration Agreement between the IDA and NZAID;

I addition, a Development Partners Harmonization Protocol (DPHP) will be agreed upon by the
 n
IDA, NZAID and the GOT. It will describe the roles and responsibilities o f the GOTand i t s
partners in TESP management, monitoring and review. It will also provide the foundations for
SWAP principles to which other donors are expected to subscribe in the future.

2.      Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

Institutional Arrangements (see Annex 6). The GOT,through the Director, MoE, has overall
management responsibility for the implementation o f TESP. An Annual Joint Review (AJR)
will be held each December to link with the annual planning and budget process. Progress will
be assessed against agreed TESP performance indicators. In addition, an Education Sector
Committee (ESC) - a multi-stakeholder forum - will meet three times a year. This Committee
will refer reports and crucial policy recommendations to the Minister o f Education. I t will
receive financial, technical and progress reports from the relevant deputy directorships in the
MoE. This process will be supported and informed by a comprehensive Educational
Management Information System (EMIS) to be established in the M o E through Cluster 2
support. Annex 6 describes the planned re-structuring o f M o E directorates to improve TESP
implementation capacity.

Financial Management (see Annex 7). Project funds will flow through the Government's budget
and accounting processes, and once disbursed, development partner funds will be distinguished
from Government funds and tracked to agreed budget lines. Special accounts will be used to
receive advance funds from the IDA but will not be used for making payments. Transfers from
the Special Accounts will be made monthly to the Government's main fund for the purposes o f
financing project expenditures, for regular reconciliation o f Ministry Vote Ledgers to the
Treasury Systems. Disbursement categories for the project will be aligned with the Government
o f Tonga's existing budget structure. This will significantly reduce the burden o f reporting for
the Government without negatively impacting on donors. The Government o f Tonga i s
enhancing reporting capabilities so as to allow generation o f Statement o f Expenditure (SoE)
statements. Disbursement for the project will be report based.

There i s a need to ensure that adequate accountability mechanisms are established for school
grants. N o disbursements for school grants will be made until the Ministry o f Education,
working with the Ministry o f Finance, has put into place satisfactory arrangements for the
monitoring o f grants, and has completed and fully disseminated the Grants Operation Manual
(GOM).
                                                11
Procurement (see Annex 8). A Procurement Advisor, financed under Cluster 2, will be
appointed on a full-time basis (a condition to effectiveness) to work with the two full-time staff
at MoE's newly established Procurement Unit. While the advisor will be responsible for
processing procurement, h i s h e r performance will be measured by success in capacity transfer.
The adequacy o f these arrangements will be carefully monitored during implementation.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation o f Outcomes/Results

The project will assess progress toward each o f the six key project indicators (shown in Table 1
in Annex 3) by regularly monitoring the set o f intermediate indicators presented in the results
framework (Table 2, Annex 3). Project monitoring will also include regular assessment o f the
grants program (TSGP), to assess progress toward meeting i t s objectives, as well as improving
sector policy and management practices.

An Annual TESP Progress Report will provide summaries o f progress against all indicators. This
report will be made available prior to the annual TESP development partner Review (AJR) and
will constitute the basis for project implementation review. A legal covenant in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) will stipulate GOT'S       requirement to finalize school-level
baseline indicators by December 3 1,2006. The indicators will be monitored consistently
throughout the life o f the project. From project year 2 onwards, TESP Progress Reviews will
also include summaries o f MoE's annual reviews o f TSGP.

Outcomes will be measured against the Project Development Objective, which ultimately seeks
improvements in school quality, relevance, efficiency and equity. TESP's success in capacity
building at the MoE and in schools will be assessed in terms o f the quality, professionalism and
timeliness with which TESP related tasks be completed at these levels. At the school level
capacity buildingwill be assessed in terms o f building basic capacities for financial management,
procurement and planning for results and monitoring outcomes. M o E will be responsible for
overseeing the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). However, initially these activities will
be completed with technical assistance. Over the course o f TESP, M&E activities will also serve
as capacity building exercises for ministry staff.

In respect to TSGP, M o E will collect project and indicator relevant data from all institutions
throughout the life o f TESP, and in doing so will lay the foundation for i t s evaluation. The
evaluation will assess the impact and cost effectiveness o f TSGP in respect to its objectives and
its key outcome goal.

4.      Sustainability

The Government o f Tonga has articulated in i t s EPF the long-term objective o f "budgetary self
reliance" as a key feature o f i t s national vision for the future o f the education sector. The
importance it has placed on ensuring self-sufficiency and financial sustainability i s demonstrated
by the costing exercise undertaken by the M o E to analyze if the resource envelope available in
the future i s adequate to ensure (i)   "continuity" o f existing services and programs; and (ii)
"improvement and transfonnation'' o f the sector through the education reforms proposed in the
EPF.

Recognizing the prevailing pressure on the education budget, IDA/NZAID financing over the
next five years is targeted o n the highest priorities (as defined by the education stakeholders)
                                                    12
amongst the transformation and reform activities within the EPF. I the medium-term, GOTi s
                                                                       n
looking to donors to bridge the financing gap for the next several years it is expected to take the
Tongan economy and the revenue effort to increase the allocations to the education sector in
order to fully self finance all education plans. In the longer-term, i t is likely that the Government
will be able to sustain this increased financing for the following reasons. First, there i s a greater
realization by the Government o f the importance o f providing quality education to i t s population.
This is evidenced by the Ministryo f Finance's recent commitment to ensuring that financial
allocations over the next few years to the existing programs o f activity within the M o E will be no
less than their 2004/05 levels- an important commitment which will reverse the prevailing
trend o f declining allocations to education. I t i s expected that government revenues will increase
over time and greater allocations will subsequently be made to education. Second, it can be
assumed that resources freed up from efficiency improvements anticipated from the project will
be reallocated to quality related interventions (especially continuing the school grants program).
Third, the anticipated benefits from the project in terms o f improved leaming outcomes,
community participation in delivering services, and other successes associated with school-based
management, will likely create a very real on-the-ground demand from communities for a
continued grants program. This stakeholder demand may make i t difficult for the Government to
reverse the precedent o f providing school grants.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and Financial Analyses

Economic Analvsis. The severe squeeze o n non-salary recurrent expenditures over recent years
has resulted in there being virtually no budget allocation for operations and maintenance and
learning-related inputs at the primary and secondary levels. As a result, many schools do not
have the basic resources necessary to provide quality education. Similarly, the overall pressure
o n the education budget has created a bottleneck in access to state secondary schools. Equity
issues consequently prevail, especially with respect to the quality o f education available to
families from low-income groups in the largely non-state secondary sub-sector as well as in
remote outer-islands.

The proposed TESP will address these aualitv and equity concems, mainly through the provision
o f school improvement grants to be provided to both state and non-state schools at the primary
and secondary level. The 2000/01 HIES dataset is used to estimate the rates o f return to
education in Tonga, as well as analyze equity issues that seem evident at the secondary level (see
Annex 9 and Project Files for details). The economic rationale for this project is provided by (i)
the quantifiable demonstration o f high rates o f retum to education in Tonga; (ii)
                                                                                  long-term
improvements in equity and poverty outcomes due to the access o f lower-income groups to a
                                              i ithe
better quality o f secondary education; and ( i ) anticipated benefits from internal and extemal
efficiencies gained at the primary and secondary level by undertaking the policy and education
quality related interventions o f the proposed project.

Financial Analvsis. Recognizing the prevailing pressure on the education budget, donor
financing over the next five years i s targeted o n the highest priorities (as defined by the
education stakeholders) amongst the transformation and reform activities within the EPF.
Selection o f these areas for support was based on the following criteria: (i)   impact o n access to
quality basic education; (ii)                                    i iconsistency with the
                              impact on poverty alleviation; ( i )
Government's o w n areas o f priority; and (iv) likelihood o f fostering long-term sustainability o f
the reforms identified in the EPF. Given the Government's scarce allocation o f resources to non-
salary recurrent expenditures, especially for learning related investments, the bulk o f project
funds will focus on school improvement grants to government and non-government primary and
secondary schools. The project will also be a vehicle for collecting baseline data and measures
o f the impact (on learning outcomes) o f increasing resources for non-salary inputs and
strengthening school based management. In the medium-term, GOTi s looking to donors to
bridge the financing gap for the next several years it i s expected to take the Tongan economy and
the revenue effort to increase the allocations to the education sector in order to eventually fully
self finance all education plans.

2. Technical

The technical aspects o f the project design are sound. The project i s based on Tonga's well
articulated EPF. It is informed by international best practice and has incorporated concerns
voiced by stakeholders. The project strategy seeks to improve the quality o f basic education in
Tonga and to address inequities in service delivery. I t also tackles system efficiencies and
moves schools into a position o f being responsible for resources and results. The project will
encourage progress toward these goals through the introduction and expansion o f a financing

                                                 15
innovation that contains incentives for schools to provide better services and to strive towards
meeting and surpassing service standards.

The project will build the enabling policy framework and the monitoring and management
capacity to provide schools the degree o f autonomy necessary to fully manage their resources
and to be held accountable, over time, for the quality o f services they provide and the results they
produce. In providing a monitoring capacity, the project facilitates Government's understanding
o f the impact o f their policy decisions and o f a new approach to financing schools. The main-
streaming o f the monitoring process not only offers objective assessment o f each aspect o f the
TSGP but, to a significant degree, ensures transparency in the application and use o f grants.
TESP also incorporates a comprehensive evaluation o f the grants program. This will inform
future policy decisions about TSGP implementation, i t s outcomes and the degree to which it is
an effective means o f resourcing reforms in the quality o f and access to basic education. The
project will build management capacity to support the school grants program at M o E and to
implement a school-based approach to managing and resourcing schools for results. The project
places a strong emphasis o n empowering schools and communities.

The introduction o f a broad program o f grants to schools draws o n international best practices, as
well as on years o f local experience o f providing per-capita grants to non-government secondary
schools. Some o f the mechanisms to be used in TESP have been tested and developed in Tonga;
others are new and will be thoroughly assessed as part o f TESP. The project will incorporate
lessons from elsewhere into TSGP and will ensure that learning takes place throughout the
project period in which the TSGP mechanisms are intended to be tested and to mature into a
sound and efficient school financing program. These lessons will be reflected in each annual
Project Implementation Plan and in operational guidelines and policies.

3. Fiduciary
Accredited senior specialists assessed Tonga's financial management capacity during project
preparation and found satisfactory and acceptable systems in place to ensure smooth
implementation o f the project. GOTsignaled at an early stage its preference for the use o f
existing Government financial systems for project implementation. Hence the core financial
management arrangements for the project will make use o f the GOTfinancial management and
budget systems which have been assessed as reliable, robust and flexible enough to cater for the
needs o f the project. Provided that the M o E maintains a full complement o f accounting staff, i t
i s not envisaged that any additional measures for strengthening institutional capacity will be
required in financial management. The incremental impact o f this project o n the Ministry o f
Finance has been assessed as marginal.
Procurement specialists visited Tonga in March 2005, to assess the MoE's capacity to implement
the project following standard Bank procurement procedures. The mission concluded that the
procurement risk is high because o f unproved procurement systems (formal procurement policies
and procedures were issued only recently) and weaknesses in Tonga's counterpart procurement
capacity. The risk will be partially mitigated by the appointment o f a procurement advisor on a
full-time basis (a condition o f effectiveness). M o E has decided to create a Procurement Unit that
will comprise two staff. While the advisor will be responsible for processing procurement,
hisher performance will be measured by success in capacity transfer. The adequacy o f these
arrangements will be carefully monitored during implementation.

4. Social

The key social issues in education in Tonga are the overall difficulties faced by schools with
respect to adequate maintenance, provision o f supplies and other educational inputs, leading to
what are perceived by communities as gradually deteriorating educational outcomes, lower
quality o f education in remote, outer islands, important differences in performance at secondary
level between government and non-government schools and unusual gender issues.

Equity o f access i s reasonably good across the various regions o f Tonga with respect to primary
school, but s t i l l could be improved. Every island with five or more children o f primary school
age i s entitled to a primary school, and in most cases this guideline appears to be met. However,
conditions are often very difficult in the smaller schools in the poorer outer islands with virtually
no materials, badly deteriorated or locally built facilities and not fully qualified staff. Outer
islands have lower pass rates from primary to secondary school, and the majority o f students
receive no education beyond that level. There is a need for both improved quality in the outer
islands, as well as for changes in curriculum such that education includes important life skills,
particularly in areas such as agricultural techniques, key health issues and additional vocational-
related instruction. The situation with respect to secondary schools has been noted in previous
sections, with the key need the equalization o f resources available to government and non-
government schools (see Annex 10 for more details).

5. Environment

The proposed project i s expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.
However, as minor school rehabilitation or maintenance is expected to be a feature in school's
development plans, comprehensive guidelines will be developed for this and technical support
provided to ensure that grants are spent wisely and civil works undertaken meet all required
environment safeguard standards and applicable buildings codes (see the Environmental
Management Framework attached to Annex 10). Best practices from other school grants
programs around the world will also be reflected in the guidelines. This will be included in the
GOM. At the primary school level, school rehabilitatiodmaintenance i s expected to be
completed by the community and not by a contractor, except in exceptional cases. At the
secondary level, contracting out school rehabilitation will be permitted, but the school will have
to provide TESP with evidence, via the school's three year rolling development plan, that the
proposed rehabilitation or construction is too complex or too large for the school's community to
complete themselves.

There w i l l be no land acquisition or resettlement under the project. The entire population o f
Tonga i s a single ethnic group, so the project as a whole w i l l constitute the Indigenous People's

7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

The project meets Regional criteria for readiness for implementation, regarding financial
management, staffing, disclosure requirements, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The
M o E has established a Procurement Unit. I t i s not anticipated that any social safeguards issues
will be triggered under the project. There will be no land acquisition or resettlement, nor i s i t
anticipated there w i l l be cultural property issues. However, the environmental assessment (OP
4.01) has been triggered due to the possibility o f minor work on school rehabilitation and
maintenance under the School Grants Program. An Environmental Management Framework
(EMF) has been prepared and publicly disclosed in Tonga to mitigate any impending adverse
consequences.

                                  Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)


Country Context

 Tonga i s an independent kingdom consisting o f an archipelago o f 129 islands, o f which only 36
are inhabited. It i s unique in the Pacific as it is the only country with a constitutional monarchy.
I t has a population o f 102,000 and a per capita GNI o f US$1,830. Tonga's human development
outcomes, including under-five mortality rate, life expectancy, and literacy, are among the best
in the Pacific, and on a par with i t s Middle Income Country status. The country has a long
standing tradition o f providing virtually universal access to six years o f compulsory, free primary
education. Evidence from the World Bank's ongoing review o f Human Development outcomes
in the Pacific indicates that unlike other countries in the Pacific, little discrepancy exists in net
primary enrollment rates by income group.

Despite its relatively strong human development indicators and commendable strides in
achieving universal primary education, the Government o f Tonga recognizes the need to improve
the quality o f education i t i s delivering in order to meet the challenges o f a globalized market
economy, as well as the aspirations of i t s large proportion o f unemployed youth (the
unemployment rate is around 30 percent among youth in the 15-24 years age group, while the
total unemployment rate is around 13 percent). Accordingly, the Government o f Tonga has
recently developed, through a two year long consultative process, an "Education Policy
Framework 2004-2019" to provide a vision and strategy for the improvement o f i t s education
system over the medium to longer term (see section below).

Sector Background and Issues

Education outcomes not reflecting initial achievements

Available M o E data indicate that the primary net enrollment rate (NER) i s close to 100
percent-a commendable achievement, especially relative to other Pacific island countries
(PICS).~Similarly, unlike in some PICs, no apparent gender disparities are evident in
enrollments in primary. While these achievements are commendable, emerging evidence
suggests a problem o f education quality in Tonga, especially in terms o f readiness o f school
graduates for productive employment in a market economy. The levels o f basic numeracy and
literacy (particularly English) o f young adults emerging from Tonga's education system are
questionable. An analysis o f unemployment rates disaggregated by levels o f education shows
that unemployment rates are highest among those with primary and secondary education (around
15 percent), in comparison to those with no education or tertiary education (World Bank 2005,
"Current Trends Future Opportunities: HumanDevelopment Outcomes in the Pacific"). This i s
also supported by qualitative data from interviews with village residents and youth who suggest
that English language skills, in particular, are not sufficiently developed, a situation the parents
report as worsening in recent years. In addition, results o f the 1990 Pacific Island Literacy levels
Test (the "PILLS" Test) indicate that functional literacy in English among primary leavers i s



' N o reliable estimates o f the secondary NER are however available due t o the existence o f t w o parallel classes for
the initial year o f the cycle and evidence o f substantial over-age entry.
                                                            19
poor.8 There i s evidence more recently o f an increasing proportion o f students categorized as
"at risk" in literacy in both English and Tongan, as well as in numeracy. There is also an uneven
quality o f a wide range o f inputs in basic (Le., primary and secondary) education. There are
problems o f curriculum relevance, the quality and availability o f teaching and leaming materials,
language policy and practice, student assessment mechanisms, and vitally, the supply and quality
o f teachers.

Inequities in education qualitv

Inequities in education are most apparent in Tonga at the secondary level due to the varied
quality o f education provided by government and non-government schools. Tonga's formal
education system consists o f Government and Church schools. In 2003,92 percent o f the total o f
17,89 1 primary students in Tonga was enrolled in Government schools with the remaining
enrolled in the country's 12 Church schools. The seven-year secondary education cycle by
contrast has around 70 percent o f i t s students studying in non-government Church and private
schools (there are 10 government schools and 32 non-government schools at the secondary
level). Restricted access to government run secondary schools account for this anomaly.' The
majority o f students who do not gain the required grades to enter the state secondary schools
have no option but to attend the less prestigious non-government schools. There is a widespread
perception within the country that the quality o f education provided in non-government
secondary schools i s lower than that provided in the state schools, despite the higher fees
charged. This perception has created a situation o f excess demand for entrance into state
secondary schools.

Although the primary repetition rate has been dropping since the mid-1990s (and was around 5.5
percent in 2003), approximately 22 percent o f class six students repeat the year. An important
reason for this high repetition rate is the attempt by students to gain sufficient marks to enter a
government secondary school. The average dropout rate in secondary appears to have remained
at around 6 percent since the mid-l990s, and i s l o w by regional standards (the rate i s lower for
girls than for boys). However, the rates are about twice as high in non-government schools as
they are in the state schools, once again pointing to the existence o f a two-tiered system. There
i s no reported information on dropouts at the primary level, but a close look at primary transition
shows that the rates are lower in non-government schools, suggesting either dropout or net-
migration to the government system. Equity concems also emerge when looking closely at
accessibility o f lower-income families to secondary education. For instance, analysis o f the
2000/01 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data suggests that government
subsidies to secondary schools is regressive, with students receiving the bigger subsidy coming
from more affluent households and lower income families on average being under-represented in
government secondary schools. This i s also substantiated by 1996 Census data which indicate
that the NER for children from the top income quintile i s over 80 percent, while i t i s only around
65 percent for children from the lowest income quintile (World Bank 2005, "Current Trends
Future Opportunities: HumanDevelopment Outcomes in the Pacific"). Some equity concems
have also emerged at the primary level where conditions are ofien difficult in smaller schools in
the poorer outer islands (virtually no materials, deteriorated facilities, lack o f qualified staff

  Approximately one third o f Grade 6 students were considered "at risk," or in other words unable to produce
"evidence o f some capacity to produce or comprehend" and showed "minimal or no success" at simple literacy
tasks, after six years at school. Tonga was one o f the lowest performers in the region in this domain.

 Access to state secondary schools i s provided on the basis o f results achieved at the highly competitive Secondary
Entrance Examination (SEE).
                                                         20
etc.)--outer islands also have lower pass rates from primary to secondary school, and the
majority o f these students receive no education beyond primary.

Weaknesses in public expenditure management

The above equity and quality issues result largely from weaknesses in the Government's public
expenditure management and policies. Government expenditures on education in Tonga have
been in the range o f about 3.5-4.5 percent o f GDP since the late 1990s-a reasonable range by
international standards. However, expenditures o n education, as a percent o f total national
budget, have declined from almost 18 percent in 1999/00 to just over 14 percent in 2004/05.
This decline in the education budget can be associated with a drop in support for the social
sectors as a whole since the mid-1990s. Within the education budget, allocations to primary (40-
45 percent) and secondary (25-30 percent) have nevertheless remained relatively constant over
the period.

While the overall education budget dropped (in real terms) during the last four years, expenditure
o n established staff increased by over 15 percent, placing severe pressure o n other expenditure
items. Government funding for non-salary recurrent inputs are inadequate at both the primary
and secondary levels, with staff costs consuming around 96 percent o f the primary and 94
percent o f the secondary recurrent budgets in recent years (Figure 1).

This has resulted in a severe squeeze o n the resources available for operations and maintenance
(less than one percent o f the recurrent budget has been allocated to maintenance in recent years)
as well as learning-related inputs. Qualitative data indicate the burden for materials, basic
maintenance and related inputs have fallen increasingly o n parent and community groups such as
PTAs. Investments in books, supplies and equipment are recognized as extremely cost-effective
investments in learning outcomes, especially in circumstances where these resources are in short
supply. Support for these learning-related inputs has eroded significantly, and there i s virtually
no allocation at the primary level (Figure 2). For instance, at the primary level, there is no
budgetary allocation for supplies; at the secondary level, allocations for supplies has been less
than half o f one percent in recent years. Similarly, n o funds are allocated for books at the
primary level, and just less than h a l f o f one percent o f the recurrent budget has been allocated to
books at the secondary level in recent years.

Although accounting for the bulk o f education's recurrent budget, teacher salaries have, in real
terms, dropped substantially during the past three years. Compared to their peak in 1995/96,
2004/05 salaries dropped by almost 30 percent. Student-teacher ratios in primary schools have
been in the 20-22 percent range over the past few years, while relatively higher in the mostly
non-government secondary schools (range o f 27-34 percent).

The Government's Education Policy Framework (EPF)

The Government o f Tonga i s well aware o f the prevailing policy and institutional constraints to
delivering high quality education in the country. During 2002-04, the M o E engaged in a broad
consultative process to align the education sector with the demands o f the 21st century and meet
the objectives o f the Strategic Development Plan 7 (2001-04). Restructuring for higher
sustainable economic growth, ensuring financial stability, and investing in people are the key
themes o f this SDP7, which places a specific emphasis on the role o f the education sector in
promoting the country's growth.

Substantial analytical work, involving a comprehensive consultative process, has been conducted
by M o E over the past three years, with World Bank, NZAID and EU assistance. This i s another
testament to the Government's commitment to reviewing and understanding the constraints in
the education sector. A complete review o f the education sector - the Tonga Education Sector
Study -was finalized in March 2003; a discussion booklet- Education Issues and Policy
Options in Tonga (September 2003) -- was circulated throughout the country, responses
analyzed, and a draft Education Policy Options Paper (November 2003) circulated for
subsequent comment and feedback from stakeholders. The culmination o f all this background
work i s the Education Policy Framework 2004-2019 prepared by the MoE'Oand approved by
Cabinet in M a y 2004.

The Education Policv Framework (EPF) provides Tonga with a vision and a broad strategy for
undertaking comprehensive reform and improvement o f education in Tonga over the medium to
longer term (a period o f approximately 15 years). I t provides a conceptual and policy framework
which allows the Government to discuss (with stakeholders in Tonga) its policy directions and

MoE. The three goals o f the EPF are to: (i)   improve equitable access and quality o f universal
                                                                                      i)
basic education up to Year 8 (primary education is currently years 1 through 6); ( iimprove
                                                     ii
access and quality o f post-basic education; and ( i )  improve the administration o f education and
training. The first three years o f this framework, which has been hrther developed in the MoE's
Corporate Plan 2004-2007, focus on "transition" and "capacity building" required for Tonga to
achieve its long-term objectives. The scope o f the EPF i s broad. I t encompasses not only the
entire education sector, but also goes beyond the formal education system to include all aspects
o f human resource development in Tonga, including strengthening the l i n k s between outcomes
o f the education sector and the training needs o f the labor force. The scope and goals o f the EPF
are ambitious, both from a budgetary and implementation point o f view. Hence, in order to
ensure success it will be critical to have a phased approach to EPF implementation, especially
with clear prioritization o f activities which will deliver the greatest impact. The proposed TESP
is the MoE's first phase o f EPF implementation.

                             Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)


The project will assess progress toward each o f the six key project indicators shown in Table 1
by regularly monitoring the set of specified intermediate indicators presented in the results
framework o f this annex (Table 2). Project monitoring will also include regular assessment o f
the grants program, TSGP, to assess progress toward meeting i t s objectives, as well as improving
sector policy making and management practices.

Annual TESP Progress Reports will provide summaries o f progress against all indicators. This
report will be made available prior to Annual TESP Development Partner Review and will
constitute the basis for project implementation review. M o E will establish baseline data on all
indicators listed in this annex. The indicators will be monitored consistently throughout the l i f e
o f the project. From Project year 2 on, TESP Progress Reviews will also include summaries o f
the MoE's annual reviews o f TSGP.

Outcomes will be measured against the Project Development Objective, which ultimately seeks
improvements in school quality, relevance, efficiency and equity. TESP's success in capacity
building at the M o E and in schools will be assessed in terms o f the quality, professionalism and
timeliness with which TESP related tasks be completed at these levels. At the school level
capacity building will be assessed in terms o f building basic capacities for financial management,
procurement and planning for results and monitoring outcomes.

M o E will be responsible for overseeing the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). However,
initially these activities will be completed with TA assistance. Over the course o f TESP, M&E
activities will also serve as capacity building exercises for ministry staff. M o E will be
responsible to develop the TESP M&E plan and to present i t to the donors prior to Project
Effectiveness.

In respect to TSGP, the M o E will collect project indicators and relevant data from all institutions
and in doing so will lay the foundation for project evaluation. The project evaluation, to be
completed in year 5, will assess the impact and cost effectiveness o f TSGP in respect to its
objectives and its key outcome goal: removing many o f the obstacles to providing a quality
education that exist at currently under-served schools and in doing so, establishing a w e l l tested
program that supports the equitable provision o f a quality basic education. This will require
attention to three measures: (i) extent to which a policy supported grants-based school
                                 the
financing system i s established; (ii) degree to which schools and communities are
                                     the
empowered in respect to school governance and management; and, importantly (iii) extent to
                                                                                       the
which TSGP has provided the necessary conditions and incentives for improved and more
equitable outcomes for primary and secondary school students.

The M o E will: (i)
                  develop a broad appreciation o f the role o f monitoring among all stakeholders;
(ii)
   compile baseline data for all project indicators; (iii)
                                                         monitor all aspects o f the TSGP for
quality, compliance with guidelines and contracts, and cost-effectiveness; (iv) assess the impact

o f TSGP activities on an ongoing basis; (iv) pay specific attention to transparency in the
programs, to the quality o f financial planning, management and control o f grants at the school
level, and to the probity o f financial transactions and adequacy o f financial safeguards
throughout the project; (v) assess the effectiveness o f the public awareness campaign; and (iv)
review the technical advice provided to schools by monitoring the frequency and quality o f the
support provided by construction advisers. Additionally, the MoE will investigate and report on
complaints about TSGP. Every two months MoE will produce a newsletter for wide distribution
that details good practice, compliance issues and clarifies TSGP guidelines, if necessary.

The Tonga Education Support Program and TESP

The first five-year phase o f GoT's EPF program is supported by two clusters o f activities
collectively referred to as the Tonga Education Support Program. Cluster 1, financed by an IDA
credit and a N e w Zealand-financed, World Bank-managed Trust Fund, focuses on establishing a
mechanism at the school level to ensure equitable provision o f universal basic education. Cluster
1 activities are those in the Tonga Education Support Project (TESP) - the project that i s
described in this document. TESP is a major initiative under the Universal Basic Education
reforms o f the EPF.

The second part o f the Tonga Education Support Program, Cluster 2, consists o f activities that
are financed directly by a grant fi-om N e w Zealand to the GOT. Cluster 2 activities are
complementary to the activities o f Cluster 1 and include reforms in teacher education, curriculum
development, and student assessment (see Annex 14 for a full description o f Cluster 2).

TESP will provide grants to schools to finance the inputs necessary to improve the quality o f
services they provide. Aside from creating an environment in which resources available to a
school can be used to finance locally (school and community) determined needs, the project
provides the Government with the opportunity to establish a 'level playing field' particularly
across government and n o n government schools, by providing a disproportionate amount o f
funds and project support to disadvantaged or underserved schools. The activities and
investments in this component represent a more comprehensive approach to reforming school

                                                       36
financing than has been taken in the past. They focus o n creating an enabling environment at the
central level and an empowering o f the school to facilitate improvements in both system and
school performance.

M o E will prepare a G O M which will describe the grant beneficiaries' eligibility criteria, the
purpose o f the grants program, the procedures for selecting, proposing and approving activities
that the grants will finance, the program's financial management requirements, how the grants
must be accounted for at the national and school level, procurement arrangements for the use o f
grants, and the program's monitoring, evaluation, reporting procedures. The GOM will be
distributed to all schools and stakeholders four months prior to the initial disbursement o f grants
to schools.

TSGP will be monitored, evaluated and refined so that by the end o f TESP the program i s robust,
cost-effective, and widely accepted as being able to produce the desired results. Through TSGP,
TESP will remove many o f the obstacles to providing a quality education that exist at currently
under-served schools. Over the course o f TESP, the policies, guidelines, funding and fund flow
mechanisms, accountability systems and monitoring necessary for the TSGP to become
established as a credible equity program will be put in place. Once in place, and once schools
are meeting results targets, the program will be a strategic part o f the core o f subsequent EPF
programs.

Four features o f the grants program are critical for i t s success:

        Government will embed &l existing cash-transfers to schools within the TSGP;
        Government will require that &l TESP grant recipient schools provide M o E with accurate
        current accountings o f non-govemment contributions to their budgets;
        Transparency; and
        Accountability

The first two o f these features allow Government to more precisely assess school needs and
existing patterns o f school financing and to subsequently allocate public resource to schools in a
more equitable manner. Transparency throughout the TSGP process will substantially reduce
suspicion o f preferential treatment to already advantaged populations. Accountability will
ensure that schools and their communities are held responsible for the use o f public h n d s and for
achieving, over time, the performance objectives that the grants are financing.

Component 1 - Policy, Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1,016,000).

This component will develop a capacity within MoE to critically analyze policy options, to
establish project priorities and to develop project specific rolling plans based o n sector priorities,
assessed project performance (results), the efficient allocation o f resources and consultative
dialogue with stakeholders. Secondly it will provide a policy and regulatory framework for the
TSGP.

Sub-component 1.1 - Policy Development (US$3 72,000)

M o E capacities will be developed as the Ministry i s guided through all stages o f the policy
decision process in respect to establishing policies and guidelines for the TSGP. Under NZAID
funding, and as part o f TESP Cluster 2 activities, a policy assessment agenda will be developed.

                                                    37
To facilitate this process, senior staff from M o E will be exposed to good practice in policy
development, planning and financing in grants programs.

In this sub-component, TESP will finance: (i)   studies o f service provision variation across each
                                                 i)
category o f school (primary and secondary); ( i development and annual improvement o f
                                                   the
national minimum service standards for schools (MSS), including a comprehensive review o f
                                i)
this policy in project year 4; i i the design and testing o f a mechanism to assess the extent to
which schools are disadvantaged or communities under-served relative to one another in respect
to meeting MSS; iv) the design and testing o f funding formula to provide an equitable
distribution o f public resources across schools.

As this work progresses, complemented by activities described below, TESP will provide ESC
and the M o E with a series o f analyses, policy position papers and draft implementation
guidelines in respect to TSGP design. Through a series o f workshops, policy makers will be
presented with costed options and taken through the process o f determining appropriate policies
for TSGP.

Sub-component 1.2 - Planning, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (USD 644,000)

Planning capacity will be developed as TSGP and MSS policies are translated into
implementation strategies and are tested. This process will strengthen sector management, its
policy footing and i t s ability to more effectively implement programs. TESP will finance the
development and annual review o f three-year TSGP rolling plans that detail project investments
and performance objectives (results) at both the national and school levels. The objective will be
to facilitate a more efficient use o f funds at all levels by providing comprehensive project and
budget details for the current and subsequent year and an investment and budget projection for
the third year.

Annual program reviews o f the TSGP three-year rolling plan will further facilitate establishing
effective programming and a results-based corporate culture. Annual reviews o f TESP, sector
policy and financing will involve the ESC, the MoE, the TESP donors and will include
consultations with stakeholders across Tonga. This exercise will raise community awareness o f
sector reforms, required standards, and system performance while providing a sounding board
for the ministry in terms o f its forward program.

This sub-component will also strengthen MOE's project oversight capacity. It will provide
substantial feedback on policy decisions, their implementation, transparency and the degree to
which project objectives are being met. TSGP will be monitored by the M o E with technical
assistance (limited to M&E design, ministry and school performance assessment and reporting).
The M o E will be responsible for TSGP M&E system upkeep, coordination with the EMIS
(financed under Cluster 2, see below), and the collection o f baseline information o n all schools
and on TSGP performance indicators. The M o E will commit to the M&E TA contract shortly
after Project Effectiveness to ensure that this important project feature is in place as the TSGP
design process begins. An intermediate goal will be to establish within the M o E the critical mass
o f monitoring capacity necessary to comprehensively monitor Government and school
performance over the later years o f TESP and the subsequent phases o f the EPF program.
Effective monitoring and reporting throughout TESP will ensure that subsequent policy
decisions are based o n firm evidence.


                                                    38
The central-based TSGP monitoring team will work directly with key planners and finance
officers in M o E and with grant recipient schools and will monitor project transparency at all
levels. Twice yearly M&E project reports will summarize project performance for the Minister
o f Education, senior ministry staff and the donors. To share best practice, information on
implementation issues and updates on project development, the TSGP monitors will produce a
quarterly TSGP newsletter that will be distributed to all stakeholders (including all schools).
They will also maintain a web site that details project policies and guidelines and reports on
school projects and results and on issues and studies. Wide dissemination o f monitoring outputs
will ensure project transparency and that lessons learnt are shared.

With NZAID financing (under TESP Cluster 2) M o E will redesign and reequip its EMIS to
enable comprehensive results-oriented reporting. Activities under this subcomponent will rely
on that system being installed, and o n the TA driven capacity building associated with i t to
provide system data and analysis o f system performance and changes to complement information
gathered on TSGP. Together, the two systems, the EMIS and the TSGP M&E, will provide GOT
with a broad understanding o f TESP impacts and associated costs.

From the beginning TSGP will be managed by MoE, although technical assistance will be
provided over the three years that it will take to fully absorb the project into regular Ministry
activities. NZAID will finance broader management support for the full Tonga Education
Support Program through Cluster 2, including TA in procurement management. NZAID will
also finance a "pool" o f TA that can be drawn on as needed by the GOTto assist in managing or
developing any aspect o f TESP.

TESP will support the strengthening o f resource management capacity at the school level. In an
ongoing process, with increased emphasis over the course o f TESP o n schools planning for
results and on removing inequities in access to quality schooling, the project will fund the
training o f head teachers, teachers and community members in school-based management
techniques and processes. In the first year o f the project, each school will develop the capacity
to assess i t s needs in respect to meeting minimum service standards set by Government. The
project will focus a disproportionate amount o f effort and resources o f strengthening the capacity
o f underserved and disadvantaged schools to identify their needs in this regard and on assisting
them to assess how best they can meet required standards utilizing TSGP grants.

TSGP will require each school to engage their community to set school improvement goals and
annual output targets and to include these in a 3-year rolling development plan. Over the course
o f TESP, the TSGP will require that schools' goals and annual targets align with the MSS.
TESP will assist schools to focus their resources, including project provided grants, on reaching
and eventually surpassing M S S in five areas: (i)                       i)
                                                    teaching methods; ( iteaching and management
capacity; (iii) learning environment - over an agreed period (to be determined during the first
Annual Joint Review) all schools will be expected to have facilities that reach or surpass a
national minimum standard in respect to classrooms, water and sanitation, furniture and
teaching/leaming materials; (iv) student achievement in agreed subj ectdareas; and (v) overall
school performance o n agreed criteria. The MSS and associated criteria in each o f these five
areas for the first three years o f EPF will be determined during the first year o f TESP. A TESP
financed MSS review workshop will assess performance against standards in project year 4. The
publication and dissemination o f the M S S will be timed to coincide with the school planning and
budget cycle. TESP will support a public awareness campaign to promote M S S and TSGP (in
sub-component 2.1). All schools will receive a Grants Operational Manual, Technical

                                                 39
Assistance and a small grant from TESP to prepare their first three-year school development
rolling plan and budget.

This subcomponent will finance: (i)                         i)
                                      technical assistance ( iTSGP monitoring costs; ( i )i iannual
                                                i itraining o f head teachers, teachers and
special studies on selected aspects o f TSGP; ( i )
community representatives in school-based resource management; and (iv) an evaluation o f
TSGP in year 5.

Component 2 - School Grants (US$3,802,000).

This component will establish the TSGP. Through TSGP, the TESP will finance improvements
to the quality o f schooling and the removal o f inequities in access to quality schooling by way o f
a program o f grants that allows schools: (i) meet, over time, Government imposed school
                                              to
quality standards (the MSS); and (ii) finance non-salary inputs that they and their communities
                                       to
determine necessary to improve school and student performance. All primary and junior
secondary schools will, over the course o f the TESP, participate in the results-based TSGP. The
TSGP will provide grants to schools in exchange for a measurable improvement in school-based
processes and conditions for improved school and student performance. In terms o f resourcing
change at the primary school level, i t is expected that TESP will make little distinction between
govemment and non-govemment schools. However, at the secondary level, where inequity i s
most obvious, a disproportionate allocation o f project resources will be directed towards non-
government schools.

Although TESP will provide grants to secondary schools, it will do so in the context o f the
Government's decision to support Universal Basic Education (UBE) through grade 8 under
TESP financing. As the majority o f the schools that provide grades 7 and 8 are secondary
schools, TESP will assist these schools but will not target i t s support at post-basic education. In
TSGP, therefore, for practical reasons, the Government will allow schools to use their TSGP
grant to finance their overall development program, as detailed in their three year rolling plans,
but will require that the `value added' to grades 7 and 8 outputs be evident in the anticipated
results section o f the schools' proposals and three year rolling plans.

As school rehabilitation is expected to be a prominent feature in many schools' development
plans, specific guidelines will be developed for this and technical support provided to ensure that
grants are spent wisely and that civil works (rehabilitation) undertaken meets all required
standards. At the primary school level, school rehabilitation is expected to be completed by the
community and not by a contractor, except in exceptional cases. At the secondary level,
contracting out school rehabilitation will be permitted, but the school will have to provide the
TSGP with evidence, via the school's three year rolling development plan, that the proposed
rehabilitation or construction is too complex or too large for the school's community to complete
themselves. Where school rehabilitation i s conducted by the community, substantial technical
assistance will be provided by TESP. The project will finance a major contractor (or two) to
provide civil works engineers to train school technical teams and provide technical oversight to
the entire program. Schools and their communities will be guided through the process o f
appointing a technical team, a bookkeeper, an engineer or master builder, and managing their
own rehabilitation project. The civil works engineers will be required to visit each school that
undertakes a rehabilitation program a minimum o f four times. The four visits will include a visit
during the planning process, two visits during rehabilitation and one visit on completion - at
which time they will be required to s i g n o f f (i.e. provide approval) o f completed works. Schools
undertaking simple maintenance will be visited only once to provide preactivity guidance and an
                                                       40
explanation o f the relevant parts o f the GOM. Site monitoring records will be submitted to the
Government every three months. Schools' bookkeepers will be trained in account and record
keeping and in how to make public all transactions.

TESP will allow schools to purchase their own inputs for their quality improvement programs.
However, a negative list will be enforced, to ensure that purchases are reasonable and are
focused on school improvement objectives. Although all school development plans and budgets
will be reviewed by TSGP management, the review process does not provide TSGP management
or the ministry an outright disapproval right, but rather, if there are issues with a schools
development plan, they will provide additional guidance to better ensure the school's plans meet
TESP objectives. Review criteria will include: (i) a school's plan demonstrates a clear step
                                                      that
towards the school meeting or surpassing MSS over the three year plan period; and (ii)      the
school's plan contains achievable performance goals for each o f the three years covered by the
plan and that the `value added' i s clear on a year-to-year basis.

The amount o f each grant will be govemed by a funding formula that reflects: (i)                 i)
                                                                                     enrollment; ( i
the extent to which the school meets or exceeds the MSS; ( i )i iGovernment's assessment o f the
schools service delivery capacity (i.e. the degree to which the school is disadvantaged andor its
community i s under-served); and ( i i)needs expressed in the school's three year rolling
development plan. In the first years o f TSGP awards, the fbnding formula will substantially
favor the most disadvantages school by financing investments in school quality items (books,
teaching aids, short-term teacher training, etc.) and minor facility rehabilitation.

Sub-component 2.1 - TSGP Management (US$998,000)

This subcomponent will finance: (i)  technical assistance and local staff to design and initially
                                                               i ia
manage TSGP; (ii) development o f program guidelines; ( i )TSGP public awareness
                   the
           i itraining o f schools in TSGP processes and procedures; (iv) civil works advisors;
campaign; ( i )
and (v) TSGP operating costs including annual program review with school representatives.

Sub-component 2.2 - Grants to Schools (US$2,804,000)

This component will finance TSGP grants to schools. TSGP grants will be distributed at the start
o f each school year beginning in SY 2007. However, after receiving a TSGP grant, schools will
not automatically receive subsequent grants. T o receive grants in the second and subsequent
years o f TSGP, a school must submit an up-to-date accounting o f the previous year's grant and a
statement o f performance against planned results.

                           Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
                            Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)


Re-structuring the Ministry o f Education. In anticipation o f TESP start-up, M o E has planned a
substantial re-structuring o f its roles and functions, to be introduced from July 2005. K e y
features o f this reform include: (i)new Deputy Directorship o f Policy and Planning, under
                                       a
which will fall the Tonga Schools Grants Program (TSGP) during i t s establishment phase before
it becomes mainstreamed within MoE; (ii)new Deputy Directorship for Quality Assurance
                                               a
which will incorporate the monitoring o f key results areas for the system, schools and students,
                                              i ia
and include curriculum and assessment; ( i )broader Deputy Directorship for Administration
that will include new units for procurement and financial management; and (iv) a single Deputy
Directorship for Schools, covering both primary and secondary.

TESP Management. Project funds will flow through the Government's budget and accounting
processes, and once disbursed, donor finds will be distinguished from Government funds and
tracked to agreed budget lines. Special accounts will be used to receive advance funds from the
IDA but will not be used for making payments. Transfers from the Special Accounts will be
made monthly to the Government's main fund for the purposes o f financing project expenditures,
and reliance will be placed on the Government accounting systems to account for the advances.
These systems will be able to track the Credit and the Trust Fund separately.

The GOT,through the Director o f MoE, has overall management responsibility for the
implementation o f TESP. M o E will manage TESP through a formal monitoring and review
process involving all stakeholders, including donors. Progress toward each o f the six key project
indicators (shown in Table 1 in Annex 3) will be assessed by regularly monitoring the set o f
intermediate indicators presented in the results framework (Table 2, Annex 3). Project
monitoring will also include regular assessment o f the grants program (TSGP), to assess progress
toward meeting its objectives, as well as improving sector policy and management practices.

A multi-stakeholder Education Sector Committee (ESC) will meet three times a year. This
Committee will refer reports and crucial policy recommendations to the Minister o f Education. It
will receive financial, technical and progress reports from the key M o E units covering policy,
planning, finance, and monitoring and evaluation, all o f which will be supported by the
comprehensive Educational Management Information System (EMIS) to be developed under
Cluster 2 direct funding by NZAID.

An Annual TESP Progress Report will provide summaries o f progress against all indicators. This
report will be made available prior to the annual TESP GOT/development partners Annual Joint
Review (AJR) held each December to link with Government's annual planning and budget
process, and will constitute the basis for project implementation review.

A legal covenant in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) will stipulate GOT'S      requirement
to finalize school-level baseline indicators by December 3 1,2006. The indicators will be
monitored consistently throughout the life o f the project. From Project year 2 onwards, TESP
Progress Reviews will also include summaries o f MoE's annual reviews o f TSGP.

Outcomes will be measured against the Project Development Objective, which ultimately seeks
improvements in school quality, relevance, efficiency and equity. TESP's success in capacity

                                                44
building at the M o E and in schools will be assessed in terms o f the quality, professionalism and
timeliness with which TESP related tasks be completed at these levels. At the school level
capacity building will be assessed in terms o f building basic capacities for financial management,
procurement and planning for results and monitoring outcomes. M o E will be responsible for
overseeing the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). However, initially these activities will
be completed with technical assistance. Over the course o f TESP, M&E activities will also serve
as capacity building exercises for ministry staff.

TSGP Implementation. The substantial policy development, planning, training and awareness-
raising required prior to implementing the schools grants program will be managed by a
dedicated, TA-supported TSGP unit under the newly-formed Policy and Planning Directorship o f
the MoE. This preparatory work, and subsequent grants disbursal and monitoring, will build o n
the strong existing cadre o f education staff at the central and district level, including the
inspectors, the head teachers, the Area Organizers, and particularly the Supervising Teachers,
who will play a leading role in guiding school improvement plans towards bettering educational
performance. At the community level, TSGP will build on the highly developed Parent /Teacher
Association network already in place.

M o E will collect project and indicator relevant data from all institutions throughout the life o f
TESP, and in doing so will lay the foundation for i t s evaluation. The evaluation will assess the
impact and cost effectiveness o f TSGP in respect to its objectives and i t s key outcome goal.

Donor Responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities o f the donors will be elaborated in a
Development Partners Harmonization Protocol (DPHP) to be finalized in the Project
Effectiveness workshops planned for September 2005. The DPHP will provide the protocol for
Sector Wide Approach principles and practice for management and reporting to which M o E will
expect present and future development partners to subscribe. The DPHP will also set out the
Terms o f Reference and membership o f the ESC and the AJR.

The Ministry o f Education will prepare all appropriate Terms o f Reference for clearance with the
World Bank and NZAID. These agencies will make supervisory visits to TESP at least three
times per year, including attendance at the December AJR.

Technical Assistance. TA will be an important feature o f TESP, particularly in i t s early stages.
TSGP will be supported by two major TA contracts. The first will provide support to TSGP-
related policy, planning and also monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The M o E will be
responsible for TSGP M&E system upkeep, coordination with the EMIS (financed under Cluster
2), and the collection o f baseline information o n all schools and o n TSGP performance
indicators. The M o E will commit to this contract shortly after Project Effectiveness to ensure
that this important project feature is in place as the TSGP design process begins. An
intermediate goal will be to establish within the M o E the critical mass o f monitoring capacity
necessary to comprehensively monitor Government and school performance over the later years
o f TESP and the subsequent phases o f the EPF program. Effective monitoring and reporting
throughout TESP will ensure that subsequent policy decisions are based o n firm evidence.

With NZAID financing (under Clusted), M o E will redesign and re-equip its EMIS to enable
comprehensive results-oriented reporting. Activities here will rely on that system being
installed, and on the TA driven capacity building associated with it to provide system data and
systematic analysis o f system performance and changes to complement information gathered on

                                                  45
TSGP. Together, the two systems (the EMIS and the TSGP M&E) will provide GOTwith a
broad understanding o f TESP impacts and associated costs.

From the beginning TSGP will be managed by MoE, although technical assistance will be
provided over the three years that it will take to fully absorb the project into regular Ministry
activities. A second major TA contract will provide a team to lead in managing the initial
implementation o f the grants program prior to mainstreaming in MoE. This will be
complemented by rehabilitation advisers recruited as necessary to supervise minor works to
improve school facilities under TSGP.

NZAID will finance broader management support for the full TESP, through Cluster 2, including
an overall TESP Adviser to provide strategic advice and capacity-building , as well as TA to
support the new Procurement Unit within the MoE. A Procurement Advisor will be appointed
on a full-time basis (a Condition o f Effectiveness). While the advisor will be responsible for
processing procurement, hisher performance will also be measured by success in capacity
transfer.

Under Cluster 2, NZAID will also finance a "pool" o f TA that can be drawn on as needed by the
GOTto assist in managing or developing any aspect o f TESP. The adequacy o f all these
arrangements will be carefully monitored during implementation, and formally reviewed at the
TESP Mid Term Review in December 2007.

             Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements

                            Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)
The desired outcome/result o f project financial management (FM) arrangements i s that project
funds, including counterpart funds where applicable, will be used for the purposes intended.
Financial management risk i s the risk that credit and grant proceeds will not be used for the
purposes intended and i s a combination o f country, sector and project specific risk factors.
Taking into account the risk mitigation measures proposed the FM risk rating for this project i s
low.
The Government o f Tonga signaled early to donors that their preference was for any project in
the sector to make use o f existing Government systems and be aligned with the Education Policy
Framework. The core FM arrangements for the project will make use o f the Government o f
Tonga financial management and budget systems which have been assessed as reliable, robust
and flexible enough to cater for the needs o f the project. Provided that the Ministry o f Education
maintains a full complement o f Accounting Staff it i s not envisaged that any additional measures
for strengthening institutional capacity will be required in financial management, the incremental
impact o n the Ministry o f Finance has been assessed as marginal.
Project funds will flow through the Governments budget and accounting processes and once
disbursed development partner funds will be distinguished from Government funds and tracked
to agreed budget lines. Although funds will be pooled in a single account, the Government o f
Tonga accounting systems will track each source o f funding and account for each source o f
funding separately. Special accounts will be used to receive advance funds from the IDA but
will not be used for making payments. Transfers from the Special Accounts will be made
monthly to the Government's main fund for the purposes o f financing project expenditures and
reliance will be placed o n the Government Accounting systems to account for the advances.
There is a risk that the accuracy o f the information contained in the accounting systems will be
undermined due to coding errors and measures have been proposed to guard against this risk,
primarily the requirement for regular reconciliation o f Ministry Vote Ledgers to the Treasury
Systems. There is also a need to ensure that adequate accountability mechanisms are established
for School Grants. I t i s therefore recommended that no disbursements for School Grants be made
until the Ministry o f Education, working with the Ministry o f Finance, has put into place
satisfactory arrangements for the monitoring o f grants.
Disbursement categories will be aligned with the Government o f Tonga's existing budget
structure. This will significantly reduce the burden o f reporting for the Government without
negatively impacting on Donors. The Government o f Tonga i s enhancing reporting capabilities
so as to allow generation o f SoE statements, Disbursement for the project will be report based.
Summary Project Description.
The Tonga Education Support Project (TESP) will assist the implementation o f policies set out in
the Education Policy Framework. The TESP i s a government/multi-donor collaborative
response. NZAID and the World Bank plan to respond jointly to the request for assistance in the
first phase o f TESP implementation. Donors agree with the Government o f Tonga that a Sector-
Wide Approach (SWAP) i s the preferred option. The project will not be a pure budget support
model, donor funds are earmarked for specific budget line items. The Bank will support TESP
cluster 1,the Tonga School Grants Program, which will consist o f the following sub
components:


                                                 47
Sub Component 1.1 Policy Development
Sub Component 1.2 Planning, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
Sub Component 2.1 TSGP Management
Sub Component 2.3 TSGP Grants
Implementing Entity.
The project will be implemented by the Ministry o f Education with support from the Ministry o f
Finance in the form o f maintenance o f accounting systems and provision o f reports. The Ministry
o f Finance will also oversee the operation o f the Project Special and other Bank accounts.
The Ministry o f Education has a system o f manually recording votes disaggregated down to line
item level in "vote books" and this i s working well. Ministry o f Education staff are comfortable
and confident using this manual system, which they have worked with for many years. At the
time o f assessment there was one vacancy at a senior level and although the project is not
expected to place undue burden on the staff it would be helpful to have a full complement o f
staff in place. The Ministry o f Education has had past experience in the implementation o f donor
funded projects and can call on advice from the Ministry o f Finance who have specific
experience in the administration o f World Bank projects (all be it that the proposed arrangements
differ somewhat from those that exist for the current portfolio in Tonga). The Ministry o f
Education i s making increasing use o f the on line access to the Sun system which enables them
to see the MoF Accounting system. The Ministry o f Education will be assisted in the design o f
TSGP management arrangements (including detailed Financial Management arrangements)
through Technical Assistance (included in component 2.1). Although annual Government
accounts have not been published for some time the Office o f the Auditor General has
maintained an active audit program which includes regular audit o f Government ministries and
departments. N o material findings have resulted from the audits o f the Ministry o f Education.
For some years the Ministry o f Finance has faced high tumover o f staff and some staff shortages,
there are a number o f persons in acting positions. W h i l s t this i s not a major issue in terms o f the
capacity o f the Ministry o f Finance to support the project, should the situation deteriorate
financial accounting capability will suffer.
Risk Analysis.
The table below summarizes the risk analysis. With the appropriate risk mitigation measures as
outlined the overall risk assessment is low.
From a financial reporting and management perspective the risks relate to the timeliness and
accuracy o f data capture as well as system integrity. The alternating fortnightly payroll/operating
expense payment cycle requires M o E to submit expense vouchers to M o F daily. M o F key in
these vouchers daily so that suppliers/creditors can be confident that MoF will have cheques
ready for collection according to the published fortnightly alphabetically split schedules. The
management o f the timeliness o f payments i s driven by creditor expectations, which are a strong
external check on system integrity.
The accuracy o f data preparation and capture i s managed by monthly reconciliation between the
MoE's robust vote control records and the M o F monthly TESP reports. Creditor expectations are
a strong check o n actual payment but accuracy o f allocation i s dependent o n intemal
reconciliation and review o f reports. Quarterly development partner and monthly Office o f the
Auditor General (OAG) review o f reports will strengthen allocation integrity.



                                                    48
System integrity comes from the maturity o f the MoF hardware and demonstrated capability
within the installed environment which includes variable power supply quality. Software
integrity i s assured through development partner contracted technical assistance.
The active engagement o f donors through the budget formulation and execution phases (see
section below) will address the country level concerns.
The Ministry o f Education will need to be able to demonstrate that appropriate mechanisms have
been put into place for the monitoring o f school grants.

BUDGETING
A key to the successful implementation o f the TESP will be the engagement o f donors with the
Government in the formulation and execution o f budget activities - this will ensure that TESP
financing i s embedded within Government o f Tonga processes. The Government o f Tonga fiscal
year runs from lSt - 30thJune.
                    July
The Government o f Tonga timetable, set out below, has been updated to include development
partner activities. I t i s expected that the timetable will guide many aspects o f the proposed
memorandum o f understanding.

     Appropriation Act effective             All Ministries           All Ministries          1'' July.

     Agreement o f the annual program with donors, rather than a traditional project based approach,
     will provide the opportunity to ensure that Government maintains i t s own level o f resources to
     the TESP. Furthermore Donors will be funding activities not currently included in the budget
     (i.e. development partner funds will be earmarked to specific budget items).
     Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements.
     To minimize disbursement transaction volume development partner disbursements will be made
     in accordance with an agreed cash flow timetable derived from the budget set as part o f the
     Annual Joint Review. Project disbursement will take the form o f advances which will be
     reconciled and reported against agreed line item expenditures. Drawdown will be contingent o n
     satisfactory reporting of the prior drawdown. Each Development partner will receive separate
     reports with the Bank receiving separate reports for the Credit and Trust Fund.
     IDA Credit and Trust Fund - The Bank will disburse finds into special TESP foreign currency
     accounts held in the National Reserve Bank o f Tonga (it is expected that should ADB wish to
     support TESP in the future they would follow the same arrangements). Disbursements would be
     made o n the receipt o f a Withdrawal Application supported by cash flow forecasts as agreed in
                                                              53
the AJR, and financial monitoring reports to account for funds previously advanced.
Disbursements will be at 100% o f budget line items agreed in the AJR up to the budget agreed
for the year. I t should be noted that in the event that activities are being supported from several
funding sources each funding source will be identified as a separate line item in the budget and
coding o f expenditure would reflect this.
From the Foreign currency special accounts the Government o f Tonga will transfer funds, on a
monthly basis equal to the planned contribution from the credit and trust fund, into a special TOP
TESP Financial Security Account (TESPFSA) for release into the Public Fund. The management
o f these transactions shall be the responsibility o f the M o F on the advice o f MoE.
Grants - Donors participating in the TESP will agree to a grant disbursement schedule to the
special TOP TESPFSA account. Partners should make payments on prescribed dates in
agreement with the schedules in their bilateral agreements.
The account will operate on an advance basis. Donors would make firm commitments under the
TESP during the AJR by the end o f December in accordance with the GOTbudget cycle. These
commitments would represent a maximum grant for the next financial year.
The NZAID grants would be made quarterly in advance on the first working day o f specified
months based on the agreed cash flow spread for each year.
The management o f these transactions shall be the responsibility o f the M o F o n the advice o f
MoE.
Reporting o f Expenditure - The GOTS n Accounting System i s being amended to produce
                                           u
reports o f expenditure by source o f financing as and when requested for any period specified.
This facility will be used to generate reports in specified disbursement category formats, based
o n GOTchart o f accounts classifications. The reports will be available to support acquittals o f
grants and withdrawal applications for credits.
The intention is that all TESP financed bills will be paid as they fall due. To facilitate this at least
one month's tagged TESP working capital will be held in the Public Fund at any one time. As
part o f the AJR and budget process the annual support will be spread into a monthly cash flow
plan which will be used to manage the quarterly development partner support and monthly
movement o f funds through GOTcontrolled accounts. M o E will advise the M o F o f agreed TESP
cash flow requirements 2 months in advance so that the M o F can draw down credits and grants
and ensure that authorized M o E TESP bills/vouchers are paid as they fall due.
Special Account - The TESP Special Foreign Currency Accounts will be opened with the
National Reserve Bank o f Tonga.
The chart below summarizes the fund flow arrangements.

Financial Reporting.
In order to enable the Sun Accounting System to automatically track tagged financing,
the financing source and a project code must be recorded on every expenditure request.
At each December AJR M o E and M o F will agree project codes for financed items for the
coming financial year so that reporting can be automatically produced.
Monthly reconciliations and reporting will be produced by source o f finance to enable
managerial review o f the facility and demonstrate that the intended budget support has
been expensed in accordance with the DPHA and financing agreements. Not later than
three weeks after the close o f any month, the M o F will present the M o E with TESP bank
reconciliations and expenditure reports for the month and year to date by source o f funds
by line item. N o t later than 45 days after each quarter sets o f the above reports will be
forwarded direct to the participating donors.
In addition, donors would receive, no later than 6 months after the end o f each financial
year, an annual financial TESP progress report within the overall Annual Report o f the
Ministry o f Education. This will include the independently audited accounts o f the TESP.
An important part o f the TESP i s the provision o f school grants. When funds are paid to a
school as a grant the expenditure will be eligible for funding under the Credit or Trust
Fund. Prior to the first school grant being paid the TESP has identified a number o f
capacity building measures (many o f which will be funded by NZAID bilateral funds).
The measures aim to
           provide MoE with the requisite skills for managing and monitoring the grants
           program
            Provide schools with the skills to apply for and utilize grants effectively
            (including accounting for grants received both to M o E and the school
            community)
            Putting into place technical advisory services which can be called upon by
            schools (as i t is expected that many o f the grants will be used for physical
            works)
Before the first school grant is disbursed there will be an operating manual prepared
which will include arrangements for the promotion o f transparency, accountability and
involvement o f community representatives. The manual will also detail FM arrangements
at both the centre and school level. I t i s recommended that the legal agreement(s) for the
credit and trust fund include a condition that the manual be approved by the Bank prior to
the first disbursement taking place for Grants.
Accounting Policies and Standards - The accounting standard to be used will be
Financial Reporting Under the Cash Basis of Accounting as set out in the International
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The Office o f the Auditor General (OAG)
and M o F need to work together to agree on any accounting standard variations prior to
operation o f the support mechanism. Any such variations will be recorded in the notes to
the accounts.
Auditing
The Office o f the Auditor General under the constitution is mandated to audit the
financial accounts o f the TESP. Specific TESP audited annual reports will be available to

                                              56
donors not later than 6 months after the end o f each GOTfinancial year. The audit reports
will be subject to the same scrutiny process as followed for other reports issued by the
Office o f Auditor General which includes tabling the reports in Parliament. Assurances
will be sought that the OAG is provided with sufficient resources to allow the office to
carry out the marginal increase in responsibilities. The scope o f the audit will be agreed       I

with the OAG through a formal Terms o f Reference which will be subject to agreement
with Donors. The scope o f the Terms o f Reference will extend to the audit o f the school
grants program to ensure that grants have been used for the purposes intended and that
procedures as detailed in the operational manual have been followed.
In addition to the audit to be conducted by the OAG, donors may consider the
commissioning o f an expenditure tracking survey the costs o f which will be met directly
by the donors.
Supervision Plan.
The overall rating for the project i s l o w and it i s envisaged that after the first year o f
operation FM supervision missions would be required at most o n an annual basis. To
minimize costs the missions would be planned to coincide with financial management
supervision o f other projects in Tonga.

                         Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)
A. General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
dated M a y 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement and
the Co-financing Grant Agreement. The general description o f various items under
different expenditure category i s described below. For each contract to be financed by the
Credit or the Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods,
the need for estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are to be agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual
project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

 I. Selection o f Consultants (US$1.8 million, Grant and Credit): The consultant's
 services would consist o f consulting firms, which should assist M o E with the
 implementation and monitoring o f the project. The main contract would be for policy
 development, planning, management and monitoring & evaluation (Component 1). The
 other major contract would be for the grant's program management (Sub-component 2.1).
 Due to the small national consulting industry, short lists o f consultants composed entirely
 o f national consultants shall not be applicable.

        (a) Least-Cost Selection (LCS): For the engineering technical support to be
            provided for minor works under to Sub-component 2.2, a qualified consultant
            firm shall be selected through LCS method under the Grant. The assignment
            i s o f routine nature and the estimated value o f the contract i s small (US$
            90,000).

        (b) Quality Based Selection (QBS): With regards to the assignments related to
            Component 1 and Sub-component 2.1 , high downstream impact activities, the
            recommended method i s QBS. The estimated cost for the contract covering
            policy, planning and monitoring and evaluation i s U S $ 1,028,000 and it would
            be under the Credit and the Grant. The contract for the grant's program
            management would be under the Grant with an estimated cost o f US$
            772,000. The no objection to the Terms o f References and Short L i s t s would
            be a condition for effectiveness.

 1 . Operational Costs (US$136,000, Grant): This item would include
  1
 communications, utilities, stationary, transportation, accommodation and allowances (e.g.
 review meeting with school representatives). This item would follow implementing
 agency's administrative procedures

 1 1 Schools Grants (US$2,792,000, Grant and Credit): The project will finance a
  1.
 number o f activities under the Grants to Schools Sub-component and it will be carried out

                                              58
with the active participation o f the schools/communities. Policy and data analysis
necessary to identify where the needy schools are located, as well as devise the hnding
formulae that could be used to ensure equity in the grants allocation, will be completed
during the project's first year. The remoteness o f some schools is not a major issue from
an implementation perspective, as transportation to these locations i s reasonably
available, but higher costs are expected. In general, both primary and secondary schools
have the necessary implementation capacity. Secondary schools have a comparative
higher capacity. Due to these characteristics, special arrangements (e.g. a phased
approach) will be considered for remote and/or primary schools. The M o E will have a
dedicated Unit to implement the grants Subcomponent and will have a separate Unit to
monitor and evaluate these activities. The selection criteria and the process for allocation,
sample agreements, procurement and disbursement o f the grants shall be in accordance
with the Grants Operational Manual acceptable to the Bank and the following
procedures:

        (a) Community Participation

              i. Goods: Most goods consist o f rehabilitation materials, furniture,
                 teaching materials and other teaching related consumables.

                H      Direct contracting: Because o f the small size o f the individual
                       purchases and since a comparison o f prices may not be practical
                       due to quality and distance considerations, procurement o f
                       materials costing less than US$2,500 per contract may be through
                       direct contracting from local markets or suppliers.

                       Shopping. For goods that are estimated to cost less than
                       US$lO,OOO per contract, a comparison o f three quotations may be
                       required.

             ii. Works: Most grants involve only minor rehabilitation works necessary
                 for school rehabilitation, such as small repairs and adjustments or water
                 and sanitation arrangements.

                       Direct contracting: Because o f the small size o f the individual
                       contracts and since a comparison o f prices may not be practical,
                       procurement o f works costing US$2,500 per contract or less may
                       be through direct labor.

                       Procurement of Small Works: For works estimated to cost US$
                       50,000 per contract or less. Procurement o f such small works may
                       be under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded o n the basis o f
                       quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic
                       contractors in response to written invitations. The invitations for
                       quotation shall include a detailed description o f the works
                       includingbasic specifications, the required completion date, and a
                       form o f agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings
                       where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor
                                              59
                      offering the lowest price quotation for the work and who has
                      experience and the resources to complete the contract successfully.
                      If three qualified contractors are not available within the
                      community area, the contract may be awarded on basis o f two
                      quotations or awarded directly to a sole qualified contractor.

            iii. Individual Consultants: Services to be provided by local consultants
                 will involve training and workshops and will follow the individual
                 selection procedures on the basis o f comparison o f qualifications.

                      Sole Source: Because o f the small size o f the individual contracts
                      and since a comparison o f three qualified candidates may not be
                      practical, selection o f individual consultants costing US$2,500 per
                      contract or less may be through Sole Source.

                      Comparison of three qualified candidates: For individual
                      contracts that are estimated to US$lO,OOO per contract or less, a
                      comparison o f three qualified candidates may be required.

B. Assessment o f the agency's capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by the M o E and there won't be a separate
Project Implementation Unit. The planned Procurement Unit will be composed by 2 full-
time staff that will be appointed by the Director o f Education and will report to the
Deputy Director o f Administration.

An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project has been carried out by Cristiano Nunes in March, 2005. The
assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interaction between the project's staff responsible for procurement and other Government
Agencies.

The following issues and corrective measures have been identified:

       (a) Legal aspects and procurement practices: Only recently formal
           procurement policies and procedures were issued by the Government. These
           policies and procedures are fairly basic. I t should be mentioned that the
           Procurement Reform & Capacity Building Project i s addressing these issues
           and concrete outcomes on this area are expected by the end o f CY2005.

       (b) Procurementcycle management:Procurement plans are not usually
           prepared and the M o E lacks in capacity in this area. (See Action Plan to build
           M o E Capacity - Activity 1 and 4)

       (c) Organization and functions: The M o E has just decided to create a
           Procurement Unit within i t s Administration Department, which will address
           procurement requirements for the entire Ministry. It has also decided to

                                            60
     establish an internal Bids and Award Committee. (See Action Plan to build
     M o E Capacity - Activity 2 and 4)

(d) Support and control systems: Contracts are Subject to auditing by the OAG.
    There is little evidence that the O A G is qualified to review procurement
    aspects o f the contracts. For this reason, it is recommended that the Bank
    should carry out procurement supervision, including ex-post reviews, twice a
    year. As the Project does foresee transfer o f funds schools, making it
    necessary to include in the design o f the project a provision for an
    independent review to ensue that funds are utilized for the intended purposes
    in accordance with the Grants Operational Manual, satisfactory to the Bank,
    which shall be prepared as a condition o f disbursement.

(e) Record-keeping: The appropriate record-keeping infrastructure shall be
    prepared and documents retained at MoE's rooms in accordance with
    procedures to be outlined in the internal manuals and instructions. (See
    Action Plan to build M o E Capacity - Activity 2).

(0   Staffing: At present, the M o E does not have necessary human resources to
     carry out procurement for the proposed project. The planned Procurement
     Unit will be composed by 2 full-time staff that will be appointed by the
     Director o f Education and will report to the Deputy Director o f
     Administration. The MoE will hire an experienced procurement consultant
     that will not only assist the project implementation but also strengthen the
     capacity o f the local procurement staff (See Action Plan to build MoE
     Capacity - Activity 3 and 5). It has been indicated that this activity will be
     financed through NZAID grant funds, and it will constitute a condition o f
     effectiveness o f the Grant and the Credit.

(8) General procurement environment: There is no procurement career stream
    in MoE. The untested arrangements pose great r i s k s and Activity 4 o f the
    action plan that sets up the design o f procurement cycle and arrangements.

                          Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis

                            Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)

Economic Analysis:

Analysis o f budgetary allocations demonstrates the policy and public expenditure management
weaknesses in education financing in Tonga. Government finding for non-salary recurrent
inputs are inadequate at both the primary and secondary levels, with staff costs consuming 96
percent o f the primary and 94 percent o f the secondary recurrent budgets in recent years. This
has resulted in a severe squeeze on the resources available for operations and maintenance and
learning-related inputs, with virtually no allocation at the primary level, and only minimal
allocation at the secondary level. As a result, many primary and secondary schools do not have
the level o f basic resources necessary to provide a high quality o f education. Similarly, the
overall pressure o n the education budget has created a significant bottleneck in access to state
secondary schools. Equity issues consequently prevail, especially with respect to the quality o f
education available to families from low-income groups in the largely non-state secondary sub-
sector, and at the primary level in remote outer islands (Tonga i s however unusual compared to
most Pacific Island Countries, in that there is only limited evidence o f equity concerns at the
primary level).

The proposed TESP will address these quality and equity concerns, mainly through the scheme
of school improvement grants to be provided to both state and non-state schools at the primary
and secondary level. The 2000/01 HIES dataset i s used to estimate the rates o f return to
education in Tonga, as well as analyze equity issues that seem evident at the secondary level.
The economic rationale for this project i s provided by (i) quantifiable demonstration o f high
                                                          the
                                         i)
rates o f return to education in Tonga; ( ilong-term improvements in equity and poverty
outcomes due to the access o f lower-income groups to a better quality o f secondary education;
and (iii) anticipated benefits from internal and external efficiencies gained at the primary and
           the
secondary level by undertaking the policy and education quality related interventions o f the
proposed project.

Economic returns to investing in quality education in Tonga

Methodology. The most common method for estimating the rate o f return to education i s the
Human Capital Earnings Function approach, associated with Professor Jacob Mincer. In this
approach, multiple regression i s used as a tool to estimate the relationship between the log o f
earnings, years o f schooling, years o f workforce experience and experience squared. The
regression coefficient on the variable measuring years o f schooling (SCL) i s interpreted to an
estimate o f the rate o f return to investments in schooling.

Tonga's 2000/01 HIES instrument was not designed to estimate a human capital earnings
function, and very approximate "proxies" have therefore been used as measures o f schooling and

                                                 66
experience in this analysis. There are no direct measures o f schooling collected in the survey
and only four categories of educational attainment exist, i.e., "no schooling," primary,"
"secondary" and "tertiary". Estimates o f schooling and o f experience (derived from age and an
imputed value for schooling) used in this analysis are very imprecise. To compensate for these
data problems, three different specifications o f the income variable are tested with three different
sub-samples, as described below, to assess the robustness o f the estimates.

The HIES contains information on 8,967 individuals, residing in 1,627 households. Of these,
4,191 are in the age group 16-65 whose main activity is not student, disabled, income recipient
or retired, shown as Panel C in Table 1. The following samples are used: (i)  Sample 1 consists
of these 4,191 household members whose main activity i s listed as either employed, seeking
                                    i)
work, doing housework or other; ( iSample 2 excludes those reporting their main occupation as
                                                                i iSample 3 includes only those
"doing housework" and reduces the sample size to 2,962; and ( i )
individuals whose main activity i s reported as "employed"-- this further reduces the sample to
2,648.

The earnings function model i s estimated with three different specifications o f the income

            Income 1 includes salary and wages, interest & dividends, business income and ad
hoc income; it also includes the value o f household production (e.g., agricultural production for

                        Income 2 excludes the value o f household production; and ( i )
includes salaries and wages only.

Results o the analysis. Estimates o f the rate o f return to education are in the range o f 29 to 5 1
          f
percent, depending upon the sample used and the specification o f the income variable (Table 2
below). This i s substantially higher than international estimates. While there may be reason to

o f return to education in Tonga.

I t is also important to note two other caveats in this estimation o f rates o f return. M u c h o f the
retum to education was in the form o f formal sector (wage) employment. The public sector has
historically been the primary formal sector employer in Tonga. With the economic restructuring
that has occurred over the last few years, opportunities for public sector employment have been
substantially reduced. Estimates o f the rate o f return to schooling using the 2000/01 HIES data
may therefore be biased upward when considering investments in the present. On the other
hand, approximately half o f the population o f Tonga emigrates, with many Tongans working
overseas. Their income i s not captured in the HEIS and these individuals are likely to have
substantially higher incomes than residents. Their exclusion would lead to a downward bias in
rate o f return estimates. I t i s not possible to estimate the extent o f either bias and it is assumed
that they are offsetting.

Mitigating poverty and eauitv concerns

Overview. Having achieved universal primary education, there appear to be very minimum
disparities in net primary enrollments in Tonga by wealth quintiles. This creditable achievement
i s not however duplicated at the secondary level, with evidence o f substantial disparity in public
hnding o f secondary education. For instance, approximately 30 percent o f students (who gain

l4These estimates should be treated with some caution for a number o f reasons. First, while the overall model a a   n
the estimated coefficients on predictor variables were a l l statistically significant, the overall explanatory power o f
the model (as measured by R-squared) was extremely low. This i s not surprising given the very limited variability
in the schooling measures (only four categories with extremely small cell sizes, except for secondary). Also, the
proxy measures o f experience and experience squared were imputed, based o n the imprecise education measures.

entrance to fully funded15 government secondary schools in 2002) received an effective subsidy
o f TOP 1,204 (about US$566) per annum while the remaining 70 percent received only TOP
100 (about US$47) an effective differential o f 12 to 1. This differential is doubly burdensome
as i t is generally recognized that, on average, the quality o f educational provision i s inferior in
non-Government secondary schools.

2000/01 HIES data are used to estimate the distribution o f private costs o f secondary education
and the impact on education finance policy and poverty alleviation.16 Analysis o f this data
suggests that the existing system o f finance may be regressive, with students receiving the bigger
subsidy coming from more affluent households (higher wealth quartiles and/or the capital
Nuku'alofa). By providing school quality improvement grants to both state and non-state
secondary schools, TESP will help redress the disparities in the quality o f education provided (a
disproportionately share o f school grants will be provided to non-government secondary schools
in order to address the equity issues identified above). Improved equity and poverty outcomes
hence will be a longer-term benefit o f this project due to the access o f lower-income groups to a
better quality o f education.

Methodology and analysis. The 2000/200 1 HIES contains information on 8,967 individuals,
residing in 1,627 households. Information is collected o n the composition o f households, main
activity o f household member and household expenditure in a range o f expenditure categories.
In 2003, with assistance o f the ADB, the Tonga Department o f Statistics conducted a series o f
analyses to address income and poverty issues in Tonga." The HIES sample i s too small to
calculate income estimates by islands but it was possible to estimate annual per capita
expenditure and household income from wages and salary for three geographic groups
(Nuku'alofa, Rest o f Tongatapu, and Outer Islands). The data show that relative to other areas o f
Tonga, households in Nuku'alofa have an economically advantage, having almost four times the
average annual household wageshalaries o f households in the outer islands.

In the regression model (see Project Files for detailed model and analysis) used to determine the
equity implications o f government funding o f secondary education, it is assumed that
expenditure on education-related items i s determined primarily by the number o f students in a
household. Total household expenditure on education-related inputs was regressed on a series o f
variables reflecting the number o f household members attending primary, secondary and tertiary
school. The regression coefficients on the variable for secondary enrolment can be interpreted as
an estimate o f the cost associated with having one additional household member enrolled in
secondary school.




l5 There i s a nominal fee ranging from TOP 45 to 54 per term charged as tuition fee at Government secondary
schools, depending on the type o f institution. There i s a reduction in fees for the second and third child in the same
household.
l6The Ministry o f Education does not collect information o n the socio-economic status o f students receiving these
higher subsidies and therefore has no basis for assessing the equity implications o f current funding policies andor
their impact o n the national goal o f poverty alleviation.

The summary results o f the analyses18 f two samples (presented in Table 3 below) indicate a
consistent pattern. The analyses show that the burden o f having a student in secondary school in
Nuku'alofa i s significantly lower than in the rest o f Tonga. Similarly, the burden o f having an
additional member o f the household in secondary school for those in the highest income quartile
i s much lower than for those in other income quartiles (Table 3 below). This analysis hence
suggests that Tonga's existing system o f secondary subsidies is regressive and that, o n average,
lower income families are under-represented in government secondary schools. Given the data
limitations, these results cannot be considered exact estimates, but rather as reflecting a relative
order o f magnitude. Moreover, as virtually all secondary schools charge tuition fees (although
there are scholarships and fee exemptions in some church schools), and fees are generally a
minimum o f 100 TOP per pupil per term, the estimates presented in Table 3 are probably biased
downward.

Financial Analysis:

Data in Table 4 highlight the trends in education expenditures in Tonga over the last few years.
Given the recent pressures on the education budget (e.g., as percent o f total public expenditures,
l o w non-salary recurrent expenditures etc.), the Government has thus far been relying o n extemal
donor finances to supplement some o f its important activities. Realizing that this strategy i s not
viable in the long-run, the Government o f Tonga has articulated in i t s EPF the long-term
objective o f "budgetary self reliance" as a key feature o f i t s national vision for the future o f the
education sector. The importance it has placed o n ensuring self-sufficiency and financial
sustainability i s demonstrated by the costing exercise undertaken by the M o E to analyze if the
resource envelope available in the future i s adequate to ensure (i)    "continuity" o f existing
                               i)
services and programs; and ( i"improvement and transformation" o f the sector through the
education reforms proposed in the EPF. While it is creditable that the M o E has undertaken a
rigorous analysis o f the financial sustainability o f its proposed reform program, it must be noted

  The first analysis compares households in Nuku'alofa to the rest o f Tonga. In the second analysis, all households
are divided into four groups based on reported household income. The regression model was estimated separately
for each sample.

  that some o f the assumptions used in the analysis have in retrospect proved to be too optimistic
  (e.g., growth in budgetary allocations to education, growth in GDP etc.). Moreover, the
  Government's EPF in its entirety represents a very ambitious package o f reforms. I t will be
  critical that activities ("cost drivers") identified in the Framework be prioritized, during the
  implementation stage, by level o f long-term impact.. Cost projections for many o f the reform
  activities are also preliminary, and i t is anticipated that further fine-tuning o f these numbers will
  be carried out by the MoE to identify cost-effective options.

   grants to government and non-government primary and secondary schools. The project will also
   be a vehicle for collecting baseline data and measures o f the impact o n learning outcomes o f
   increasing resources for non-salary inputs and strengthening school based management. In the
   medium-term, GOTis looking to donors to bridge the financing gap for the next several years it
   i s expected to take the Tongan economy and the revenue effort to increase the allocation o f
   resources to the education sector, with the view to eventually fully self financing all education
   plans.

   Although the implementation o f the TESP and support for the first phase o f the EPF will increase
   the recurrent costs o f the MoE, it is likely that the Government will be able to sustain this
   increased financing in the longer-term for the following reasons. First, there i s an increased
   realization by the Government o f the importance o f providing quality education to i t s population.
                                                                     71
This is evidenced by the Ministry o f Finance's recent commitment to ensuring that financial
allocations over the next few years to the existing programs o f activity within the M o E will be no
less than their 2004/05 levels-an important commitment which will reverse the prevailing trend
o f declining allocations to education. I t is expected that government revenues will increase over
time and greater allocations will subsequently be made to education. Second, i t can be assumed
that resources freed up from efficiency improvement^'^ anticipated from the project will be
reallocated to quality related interventions (especially continuing the school grants program).
Third, the anticipated benefits from the project in terms o f improved leaming outcomes,
community participation in delivering services, and other successes associated with school-based
management, will likely create a very real on-the-ground demand from communities for a
continued grants program. This stakeholder demand may make it difficult for the Government to
reverse the precedent o f providing school grants.




    Efficiency gains are anticipated due to better public expenditure management at the central level from improved
policies and institutional strengthening; intemal and extemal efficiencies associated with successful implementation
o f the school quality improvement grants; improved student-teacher ratios which would reduce the proportion o f the
recurrent budget allocated to salariedwages etc.

                                Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues
                             Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)

Environmental Safeguards
The proposed project is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.
However, as minor school rehabilitation or maintenance i s expected to be a feature in school's
development plans, comprehensive guidelines will be developed for this and technical support
provided to ensure that grants are spent wisely and civil works undertakenmeet all required
environment safeguard standards and applicable buildings codes. Best practices fi-om other
school grants programs around the world will also be reflected in the guidelines. This will be
included in the GOM. At the primary school level, school rehabilitationlmaintenance i s expected
to be completed by the community and not by a contractor, except in exceptional cases. At the
secondary level, contracting out school rehabilitation will be permitted, but the school will have
to provide TESP with evidence, via the school's three year rolling development plan, that the
proposed rehabilitation or construction i s too complex or too large for the school's community to
complete themselves (see Attachment to this Annex on Environmental Management
Framework).

Social Safeguards
I t i s not anticipated that any social safeguards issues will be triggered under the project. There
will be no land acquisition or resettlement, nor is i t anticipated there will be cultural property
issues.

Social Assessment

The key social issues in education in Tonga are the overall difficulties faced by schools with
respect to adequate maintenance, provision o f supplies and other educational inputs, leading to
what are perceived by communities as gradually deteriorating educational outcomes, lower
quality o f education in remote, outer islands, important differences in performance at secondary
level between government and non-government schools and unusual gender issues.

Primary education is overwhelmingly provided by government schools, but funding has been
inadequate to allow the schools to maintain facilities, adequately implement curriculum or
provide sufficient materials. This has led to a disproportionate burden placed on the schools
themselves and, in particular, the communities in which the schools are located. Local Parent
Teacher Associations are very active in almost every region o f the country. PTAs provide
unusually large inputs o f labour, materials and finding to enable primary schools to operate at
even basic levels. In some cases PTAs and communities have even provided the buildings
themselves in which primary schools operate in the absence o f government's ability to construct
new facilities for areas in which population is increasing rapidly. An important goal o f the
project will be to reduce the direct burden on the community, while at the same time maintaining
the admirable level o f community commitment to and engagement in promoting good
educational outcomes.



                                                  73
At the secondary level the situation i s reversed, with non-government (almost exclusively
church) schools providing access to almost three-quarters o f secondary students. However, those
who score highest on the SEE (Secondary Entrance Examination) are accepted into government
secondary schools which are better resourced and perform better o n form 5 and 6 exams for
advancement, While all secondary schools suffer from problems with maintenance and
educational inputs, these problems are significantly more serious in non-government schools and
the most pressing need is for resources to bring those schools up to the standard o f the
government secondary schools. Currently church groups and parents provide significant inputs
into church secondary schools, but despite these efforts they remain inferior in quality.

Equity o f access i s reasonably good across the various regions o f Tonga with respect to primary
school, but s t i l l could be improved. Every island with five or more children o f primary school
age i s entitled to a primary school, and in most cases this guideline appears to be met. However,
conditions are often very difficult in the smaller schools in the poorer outer islands with virtually
no materials, badly deteriorated or locally built facilities and not fully qualified staff. Outer
islands have lower pass rates from primary to secondary school, and the majority o f students
receive no education beyond that level. There i s a need for both improved quality in the outer
islands, as well as for changes in curriculum such that education includes important l i f e skills,
particularly in areas such as agricultural techniques, key health issues and additional vocational-
related instruction. The situation with respect to secondary schools has been noted above, with
the key need the equalization o f resources available to government and non-government schools.

Gender equity i s an issue in Tonga, but it i s the opposite o f most countries in that girls tend to
perform better than boys at the primary level, with the result that girls outnumber boys in the
more prestigious government secondary schools, while boys outnumber girls in the
comparatively under-resourced non-government secondary schools. Access to primary school i s
close to 100% for both boys and girls. There is a need to better understand the reasons for the
lower levels o f achievement o f boys at the primary level and to implement strategies to improve
their performance.

K e y social development outcomes will be:
             Improved quality o f education at the primary level leading to improved test score in
             the SEE.
     w       Improved equity in primary education, leading to closing o f the gap between
             performance in poorer, particularly remote outer island schools and those schools in
             the larger islands and population centres
     w       Improved overall performance at the secondary level, and closing o f the gap in
             performance between government secondary schools and non-government secondary
             schools.
             Improved perfonnance o f males vis-a-vis females at the primary level, reflected in
             improved test scores for males o n the SEE.
             Provision o f more relevant education with respect to life skills at the primary level

K e y stakeholders in the project include government, churches and other non-government
providers, and teachers, parents, students and the larger community at the local level.
Consultations have been held with all key stakeholders, including with communities (teachers,
parents, students, PTAs, etc.) as a part o f preparation. These consultations have identified some


                                                  74
o f the critical constraints to effective delivery o f educational services, and some o f the priorities
o f people at the local level with respect to improving delivery.

Over the course o f the project, local level consultations will be an important part o f both project
implementation and the monitoring and evaluation process. Community groups, including the
PTA, will take an active part in determining local priorities for the use o f the school grants, and
will participate in both implementation and in monitoring results. PTAs and other local groups
will make significant contributions in terms o f time and labor to local programs for improvement
o f school facilities and outcomes. Qualitative assessment o f the success o f the project through
consistent consultation with local communities will be an important part o f the monitoring and
evaluation system.

During preparation consultations have been held with key civil society organizations, including
women's organizations, youth groups and a variety o f other community organizations and
groups. Consultation will continue with these groups during implementation and as a part o f the
monitoring and evaluation process.

Key Project Indicators (see Annex 3) will be regularly monitored throughout the life o f the
project in order to ensure that the social development objectives o f the project will be achieved.
Initially, monitoring will be carried out by an Independent Monitor which, with the assistance o f
MoE, will establish baseline data for all indicators. Over the course o f the project the MoE will
oversee M&E, and will be gradually strengthened through capacity building activities so it can
take increasing responsibility for M&E. M&E will include qualitative assessment o f progress
towards intended outcomes through regular consultation with school personnel (government and
non-government) as well as parents, students and community members.

              Environmental Management Framework: Description and M a t r i x

The attached Environmental Management Framework (EMF) describes the TESP School Grants
Program and how it will be managed and monitored to ensure that TESP-financed school
rehabilitation and maintenance do not have any adverse environmental impact.

The T E S P School Grants Program

The TESP i s designed to improve the quality o f schooling for all primary and secondary students
in Tonga, particularly those that are disadvantaged in terms o f access to quality schooling. To
achieve this TESP will both develop a mechanism for consistent and equitable improvements in
schooling for all children and a means to improve the quality o f education by empowering
schools and their communities.

Part o f the TESP i s the Tonga school grants program (TSGP). Starting in January 2007,
TSGP will provide annual grants to primary and secondary schools -both Government and non-
Government - to finance the non-salary inputs that schools and their communities feel are
necessary to improve both the quality o f services they provide and the educational outcomes they
and their students achieve. The TSGP will provide a disproportionate amount o f grant funds to
Tonga's most disadvantaged schools (these will be identified through an objective independent
assessment o f school services throughout the Kingdom). By providing additional support to the
most disadvantaged schools it i s intended that over time these schools will be able to provide
quality services equivalent to those offered by the schools that are currently the most advantaged.
The goal o f TSGP i s to assist schools and their communities to develop their schools so that they
at least meet, and hopefully exceed, the national minimum quality standards that are being
developed under TESP. Over the course o f TESP all primary and junior secondary schools will
participate in the TSGP. In terms o f financing change at the primary school level, it i s expected
that TESP will make little distinction between government and non-government schools.
However, at the secondary level, where inequity is most obvious, a disproportionate allocation o f
project resources will be directed towards non-government schools.

Although TSGP grants will be available to all primary and secondary schools, they are provided
in exchange for a measurable improvement in school-based processes and conditions for
improved school and student performance. In other words, TSGP is results-based and recipient
schools will have to commit to upgrading services and improving outcomes. Assistance from
TESP will help schools to meet these obligations

As part o f TESP, the Government will finance the strengthening o f school management capacity.
In an ongoing process, with increased emphasis on schools planning for results and on removing
inequities in access to quality schooling, the project will fund the training o f head teachers,
teachers and community members in school-based management techniques and processes. In the
first year o f the project, each school will develop the capacity to assess i t s needs in respect to
meeting minimum service standards set by Government. At this point TSGP will require each
school to engage their community to set school improvement goals and annual output targets and
to include these in a 3-year rolling development plan. TESP will focus a disproportionate
amount o f effort and resources o f strengthening the capacity o f underserved and disadvantaged

                                                 76
schools to identify their needs in this regard and on assisting them to assess how best they can
meet required standards utilizing TSGP grants. All schools will receive a Grants Operational
Manual (GOM), technical assistance and a small grant to prepare their first three-year school
development rolling plan and budget.

The amount o f each TSGP grant will be governed by a hnding formula that reflects: (i)
                  i)
enrollment; ( ithe extent to which the school meets or exceeds the national quality standards;
    i ithe
( i ) degree to which the school is disadvantaged and/or its community i s under-served; and
(iv) needs expressed in the school's three year rolling development plan. As noted above, during
i t s first years TSGP will substantially favor the most disadvantaged schools by providing
financing for much needed minor rehabilitation and maintenance and the purchase o f school
quality related items (books, teaching aids, short-term teacher training, etc) that are currently in
short supply or non-existent. A TSGP GOM (detailing all aspects o f TSGP) will be provided to
each TESP stakeholder well in advance o f the payment o f grants to schools.

TESP financed school rehabilitation and maintenance

As school rehabilitation or maintenance" is expected to be a prominent feature in many schools'
development plans, comprehensive guidelines will be developed for this and technical support
provided to ensure that the grants are spent wisely and that school rehabilitation projects meet all
required environment safeguard standards and applicable building codes21. Best practices from
other school grants programs around the world will also be reflected in the GOM. At the
primary school level, school rehabilitatiodmaintenance i s expected to be completed by the
community and not by a contractor, except in exceptional cases. At the secondary level,
contracting out school rehabilitation will be permitted, but the school will have to provide TESP
with evidence, via the school's three year rolling development plan, that the proposed
rehabilitation or construction is too complex or too large for the school's community to complete
themselves.

Where school rehabilitation is conducted by the community, substantial technical assistance will
be provided. The Government o f Tonga will hire professional civil works engineers to provide
technical advice and to comprehensively monitor all schools that decide to use their grants for
any type o f rehabilitation or maintenance work. (TSGP will not finance new construction.)

Critical to the success o f the TSGP i s an adherence to Government o f Tonga's environmental
safeguards and building codes and the environmental guidelines o f the Donors that are
financing TESP. Specifically, in respect to TESP-financed school rehabilitation and
maintenance, the project i s concerned about:

2o
    Minor to moderate rehabilitation and repairs (maintenance) can be financed from the grants. Grant-financed
rehabilitation w i l l be limited to replacinghpgrading parts o f damaged structures such as roofs, internal and external
walls, doors and door frames, windows and window frames, and water and sanitation facilities. The grants,
however, w i l l not be adequate to finance major rehabilitation such as reconstruction o f classrooms, administration
rooms or toilet blocks.

21 GOTapproved building codes and environmental safeguard standards and the environmental safeguard standards
o f the development partners (NZAID and the World Bank) will apply. Relevant information from these sources w i l l
be included in the TSGP GOM.


                                                           77
    .
    m
          The use o f appropriate rehabilitatiodmaintenance techniques.
          The placement o f sanitation facilities.
          Sewage disposal techniques
          The disposal o f building waste.
          Complications concerning asbestos material in existing construction.

In order to substantially lessen the chance that any o f the above concems will develop into a
problem at any school site, the project is taking a number o f mitigating measures:

          The Government o f Tonga will contract qualified local civil works engineers to
          provide advice on and to monitor school and community managed school
          rehabilitation.
          The TSGP GOM will detail the nature o f the project's five listed environmental
          concerns (listed above) and provide suggestions o n how to address each in the process
          o f rehabilitation.
          Schools undertaking rehabilitation will submit a site rehabilitation proposal that
          includes drawings and descriptions o f planned activities in respect to any o f the above
          five concerns that may apply to their site. (Guidance and assistance will be provided by
          the GOTcontracted civil engineers.)

The civil works engineers will be required to visit each school that undertakes a rehabilitation
program a minimum o f four times. The four visits will include a visit during the planning
process, two visits during rehabilitation and one visit o n completion - at which time they will be
required to sign o f f (i.e. provide approval) o f completed works. Schools undertaking simple
maintenance will be required to visited at least twice; once before to receive guidance and once
on completion o f the work. Site monitoring records will be submitted to the Government every
three months. The extent to which building codes apply and civil works guidance i s required
during the work will be determined o n a school-by-school basis. If schools are only undertaking
minor maintenance, it anticipated that they will only require a single visit to the school to
provide pre-activity guidance and an explanation o f the relevant parts o f the GOM.

The attached matrix summarizes these concerns and how they will be addressed by TESP.

     Annex 14: Cluster 2, the NZAID Grant Financed contribution to the Tonga Education
                                    Support Program22
                                   Tonga Education Support Project (TESP)


Structure of the TESP

The Tonga Education Support Program (the Program) consists o f two clusters o f activities.
Cluster 1, The Tonga education Support Project (TESP), financed jointly by the World Bank and
NZAID, focuses o n establishing an intervention at the school level to ensure equitable provision
o f universal basic education. This i s a major initiative under the Universal Basic Education
reforms o f the Education Policy Framework (EPF). Cluster 2, financed solely by NZAID, also
supports the Universal Basic Education reforms o f the EPF and includes teacher education,
curriculum development, assessment and school examinations, skills development together with
support for strengthened sector coordination, policy and planning. This annex refers
specifically to Cluster 2.

Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The development objectives o f Cluster 2 are as follows:

      primary and secondary school curriculum reformed;
      literacy outcomes o f schooling strengthened;
      assessment for better learning strengthened;
      quality o f teaching improved;
      education policy, planning, monitoring and evaluation strengthened;
      education sector policy dialogue improved;
      education management strengthened and capacity within the sector improved;
      progress towards establishing key features o f a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP);
      further development o f I C T in education;
      teacher supply and conditions o f service improved; and
      improved efficiencies within the sector.

Both Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 will benefit primary and secondary school children in Tonga,
particularly those that are disadvantaged in terms o f access to quality schooling. To achieve this
objective the project i s financing changes in the way the education system i s managed,
monitored and resourced. Over the longer term improvements in educational outcomes are
envisaged as project inputs are realized and take effect. These should translate into broader
social and economic benefits.

Key Outcome

The key outcome o f Cluster 2 will be to foster a policy and financing environment in which
teachers can operate effectively, and students can participate and achieve to a high standard.


22   The text o f this annex was provided by NZAID. I t has been edited to conform with the text o f the main document


                                                          83
Cluster 2 will assist the GOTto ensure that the education system i s able to respond quickly and
effectively to social and economic trends as they emerge, and can meet the diverse needs o f
different communities, employers, and the wider society.

Under Cluster 2, with the support o f NZAID, major reforms will be implemented by the GOTin
curriculum, assessment and teacher policy that support the equitable provision o f quality basic
education. As mandated under the Universal Basic Education reforms in the EPF, the Ministry
o f Education will have the incentive and opportunity to become more efficient through increased
capacity and responsibility for managing resources. The education system will progress to a
"level playing field" in which Govemment (and other stakeholders) will finance "outputs" and
"outcomes," rather than inputs. The MOE will move rapidly to implementing the principles o f
program budgeting.

The Tonga Education support Program overall will improve sector management by supporting a
more critical process o f assessing policy options in key areas, based o n sound technical analysis
o f reliable data and effective system reporting, and more substantially linking policy to expected
benefits and costs. By institutionalizing results-based management and financing to schools and
to the sector, TESP provides the impetus for sector programs to reach beyond the provision o f
services to establishment o f quality services and improved outcomes.

K e y Project Indicators

Although TESP i s a five-year project, NZAID support for Cluster 2 is confirmed to the first three
years only - the fourth and fifth years are supported by NZAID indicatively. The Tonga
Education Support Program offers the Government the opportunity to assess movement towards
meeting i t s objectives over a reasonable timeframe, though i t may be unrealistic to expect
improved learning outcomes by the end o f the project.23 Over the course o f the Program,
policies, resource allocations and anticipated outcomes will be expressed in a p o l i c y h a n c i n g
matrix that will be used by project monitors to guide regular appraisals o f the policy
environment, expenditures and results.24 In addition, six general indicators will gauge progress
towards achieving the development objective and guide project monitoring and evaluation,
discussed in detail in Annex 3:

(i)       Policies and mechanisms are adopted that provide all schools with access to School
          Grants. A school financing policy framework will be developed, to include policy and
          guidelines o n School Grants, school-level multi-year planning and budgeting, and
          funding formulas that provide access to funds adequate to equalize services across
          schools (primary and secondary).



23 The establishment and credible maintenance o f an education management information system (EMIS) in the MoE w i l l be a
vital contribution to the MoE, and will be the basis for monitoring the key outcome indicators like net enrollment rates,
repetition, dropout and transition rates, student performance in P I L L tests etc.

24K e y to the successful application o f the policy matrix for this purpose will be: a commitment to key Program policies and
practices, equity-based school grants, for example; regular reporting o f the full costs o f education in both the government and
non-government sectors; student achievement measurement and monitoring; system performance monitoring; and a commitment
by the Govemment to realizing system efficiencies (less costly student to teacher ratios, for example).


                                                               84
       Management capacity is strengthened at the M o E and school levels to: (a) assess school
       needs; (b) determine and prioritize policies and allocate budget thereafter; and (c)
       implement and assess the progress under the project and communicate with stakeholders.
       Quality assessment systems are established. The minimum service standards (MSS) are
       established and applied at primary and secondary schools. The procedures and capacities
       for assessing compliance with M S S are developed.
       Resources are allocated more equitably. MoE's capacity i s strengthened in public
       expenditure management, policy making, and monitoring and evaluation.
       Performance based programming is established. Schools manage resources effectively to
       meet MSS.
       An upward trend in educational outcomes, both academic and non-academic, for students
       in schools. The upward trend is monitored by indicators, such as net enrollment rates,
       repetition, dropout, and transition rates, and student test performance.

The Tonga Education Support Program i s results focused. Investments under Cluster 2 are
directly targeted at establishing a results oriented system.

Cluster 2 will provide financing and technical assistance to the Ministry o f Education to support
key reforms o f curriculum, assessment and teacher policy under EPF Goal 1 (Universal Basic
Education). In addition, Cluster 2 resources will be used to support strengthened literacy
outcomes and to improve the quality o f teaching. These activities will complement and reinforce
the support provided to primary and secondary schools - both Government and non-Government
- under Cluster 1 that is being used to finance the inputs necessary to improve the quality o f
services they provide. In addition, NZAID's finding o f Cluster 2 will also support the
achievement o f EPF Goal 3 (Improvement o f Education Management) and complement the IDA
credit o f US$1 million (under Cluster 1) that will fund all the policy development and capacity
building necessary for the implementation o f TSGP. NZAID's support for EPF Goal 3 under
Cluster 2 will include the fbnding of an international Education Sector Coordinator for a period
o f three years and the design, development and establishment o f a Tonga Education Management
Information System (TEMIS). NZAID grant financing will also support the implementation o f
TESP sub-programs that strengthen management, build capacity, improve the supply o f teachers
and their terms and conditions of service and improve efficiencies. The various components to
be supported under Cluster 2 are briefly described below.

Goal 1: Universal Basic Education

A. Curriculum Reform (US$ 1,072,000)

The Curriculum Reform sub-program activities will help the GOTto achieve the desired policy
outcomes o f the Tonga primary and junior secondary school curriculum preparing students to
live fulfilling lives, being o f high quality, promoting student achievement at a high level, and
meeting individual and national needs. The MoE managed Cluster 2 curriculum reform process


.
will lead to the production and delivery of:


.   a curriculum framework;


.
    a revised syllabi;


.
    a new generation o f learning materials;


.
    a new generation o f in-service teacher training programmes;
    improved school broadcasting programmes based o n the new curriculum and syllabi; and
    the co-location o f curriculum and assessment units.

B. Strengthen Literacy Outcomes (US$294,000)

Under this Cluster 2 sub-program the M o E will review existing policies o n languages, literacy,
and bilingualism. I t will then develop a comprehensive policy that covers languages, literacy,
bilingualism, and language o f instruction, including use o f diagnostic instruments at an early
stage o f primary schooling to identify students with literacy problems. The new policy will
include provision for intensive retraining o f teachers, and development and distribution o f
learning resources (graded readers and quality books) in both Tongan and English.

To support the new language policy, significant investment will be provided in appropriate in-
service training to develop skills in teaching literacy in both Tongan and English by early
childhood and primary school teachers. This investment i s intended to ensure that primary
school teachers will be adequately trained and appropriately skilled to meet the stated Tongan


                                                 86
and English language objectives. The activities h n d e d under this sub-program o f Cluster 2 will
include:

   reviewing language and bilingualism policy and training programmes;
   reviewing and revise the National Strategic Plan (Literacy & Numeracy);
   developing a system o f objective measures and benchmarks;
   developing improved early diagnostic methods & train teachers;
   piloting o f a reading recovery programme;
   producing Tongan language learning materials;
   delivering teacher in-service programmes to improve literacy teaching;
   increasing opportunities for students to learn other languages; and
   continuing the monolingual Tongan Dictionary project.

C. Assessment for Better Learning (US$235,000)

Under this component the M o E will broaden the assessment system in Tonga to ensure a wider
range o f students' skills and abilities i s assessed, by:

   developing national assessment policy through the establishment o f an Assessment Review
   Working Party, including representation fi-om the South Pacific Board for Educational
   Assessment, to review the current school assessment system and report to the Director, MoE;
   reporting the findings o f the Assessment Review Working Party to the independent Tonga
   National Qualifications and Accreditation Board which will have oversight o f all
   qualifications in Tonga (once legislation i s passed and this Board is established);
   producing an assessment handbook for teachers;
   phasing out the Secondary Entrance Examination at Year 6 (Class 6) and replacing it in the
   short t e r m with an examination at the end o f compulsory education at Year 8 (Form 2) to
   select entrants for secondary schools, which would then cater for Year 9 (Form 3) and above,
   in the medium to longer term, examining the feasibility o f removing the Secondary Entrance
   Examination completely and allowing social promotion to year 11 (form 5) with selection to
   secondary schools (beginning at year 9 (form 3)) determined by a combination o f school-
   determined criteria and geographic zoning;
   developing and applying assessment instruments across the early primary years to assist with
   diagnosing learning difficulties and remediation strategies; and
   monitoring and supporting the regional qualification for year 13 (form 7 ) developed by the
   South Pacific Board for Educational Assessment, and the CIE (Cambridge International
   Examinations), introduced in 2004 to replace the N e w Zealand University Bursaries
   examination.

D. School Grants Program (US$950,000)

Refer to TESP for details.

E. Improve the Quality o Teaching (US$I,572,000)
                        f

The anticipated policy outcome o f this component i s that all teachers in Tonga are well qualified,
trained, committed and competent, and are able to motivate and encourage all students to learn.


                                                 87
Teaching will be perceived as an attractive profession and held in high regard by the community,
and teachers o f quality will fill all teaching positions.

The key investments to be supported under this component o f Cluster 2 will primarily include
activities designed to strengthen the Tonga Institute o f Education (TIOE), including:

    establishing a "twinning" arrangement between TIOE and an accredited overseas provider for


.
    the development and delivery o f teacher education degree programmes;


.
m   strengthening o f in-service programmes;
    development o f improved facilities at TIOE; and
    the introduction o f improved access to Bachelor o f Education degree programmes (or
    Bachelor o f Teaching degree programmes) for existing teachers.

Goal 3: Improvement of Management of Education

F. Strengthen Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$l,008,000)

This component will develop a capacity within M o E to critically analyze policy options, to
establish project priorities and to develop project specific rolling plans based o n sector priorities,
assessed project performance (results), the efficient allocation o f resources and consultative
dialogue with stakeholders. The NZAID funding o f US$700,000 under Cluster 2 will


.
complement the funding of US$1,044,000 under TESP and will primarily consist o f support for:

    an Intemational Education Sector Coordinator for a period o f three years to assist the
    Ministryo f Education with the planning, monitoring and coordination o f the Program and the
    building o f Sector Coordination capacity within the Ministry; and
    the improvement of decision-making, planning, budgeting and resource allocation within the
    education system through the development and establishment o f an Education Management
    Information System (EMIS) incorporating all management and technical arrangements and
    systems for effective school, teacher and student data collection, analysis and reporting at
    national and local levels.

This sub-component will also focus on the development and running o f annual education sector
reviews, including the monitoring and updating o f three year rolling plans (MoE Corporate
Plans) that detail sector investments and performance objectives (results) at both the national and
school levels. These sector reviews will also contribute to the development o f annual plans and
budgets within the framework of the EPF and the Corporate Plans and the wider planning and
budget process o f the Government of Tonga. This component will also support the strengthening
o f resource management capacity in the M o E at the sector level. I t will finance: (i)  technical
assistance; (ii)                            i iannual special studies o n selected aspects o f EPF
                sector monitoring costs; ( i )
implementation; (iv) training o f staff at various levels o f the sector in education policy, planning,
financing and monitoring and evaluation; and (v) a mid term review o f both TESP and Cluster 2
activities in year 3.

G. Policy Dialogue (US$66,000)

In this sub-component, NZAID will finance Consultative Fora that will facilitate an effective
policy dialogue between the MoE, other concerned agencies in GOT,such as the Ministry o f
                                                   88
Finance, private providers o f education services, representatives o f local government,
representatives o f teachers, heads o f key education institutions, representatives o f regional
education institutions and agencies, representatives o f civil society, representatives o f employers
and industry, representatives o f the media, other key stakeholders and representatives o f donors
and multilateral technical assistance agencies.

The cornerstone o f the partnership between the GOTand its donors in education is the annual
education sector review. This component will support these annual events and will also support


.
other institutional arrangements associated with the partnership, including:


.
.
    the Education Sector Committee;
    Deputy Directors Quarterly Reporting to Director, MOE; and
    Task Forces or Working Groups that may be formed to work on key policy areas.

H. Strengthen Management (US$317,000)

During the first three years, the program will focus on strengthening M o E capacity in policy
development, planning and monitoring, and on strengthening information systems and
utilization. The Ministry o f Education will restructure its administration and management in
order to strengthen its policy development role, i t s administrative structure, and its capacity to
deliver education more effectively. The policy development and policy analysis roles o f the
Ministry o f Education will be strengthened, so that its administrative structure meets the newly
proposed national requirements, and so that its efficiency is increased.

By the end o f year 3, the M o E will have a fully staffed policy, planning and monitoring capacity
with information and staff skills appropriate to this function. The EMIS will be fully hnctional
to support these activities at all levels o f the system, including school and classroom
management (see above). The M o E will have developed a comprehensive and detailed plan for
the next Phase o f the 15 year EFP, including modalities and conditions for moving to external
budgetary support, if this i s determined to be the preferred approach. The investments in each o f
the 17 main EPF Policy Areas under the Tonga Education Support Program in years 1,2 and 3
will have been implemented, monitored and evaluated and this will constitute an important input
into continuing the strategic planning process.

J. Capacity Building (US$300,000)

The plan under this sub-program i s to initiate capacity building activities through a combination
o f project support and earmarked grant funds. During the first phase, the M o E will develop the
necessary capacity to move forward in the remaining years covered by the EPF, without relying
on projectised donor support. While data collection and analysis tasks will be supported under
the development o f the EMIS, responsibility for policy making on the basis o f E M I S reporting
will be solely with the MoE. The Ministry will invest time and staff in order to "engage" with
the implications o f information and reporting that will be produced by EMIS. The benefit o f this
approach i s that the quantitative data and analyses, needed to operationalize and implement the
EPF and to "validate the intervention logic," will be produced relatively quickly under EMIS.

In this sub-program, TESP will finance:


                                                  89
.
.
.
    assessment o f skill needs to implement the MOE EPF and Corporate Plan;
    appointment o f key staff (Deputy Director, & policy, I T & property analysts);


.
    training o f staff (including policy analysts, I T specialists, & property staff);
a   capacity building activities; and
    implementation activities and support services.

K. Transition to SWAP (US$76,000)

In the course o f years 1, 2 and 3, the MOE will develop all needed capacity and obtain
information required to design and implement a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) for the
remaining 12 years o f the EPF period. In this sub-program, NZAID will finance activities


.
designed to achieve the following conditions:


.
.
    a comprehensive sector policy framework;
    a sectoral expenditure programme;
    a sound macro-economic framework with sector and macro expenditure consistent;


.
    Government led donor coordination within these frameworks, with common implementation
    and management arrangements and the use o f Government systems; and
    the participation o f key stakeholders.

L. Information and Communication Technology (US$SO,000)

With the support o f this component the M o E will consider the options available for developing
the capacity o f the education system to produce information and communications technology
(ICT) skills that are and will be required for economic development and growth. This work will
be coordinated with the Curriculum Reform sub-program.

The capacity o f the Ministry o f Education and other providers to use information to improve
management, planning, policy analysis and monitoring will also be supported under this sub-
program in coordination with the work o n the design, development and establishment o f TEMIS
(see para. 16 above). This will include staff training for all those Ministry o f Education staff and
teaching personnel who are not confident or competent in the use o f ICT.
Strategies to support multi-grade teaching, distance education and computer-assisted learning
will be supported under this component. The Ministry will also explore options for using new
technology to increase pupil: teacher ratios to economic levels. For some parts o f the education
sector, I C T solutions will probably be the only financially viable strategy for delivering a range
o f learning options to a small population. The cost-effectiveness o f overseas scholarships will
also be carefully examined with reference to changes in the availability o f ICT-based
alternatives.

M. Improve Teacher Supply and Conditions o Service (US$l17,000)
                                          f

With the support o f this component the MOE will set up a team to identify the information
required to predict short and longer term teacher supply needs in Tonga, and to develop
appropriate policies on teacher supply and quality. The M O E will also document the existing
situation in Tonga with respect to teacher supply needs. Interventions that the Government will
consider include:

                                                  90
   appointing a teacher recruitment officer to attract young people into the teaching profession;
   a public relations exercise to promote the teaching profession;
   a review o f teacher remuneration policies;
   revitalizing the Tonga graduate teacher preparation program;
   a regional teacher recruitment program that targets expatriate teachers from elsewhere in the
   Pacific;
   developing alternative school-based models of teacher training using a mentor system;
   introducing more contestability into the teacher education "market" by freeing up controls on
   TIOE and possibly allowing other providers to train teachers;
   targeted (and bonded) scholarships for secondary teachers to study overseas, who then return
   to teach in Tonga;
   approaches to donors for assistance with a specific proposal for a teacher support program;
   incentives to attract previous teachers back into the teaching profession;
   review o f policies to upgrade skills o f unqualified teachers; and
   initiation o f a program to up s k i l l existing teachers.

During the first three years of the Tonga Education Support Program, the M o E will focus on
identifgng factors related to the supply o f and demand for teachers (with specialized skills) at
different levels of the system. Special emphasis will be placed on issues o f remuneration and the
implications o f devolution of authority for staffing decisions to institutions. By the end o f year
3, the M o E will have reliable information needed to develop a coherent and financially
sustainable strategy for balancing pupil: teacher ratios, conditions o f service, and support for
non-salary operating inputs to maximize system efficiency. Initial estimates o f the recurrent cost
implications o f teacher upgrading and modest improvements in terms and conditions (to be
considered for implementation in years 4 and 5 and beyond) will be based o n an initial workshop
exercise using the cost projectionhesource envelope simulation model.

Over the same period, the M o E will examine these issues within the framework o f on-going
labor market analyses, plans for expansion o f vocational/technical training, trends in teachers'
wages, projections o f the education labor market, and analyses o f the cost implications o f teacher
upgrading and salary increases. The M o E will develop a coherent, information-based strategy to
ensure supply o f adequately trained and motivated teachers. This work will be undertaken in
close collaboration with the Public Service Commission and the Ministry o f Finance. The
following investments will be supported under this sub-program:

   analysis o f school population projections and trends over a ten-year time frame.
   study o f patterns in teacher retention, mobility, and loss rates.
   time series analysis o f real (inflation-corrected) teacher wage patterns.
   data base on numbers and location o f teachers in the community pool.
   tracer studies o f new teacher trainees.
   analysis o f trends in advertisements for teacher vacancies.
   analysis o f time series data o n intake at TIOE.
   study o f changes in the attitudes o f a sample o f secondary students regarding the teaching
   profession.
   improvements in the Tonga graduate teacher preparation program.
   identification o f options and incentives to introduce more "contestability" into the teacher
   education market.
                                                 91
Anticipated outputs and outcomes are:


.   a comprehensive "model" o f teacher supply and demand, under a range o f assumptions.
    analysis o f the long-term cost implications of teacher upgrading and improvements in
    remuneration in the context o f possible savings related to improved teacher pupil ratios.
H
    a detailed plan for strengthening TIOE within the framework o f a reorganised system o f
    tertiary education under the Tonga Institute o f Education;
    identification and costing of options to increase alternative modes o f teacher training
    provision.

Management of Cluster 2 Activities

N: Implementation

The N e w Zealand Government will support the MOE's implementation o f its Education
Planning Framework, as outlined in i t s key documents. This partnership will reinforced through
the ESC, AJR and a December 2007 mid term review (MTR).

0: F i n ancing Arrangements including Procurement

The N e w Zealand's Government's bilateral grant component (Cluster 2) will be paid in quarterly
tranches as direct earmarked budget support to the Tongan Government. The quarterly cash flow
required to finance agreed earmarked activities will be agreed in the December AJR, as informed
by the ESC April and September meetings.

The Government o f N e w Zealand (NZAID) will contribute the agreed NZD$8.4million over
three years, commencing 2005/06 into a special TOP Tonga Education Support Program
Financial Security Account (TESPFSA). Funds will be drawn down on the basis o f the approved
cash flow timetable upon the authority o f the Deputy Director Administration, as delegated by
the Director Education.

Auditing will follow the arrangements set out in Annex 7

Procurement associated with N e w Zealand's Government's bilateral grant component (Cluster 2)
will be harmonized with World Bank processes agreed for TESP.

P: Reporting

Monitoring and Evaluation o f Cluster 2 activities will be harmonized with the processes agreed
for TESP, and reinforced by the finctions o f MoE, ESC and AJR.
