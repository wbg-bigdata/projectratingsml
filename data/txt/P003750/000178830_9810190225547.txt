REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $37.0 million to
help finance the Fourth Education Project. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including six years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Indonesia:    Development
Prospects and Needs" of April 15, 1975 (708-IND) described and analyzed
the structure of production and incomes, the recent changes in the avail-
ability of resources, and the medium and longer-term outlook for the In-
donesian economy. Coumtry data are shown in Annex 1.
3.        In 1969, at the start of Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan,
the per capita income of the Indonesian population was probably no higher
than half a century ago. A majority of the population lived below a mini-
mum welfare standard, especially on Java. Most were dependent exclusively
or primarily on agriculture, where farms were generally very small. Under-
employment was widespread. While the inflation of the mid-1960s had been
overcome, infrastructuare was still in very poor condition.
4.        The Government's efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974) were successful in putting the economy
on the road towards dievelopment. Most physical objectives were achieved
or nearly so, and there was very substantial rehabilitation of run-down
infrastructure and Government enterprises in agriculture and manufacturing.
Foodgrain production increased by 4 million tons during the Plan period
at an average rate of 5 percent per annum. Investments increased at a very
fast rate, rising from 9 to 19 percent of GNP. While 57 percent of Govern-
ment development expenditures were financed from abroad, the reliance on
foreign financing was much less than the level of nearly 80 percent foreseen
in the Plan. Real GDP increased at an annual rate of over 7 percent. GNP per
capita in current prices reached about $130 1/ in 1973. The Government
programs for the labor intensive rehabilitation of infrastructure and other
measures created substantial incomes and employment. However, given the
annual increase in the labor force of about one million, one cannot be con
fident that the employment situation improved during the First Plan period,
and from available information it is difficult to judge the extent to which
the poorest section of the population shared in the gains of development.

5.        The Second Five-Year Plan (April 1, 1974 to March 31, 1979) builds
on the achievements of the First Plan. While the First Plan dealt mainly with
the urgent needs for stabilization and rehabilitation under conditions of
great scarcity of resources, progress has been such that the Second Plan can
give much more weight to such problems as employment, increasing the produc-
tivity and incomes of the poorest sections of the population and the poorest
regions, population control, education and health. The Plan identifies a
number of specific low-income target groups and, in general, adopts an employ-
ment oriented development strategy. It aims at a continued growth in invest-
ment, needed both because capital intensity will tend to increase as the
rehabilitation phase draws to an end, and because more socially-oriented
investments will be made. Overall, the Plan expects GDP to grow at 7.5
percent per annum.
6.        Over the decade 1961-71, Indonesia's population grew by 2.1 per-
cent a year. However, as a result of changes in the age, distribution and
declining mortality, the current growth rate is estimated at 2.5 percent.
Even under the most optimistic assumptions with regard to a decline in fer-
tility, the growth rate would come down only gradually, and the population
would nearly double by the end of the century. While Indonesia still has
substantial unutilized land reserves in the Outer Islands, these are limited
in relation to the expected population increase. Since 1969, the Government
has been operating and gradually extending a successful family planning
program. The number of acceptors has been increasing rapidly. The Second
Plan foresees a progressively more vigorous and comprehensive attack on the
population problem.
7.        During the years 1976-79, average annual additions to the labor
force are estimated at 1.2 million, increasing to more than 1.4 million in
the years 1980-85. In addition, substantial underemployment exists, and
there is the risk that even relatively simple technological improvements
may adversely affect existing employment. The Second Plan's projections
show that employment growth would approximately keep pace with the growth in
the labor force, but even this may be too optimistic. Thus, the magnitude and
the employment content of the investment program needs to be further enlarged
and strengthened if an appreciable increase in employment and the real earn-
ings of labor - and thus a wider spread of the benefits of development - is
to be attained.
8.        Towards the end of 1973, when the Second Plan was being finalized,
prospects for resource availability improved dramatically. In line with
other OPEC countries, the Government raised the export price of oil in
successive stages from $3.70 per barrel in April 1973 to $12.60 per barrel
in July 1974. Early in 1974 (and again in 1975) the Government also suc-
cessfully renegotiated the contracts with foreign oil companies, enabling
it to retain a greater share of the oil income. As a result, the net
contribution of the oil sector to the balance of payments and Government
revenues was expected to increase very considerably; a large increase in
foreign exchange reserves and a budget surplus were anticipated for
1974/75.1/
1/   Indonesian fiscal year April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1975.



- 3 -
9.        By October 1974, foreign exchange reserves had risen by $650 mil-
lion from nearly $1.0 billion at the beginning of 1974/75 and Government
revenues were exceeding the levels originally estimated. The Government
authorized much higher levels of expenditures, mainly for development, which
reflected the improved revenue prospects. However, the recessionary condi-
tions in the industrial countries began to affect the volume of oil exports
and production by the middle of the year. Indonesia's high quality oil tended
to become overpriced ]/ as world oil demand slackened and output declined from
an average of 1.45 miLlion barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 1974 to
1.31 million bpd in the second half. Proceeds from non-oil exports also
started to decline as prices, and in some cases export quantities, fell.
10.       In October 1974 also, the first signs appeared of what turned out
to be a substantial financial overextension by PERTAMINA, the national oil
company. PERTAMINA had undertaken a large and diversified investment program
financed to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing. In the third
quarter of 1974/75, it started withholding part of the corporate oil tax it
had collected on behaLf of Government from the foreign oil companies; by the
end of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 billion ($830 million) had been so
withheld and used to meet PERTAMINA's financial obligations. Early in 1975,
PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due to some foreign banks and the Government
stepped in and took decisive action. It banned all independent foreign bor-
rowing by PERTAMINA and other Government enterprises and gave Bank Indonesia
the sole authority to contract foreign obligations, instructed Bank Indonesia
to provide the funds needed to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations, under-
took a comprehensive review of the oil company's investment projects and began
the process of reducing and re-plannning the company's investment program and
of cancelling and renegotiating many of the related procurement contracts.
11.       The combination, in the last half of 1974/75, of slackening
receipts from exports of oil and other products and of the need to meet
PERTAMINA's short-term obligations resulted in a loss of the foreign ex-
change reserves gained in the first half of the fiscal year. By March 31,
1975, these reserves were at the same level as at the beginning of April
1974.
12.       The balance of payments situation did not improve in    the first
half of 1975/76. With continuing recessionary conditions in Indonesia's
principal markets, exports failed to increase while imports rose again
(about 30 percent on an annual basis). Debt service payments on behalf
of PERTAMINA were very large (about $1.0 billion). As a result, Indonesia's
foreign exchange reserves declined by a further $480 million, despite sub-
stantial capital inflows, including two syndicated public cash borrowings
(totalling $575 million) from the international capital market.
1/   The premium on I]ndonesian oil has recently been reduced by the Government's
decision to raise the price of its main crude by 1.5 percent (to $12.80)
as compared with the 10 percent increase in the price of Saudi Arabian
light crude agreed at the meeting of OPEC in September 1975.



- 4 -
13.       For 1976, balance of payments prospects appear distinctly more
favorable. Signs of recovery from the recession have appeared in some indus-
trialized countries, commodity prices seem to have bottomed out and oil ex-
ports from Indonesia have increased in recent months. Rice import needs are
smaller and fertilizer imports have been stopped due to the sizeable stocks
now on hand. Prices of some other imported commodities have fallen. Service
on PERTAMINA's debt is much smaller and the Government has recently raised
another cash loan amounting to $425 million. Some build-up of foreign
exchange reserves is expected in the second half of the fiscal year.
14.       Budgetary revenues in 1974/75 were much lower than had been anti-
cipated at the middle of the year, partly due to the withholding of oil
revenues by PERTAMINA and partly to the shortfall in oil exports in the
second half of the year. The budget was, however, still in balance by year's
end as the Government reduced or deferred expenditures. The budget for
1975/76 is balanced. Revenues, as well as current and domestically financed
development expenditures, are now expected to be about 10 percent lower than
originally budgeted, but still about 30 percent higher than in the previous
year.
15.       In spite of the shortfall in budgetary revenues, and the adminis-
trative difficulties involved in implementation of some projects, total
development expenditures in 1974/75 were Rp 770 billion ($1.9 billion) double
that in the previous year. In 1975/76 they are expected to reach Rp 1.4
trillion ($3.3 billion), including foreign financing of projects, totalling
about $1.0 billion and fertilizer subsidies amounting to $350 million. This
is about three times the actual expenditure in 1973/74; even when adjusted for
price changes this represents a near doubling.
16.       Preliminary figures indicate that the high growth rate achieved
during 1969-73 was maintained in 1974. At constant 1973 prices, gross
domestic product rose by 7.5 percent in 1974. Partial indicators seem to
point to slower growth of output in 1975. The inflation rate was very high
in the first part of 1974 as, among other factors, world inflation was
transmitted through both export and import channels, but abated somewhat
later in the year, partly as a result of the Government's stabilization
measures in April 1974. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole it reached
40 percent. While still considerable, the average inflation rate for 1975
is expected to be only half of 1974's, or about 20 percent.
17.       In the aftermath of the PERTAMINA development, the Government is
faced with problems which, although serious, are surmountable. The review
of PERTAMINA's projects has resulted in cancellation or renegotiation of
many contracts and reductions in project scope and size. 1/ The Government
1/   The planned capacity of the Krakatau Steel plant, for example, was
reduced from 2,000,000 to 500,000 tons per year and the existing
supply iontracts were reduced by $750 million.

has more recently undertaken a hroader review of projects iitiiat(-d by
various Covernment departments mid other State entities in ain effort to
bring future expendit:ures in line with avaiLable resources and the prior-
ities set out in the Second Plan. It is screening very carefully any major
new programs or projects, since considerable resources will be needed in the
next year or two for the completion of projects already initiated.
18.       A longer-term effect of the recent financial difficulties will
be on the country's external public debt service obligations during the
rest of the decade. Debt service payments over the next several years will
be much larger than previously envisaged, as a result of the large borrowings
by the Government in the current fiscal year. Debt service in 1975/76 is
now estimated at $50C million, which would be more than 10 percent of offi-
cially projected net oil and other exports. Debt service payments on all
loans contracted to LDecember 31, 1975 may reach about one billion dollars by
1978 before declining as shorter-term maturities are paid off. This is about
$500 million more per year than the payments projected on the basis of debt
outstanding at the erd of 1974. With debt service obligations on these
borrowings substantially higher than expected earlier (about 12 percent of
exports in 1978), the margin for further borrowing on other than semi-con-
cessional terms has now become much more limited. The amounts, terms and
purposes of future borrowing therefore need to be kept under continuous
careful review.
19.       While the recent balance of payments and budgetary difficulties
have upset some of the Government's plans, the long-term prospects for
Indonesia's development remain good. The country has a substantial poten-
tial for further productive investment, employment and income growth. In
agriculture, a vigorous pursuit of on-going programs in irrigation, devel-
opment of new plant varieties and technical services, provision of credit
and current inputs, etc., promises to yield high returns. In addition,
there are opportunities for the development of new areas, of food and tree
crops - partly in conjunction with a rapidly growing transmigration program.
The industrial potential is good, both for modern capital-intensive natural
resource-based activities and for more labor-intensive, partly export-oriented
industries.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
20.       As indicated in Part I, Indonesia's plans emphasize a need to
undertake a large investment and development program designed to provide
productive work opport:unities (with resultant increased incomes) for its
presently underemployed and growing labor force. Substantial external
financing, on concessLonal and semi-concessional terms, as well as a consid-
erable volume of technical assistance, is also required. The Bank is planning
to increase its lending to Indonesia and, in particular, to support projects
designed to: improve agricultural credit, research and extension; rehabili-
tate and expand irrigation systems; increase the production and distribution



- 6 -
of fertilizer; assist transmigration and nucleus estates; increase non-agri-
cultural employment in small towns and rural areas by the establishment of
small-scale industries; and rehabilitate and expand urgently needed trans-
portation and other infrastructure.
21.       As of March 15, 1976, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits total-
ling $561.8 million and 10 Bank loans amounting to $461.0 million. At that
date, IFC investments totalled $58.4 million. At the end of 1974 the Bank
Group accounted for about 4 percent of Indonesia's total outstanding public
debt; by 1978 it is expected to acccount for 12 percent of total outstanding
public debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations. A summary
statement of IDA credits, Bank loans and IFC investments as of January 31,
1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects, are contained in Annex II.
This is the fourth loan proposed for Indonesia this year and, if approved,
along with the proposed fourth highway project, would bring total IBRD
commitments since June 30, 1975 to $270 million.
22.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one-third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitation,
six for the rehabilitation and expansion of the irrigation systems, two for
fisheries, and one each for seeds, beef cattle, sugar and smallholder tea and
rubber. In the industrial sector, the Bank Group has assisted in three
projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production capacity, three for develop-
ment finance companies (Government-owned and private) which play a major role
in fostering the growth of industrial enterprises, and one for the Pulo Gadung
industrial estate. Loans and credits have also been extended to the transpor-
tation, education, telecommunications, tourism, power, population, urbaniza-
tion and water supply sectors, and four credits have been made for technical
assistance to aid the Government in preparing and formulating its development
programs and projects.
23.        In the field of education Indonesia has received three credits to-
talling $24.4 million for projects with manpower development and equity ob-
jectives. The first credit made in 1970 financed the construction of five
centralized workshops (TTC) to strengthen practical instruction for fifteen
satellite senior secondary schools. The Second Education Project (1972) aims
at upgrading and expanding middle leval agricultural training. The third
project (1973) will contribute to the improvement of basic education through
the testing, production and distribution of 138 million primary school text-
books and the training of teachers. Although there have been some delays in
the implementation of these projects, the first project will be completed on
schedule and the overall progress on the remaining two is generally satisfac-
tory. Details of the implementation of these projects are given in Annex II.
24.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation; almost half of all loans and credits have been
made since mid-1972, with lending on Bank terms commencing in June 1974.
Disbursements on loans and credits are prevailing at satisfactory levels.
The Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the delays



- 7 -
in project execution caused by cumbersome procedures and the need to establish
an effective control system in BAPPENAS (The National Development Planning
Agency). At the Government's request, the Bank has arranged for assistance
under the Fourth Techn:ical Assistance Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a
monitoring and control system which it is hoped will lead to better project
administration.
25.       Future Bank lending gives high priority to the agricultural sector
through support of projects to increase rice and other crop production in
the Inner and Outer Islands, and the expansion of resettlement efforts on
the latter. In addition, the program provides for further socially-oriented
projects in the fields of urban development and population. Projects for
agricultural extension, power, shipping, ports, sugar, fertilizer production,
irrigation and nutrition are expected to be ready for presentation in the next
few months.
PART III - TEC(HNICAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN INDONESIA
26.       In Indonesin the formal education system comprises six years of
primary education, sixt years of secondary education divided into a lower and
upper cycle and three to five years of higher education. The Presidential
Decree No. 34/72 has delegated the authority for formal education to the
Department of Education and Culture, whereas the Department of Manpower,
Transmigration and Cooperatives is responsible for non-formal training, and
the National Institute of Administration (LAN) is in charge of civil service
training.
27.       The technical education and vocational training system comprises
four levels ranging from training of semi-skilled workers to graduate engi-
neers. At the professional level engineers are trained in the engineering
faculties of 18 universities and in two institutes of technology. Sub-pro-
fessional training of technicians has been conducted so far at eight tech-
nical academies (Grades 13-15) and eleven business study academies (Grades 13-
15), all scheduled to be closed shortly. Skilled workers are trained at 440
senior secondary technical schools (STM, Grades 10-12) and eight secondary
technical schools (Grades 9-12). These institutions are under the jurisdic-
tion of the Department of Education and Culture. Semi-skilled workers and
operatives are trained in vocational training centers (PLK) and mobile train-
ing units (MTU) (both without grade structures) under the jurisdication of
the Department of Manpower, Transmigration and Cooperatives. Technical second-
ary teachers are trained in ten technical faculties (FKIT, Grades 13-17) of
teacher training institutes.
28.       Indonesia's technical and vocational education and training system
presently fails to produce properly trained technicians, and has inadequate
supply capacities at skilled and semi-skilled worker levels. Rural out-of-
school youth particu]arly lack access to enough skill training. Technical and
vocational training also suffers from low quality because of under-qualified



- 8 -
teachers, inadequate curricula and lack of appropriate facilities. Two-thirds
of the teachers in secondary technical schools and 90 percent of teaching staff
in technical academies are on a part-time basis. The root cause of this low
quality is inadequate expenditure. Recurrent expenditures per student in In-
donesian technical/vocational schools have been among the lowest in the world.
The Government increased base salaries of teachers ninefold between 1971 and
1975. The budgeted expenditures for the Department of Education and Culture
are Rp. 436 billion under the Second Five Year Plan as compared to Rp. 37 bil-
lion allocated for the preceding five year period. However, the accumulated
effects of many years of budgetary stringency can be overcome only gradually.
29.       An essential condition for the success of Indonesia's development
efforts would be an adequate supply of qualified manpower at skilled worker,
technician and engineer/technologist levels and, at the base of the manpower
pyramid, a work force commanding basic vocational skills. The strengthening
and expansion of the Government's resource management capabilities, which
would require an effective public service training system, is considered
another necessary condition for carrying out the large industrial and infra-
structure investment programs Indonesia is envisaging. The existing National
Institute of Administration (LAN) is not able at present to provide such
training to public servants and would have to be strengthened if it is to
fulfill its triple role of research and development, monitoring and central
training agent in the field of public administration training.
30.       The detailed manpower and training implications of Indonesia's
planned ambitious growth have not yet been articulated. However the follow-
ing generalizations can be made on the basis of a broad comparison of the
likely manpower needs by major skill categories and the available training
capacities:
(a)  the total number of university graduates in engineering/
technology would exceed slightly the available jobs
(although there may be shortages in certain fields)
whereas properly trained technicians would be in short
supply owing to the virtual absence of relevant training
institutions;
(b)  the training capacity for skilled workers would be in-
sufficient, leading to large-scale upgrading from the
semi-skilled worker level. This in turn would require
an expansion of training facilities for basic vocational
skills to make up for these losses and also to allow for
an increased demand for semi-skilled workers.
31.       The Government has identified and is dealing with the shortcomings
of technical education. During the first Five Year Plan period (1969-74) it
introduced the new concept of centralized workshops and developed new curri-
cula for secondary technical education. For the period of the Second Plan
(1974-79) and beyond, the following developments are envisaged:



- 9 -
(a)  engineering educiti-n w,.uld he selectively expanded and
efforts would be male to increase its internal efficiency;
(b) technical teacher training would be concentrated and
strengthenecl;
(c)  senior secondary technical schools (STM) would have their
facilities upgraded and re-equipped.    In major urban areas
centralized workshops would serve groups of STMs.     Senior
secondary technical education would also profit from better
teacher training and the introduction of new curricula;
(d)  junior secondary technical schools would by 1978 be converted
into genera]. schools;
(e) the network of vocational training centers and mobile train-
ing units wculd be expanded to cover all provinces.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
General
32.       With a view to improving its long-term planning for education and
formulating appropriate strategies, the Government undertook a "National As-
sessment Study on Education" in 1969-73 with the help of the Ford Foundation
and requested Bank assistance to identify projects for priority implementa-
tion.  An Education Sector Survey Mission visited Indonesia in late 1973 and
its report "Indonesia Education Sector Survey Report" (No. 443a--IND), dated
February 5, 1975 identified projects for financing from local and external
resources. The proposed project is based on the recommendations of this
Sector Survey Report and was prepared by a team of experts supp:Lied by UNESCO.
A preparatory assistance mission under the leadership of the Bank with partici-
pation from UNESCO, ILO, and UNOTC (United Nations Office of Technical Coopera-
tion) and financed by UNDP formulated a detailed program of technical assistance.
The project was appraised in February/March 1975. Negotiations were held on
October 28-31, 1975 in Washington, D.C.; Mr. Soelaeman Soemardi, Chief, Bureau
of Education, Law and Religion of BAPPENAS led the Government delegation.
33.       The proposed project would have the following main objectives:
(a) to help meet the country's requirements of skilled and
semi-skilled manpower;
(b) to provide disadvantaged rural and urban groups with skills
that would enable them to earn additional income.
(c) to contribute towards an improvement in civil service training.

government agencies mentioned above.
/a   Eight of the ten existing FKlT's will be used for other forms of teacher
training.



Project Institutions
34.       (a)  Department of Education
Technical T'eacher Training Faculties (FKIT): The present low
quality of technical teacher training would be raised by consoLidating and
strengthening trainirg at two FKIT in Jogyakarta and Padang. The proposed
project would construct, furnish and equip new facilities at these insti-
tutions sufficient tc enroll 2,050 students.   The required staff of 120
teacher-trainers would be obtained through in-service upgrading of present
FKIT personnel, initially with the help of technical assistance specialists.
Internal efficiency would be improved through careful selection of entrants by
means of an examination open to general and technical senior secondary school
graduates.  In order to simplify the curricula, reduce equipment needs and
lower recurrent experLditure of the FKITs, their entrance requirements in
workshop practice woulLd be set equivalent to the level of a graduate from
a high-quality senior secondary technical school. To avoid creating a dual
system of secondary technical teachers, all technical teacher training will be
concentrated, by 1980, in the two FKITs included in the project and eight of
the existing FKIT's which are poorly equipped and have low standards will be
used for other forms of teacher training (Section 4.09 of the Loan Agreement).
Centralized Workshops (TTC):   Centralized workshops appear to be
the most expeditious and economical way of improving the quality of technical
schools in major urban areas. Five such TTCs are being financed under Credit
219-IND. These are Jocated in Bandung, Jakarta and Surabaya, in Java, Medan
in Sumatera and Ujung Pandang in Sulawesi.   The proposed project includes the
establishment of four more centralized workshops in Jogyakarta and Semarang in
Java, as well as Padang and Palembang, in Sumatera. They would serve eleven
existing feeder senior secondary technical schools (STM) with a total enroll-
ment of 11,900 students and an annual output of almost 4,000 skilled workers,
almost 10 percent of the country's estimated requirements. The 340 instructors
needed for the workshiops would be recruited from teachers already in service
who would receive in--service training.
35.       (b)  Department of Manpower
Vocational Training Centers (PLK): The proposed project would help
expand non-formal skiLll training by establishing 17 new vocational training
centers, four in major urban areas, seven in mid-sized towns and six, which
would serve as operational bases for the mobile training units, in small
towns. The 17 centers would enroll 11,600 trainees per annum, mostly unem-
ployed youths between 18 and 25 years old, preparing them for jobs as for
example semi-skilled construction workers, welders, plumbers, motor mechan-
ics, carpenters and electricians. Curricula materials have already been
developed under the IL0 modular system. The 400 instructors required would
come from the specia:L training centers in Bandung and Singosari in Java.
Instructor Training Center: The proposed loan would help finance
furniture and equipment at the Instructor Training Center in Singosari re-
quired to strengthen its teaching program. The equipment would enable up



- 12 -
to 150 instructors to be trained properly per annum.     The vocational train-
ing centers and mobile training units in the proposed project would require
more than 600 instructors. The combined annual output of the existing
Instructor Training Center at Bandung and the Singosari center (300) would
be sufficient to meet this demand over a three-year period and to allow for
the replacement requirements of the existing vocational training centers
and units, presently estimated at 100 per year.
Mobile Training Units (MTU): The proposed project would expand
the capacity of mobile training units by 9,300 trainees, more than doubling
the existing capacity. It would establish 25 new units, 20 for rural areas
and five for major urban areas. The 25 units would use vocational training
centers as operational bases. About 220 additional instructors would be
required and would be recruited from the instructor training centers in
Bandung and Singosari. Curricula, following the ILO modular pattern, have
already been developed. The MTUs would provide rural and urban, mainly
unemployed youths, with basic agricultural and industrial/artisan skills.
36.        (c)  National Institute of Administration (LAN)
The proposed project would construct training and auxiliary facili-
ties (library and accommodation for 200 boarders) sufficient to enable the
consolidation of all LAN's training activities in one location. Enrollment
would increase by 1,100 places, or about 50 percent and training would include
these major courses: (a) in-service training for senior civil servants, (b)
pre-service training for Government officers, (c) training of instructors for
Government agencies and (d) specialized language and secretarial courses. The
future training activities would emphasize functions that have arisen out of
the Government's increased involvement in the process of economic and social
development (such as general planning, financial analysis, program/project
design, implementation and evaluation), rather than the traditional regulatory
functions. Curricula, including Indonesian case studies, would be developed
as an integral part of the project. The development of a plan for civil
service training is urgently required. Disbursement for civil works, furniture
and equipment for LAN would therefore be contingent upon the preparation and
submission to the Bank for comment of such a plan (Part 4 (f) of Schedule 1 of
the Loan Agreement).
Technical Assistance
37.       A total of 104 man-years of specialist services and 61 man-years
of fellowships would be needed for strengthening management capability, pro-
gram development and staff training. Of this total UNDP is financing four
man-years of specialist services for initial implementation and agreement
has been reached for aid from the U.K. Government to provide 24 man-years of
specialist services for the centralized workshops. The remaining technical
assistance would be financed out of the proceeds of the loan, as follows:



- 13 -
(a)  Department of Education:   30 man-years of specialist
services for curriculum and staff development and 41
man-years of fellowships;
(b) Department of Manpower: 35 man-years of specialist
services and 14 man-years of fellowships for strength-
ening management and supervision capability; and
(c)  National Institute of Administration:    11 man-years of
specialist services and six man-years of fellowships
to develop curricula and a civil service training plan
and to train staff.
Specialist services would cover three phases: (a) the initial preparation
of work programs (6 months); (b) assistance in establishment of institutions
(2-3 years); and (c) assistance in initial operation of the institutions (2-3
years).
Cost Estimates
38.       The estimated costs of the various project items are given in detail
in Annex III. The total cost (including contingencies and projected price
increases) would be about $65.0 million, of which about $37.8 million, or
about 58 percent, would be in foreign exchange. Physical contingencies and
projected price increases would amount to about $19.2 million (or about 30
percent of the total project cost).
Financing Plan
39.       The proposed financing plan provides for Bank assistance to finance
98 percent of the foreign exchange component of the project; the remaining for-
eign requirements would be financed by the U.K. Government. The details of
the financing plan are shown below:

Project Implementation
40.       Administration.   The existing project unit in the Department of
Education charged with implementation of the first education project (Credit
219-IND) would be responsible for administration, financial control and
liaison with the Bank for the components under the Department of Education.
To carry out the additional workload, the Government has appointed additional
staff to the unit.
41.       A project unit recently established in the Department of Manpower
would be responsible for the implementation of the components under the
Department of Manpower. The Deputy Chairman of LAN has been appoined Project
Implementation Officer for the LAN component and would be supported by a
committee of LAN staff.
42.       Financing and Execution of Technical Assistance.    A 12-month prep-
aratory assistance project, covering the salaries of a project coordinator
and three team leaders, was started in January 1976 financed by UNDP with
the Bank as Executing Agency. Agreement had been reached in principle that
the preparatory assistance would be followed by UNDP financing of the full
technical assistance program. However, recent financial constraints have
prevented UNDP from funding the full project and the required technical
assistance would therefore be financed from the proposed loan. Should UNDP
funds become available for this purpose at a later date the corresponding
amount of the loan will be cancelled. It is expected that the technical
assistance component would be administered through UNESCO, ILO and UNOTC for
the project components related to the Departments of Education, Manpower and
LAN respectively. Completion of these agreements satisfactory to the Bank
would be a condition of disbursement for the respective project component.
(Paragraphs 4 (b) (c) and (d) of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement).
43.       Professional Services.   The Departments of Education, Manpower
and LAN (in consultation with the Department of Public Works and Power),
have appointed qualified consultants on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank to carry out design and supervision of civil works. The consultants
would work under the supervision of the respective project units through the
project architects.
44.       Sites.   The sites for the proposed project institutions have already
been selected and most of them purchased; the acquisition of the remaining
lands is expected to be completed soon by the Government.
45.       Performance Monitoring.   The Government would establish a perform-
ance monitoring system in all the project institutions to collect information,
in accordance with guidelines agreed with the Bank, on the following aspects
(Section 3.06 of the Loan Agreement):
(a)  external performance:   employment status of graduates/
trainees including data on occupation sector and place
of employment;



- 1 5 -
(b)  internal performance:   dropout-reputitLon rates, results
of trade tEStS or otlher skill measurements;
(c) course demand: application/admission ratios, requests by
industry and Government agencies for courses; and
(d) workshop discipline: accident rates.
46.       Implementation Schedule.   In order to ensure that the Droposed
project will be executed without delay, the agreement of the Government has
been obtained to an initial implementation schedule with specified timing
of critical steps in project implementation. The project is expected to
be completed by 1980.
Procurement
47.       Contracts for civil works (excluding those for the sub-project
of the Department of Manpower) and equipment and furniture (except those
below US$50,000 equivalent) would be awarded following international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. In bid comparison,
domestic suppliers of equipment, furniture and vehicles would be allowed a
preferential margin oE 15 percent or the actual customs duty, whichever is
lower. In addition, a 7-1/2 percent margin of preference would be given to
domestic contractors Eor purposes of bid comparison for civil works. Small
contracts for equipment and furniture and the contracts for civil works for
the smaller and often more remote Department of Manpower schools would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following
Government's normal procurement procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Some items will be purchased off-the-shelf on the basis of a minimum of three
price quotations. The details of the arrangements for procurement are given
in Annex III.
Disbursement
48.       The proposed loan of $37.0 million would be disbursed on the basis
of the following percentages:
(a) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for directly imported
equipment and vehicles;
(b)  95 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment and vehicles, excluding sales taxes;
(c) 65 percent of the total cost of imported and locally pro-
cured equipment purchased off-the-shelf;
(d) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures on technical assis-
tance;
(e) 40 percent of total expenditures on civil works;



- 16 -
(f) 40 percent of total expenditures on consultants' ser-
vices; and
(g) 30 percent of the total expenditures on furniture.
The estimated disbursement Schedule is shown in Annex III. Disbursement is
expected to be completed by the end of 1980.
49.       In order to speed up project implementation, consultant architects
have already been appointed; it is therefore proposed that expenditures for
their services after December 1, 1975 be reimbursed from the loan. The total
amount of retroactive financing would not exceed $100,000 (Paragraph 4(a) of
Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement).
Benefits and Justification
50.        The proposed project would aid the development of technical man-
power in Indonesia by:
(a) increasing the output of skilled workers through the pro-
vision of four centralized workshops for senior secondary
technical schools, and by assuring the necessary supply
of qualified technical teachers through the simultaneous
improvement of two technical teacher training faculties;
(b) expanding the capacity for non-formal vocational training
at the semi-skilled worker level through the provision of
17 vocational training centers (PLK), and by assuring the
necessary supply of qualified instructors through the
re-equipping of an instructor training center;
(c) providing through the MTUs the basic skills for disad-
vantaged rural and urban groups that would enable them
to earn additional incomes to improve their livelihoods;
and
(d) strengthening LAN to increase the supply of better trained
civil servants at national and provincial levels, and thus
provide for more effective and efficient operation of pub-
lic administration.
51.       Quantitatively, the project institutions would train each year:
(a) about 3,600 skilled workers, or about 10 percent of the
estimated requirements; and
(b) about 11,600 workers at the upper range of the semi-skilled
,eval, thus more than doubling the existing annual training
potential.



- 17 -
52.       The annual capacity of the rural and mobile training units would
increase from about 7,000 to over 16,000 participants. Moreover, the demon-
stration effect of the training would spread beyond the group of direct
participants.
53.       The proposed improvement and expansion of LAN would provide train-
ing annually to 270 civil servants in the top category and those to be pro-
moted into it. It would reach through pre-service training another 800, about
10 percent of the estimated training requirements for the annual entrants into
the intermediate levels.
54.       Despite this expansion of specific segments of the education and
training system, training deficits at skilled and semi-skilled worker levels
will persist. Since an immediate large-scale replication of the relevant
items in the proposed project is ruled out by staff and financial constraints,
the economy would have to rely on alternative means to supply the necessary
manpower. The upgrading of semi-skilled workers would mainly be used to re-
duce the present deficit of skilled workers; the vocational training centers
could support this process by concentrating on training workers who are al-
ready employed. This would mean that the initial training of semi-skilled
workers would have largely to be carried out by private enterprises, with
the mobile training units as a supply source for basic skills. These tempo-
rary training deficits should *not detract from the important contribution
that the proposed project would make to manpower development in Indonesia,
by laying the foundation for a modern and efficient system of technical edu-
cation and vocational training.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately. Items in the Loan Agreement of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 36, 38, 44, 47 and 51 of this report. The
draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern of loan agreements relating
to education projects.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 127:       Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Effective Date: March 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
It is expected that all civil works will be completed
by March 1976. Additional drainage work will be carried out under Loan
1100-IND and tertiary development under the proposed Irrigation VII Project.
The closing date has been postponed by one year to allow for payment of
late accounts. The adequacy and timeliness of operation and maintenance
of completed irrigation rehabilitation projects is presently under discus-
sion with the Government.
Cr. No. 154:      Highways:   US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Effective Date: October 2, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.
Rehabilitation work, of acceptable quality, has been
completed. The work accomplished exceeded the project's original target.
The program for improved highway maintenance included in the project has
been completed. A project completion report is being prepared for issuance
before June 30, 1976.
Cr. No. 155:      Agricultural Estates:   US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
With improvements in management and much higher inter-
national prices, particularly for palm oil, prevailing in 1974, the
financial position of the estate groups has improved. The field and
factory standards have now been raised to a good technical level and
the managements have been advised to concentrate on cost control in order
to prepare for the time when produce prices may become less attractive.
The combined efforts of the management, consultants and IDA missions
to review project implementation are yielding good results. The closing
date has been postponed to December 31, 1976 to enable payment to con-
sultants for services for other rubber estates.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165:       Electricity Distribution:   US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Effective Date: June 1, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The closing date was postponed to December 3], 1975, to
allow for payment of small amounts outstanding. The project completion re-
port will be prepared in conjunction with that for Credit No. 334.
Cr. No. 193:       PUSRI Fertilizer:   US$35 Million Credit of June 15,
1970 (as amended May 21, 1973); Effective Date:
January 15, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance
test and is operating at close to rated capacity. The gas gathering
and transmission system is also completed and sufficient gas is being
delivered to the plant. The closing date has been postponed to December
31, 1976 to allow for delivery and installation of remaining equipment.
Cr. No. 194:       Second Agricultural Estates:   US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After initial delays, there have been considerable
improvements in management and these, combined with high prices, particular-
ly for palm oil, have resulted in the two estate groups being put in a
much stronger financial position. On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort
is necessary to improve agricultural standards and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment of the palm oil group (PNP VI), there is
a need to employ expertise in financial planning, control and management,
which are now the main constraints to efficient development. This estate
group is undertaking action in this respect. The closing date has been
postponed by one year to allow payment for remaining equipment, civil
works and consultants' contracts.
Cr. No. 195:       Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:    US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
Problems of quality and progress of construction still
exist, but the project entity assisted by the consultants are tackling
these vigorously, and the situation is improving, although not sufficiently
to make up for earlier delays. Costs are likely to be double the overall
appraisal estimate, due to inflation, but the Government will provide any
additional funds required. Completion of disbursements will be about two
years behind the original schedule.

Cr. No. 210:      Telecommunications Expansion:   US$12.8 Million Credit
of July 13, 1970; Effective Date: February 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Contracts for all equipment have been awarded. The
physical work has been substantially completed. The troposcatter system
and the telex installation has been completed. Although Government has
increased tariffs, PERUMTEL's financial results are not satisfactory and a
review of its financial position is required. The closing date, which had
been postponed by 18 months due to delays in the delivery of goods, has been
postponed by another six months to allow for payments of outstanding contracts.
Cr. No. 211:      Fisheries:   US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
The credit helps finance the construction of 30 fully
equipped skipjack boats, auxiliary facilities and technical assistance.
The project is about two years behind the original schedule due to delays
in engaging consultants and in executing contracts for the shore facilities.
There has been a substantial project cost increase but the project is still
expected to be financially viable due to the greatly increased skipjack prices.
Government plans to replace the present project management and seek early al-
location of the additional funds necessary for full operation.
Cr. No. 219:       Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Project implementation in the Department of Education
is satisfactory. Civil works for the five Technical Training Centers
(TTCs) have been completed. About 90 percent of the equipment has been
purchased and about 60 percent delivered and installed. All TTCs will
operate at full capacity by January 1976 when the new academic year begins.
Over 500 technical teachers have completed or are about to complete their
training. Technical assistance financed by the U.K. for the project is
also satisfactory. Disbursement has improved considerably. Revised
total project cost is now about 40 percent above appraisal estimate. The
Government will finance the cost overrun. The project is expected to be
completed about three months ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 220:       Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$14.5 Million Credit
of November , 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction remains about two to three years behind
schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties in preparation
of contract document, late financial allocations, heavy rains in the 1973 con-
struction season and, more recently, slow response by GOI to high inflation
rates and consequent civil works costs overruns - have been mainly overcome,

but time lost cannot be regained. Estimated project cost is 50 percent
above the appraisal estimate, but with higher rice prices on the world
market, the project's economic rate of return remains over 20 percent.
The closing date has been postponed by 18 months as a result of project
delay.
Cr. No. 246:      Seeds:   US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effeactive Date:  December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
Se%p-ember 30, 1977.
Significant progress has been made in the construction
of the irrigation infrastructure and in land development at the National
Seeds Corporation (NSC). Construction is proceeding satisfactorily and is
now 70 percent complei:ed. The inadequacy of NSC management at the opera-
tional level is reflected in technical production problems, low yields of
seed and high costs oF production. Increasing nation-wide production prob-
lems caused by prevalent disease, pests and insect losses has resulted in
government authorities now giving certified seed production high priority.
Cr. No. 259:      Tea:: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded
appraisal expectations necessitating construction and rehabilitation
of three additional factories. Project completion, estimated for December
1977, can probably be advanced by up to one year. Rising costs are creating
pressure on available funds and the main challenge for the two PTPs will
be to reduce working capital requirements, as well as overhead and indirect
costs, and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260:       Second Highway:  US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Construction work is about 80 percent finished and should
be completed by August. 1976, about one and a half years behind schedule.
The delay was caused largely by slow progress in mobilizing contractors,
difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and landslides. The closing
date has therefore been postponed to December 31, 1976. Design standards for
the road sections have been slightly lowered and some savings have been
achieved, which, together with other savings have partly offset construction
cost increases.
Cr. No. 275:      Third Technical Assistance: US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Effective Date: February 25,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing
date has been postponed by another year to complete disbursements for
ongoing studies.

Cr. No. 288:       Second Education:  US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This agricultural training project, being implemented
by the Department of Agriculture, is about 16 months delayed because of
late appointment of consultant architects, lack of counterpart funds, delays
in bid analysis and in awarding contracts. As a result, civil works,
which were to be completed already, have not commenced. Furniture and
equipment procurement have therefore been deferred. Unlike the physical
aspects of the project, the educational aspects are generally on schedule.
Total project costs are now estimated to be 90 percent higher than the
original estimate. Government has budgeted for the cost overrun. Disburse-
ment, which has been slow, should improve since civil works contracts have
now been awarded.
Cr. No. 289:      Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:    US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
Civil Works and equipment purchases for the main project,
Pekalen-Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be
about two years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are
likely to be substantially higher than appraisal estimates. Consultants
for the various studies are at work with their counterparts. Groundwater
investigations have been delayed due to procurement difficulties. The
rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule. Disburse-
ments are also on schedule.
Cr. No. 300:       Population:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
Progress of this project is generally satisfactory.
Steps are being taken to improve preparation and implementation of project
components concerned with communications, research and evaluation. All
vehicles have been procured and good progress is being made with equipment
procurement. The civil works section of the Project Implementation Unit
functions well but is underutilized because of delays in making policy
decisions. Construction costs will exceed appraisal estimates by 135
percent. Population Education is now being introduced into school curricula
after a successful trial. Despite its limitations, the national family
planning program, of which the project is an integral part, is expanding
annually.
Cr. No. 310:       Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I):   US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This credit is fully committed.

Cr. No. 318:       Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitaton:    US$8.5 Million
Crecit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
Progress on this project is generally satisfactory.
Cr. No. 319:      Fourth Agricultural Estates:   US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The physical progress of the project is ahead of Lhe
appraisal schedule. The financial position of the estate group is dif-
ficult due to an unsatisfactory debt/equity ratio. Measures to improve
the situation are under review.
Cr. No. 334:       Second Electricity Distribution:   US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits
165-IND and 334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays
due to procurement problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result
the project is two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties
have been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. No further delays
are therefore expected.
Cr. No 355:        Beef Cattle Development:  US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project imple-
mentation. Land acquisition and procurement of cattle and goods have been
difficult. Government's budget allocation has been insufficient; and fi-
nancial management and coordination have been weak. The last supervision
mission undertook a thorough project review and its recommendations, which
include major changes in project scope and objectives, are presently under
discussion with Government.
Cr. No. 358:      North Sumatra Smallholder Development:    US$5 Million
Credit of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project performance, which had suffered from severe fin-
nancial and organizational difficulties, has improved greatly. Physical
progress is encouraging; rubber planting and rice intercropping are now
on schedule. There is some room for improvement in financial management,
in which consultants aire assisting. Total project costs are now estimated
at about three times the original estimate of US$10 million. Disbursements
are expected to be completed ahead of schedule.

Cr. No. 387:      Third Education:   US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is about 10 months behind schedule, mainly due
to insufficient top management staff and paper shortages last year. The paper
shortage has been overcome and about 32 million text books will be printed by
January 1976, about four months behind schedule. Steps are being taken to
strengthen project management and to improve arrangements for expert services.
Measures to improve project implementation have been discussed and agreed with
the Government. The book testing and teacher training programs are on schedule,
but their results have not yet been evaluated. Procurement of instructional
equipment will be completed by early 1976.
Cr. No. 388:       Third Highways:  US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections
in the project was started early in 1974 under two contracts and is now 35
percent completed. Contractors have been delayed mainly because of long
mobilization periods and heavy rains. Project costs will likely exceed
original estimates (including contingencies) by 57 percent mainly due to
sharply escalated prices. The training program has been completed success-
fully.
Cr. No. 399:       West Java Thermal Power:  US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 mw units at Muara
Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase
in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. Government will provide
the additional funds required. PLN has satisfactorily met the initial targets
in its financial recovery plan provided for under the terms of the Credit
Agreement.
Cr. No. 400:       Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:   US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Planting is presently slightly behind schedule but
it is expected that targets will be achieved or even exceeded by the end
of the 1975/76 planting season. Project nurseries are well organized
and field work is proceeding well. Also non-participating farmers have
benefitted from the project. Total project costs are estimated to be
double the amount originally envisaged and project management is attempting
to achieve cost reductions. Due to the high prices for tea (about twice
the level ex,'ected at the time of appraisal), the economic rate of return
is still sat.Esfactory.

Cr. No. 405:      Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:   US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Clo_ing Date: June 30, 1979.
In view of the rapid and continuing increase in the cost
of sugar factory machinery and the more recent shortage of budgetary funds,
the scope of the above-mentioned project has been reduced by the deletion of
six minor rehabilitations from the project description. The revised project
consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories and the construction
of a new factory. Credit funds have been reallocated from the minor to
the major rehabilitation and to the new construction.
Cr. No. 428:      Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:   US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Despite an increase in construction costs, the project
remains financially viable because revenues from the sale of plots has
risen proportionately. Construction has fallen behind schedule due to
land acquisition problems, but developed land is being occupied as fast
as it is made available. While there is still a backlog of applications
for industrial plots, the rate of new applications has fallen of-f during
recent months and the estate is intensifying its promotional efforts.
Cr. No. 436:      Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
Dece_mber 31, 1978.
After a long start-up period and difficulties in finding
and recruiting qualified local staff, PDFCI has now reached the operating
stage. Commitments have started and are expected to increase rapidly
as PDFCI's own operational capability improves.
Cr. No. 451:      Fourth Technical Assistance:   US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
ClosLng Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479:      Bali Tourism:   US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effe(tive Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
AvN&,t 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial diffi-
culties. Tender documents for all major infrastructure works were issued
in January 1976. The earliest possible completion date has shifted from
February 1979 to October 1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the
Bali Tourism Development Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Negotia-
tions with one group of investors are in progress but otherwise investor in-
terest appears to be low. Promotional efforts to attract additional investors
will be intensified in 1976.

Cr. No. 480:      Fisheries Credit:   US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After initial delays in project organization and preparation
by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the project is progressing well. Physical
progress is encouraging and lending started in October1975. Disbursements are
therefore expected to be on schedule soon.
Cr. No. 514:        Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension:    US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The consultants are designing works and preparing contract
documents. The first civil works contract is expectd to be let in May 1976,
about nine months behind the original schedule.
Loan No. 1005:       Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been
slow due to poor organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now
improved. Bids have been received for most items and the bulk of the con-
tracts should be signed soon. Passenger traffic in 1975 is slightly lower
than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic has continued
to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive power, which
should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were raised in May
1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25 percent and freight revenues
by about 10 percent, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate further, as
operating costs have continued to rise at a faster rate.
Loan No. 1040:       Jakarta Urban Development:   US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress on the Kampung Improvement Program has been
very good; costs were less than estimated, allowing additional work to be
undertaken. Execution of the Klender Sites and Services Scheme is a year
behind schedule due to disagreements about site boundaries. Most consultant
contracts commenced early in 1976.
Loan No. 1049:       Five Cities Water Supply:  US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the
project is running 8-10 months behind schedule. This delay together



ANNEX II
Page 13 of 14
with higher rates of inflation than anticipated is expected to increase
project costs 20-25 percent above the appraisal estimate. Water Enterprises
have now been established in each of the five cities and good progress has
been made in their staffing. The anticipated interdepartmental decree which
would govern the relationship of the Water Enterprises to the Central Govern-
ment's Directorate of Sanitary Engineering has not been issued; it is now
proposed to clarify this relationship in a Presidential Decree which is
being drafted.
Loan No. 1054:     Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II):   US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Commitments and disbursements initially were slower
than expected, but they should increase in the second half of FY76. The
progress of this project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1089:     Second Fertilizer Expansion:   US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29. 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
Work on the PUSRI III project is proceeding according to
schedule. Work on the related gas pipeline is experiencing delay, but steps
are being taken to expedite implementation.
Loan No. 1100:     Sixth Irrigation:  US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Consultants for the project and technical assistance advisors
have been selected. Construction work is about five months behind schedule
due to the delay in selection of consultants.
Loan No. 1127:     Fourth Power:  US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975;
Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The options for a third 100 MW unit at Muara Karang, which
were included in the tenders for the first two units financed under Credit
399, have been excercised. The project is on schedule and expected to be
completed during 1978.
Loan No. 1139:     Fertilizer Distribution:  US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Progress design is satisfactory. About 60 percent of the
equipment and materials required for the project have been procured.

Financing Plan:     The proposed loan of $37.0 million would finance 98 per-
cent of the foreign exchange cost, or about 58 percent
of the project; the U.K. Government and the UNDP would
finance the remaining foreign exchange cost ($800,000).

Procurement:        Contracts for civil works would be awarded following
international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines in the case of all Department of
Education project institutions and of LAN (which are
all in central locations and for which civil works costs
exe2luding contingencies exceed $1.5 million). In bid
comparison, domestic contractors would be given a 7-1/2
percent preference. In the case of the smaller and often
more remote project institutions administered by the De-
partment of Manpower (with civil works costs ranging from
$200,000 to $800,000), contracts for civil works would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding following
Government's normal procurement procedures, which are
sal:isfactory to the Bank. Equipment and furniture con-
tracts over $50,000 equivalent would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
wit:h the Bank's Guidelines. In bid comparison, domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of
15 percent or existing customs duty, whichever is lower.
Direct Government imports are exempt from customs duties
and. taxes. Equipment and furniture purchases which can-
not reasonably be grouped to form contracts of at least
$5C0,000 equivalent, subject to an aggregate total of $1.8
million equivalent, could be awarded on the basis of com-
petitive bidding advertised locally following usual Gov-
ernment procedures. Off-the-shelf items, in contracts
costing less than $10,000 equivalent subject to an aggre-
gate total not exceeding $200,000 equivalent could be pur-
chased on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations.
