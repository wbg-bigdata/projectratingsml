REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a fourth education project
in the Republic of Indonesia for which Bank assistance of US$37.0 million
is proposed. Three other education projects are being assisted under
Credits 219-IND (1970), 288-IND (1972) and 387-IND (1973) amounting to
US$4.6 million, US$6.3 million and US$13.5 million, respectively. They
aim at improvements in senior technical secondary education, upgrading and
expansion of middle-level agricultural training and the provision of text-
books for the country's primary school pupils. The first project is near-
ing completion on schedule, the second has been delayed by about 15 months
and the third project, while largely on schedule, has qualitative deficien-
cies which the Government is addressing.
ii.       After a period of economic stagnation and general capital stock
depletion in the first half of the 1960s Indonesia has entered a phase of
recovery and renewed growth. The recent increases in the price of oil and
the favorable prospects in other Indonesian export goods have led to an
improvement of the balance of payment and budget situation. This will per-
mit the Government to pursue during the period of the Second Five-Year
Development Plan (1974-79) a vigorous investment policy in industry and
infrastructure to compensate for the uneven distribution of population, land,
natural resources and development potential. This course is expected to
result in an average annual GDP growth rate of 7.5% during the Plan period
and in structural changes emphasizing non-agricultural activities, particu-
larly in the densely populated core islands of Java and Bali.
iii.      An essential condition for the success of this policy would be
an adequate supply of qualified manpower at skilled worker, technician and
engineer/technologist levels and, at the base of the manpower pyramid, a
disciplined work force commanding basic vocational skills. The strength-
ening of civil service training is considered an important complement to
the large industrial and infrastructure investment programs Indonesia is
envisaging.
iv.       Indonesia's technical and vocational education and training system
presently has inadequate supply capacities at skilled and semi-skilled worker
levels. Qualitative shortcomings in this segment include underequipped work-
shops and a lack of suitably prepared technical teachers. These weaknesses
assume increased importance against the background of Indonesia's industri-
alization plans. Training shortages also exist in the field of public admin-
istration. A greater measure of economic and social equity continues to be
a central concern of the Government. Compensatory basic skill training for
disadvantaged rural and urban groups could make an important contribution to
a policy of equal opportunities.



@-ii -
v.        The proposed fourth education project would pursue the following
objectives:
(a)  help meet the country's manpower requirements at skilled
and semi-skilled worker Levels;
(b)  provide disadvantaged rural and urban groups with skills
that would enable them to earn additional incomes or to
improve their livelihoods; and
(c)  contribute towards an improvement in civil service training.
vi.       The proposed project would include:

Technical Assistance
A total of 104 man-years of specialist services and 61 man-years of
fellowships for the three government agencies mentioned above.



- iii -
vii.      The technical teacher training faculties would train annually
500 secondary technical teachers and 50 administrators in support of the
improvement program for senior technical secondary schools, the country's
main source of skilled workers. The centralized workshops would provide
opportunities for intensive workshop practice to about 12,000 senior tech-
nical secondary students each year. The vocational training centers would
train each year almost 12,000 semi-skilled workers and up to 150 instructors
to assure an adequate supply of qualified staff. The mobile training units
would give basic skill training to more than 9,000 rural and urban, mostly
unemployed, youth per year. The public administration training in LAN would
be strengthened and enrollment capacity expanded by 1,100.
viii.     The total project cost including technical assistance to be financed
by the Bank is estimated at US$64.2 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$37.0 million equivalent, or 58% of the total. The proposed loan would
equal the foreign exchange component.
ix.       The proposed project would be administered by two project units.
The existing project unit in the Department of Education in charge of the
first education project has been expanded to enable it to implement and
supervise the proposed Department of Education subproject. A unit in the
Department of Manpower has been established to assume administrative and
financial control and liaison with the Bank with regard to the proposed
Department of Manpower subproject. A Project Implementation Officer in the
National Institute of Administration (LAN) would, in cooperation with the
Department of Public Works and Power, manage the proposed LAN component.
X.        Technical assistance in the amount of 104 man-years of specialist
services and 61 man-years of fellowships would be required for strengthening
management capability, program development and staff training. Of this total
UNDP is currently financing four man-years of specialist services for initial
implementation and agreement has been reached in principle for the UK Govern-
ment to provide 24 man-years of specialist services for centralized workshops.
The remaining technical assistance would be financed out of the proceeds of
the loan. It would be administered by the Government through contracts with
Unesco, ILO and UNOTC, respectively, for the components of the project
related to the Departments of Education, Manpower and LAN. Completion of
such contracts would be a condition of disbursement for each respective
project component.
xi.       Civil works contracts for the Department of Education and LAN
subprojects would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines; domestic contractors
would be given a 7-1/2% preference. Civil works contracts for the Depart-
ment of Manpower subproject would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally following normal Government procedures which
are satisfactory to the Bank. Equipment and furniture contracts over
US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines; domestic manu-
facturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or the existing
customs duty, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing



- iv -
imports. Contracts for equipment and furniture which cannot reasonably
be grouped in packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent, subject to an
aggregate total of US$1.8 million equivalent, could be awarded on the basis
of competitive bidding advertised locally following normal Government pro-
cedures. Off-the-shelf items, each costing less than US$10,000 equivalent,
subject to an aggregate total not exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, could
be purchased on the basis of at least three price quotations.
xii.      Disbursement would be made at the rate of 100% against the
foreign expenditures on Technical Assistance and of directly imported
equipment, 95% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured equipment
excluding sales taxes, 65% of the total cost of imported and locally pro-
cured equipment, 40% of total expenditure on civil works and professional
fees and 30% of total expenditure on furniture.
xiii.     When fully operating in 1980, the project institutions would con-
tribute about 10% towards the estimated annual training requirements for
skilled workers; increase the annual vocational training capacity for semi-
skilled workers from 8,500 to 20,000 and more than double the country's
potential for compensatory basic skill training. Almost 3,500 civil ser-
vants, 1,000 more than at present, would benefit each year from the improve-
ments in public administration training resulting from the project.
xiv.      The project would be completed in five years.  The proposed project
provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$37.0 million equivalent to the
Republic of Indonesia with a term of 25 years, including six years of grace.



REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The lack of properly trained technical manpower, particularly at
technician and skilled worker levels, is a potentially serious constraint
for Indonesia's industrialization program. Accelerated non-agricultural
development, particularly on Java and Bali, is essential for narrowing the
gap between a large and growing population and the insufficient agricultural
resource base in these core islands.
1.02      Indonesia has received three IDA credits for education projects
which pursued both manpower development and equalization objectives (Ap-
pendix I). The first project (1970) under Credit 219-IND (US$4.6 million
equivalent) is financing the construction of five centralized workshops
(TTCs) to strengthen practical instruction for fifteen satellite senior
technical secondary schools. Despite initial delays the project will be
completed on schedule. The second education project (1972) under Credit
288-IND (US$6.3 million equivalent) aims at the upgrading and expansion
of middle level agricultural training. Project implementation is about
15 months behind schedule due to initial delays in contracting consultant
architects and lack of Government counterpart funds. The third project
(1973) under Credit 387-IND (US$13.5 million equivalent) will contribute
towards an improvement of basic education through the testing, production
and distribution of 138 million primary school textbooks.  This complex
project is largely on schedule. Problems have been experienced recently
in quality of the textbooks and project management but are being addressed
b.y the Government (Appendix I).
1.03      The Bank undertook an Education Sector Survey 1/ in November/
December 1973, to evaluate the results of the Government's comprehensive
National Assessment Study on Education and to develop a phased education
investment program suitable for external financing. The Sector Survey as-
sisted the Government in the identification of three projects in the broad
areas of: (i) technical education and vocational training; (ii) agricul-
tural education; and (iii) general education. The first of these is the
subject of this appraisal; the other two will be developed for future con-
sideration, pending the formulation of subsector plans by the Government
and the preparation of pre-investment studies.
1.04      The design of the proposed fourth education project is based on a
request by the Government (November 1974) developed in cooperation with a
UNESCO project preparation team and modified during appraisal in February/

March 1975, and again in July 1975. 1/ A preparatory assistance mission 2/ in
September 1975, financed by UNDP, foriulated a detailed program of technical
assistance to support the project. The proposed project includes priority
education and training programs under the jurisdiction of three agencies: the
Department of Education and Culture (henceforth called the Department of
Education), the Department of Manpower, Transmigration and Cooperatives (hence-
forth called the Department of Manpower) and the National Institute of Adminis-
tration (LAN). The proposed project would cost an estimated US$64.2 million
with a foreign exchange component of IJS$37.0 million.
II. DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
Socio-Economic Background
2.01      The more than 3,000 islands that constitute the Republic of Indo-
nesia are scattered over an expanse of ocean of about 5,000 by 2,000 Km.
This geographic dispersion poses considerable administrative difficulties
for public services including education.
2.02      Indonesia's main economic problem lies in the uneven distribution
of population, land, natural resources and development potential. This
discrepancy shows most acutely in the country's core islands where average
population densities approach 600 persons/km2. Present annual population
growth rates are estimated at 2.4%, up from 2.0% between 1961 and 1971.
Since expansion of cultivated areas on Java has already been driven to,
and in some cases beyond, the sustainable maximum, and since transmigra-
tion to the outer islands cannot be more than a partial solution to the
overcrowding of the core islands, vigorous non-agricultural development
would be imperative. An essential condition for such a restructuring of
the economy would be the adequate development of human resources: the
creation of a disciplined work force with basic vocational skills, a suf-
ficient supply of qualified manpower at skilled worker, technician and
engineer/technologist levels, and an expansion and deepening of public
resource management capability.
2.03      Economic development in the 1960s went through two distinct phases:
a period of stagnation and general capital stock depletion (1960-65), fol-
lowed by a period of recovery and more vigorous growth during the latter
half of the decade. GDP at constant 1960 prices grow by 1.4% p.a. from
1/   It was mutually agreed between the Government and the Bank to delete
the following proposed components from the project because of inade-
quate preparation or financial limitations: four polytechnics, two
new senior secondary technical schools, workshop facilities for five
existing technical schools, and three vocational training centers.

ILO and UNOTC.

1961 to 1966 and 6.6% p.a. between 1966 and 1971. Over the ten year period
1961-71 the labor force grew at 1.5% p.a. to reach 40.1 million and employ-
ment increased by 1.8% p.a. to a total of 39.2 million in 1971.
2.04      Between 1961 and 1971 GDP per capita increased by about 20% in
real terms, and by 1973 had reached a level of about $130. However, this
growth was unevenly distributed and probably accentuated the wide dispari-
ties in GDP per capita that existed among the country's 26 provinces -
ranging from $530 in East Kalimantan to $40 in West Nusa Tenggara -- and
between urban and rural areas (Annex 1). A second, and growing, concern is
unemployment particularly of school leavers. The 1972 Urban Unemployment
Survey arrived at unemployment rates of almost 8% in Surabaya and more than
10% in Jakarta and Bandung. Significantly, almost two thirds of the un-
employed were under 25 years of age and two-thirds had pursued their edu-
cation beyond primary school (Annex 2). Compensatory skill training could
improve the living conditions of this group, and enhance their employment
prospects.
2.05      The recent increase in the price of oil and the improved outlook
for other Indonesian export goods have led to an improvement of the balance
of payment and budget situation. While much of the gain in real terms has
been eroded by simultaneous increases in import prices, the net benefits
accruing to the Central Government from the oil sector, expected to reach a
level of US$3.5 billion in 1975, are still sufficient to give a new dimen-
sion to Indonesia's development prospects. 1/
2.06      This strengthening of the foreign exchange and fiscal base should
enable Indonesia to pursue during the next years a vigorous investment pro-
gram without sacrificing equity considerations which in the recent past have
been given increasing importance by the Government.
Planned Economic Development and Manpower Implications
2.07      The broad objectives of Repelita II, Indonesia's Second Five
Year Plan (1974-79) are to increase employment opportunities, to achieve a
more equitable distribution of incomes and to aim at balanced regional
growth. To achieve this, the economy would have to undergo substantial
structural changes away from agriculture and towards manufacturing and other
modern sectors. More specifically, the Plan aims at a 7.5% p.a. real GDP
growth rate. While agriculture would grow at 4.6% p.a. and have its share
reduced from about 40% to 35% of GDP, all other sectors would increase their
shares, growing at annual rates between 7.7% (services) and 13.0% (manu-
facturing). Employment expansion would be expected to almost equal at 2.5%
p.a. the expected labor force growth. While agricultural employment would
grow at less than 1% p.a. on average, annual growth rates in manufacturing
and services would reach 5.2% and 3.5%, respectively. This would mean a

going through a period of unexpected budgetary stringency to compensate
for previous uncoordinated spending in excess of revenues by Pertamina,
the state oil company.

decrease in the share of agriculture in total employment (from 60% to 55%),
a slight increase (from 8% to 9%) for manufacturing, and an unchanged per-
centage (about 15%) for services.
2.08      Within the manufacturing sector, the main employer of technical
manpower, which is expected to absorb investments totalling US$5 billion.
during the Plan period, the largest absolute employment increases would
occur in the traditional branches of food, beverages and tobacco; textiles
and clothing; and wood and wood products, including pulp and paper. The
largest relative employment growth would take place in the fields of
chemicals including oil derivatives; non-metallic mineral products; and
basic metals - all skill-intensive branches.  The development of these new
industries and the likely increases in labor productivity in the traditional
branches would require substantial inputs of technical skills.
2.09      The manpower and training implications of this planned growth
have not yet been articulated, due in part to the belated availability of
necessary reference data from the 1971 Census. To put the manpower con-
tribution of the proposed fourth education project into perspective, a set
of aggregate manpower estimates for the period 1975-79 will be used. 1, The
assumption of a 7.5% p.a. real growth of GDP underlying it approximates
recent growth rates and equals the Repelita II target. These requirements
estimates will be compared with the relevant supply projections to determine
the order of magnitude of anticipated training surpluses and deficits (all
figures in 1,000).

1/   See IBRD Report No. 443a-IND, App B, pp. 21-25 for similar estimates
and for the underlying assumptions. A higher rate of increase in GDP
would probably increase manpower and training needs more than pro-
portionately.



- 5 -
2.10      Both the requirements and supply estimates contain wide potential
margins of error. On the requirements side, the choice of the 7.5% GDP
growth alternative, the related manpower requirements projections of the
derivation of training needs are uncertain, and on the supply side, the
numbers and quality of university graduates, the future of the private
academies and the feasibility of the Government's upgrading plans for
eighty-six technical senior secondary schools.
2.11      However, the following generalizations appear plausible:
(a)  the total number of university graduates in engineering/
technology would exceed slightly the available jobs,
although not enough sufficiently qualified graduates
might be available in certain fields of engineering;
(b)  properly trained technicians would be in short
supply owing to the virtual absence of relevant
training institutions; some upgrading of skilled
workers and probably continued employment of foreign
technicians would be necessary;
(c)  the training capacity for skilled workers would be in-
sufficient, leading to large-scale upgrading on the job
of semi-skilled workers.
2.12      Another necessary condition for carrying out and coordinating the
numerous industrial and infrastructure investments necessary to change In-
donesia from an agricultural to an intermediate economy would be for the
Government to possess a broad resource management base. Large numbers of
adequately trained civil service staff at intermediate and higher levels
would be required to carry out and supervise the multitude of diverse Gov-
ernment programs needed to pursue the development objectives of the Second
Five Year Plan and beyond. This in turn would demand a selective expansion
and strengthening of public administration training. To give proper focus
to the staff training efforts of the various Government departments, it
would be essential to strengthen the National Institute of Administration
(LAN) in order to enable it to fulfill its triple role of research and de-
velopment, monitoring and central training agent in the field of public
administration training.
III.  TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING
3.01      Structure. Presidential Decree No. 34/72 has delegated the author-
ity for formal education to the Department of Education, whereas the Depart-
ment of Manpower is responsible for non-formal training, and LAN for civil

service training. The education system comprises six years of primary
education, six years of secondary education divided into a lower and upper
cycle and three to five years of higher education (Chart 9787). The educa-
tion structure is complex. Lower secondary education consists in name of
nine different types of specialized schools and upper secondary includes
twelve types. In practice, however, there are few major differences among
the various types of schools because their purposes have not always been
clearly defined and specialized schools tend to lack specialized facili-
ties and equipment.

3.03      Evaluation:  The education and training system is not well equipped
to respond to the present and probable future needs of the labor market (para
2.09). Major shortages have occurred in technical fields where outputs from
vocational, technical secondary and technician courses have been inferior to
demand. Rural out-of-school youth particularly lack access to simple skill
training.



- 7 -
3.04      Technical and vocational training suffers from low quality because
of underqualified teachers, inadequate curricula and lack of appropriate
facilities. Most instructors have not received adequate practical training
and between one- and two-thirds of all technical teachers are considered
unqualified by Indonesian standards. Curricula, usually prepared without
employer participation, contain little practical preparation of students.
Students in technical secondary schools (STM), for example, used to spend
only 8% of their course-work performing practical exercises. Schools tend
to be poorly equipped and short of operating funds for materials, tools and
maintenance.
3.05      The root cause of this low quality is inadequate budget alloca-
tions. Recurrent expenditures per student in Indonesian technical/vocational
schools have been among the lowest in the world. Expenditures on technical
secondary students averaged only US$21 each in 1971, ranging from a low
of US$4 in East Nusa Tenggara to a high of US$36 in Jakarta. Low salaries
force teachers and administrators to hold two or three jobs concurrently,
which dissipates their efforts. Two-thirds of teachers in technical second-
ary schools and 90% of teaching staff in technical academies taught on a part
time basis. The accumulated effects of many years of budgetary stringency
can be overcome only gradually.
3.06      Underfinancing of education, which contributes to poor quality,
paradoxically results in expensive education. Low expenditures per student
in secondary technical schools (STM) on salaries, equipment and supplies
mean that graduates receive inadequate training and are often retrained later
in vocational training centers (PLK). Consequently, their earlier training
is largely wasted. Moreover, the efficiency of secondary technical schools
tends to be low. About 40% of the students who enter secondary technical
schools drop out before completing their studies, thereby using educational
investment which comes only to partial fruition. In 1971 the enrollment
was 6,700 in technical academies, but the output was only 140 due to drop-
outs and repetition among the poorly prepared students who were admitted un-
selectively. Output was similarly low from engineering courses.
Technical/Vocational Institutions by Type
3.07      Engineering Education (Gr. 13-17).  About two thirds of engineer-
ing enrollments are concentrated in two institutions (the Institutes of
Technology in Bandung and Surabaya). Their recent enrollment growth has
been modest (from 9,600 in 1972 to 10,100 in 1975) (Annex 6). The low
output from the 5-year post-secondary courses suggests high dropout and
repeater rates, explained by the inadequate preparation of students in
secondary level science and mathematics. The total output of engineers/tech-
nologists in Indonesia was about 700 in 1972, inadequate to meet manpower
requirements at this level. The limited output means that graduates enjoy
good employment prospects. The Government is presently envisaging a moderate
expansion of this segment of the education system, possibly with financial
assistance from the Asian Development Bank.



- 8 -
3.08      Technical Teacher Training (Gr. 13-17).  Technical secondary
teachers are presently trained in ten technical faculties (FKIT) of
teacher training institutes (IKIP). Staff shortages are acute, particu-
larly of those with industrial experience. About 90% of the teacher-trainers
are part time and most classes are therefore held in the evenings. Little
equipment exists for practical preparation of the teachers. Few students
who enter complete the course. Total enrollment was 3,500 in 1972 but out-
put at the intermediate stage was less than 300. Only about 30% of the
graduates became teachers; the majority joined industry. The quality of
instruction should be improved by concentrating available resources in two
institutions of sufficient scale to attract competent teacher-trainers and
use workshop equipment efficiently.
3.09      Industrial Technician Training (Gr. 13-15).  There is no satis-
factory industrial technician training in Indonesia. Technicians and other
sub-professionals are presently trained in eight public technical academies
(ATN) and in eleven public business academies (AANN) under the Department
of Education enrolling 6,600 and 5,900 students , respectively, in 1972. The
quality of training is poor owing to the prevalence of part time and un-
qualified staff (because of low salaries in relation to private enterprise),
lack of equipment and operating funds. The Government has decided to phase
out all public academies by the end of 1975. The future modes of technician
training will be determined as part of a comprehensive policy for the de-
velopment of higher education. The Government has established a "Higher
Education Development Consultant Team" to assist it in this task. The
initial review work is expected to be completed by early 1976.
3.10      Senior Technical Secondary Schools (STM, Gr. 10-12).  STM enrolled
about 130,000 students in 1972 and graduated 27,000 (Annexes 7 and 8). This
output falls short of demand (para. 2.09), but the actual shortage is much
larger due to substandard training in most STM. Inadequate practical work
in the curriculum, the weak material basis and the underqualified teachers
(para. 3.04) account for the low quality of training. 1/
3.11      Centralized Workshops.  To overcome these weaknesses the Govern-
ment has established five centralized workshops (TTCs) in major urban areas
under Credit 219-IND with a total capacity of 3,000 places and 14,800 stu-
dents per week on a shift basis. These centralized workshops provide prac-
tical facilities to students at satellite STM in the fields of mechanics
and machinery, electricity and electronics, automobile maintenance and
building construction. The TTCs, together with their complement of trained
1/   Junior secondary technical schools or ST (Gr. 7-9) are intended to
give elementary vocational courses. They are to be phased out by 1978
and converted into general schools.

staff, will give a total of about 1,500 hours in proper workshop instruction
over the three year course. 1/
3.12      Vocational Training Centers (PLK) are administered by the De-
partment of Manpower. They are well equipped, have trained instructors and
use curricula (80% practical) worked out in collaboration with employers.
In 1972/73 eight PLK enrolled 6,000 students. Together with five new
centers under construction for 2,500 additional trainees this presents a
sound, albeit narrow, basis for expansion. Trainees belong to three broad
categories: 70% referred by industry to undergo preemployment training;
20% unemployed youth; 10% workers seeking upgrading of skills. Curricula,
based on the ILO modular system, impart about 650 hours of skill training
in each six month course. The mix of courses is determined by job vacancy
and placement data collected by the field offices of the Department of
Manpower. The modular system and short duration of training give PLK
flexibility that permits rapid adjustment to labor market conditions. In-
structors for PLK are trained at a center in Bandung. However, the Bandung
center is inadequate to supply the growing number of instructors required.
The Government intends to reequip the PLK at Singosari to serve as a second
center for instructor training. This would enable it to train each year up
to 150 instructors in a one year course.
3.13      Mobile TraininK Units (MTUs).  The Department of Manpower has
established a system of mobile training units to provide unemployed youth
in urban and rural areas with basic industrial/artisan and agricultural
skills. At present 27 units exist with a training capacity of 1,400 places
and annual training potential of 7,000. The units are of three types, two
providing modern sector skills (e.g., masonry, construction, welding) the
third rural skills (rural construction, farm implement repair and farming
skills). The units consist of training equipment which is moved from village
to village on a training circuit every two months by trucks operating out
of a center, usually a PLK. Trainees are unemployed or underemployed youth
who receive certificates upon completion of the course. The existing MTUs,
potentially a significant means of imparting skills in rural areas where
permanent PLK cannot be established, have suffered from lack of operational
funds which has caused some units to remain idle for part of the year. Be-
cause of this handicap and of the mode of operation of the MTUs it is dif-
ficult to ascertain in quantitative terms the success of this training
program. Instructors and Department of Manpower officials are reporting a
gradual diversification of economic activities and life patterns in the
villages visited. The nature and intensity of these changes would have to
be recorded at various intervals after the contact with the MTUs before a
systematic evaluation of the mobile training unit program could be undertaken.
1/   Recurrent expenditure per student/trainee total about US$200 for the
three-year course in an STM operating in conjunction with a centralized
workshop and average US$130 for a six-month PLK course. However, basic
differences in objectives and in related approaches to imparting skills
would preclude a cost-effectiveness comparison.

3.14      Public Administration Training (LAN).  Training of Government
staff is the responsibility of the National Institute of Administration (LAN)
which (a) directly trains senior Government officials in various areas of
management, (b) coordinates the in-service training of staff by other Govern-
ment departments and (c) serves as central research and development agent in
the field of public administration. The direct training activities of LAN
comprise three-months in-service training courses for top level civil servants
on administration (present annual. output 100), pre-service training to future
government staff (present annual output 400) and a variety of specific short
term courses (e.g., in secretarial skills) totalling 300 trainees per year.
The capacity of LAN to provide effective civil service training has been
limited by several factors: (a) crowded, dispersed and outdated facilities,
(b) the absence of a coordinated training plan based on projections of
training requirements and analysis of training priorities of client agencies,
(c) lack of appropriate Indonesian course materials and (d) insufficiently
qualified teaching staff. The Government intends to expand and strengthen
LAN in order to enable it to play its intended role in the development of
Indonesia's administration.
3.15      Government Plans in Technical/Vocational Education.  The Govern-
ment has identified and is dealing with the weaknesses of technical educa-
tion. During the first Five Year Plan period (1969-74) it introduced the
new concept of centralized workshops and developed new curricula for second-
ary technical education. For the period of the Second Plan (1974-79) and
beyond the following developments are envisaged:
(a) engineering education would be selectively expanded
and efforts would be made to increase its internal
efficiency;
(b) technical teacher training would be concentrated in two
faculties and strengthened;
(c) senior technical secondary schools would have their
facilities upgraded and re-equipped (Annexes 8 and 9).
In major urban areas centralized workshops would serve
groups of STM. Senior technical secondary education
would also profit from better teacher training and the
introduction of new curricula;
(d) junior secondary technical schools would by 1978 be con-
verted into general schools;
(e) the network of vocational training centers and mobile
training units would be expanded to cover all provinces.
3.16      While financial constraints and the relative novelty of some types
of technical/vocational education and training would require a careful timing
for the implementation of this program, limits to staff expansion would appear
to be a more serious problem. The training and continous employment of qual-
ified technical teachers and instructors would remain a task of high prior-
ity.

IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project would pursue the following main objectives:
(a) help meet the country's manpower requirements at skilled
and semi-skilled worker level;
(b) provide disadvantaged rural and urban groups with skills that
would enable them to earn additional incomes or to improve their
livelihoods; and
(c) contribute towards an improvement in civil service training.
4.02      The project items (with their locations shown on the map at the
end of the report) would be as follows:

/a   to be used for other forms of teacher training.
4.03      During negotiations the Government agreed to establish a performance
monitoring system in all the project institutions to collect information on
the following aspects:
(a) external performance: employment status of graduates/
trainees six months and one year after leaving school,
including data on occupation, sector and place of
employment;
(b)  internal performance:  dropout/repetition rates, results
of trade tests or other skill measurements;



- 13 -
(c) course demand: application/admission ratios, requests
by industry and Government agencies for courses;
(d) workshop discipline: accident rates.
4.04      This information would be used (a) to ascertain whether the objec-
tives of the project, as summarized in para. 4.01, are being attained, and
(b) to identify areas in the teaching process that would need strengthening.
The Government has agreed at negotiations to send the Bank a summary analysis
of the relevant data annually for five consecutive years after the project
institutions start operations.
4.05      The effectiveness of technical education and vocational training is
diminished by the lack of uniform trade skill standards which impedes the
deployment of school leavers. During negotiations the Government has
provided assurances that it would establish within three years of the Loan
Agreement a national trade testing scheme.
4.06      Despite a ninefold increase in teachers' base salaries between
1971 and 1975 discrepancies between their pay scales and those in industry
continue to induce technical teachers and vocational training instructors
to switch to better paying jobs. A combination of bonding for a given period
following their initial training (already practiced in some segments of the
education and training system) and of monetary and other incentives could
lessen the "pull" of industrial jobs. The Government has given assurances
at negotiations that it would develop within three years of the date of the
loan Agreement, and thereafter implement, packages of such staff stabilization
measures for each Department of Education and Department of Manpower project
institution.
A. Department of Education
Two Technical Teacher Training Faculties (proposed outlay US$5.0 million) _/
4.07      The present low quality of technical teacher training (para 3.08)
would be raised by consolidating and strengthening training at two FKIT
in Jogyakarta and Padang. The proposed project would construct, furnish
and equip new facilities at these institutions sufficient to enroll 2,050
students. The required staff of 120 teacher-trainers would be obtained
through in-service upgrading of present FKIT personnel, initially with
the help of technical assistance specialists. Internal efficiency would
be improved through careful selection of entrants by means of an examina-
tion open to general and technical senior secondary school graduates. In
order to simplify the curricula, reduce equipment needs and lower recurrent
expenditure of the FKIT, their entrance requirements in workshop practice
would be set equivalent to the level of a graduate from a fully equipped
senior technical school. About 500 technical teachers would graduate each
year from the regular three year program, sufficient to compensate for
attrition (200 teachers or 5% of the present estimated stock of about
4,000 technical teachers each year), for losses to industry and for a
1/   This and subsequent figures on proposed outlays exclude contingencies.



- 14 -
moderate enrollment expansion. In addition to preparation of teachers,
the faculties would enroll 100, and graduate 50, experienced teachers an-
anually in a two-year (grades 16-17) school administration program. To
avoid creating a dual system of secondary technical teachers, the Govern-
ment has given assurances at negotiations that within four years of the
date of the Loan Agreement all technical teacher training for senior sec-
ondary technical schools would be concentrated in the two project institu-
tions.
Four Centralized Workshops (proposed outlay US$14.0 million)
4.08      Centralized workshops (TTCs) appear to be the most expeditious
and economical way of improving the quality of technical schools in major
urban areas (para. 3.11). The proposed project includes the establishment of
four more centralized workshops in Jogyakarta, Semarang, Padang and Palem-
bang. They would serve eleven existing feeder STM with a total enrollment
of 11,900 students and an annual output of about 3,600 skilled workers ,
almost 10% of the country's requirements (para 2.09). The 340 instructors
needed for the workshops would be recruited from teachers already in service
who would receive in-service training. During negotiations, the Government
has confirmed the tentative agreement reached during appraisal to have
groups of 15 students in workshops and of 45 in general courses, thereby
economizing on teacher expenditure per student without significant loss of
quality of instruction. It has also agreed (i) to establish for each TTC an
Advisory Committee consisting of representatives of local industry, adminis-
trators of the feeder STM and TTC staff, to assist the directors of the
centers in their management, (ii) to give proper weight to technical aptitude
in the selection of entrants for the feeder schools; and (iii) to submit
their students to a final examination that would include practical skill
testing.
B.   Department of Manpower
Vocational Training Centers (proposed outlay US$14.4 million)
4.09      The proposed project would help expand non-formal skill training
by establishing 17 new vocational training centers, four in major urban
areas, seven in mid-sized towns and six, which would serve as operational
bases for the mobile training units ,in rural towns. The 17 centers would
enroll 11,600 trainees p.a., mostly unemployed youths between 18-25 years
old, preparing them for Jobs as semi-skilled workers in such occupations
as construction workers, welders, plumbers, motor mechanics, carpenters
and electricians. Curricula materials have already been developed under the
ILO modular system. The 400 instructors required would come from the
special training centers in Bandung and Singosari (para 3.12). Through the
fellowship program supplementing the proposed project the administrative and
technical infrastructure of the Department of Manpower would be strengthened
in the following areas: (i) management and supervisory capability of the
central office and provincial branch offices; (ii) instructor training;



- 15 -
(iii) program development and evaluation, and (iv) establishment of career
planning schemes including testing, selection and counselling services.
Instructor Training Center (proposed outlay US$0.4 million)
4.10      The proposed loan would help finance furniture and equipment at
the Instructor Training Center in Singosari required to strengthen its teach-
ing program (para 3.12). The equipment would enable up to 150 instructors
to be trained properly per annum. The vocational training centers and
mobile training units in the proposed project would require more than 600
instructors. The combined annual output of the Bandung and Singosari centers
(300) would be sufficient to meet this demand over a three-year period and
to allow for the replacement requirements of the existing centers and units,
presently estimated at 100 per year.
Mobile Training Units (proposed outlay US$2.7 million)
4.11      The proposed project would expand the capacity of mobile training
units (para 3.13) by 9,300 trainees, more than doubling the existing capacity.
It would establish 25 new units, 20 for rural areas and five for major urban
areas. The 25 units would use vocational training centers as operational
bases. About 220 additional instructors would be required, to be recruited
from the instructor training centers in Bandung and Singosari. Curricula,
following the ILO modular pattern, have already been developed. To ensure
adequate operating funds, lack of which in the past has idled equipment and
instructors, during negotiations the Government has given assurances
that each MTU would receive adequate annual budget appropriations for
operating courses totalling not less than ten months a year.
C.   National Institute of Administration (LAN) (proposed outlay US$2.9
million)
4.12      The proposed project would construct training and auxiliary faci-
lities (library and accommodation for 200 boarders) sufficient to enable the
consolidation of all LAN's training activities in one location (para 3.14).
Enrollments would increase by 1,100 places, about half the existing places,
and outputs as follows for each major course:

Duration   Output p.a.
(a)  in-service training for senior civil
servant                                      3 mo.          270
(b)  pre-service training for Government          2-1/2 and 3
officers                                       years        800

- 16 -
About 300 total teaching staff would be required. The breakdown of this
staff into LAN personnel and guest 'Lecturers from LAN's client agencies would
have to be decided in the context of a more comprehensive planning exercise.
The future training activities would emphasize functions that have arisen
out of the Government's increased involvement in the process of economic and
social development (such as general planning, financial analysis, program/
project design, implementation and evaluation), rather than on the tra-
ditional regulatory functions. Curricula, including Indonesian case studies,
would be developed as an integral part of the project. The development
of a civil service training plan is required urgently (para 3.14). Disburse-
ment on civil works, furniture and equipment for the LAN sub-project
therefore would be contingent upon the preparation and submission to the
Bank for comment of such a plan.
Technical Assistance (proposed outlay US$5.7 million)
4.13      A total of 104 man-years of specialist services and 61 man-years
of fellowships (Annex 10 and Appendix III) would be needed for strengthening
management capability, program development and staff training. Of this total
UNDP is currently financing four man-years of specialist services for initial
implementation and aagreement has_been reached for the UK government to provide
24 man-years of specialist services for centralized workshops.  The remaining
technical assistance would be financed out of the proceeds of the loan, as
follows:
(a) Department of Education: 30 man-years of specialist
services and 41 man-years of fellowships for cur-
ricula and staff development;
(b) Department of Manpower: 35 man-years of specialist
services and 14 man-years of fellowships for
strengthening management and supervision capability; and
(c) National Institute of Administration: 11 man-years
of specialist services and six man-years of fellowships
to develop curricula and a civil service training plan
and to train staff.
Specialist services would be divided into three phases: (a) initial prepa-
ration of work programs (6 months); (b) assistance in establishment of
institutions (2-3 years) and (c) assistance in initial operation of the
institutions (1-2 years).

5.02      Construction cost estimates have been derived from recent school
building costs, including those for the centralized workshops provided under
the first education project. The average cost per m2 is about US$160, which
accords with building costs in other countries in the region (e.g., Korea,
Malaysia, Philippines). Capital costs per place are US$2,400 for the tech-
nical teacher training faculties, US$5,050 for the vocational training



18 -
centers and US$5,900 for the centralized workshops. 1/ Utilization factors
for classrooms, workshops and laboratories are satisfactory and range from
over 90% for the general purpose classrooms to 70% for the more specialized
facilities, averaging a weekly use of 40 hours. Equipment and furniture
cost estimates are based on lists used for recent similar institutions,
except for the technical teacher faculties for which they have been derived
through detailed workshop-by-workshop analysis. All sketch plans for civil
works and the major components of furniture/equipment lists would be reviewed
by the Bank before procurement. Technical assistance costs have been cal-
culated on the basis per man-year of US$52,000 for specialist services and
US$13,200 for fellowships. These estimates per man-year were derived from an
analysis of the current costs for personnel from specialized UN agencies in
Jakarta and relevant training costs in countries in which fellowship holders
are likely to be placed.
5.03      Base costs refer to estimated prices in October 1975.  A physical
contingency of 10% was added to the base costs. The expected price in-
creases were derived by applying the following annual rates for price esca-
lation: for civil works and furniture, 16% in 1975, 14% in 1976, 12% in
1977-79, and 10% in 1980; for equipment, 12% in 1975, 10% in 1976, 8% in
1977-79, and 7% in 1980; for professional services and technical assistance,
4% throughout the period 1975-80 (Annex 13).
5.04      Based on a detailed analysis of costs incurred under the first
education project, the foreign cost components have been estimated as fol-
lows: (a) civil works; 40%; (b) furniture, 30%; (c) equipment, 87%; (d)
professional fees, 40%; and (e) technical assistance, 90%. Including con-
tingencies, the foreign exchange component of the project including the
technical assistance is estimated at US$37.0 million, or 58% of the total
cost including contingencies; it would be covered by the proposed Bank loan
of US$37.0 million equivalent.
Financial Plan
5.05      The proposed financial plan provides for Bank assistance to
finance 100% of the foreign exchange component of the project (excluding
UK and UNDP assistance).
1/   Capital costs per user/year are much lower for the two latter types
of institutions because of multiple shifts or short duration of courses
(around $1,050 for the centralized workshops and $1,200 for the voca-
tional training centers).

5.06      The annual recurrent expenditure generated by this project once
it is in full operation would be about Rp. 1.1 billion in March 1975 prices
for the Department of Education and Rp. 0.9 billion for the Department of
Manpower, or 1% and 18% of their respective budgets in 1974/75. The esti-
mated operating expenditure for LAN would be about Rp. 0.4 billion, an
increase of 65% over 1974/75. These additional expenditures could be
accommodated without undue difficulty within the anticipated growth of
education expenditure as the Government attaches priority to the proposed
project items.
Project Implementation
5.07      Administration.  The existing project unit in the Department
of Education charged with implementation of the first education project
(Cr. 219-IND) would be responsible for administration, financial control
and liaison with the Bank for the Department of Education sub-project.
The Unit would report to the Directors-General for Higher Education and
for Primary and Secondary Education, with regard to the FKIT and TTC
components, respectively. To enabLe the unit to carry the additional
workload, the Government, in consultation with the Bank, has expanded
it to comprise one Project Director, one Co-Director, one Assistant Director,
two technical education advisers, one project architect, one procurement
officer, one accountant, and adequate technical and clerical support staff.
Except for the Director and Co-Director, all staff would be employed on a
full-time basis.
5.08      A project unit established in the Directorate of Manpower Plan-
ning and Guidance reports to the Director-General of Manpower Development
and Utilization and would be responsible for the implementation of the
Department of Manpower sub-project. It comprises one Project Director,
one Assistant Director, two vocational training specialists, one project
architect, one procurement officer, one accountant, and adequate technical
and clerical support staff. The key officers (Project Director and As-
sistant Director) have been appointed in consultation with the Bank; except
for the Project Director, all staff would be employed on a full-time basis.
5.09      The National Institute of Administration sub-project would,
because of its limited size, be designed by a private consultant and be
managed by the Department of Public Works and Power. The Deputy Chairman
of LAN has been appointed Project Implementation Officer. He would be sup-
ported by a committee of LAN staff and would be responsible for equipment
procurement and for maintaining contact with the Bank. He would also,
together with the supporting committee (and other LAN staff as indicated)
act as counterpart to the technical assistance experts in developing the
civil service training plan (para 4.12 and Appendix III/C/a).
5.10      In order to avoid delays in project implementation, the appoint-
ment of additional officers to the existing project unit in the Department
of Education and the establishment of the project unit in the Department
of Manpower and appointment of its key officers were made before negotiations.



- 21 -
Any future replacement of key officers (Project Directors or Co-Director/
Project Implementation Officer/Assistant Directors) would be made in con-
sultation with the Bank.
5.11      Financing and Execution of Technical Assistance.  In January 1976
a 12-month preparatory assistance project was started (US$200,000) financed
by UNDP. The preparatory assistance covers the salaries of a project co-
ordinator and three team leaders for each of the three government agencies
in the project. The preparatory assistance covers the first year of project
implementation and is intended to ensure essential initial coordination
between physical implementation, and curricula and staff development. Agree-
ments in principle had been reached earlier that the UNDP would finance
the full technical assistance program. However, recent financial constraints
have prevented UNDP from committing funds for the full project. Therefore,
the Government has agreed to finance the required technical assistance out
of loan funds. Should UNDP funds become available for this purpose, the
corresponding amount would be cancelled from the loan. Administration of
the Bank-financed technical assistance would be done by the Government through
agreements with institutions for the three project components. It is expected
that these agreements would be funds-in-trust contracts with Unesco, ILO and
UNOTC. Conditions of disbursement for each project component related to the
Departments of Education, Manpower and LAN, respectively, would be conclusion
of an agreement satisfactory to the Bank with an institution acceptable to
the Bank.
5.12      Professional Services.  Design and supervision of civil works would
be carried out by consultants acceptable to the Bank selected and appointed by
the Departments of Education, Manpower and LAN (for the latter in consultation
with the Department of Public Works and Power), on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank. The consultants would work under the supervision of the respective
project units through the project architects. Except for the FKIT and LAN,
Indonesia has sufficient numbers of qualified consultants to design and supervise
the civil works in the project. Satisfactory project implementation requires
timely recruitment of consultants to prepare the architectural designs. To
avoid the delays experienced in the past, the selection and appointment of
consultant architects have already been completed.
5.13      Sites.  All sites for the proposed six Department of Education
institutions and for LAN had been selected and three acquired prior to
negotiations. The majority of sites for the proposed Department of Manpower
institutions had not yet been selected at the time of appraisal, but
reasonable progress in site selection and acquisition had been achieved
and the necessary budgetary allocations made by the time of negotiations.
5.14      Procurement.  Contracts for civil works would be awarded follow-
ing international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guide-
lines in the case of all Department of Education institutions and of LAN
(which are all in central locations and for which civil works costs excluding



- 22 -
contingencies surpass US$1.5 million). In bid comparison, domestic contractors
would be given a 7-1/2% preference. In the case of the smaller and often more
remote Department of Manpower schools (with civil works costs ranging from
US$200,000 to US$800,000), contracts for civil works would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following normal Government
procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign firms would be allowed
to participate. Prior Bank review would be required for all civil works contracts
exceeding US$100,000 equivalent. Equipment and furniture contracts over US$50,000
equivalent would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. In bid comparison, domestic manu-
facturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the existing customs
duty, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports.
Direct Government imports are exempt from customs duties and taxes. Equipment
and furniture purchases which cannot reasonably be grouped to form contracts
of at least US$50,000 equivalent, subject to an aggregate total of US$1.8
million equivalent, could be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally following normal Government procedures, which are satis-
factory to the Bank. In addition, off-the-shelf items in contracts not
exceeding US$10,000 equivalent subject to an aggregate total not exceeding
US$200,000 equivalent could be purchased on the basis of a minimum of three
price quotations. Prior Bank review would be required on all equipment and
furniture contracts exceeding US$50,000 equivalent.
5.15      Disbursement.  The proposed loan of US$37.0 million would finance
the foreign exchange component of professional fees, civil works, furniture
and equipment. Bank Group financial assistance would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures on technical assistance
and of directly imported equipment and vehicles;
(b) 95% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured
equipment and vehicles, excluding sales taxes;
(c) 65% of the total cost of imported and locally procured
equipment;
(d) 40% of total expenditures on civil works and of profes-
sional fees; and
(e) 30% of the total expenditures of furniture.
These percentages are equivalent to the relevant foreign exchange components.
They would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursements over the imple-
mentation period of the project. Savings under one category would be avail-
able to cover cost overruns in other categories. Withdrawal applications
would be aggregated to the extent feasible in groups of US$50,000 prior to
submission to the Bank for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the proposed
loan. Expenditures for consultant architects incurred after December 1,
1975 would be financed retroactively from the proposed loan, up to a total
of US$100,000 equivalent. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown
in Annex 14. Disbursement is expected to be completed by 1980.



- 23 -
5.16      Implementation Period.  The proposed project would be executed in
about four years after loan effectiveness, with implementation periods of
3.5, 3.0 and 3.5 years, respectively, for the Department of Education,
Department of Manpower and LAN sub-projects (Annexes 15a and b).  The
Closing Date would be December 31, 1980.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      Indonesia's technical and vocational education and training system
is unable to supply sufficient skilled and semi-skilled workers, and has
qualitative shortcomings such as under-equipped workshops and lack of
suitably prepared technical teachers. These weaknesses assume increased
importance against the background of the country's industrialization plans.
Training shortages also exist in the field of public administration. Apart
from these manpower considerations, a greater measure of economic and social
equity continues to be a central concern of the Government; compensatory
basic skill training for disadvantaged rural and urban groups could make an
important contribution to a policy of equal opportunities.
6.02      The proposed project would aid the development of technical man-
power in Indonesia by:
Mi) increasing the output of skilled workers through the
provision of four centralized workshops for technical
senior secondary schools, and by assuring the necessary
supply of qualified technical teachers through the
simultaneous improvement of two technical teacher
training faculties;
(ii) expanding the capacity for non-formal vocational
training at the semi-skilled worker level through
the provision of seventeen vocational training
centers (PLK), and by assuring the necessary supply
of qualified instructors through the re-quipping of
an instructor training center;
6.03      The proposed mobile training units would pursue equalization ob-
jectives by providing disadvantaged rural and urban groups with basic skills
that would enable them to earn additional incomes or to improve their live-
lihoods.
6.04      The proposed strengthening of the National Institute of Admin-
istration (LAN) would lead to an increased supply of better trained civil
servants at national and provincial levels, and thus provide for a more
effective and efficient operation of public administration.



- 24 -
6.05      Quantitatively, the project institutions would train each year:
(i) about 3,600 skilled workers, almost 10% of the estimated
requirements (paras. 2.09 and 4.08);
(ii)  about 11,600 workers at the upper range of the semi-
skilled level thus more than doubling the existing
annual training potential (para 4.09).
6.06      The annual capacity of the rural mobile training units would in-
crease from about 5,800 to 10,600 participants and that of the urban units,
from 4,500 to 6,300. However, the likely demonstration effect of the train-
ing would spread beyond the small group of direct participants.
6.07      The proposed improvement and expansion of the National Institute
of Administration would benefit annually 270 civil servants in the top cate-
gory and those to be promoted into it. It would reach through pre-service
training another 800, about 10% of the estimated training requirements for
the annual entrants into the intermedliate levels.
6.08      Despite this expansion of specific segments of the education and
training system training deficits at skilled and semi-skilled worker levels
would persist. Since an immediate large-scale replication of the relevant
items in the proposed project is ruled out by staff and financial con-
straints, the economy would have to rely on alternative avenues of manpower
supply. Up-grading of semi-skilled workers would mainly be used to reduced
the deficit of skilled workers; the vocational training centers could sup-
port this process by concentrating on post-employment training. This would
leave the initial training of semi-skilled workers largely to the enterprises,
with the mobile training units as a supply source for basic skills.
6.09      The realization of the benefits expected from the proposed project
would depend on several conditions:
(i) all project institutions would have to be assured an
adequate and steady supply of qualified staff (para 4.06);
(ii)  program development and evaluation in the field of
vocational training would have to be strengthened
(para 4.09);
(iii)  the mobile training units would require adequate funding
for a continuous operation (para 4.11);
(iv)  public administration training activities by various
Government agencies would need to be coordinated and
made subject to overall planning (para 4.12); and
(v)  technical assistance would have to be available in a
timely fashion sufficient in numbers and quality to
assure proper development and functioning of the project



- 25 -
institutions, in particular the training of local
teaching and administrative staff. The various technical
assistance components would have to be properly coordinated
with the capital investment (para 5.11).
The proposed project includes provisions to ensure that each of the above
conditions is met,
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government
on the following principal points:
(a)  the establishment of a project performance monitoring
system, a national trade testing scheme and staff
stabilization measures (paras 4.04 - 4.06);
(b)  the concentration of all secondary technical teacher
training at the two project FKITs (para. 4.07);
(c) establishment of advisory committee for each TTC and
testing of applicants and graduates (para. 4.08); and
(d)  provision of adequate recurrent budgets for mobile
training units (para. 4.11).
7.02      The Government has already taken the following steps in prepara-
tion for project implementation:
(a)  organization and staffing of project implementation units
in the respective Departments (paras. 5.07 - 5.10);
(b)  signing of an agreement with UNDP for preparatory
assistance and agreement in principle with the U.K.
Government for provision of technical assistance
(paras 4.13 and 5.11);
(c)  selection and appointment of consultant architects
(para 5.12); and
(d)  selection and substantial acquisition of all sites
(para 5.13).
7.03      Conditions of disbursement would be as follows:  (a) the submission
to the Bank for comment of a civil service training plan for disbursement on
civil works, furniture and equipment for the National Institute of Adminis-
tration (LAN) subproject (para 4.12); and (b) the conclusion of an agreement
satisfactory to the Bank with an institution acceptable to the Bank for



- 26 -
disbursement on each project component related to the Departments of Education,
Manpower and LAN, respectively (para 5.11).
7.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$37.0 million to the Republic of Indonesia for a term of 25 years,
Including six years of grace.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORLD BANK GROUP
EDUCATION PROJECTS IN INDONESIA
Three education projects are presently being carried out with
World Bank assistance. They can be summarized as follows:
(a) Indonesia I (Credit 219-IND)
(i) Project Description:
Total project cost (appr. est.)           US$7.6 million
Amount of credit                          US$4.6 million
Amount disbursed (3/12/76)                US$4.0 million
Date of Credit Agreement                  November 6, 1970
Closing Date                              December 31, 1976
(ii) Project Content:
Five new centralized workshops (TTCs)
for technical senior secondary schools
(iii)  Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and
should be completed five months ahead of schedule. Three
of the five centers opened in April 1975, and the remaining
two started operations in June, 1975. At the beginning
of the new school year (January 1976) all centers should
work fully.
Furniture delivery and installation has been completed, and
about two thirds of the equipment have been installed. Two
groups of 260 technical teachers each have completed their basic
training. Disbursement has improved steadily. The revised
total project cost is about 40% above the appraisal estimate;
the Government will finance the cost overrun.
Technical training centers appear to be the most economical
way of upgrading workshop instruction in technical schools
in an urban environment, i.e. in centers where a sufficient
number of technical schools are within commuting distance.
This advantage and the urgent need to improve technical
senior secondary schools have led the Government to undertake
a replication of this type of facilities in four more cities.

(ii)  Project Content:
-    13 in-service training centers and a training institute
for agricultural extension workers (rehabilitation,
expansion and equipping);
-    two new agricultural senior secondary schools (SPMA);
-    twelve agricultural senior secondary schools (rehabil-
itation, expansion and equipping).
(iii)  The latest revision has brought the total project cost estimate
to US$22 million, almost 80% above the appraisal estimate.
Project implementation is presently about 15 months behind
schedule owing to delays in the appointment of consultant
architects and the recruitment of technical specialists and
a temporary lack of Government counterpart funds.
The following specific implementation problems exist at
present:
(i) delays in acquisition of farmland for some of the
project schools, and inefficient management of
school farms;
(ii) poor utilization of technical specialists because of
unsatisfactory counterpart arrangements;
(iii) delays in the execution of the fellowship program;
(iv) unsatisfactory progress in the recruitment of
full-time teachers for project institutions in
remote areas.
Appropriate actions are being taken to overcome these problems.

the Canadian loan in order to minimize production costs in
the face of the major increase in world paper prices during
the last two years.
The complex programs for teacher training and manuscript
testing are on schedule but improvements are necessary in
1976. Vehicles for the mobile teacher training teams,
motorcycles for school inspectors and teaching equipment,
have arrived in Indonesia. The Government is taking action
to strengthen the size and qualifications of the project
unit by the recruitment of three expatriate specialists
and Indonesian consultants in order to rectify the short-
comings in management capacity identified during recent reviews.

THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Summary Evaluation 1/
1.        The Indonesian formal education system comprises six years of
primary education usually starting at age 7 (grades 1-6), three years of
junior secondary education (grades 7-9), three years of senior secondary
education (grades 10-12) and three to five years of post-secondary education
(grades 13-17) in academies or universities (Charts 9785 and 9887). Re-
sponsibility for vocational training is vested with the Department of
Manpower (charts 9784 A and B) and for civil service training with the
National Institute of Administration (LAN) (Chart 9786).
2.        At the lower levels of education, enrollment levels (about 80%
in primary and 22% in junior secondary education) are relatively high con-
sidering the very limited budgets that have been available for education
in the past (Chart 9788). However, they conceal disparities among the
provinces and between urban and rural areas, as well as high dropout and
repetition rates. Enrollments in secondary and higher education appear to
be reasonably well-balanced between general and technical/professional
options (Annexes 4 and 6), but owing to the past continuous shortage of
funds, technical schools are often insufficiently equipped so that they
differ only in name from general schools. Low teacher salaries have induced
many teachers to seek additional employment, thus fragmenting their efforts.
Shortcomings in educational opportunity, quality and internal efficiency
are matched by low external productivity: inadequate and inappropriate
education has led to large numbers of youth without marketable skills leav-
ing the education system every year, side by side with manifest shortages
of technicians and skilled workers.
Education Development Objectives
3.        The Government has identified the weaknesses of the education
system and developed plans to overcome them. During the First Five Year
Development Plan (Repelita I, 1969-74) educational administration and plan-
ning were strengthened, and a beg:Lnning was made to improve the quality of
primary and technical senior secondary education. Experiments were launched
with comprehensive secondary schools (Development Schools) which would
eventually produce a simplified model to replace the present overly complex
structure. Other efforts were directed at selective strengthening of
higher education institutions and at developing non-formal education
schemes.

Report February 5, 1975.



APPENDIX II
Page 2
4.        The Second Five Year Development Plan (Repelita II, 1974-79),
stresses equity considerations and the "social sector." It aims at further
expansion and improvements of education and training and its integration
with economic development. The plan foresees:
(a) an increase in primary enrollments by more than
50% to a gross enrollment ratio of 91% in 1978;
(b) the introduction of a unified junior secondary
school and an expansion of enrollments by one-third;
(c) the extension of textbook production and teacher
in-service training programs to junior secondary
education;
(d) the establishment of libraries and laboratories
at all Government secondary schools;
(e) in higher education, the support of selected fields
of study (agriculture, geology, civil engineering
and accountancy), and the creation of a sub-
professional certificate program to reduce the
repetition and dropout problem at this level;
(f) the rehabilitation of all Government school buildings;
and
(g) curriculum improvements at all education levels.
Besides these general measures, a series of specific improvements in tech-
nical education and vocational training will be carried out (para 9 below).
Education Financing
5.        Persistent shortages of funds in the past have contributed to the
development of a complex education financing system. Besides the Government
schools, there exist three types of private schools which differ in their
degree of subsidization which in turn is determined by their meeting of
certain quality and performance criteria.
6.        The most important source of education finance is the Central
Government which spends about 20% of its recurrent (routine) budget and
5% of its development budget on education, totalling about 2% of GDP
(Annexes 5a and 5b). The administration of funds differs among the various
levels of education and from one type of expenditure to another. Personnel
in state primary schools are paid by the Department of Home Affairs, with
the provincial governments as intermediaries. At higher levels, salaries
derive from the budget of the Department of Education and are channelled
through its provincial offices. Provincial and local governments play



APPENDIX II
Page 3
a lesser role in the financing of education, except as fiscal agents for
Central Government funds and for fee revenues. The latter are the second
most important source of finance ranging from 10-30% of school budgets.
The former multitude of fees and contributions has been replaced by a single
fee differentiating by level and branch of education, location of school,
parental income and number of children. Since 1974, the system has been
simplified by applying a uniform fee level within individual schools.
7.        The planned educational developments summarized in para 4 above
would imply an increasing role of the Central Government in the financing
of education. This development became apparent in 1973 when an extra-
ordinary allocation of Rp 15.8 billion was made for primary school con-
struction; the subsequent increase in teacher salaries continued this trend.
For Repelita II (1974-79), the Department of Education's development expend-
iture has been budgeted at Rp. 436 billion, as compared to Rp. 37 billion
for the preceding five-year period.
8.        The corresponding recurrent expenditure by the Department of
Education in 1978/79 could be expected to be in the order of Rp. 200-220
billion in 1973 prices up from Rp. 85 billion in 1973/74; this growth should
be within the Government's financial capabilities.
Technical Education and Vocational Training: Present Situation and Prospects
9.        Indonesia's broad industrial skill levels and the corresponding
educational qualifications follow a pattern observed in many other countries:
Skill Level                         Education Level
Engineers/Technologists             Universities and Institutes of Technology
(5-year courses, grades 13-17)
Technicians                         Academies (3-year courses, grades 13-15)
Skilled Workers                     Technical Senior Secondary Schools
(STM or STM(P), 3- or 4-year courses,
grades 10-12 or 9-12)
Semi-skilled Workers/Operatives    Vocational Training Centers (PLK, 6-month
courses, no grade structure) on in-plant
training; technical junior secondary
schools (ST).
Most segments of the technical education system share a number of weak-
nesses brought about by two decades of enforced neglect because of lack of
funds: shortages of properly trained teachers, serious underequipping,
insufficiently developed curricula and inadequate learning materials. With
the improvement of the country's financial situation, the Government is



APPENDIX II
Page 4
undertaking the following broad improvements in its entire technical educa-
tion and vocational training system:
(a) the establishment of a national coordinating committee
for technical education and vocational training, in
compliance with a covenant in Credit 219-IND;
(b) the phasing out of all technical junior secondary
schools;
(c)  enrollment control coupled with quality improvements
in technical senior secondary schools;
(d) the abolition of the ineffective public three-year
academies and their replacement by a different type
of post-secondary education;
Ce) strengthening of in-service technical teacher
training; and
(f) expansion of non-formal vocational training.
Engineers/Technologists
10.       About two thirds of engineering/technology enrollments are
concentrated in two institutions (the Institutes of Technology in Bandung
and Surabaya). Their recent enrollment growth has been modest (from 9,600
in 1972 to 10,100 in 1975; Annex 6). The low output from the 5-year post-
secondary courses (in 1972 only 440 out of 9,200 students) suggests high
dropout and repeater rates which in turn are explained by the inability of
most students to meet the good quality standards of these two institutions.
11.       The total output of engineers/technologists in Indonesia was about
700 in 1972 and 500 in 1973 which is considered inadequate to meet manpower
requirements at this level. The Government is presently envisaging a
moderate expansion of this segment of the education system, possibly with
financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank.
Technicians
12.       Technicians and other sub-professionals are presently trained in
eight public technical academies (ATN) and in eleven public business
studies academies (AANN). The 1972 enrollments in these three-year post-
secondary courses were about 6,600 and 5,900, respectively (Annex 7). The
quality of instruction, particularly in the ATN, has been unsatisfactory,
owing mainly to lack of equipment and operating funds and the prevalence
of part-time and unqualified staff.



APPENDIX II
Page 5
Skilled Workers
13.       The customary sources of supply for skilled workers have been the
technical senior secondary schools (STM and STM(P) 1/, the vocational
training centers (PLK) under the Department of Manpower and on-the-job train-
ing. In 1972, about 130,000 students were enrolled in 450 public and
private senior secondary technical schools (STM), and about 27,000 gradu-
ated from the three-year program (Anmex 8). The Government plans to in-
crease this output to 41,000 by 1981), with 1,200 coming from STM(P), 600
from technical agricultural senior secondary schools (STM Pertanian/Tek-
nologi), 9,000 from STM supported by centralized workshops and the remaining
30,000 from other STM (see Annex 9).
14.       However, only slightly less than half the graduates (about 20,000
would have come from properly equipped schools and thus possess the re-
quisite practical skills (Annex 10). This is tantamount to a concealed
annual training deficit of about 21,000 2/. To mitigate the equipment short-
age in the senior technical secondary schools, the Government has decided
to build centralized workshops (Technical Training Centers, TTCs) in suita-
ble urban catchment areas. The Bank Group is supporting this concept by
assisting in the establishing of the first five centers in the country's
main cities (Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Medan and Ujung Pandang) to serve
15 STM (Cr. 219-IND). Their total capacity is just under 3,000 which means
that with double-shift operation a total of 14,000 students can be given
proper workshop instruction.  The amnual TTC output from 1976 onwards will
be about 4,500 in the following areas: mechanics and machinery, electricity
and electronics, automobile maintenamce and repair and building construction.
15.       Since centralized workshops appear to be the most expeditious and
economical way of improving the qua:Lity of technical schools in major urban
areas, the Government plans to establish four more TTCs in Padang (West
Sumatera), Palembang (South Sumatera), Semarang (Central Java) and Yogyakarta
where a total of ten feeder schools exist within commuting distance. The
Government also intends eventually to provide workshops for those STM for
which centralized workshops would not be a viable proposition because of
isolated location. Present plans foresee the equipping of 86 STM by 1978.
This would raise the number of STM with a satisfactory standard of equip-
ment to 113, and total output to about 19,000.
1/   The four-year Development Senior Secondary Technical Schools (grades
9-12).
2/   This would seem to be an optimLstic estimate as it would assume that
the Government's plans to reequip and upgrade 86 STM could be carried
out by that date (see para 17 below).



APPENDIX II
Page 6
16.       This program of quality improvement might be expected to meet with
difficulties arising from (i) the rather ambitious target which could cause
financial and staff constaints; and (ii) the small size of many STM which
would pose problems of viability.
17.       Other serious handicaps for the technical senior secondary schools
are the poor quality of teachers particularly in technical fields, and
shortcomings in school administration. Technical teachers are presently
trained in ten technical teacher training faculties (FKIT) in three - and
five-year courses. Lack of equipment and staff shortages have led to in-
adequate and inefficient training: in 1972 only 300 students (out of 3,500
total enrollments) graduated from the intermediate three-year course.
18.       To overcome these weaknesses, the Government plans to increase
the supply of properly trained technical teachers by strengthening pre-
service technical teacher training at two technical teacher training
faculties (FKIT) in Padang and Jogyakarta; and to provide in-service tech-
nical teacher training through the establishment of a technical teacher
training institute in Bandung. Secondly, it will offer fellowships to
administrators and initiate a special two-year program in administration
and school management in the two above-mentioned FKIT.
19.       Another weakness of senior technical secondary education is pre-
sently being removed with the introduction of a new curriculum. The former
one included only eight periods per week, or 20% of the total, for workshop
training (the effective number of periods was even lower because of the
general shortage of equipment). The new curriculum contains 16 weekly periods
of practical training, amounting to a total of about 1,500 hours over the
three-year course and reaching a skill level fully acceptable to industry.
The centralized workshops are to play a crucial role in carrying out and
testing the new curriculum.
20.       The eight Development Senior Secondary Technical Schools (STM(P))
constitute a small but important high-quality experimental segment within
Indonesia's education system. The duration of their courses is four years,
and the total number of hours for practical training reaches about 2,000.
Students attain "terminal one" qualification at the end of two years and
"terminal two" after the full four-year course. The first level embodies
about 1,000 hours of workshop instruction which is slightly below what might
be termed the "skill threshold" of a skilled industrial worker. "Terminal
two" represents a level of practical proficiency which would be fully suf-
ficient to carry out the job of a skilled worker and would qualify its
holders for eventual supervisory positions.
PLK
21.       The vocational training system under the Department of Manpower
presently comprises eight industrial vocational training centers (PLK) and
three agricultural vocational training centers with an annual training
potential of about 6,000. Five more centers now under construction would



APPENDIX II
Page 7
increase the capacity to about 8,500 trainees per year, still clearly in-
adequate to meet the country's needs for competent operatives and semi-skilled
workers.
22.       The PLK curricula allocate about 80% of the 33 weekly hours to
practical work; each six-month course thus contains approximately 650 hours
of skill training. The mix of cDurses is determined on the basis of job
vacancy and placement data collected by the field offices of the Department
of Manpower. The courses use the ILO modular system and cover the follow-
ing fields: gas welding, electric welding, electrical repair work,
machine work, general fitting, plumbing and pipe fitting, gasoline engine,
diesel engine, diesel locomotive, woodwork, bricklaying, radio servicing,
TV servicing, secretarial work, tailoring and handicrafts. The modular
system and the short duration of the training give the vocational training
centers a high degree of flexibility that would permit a rapid adjustment
to changes in national and local labor market conditions. This is borne out
by the high employment rate -89% on average - of former trainees.
23.       PLK trainees must be at least 18 years of age and have left the
formal education system (with the exception of STM pupils who may use the
workshop facilities under a cooperative agreement between their schools
and the PLK). 1/ They belong to three broad categories: 70% are referred
by industry to undergo pre-employment training; 20% are direct referrals,
generally by a Department of Manpower field office, of unemployed youth;
and the remaining 10% are workers sent by industry to be upgraded. Although
there are no specific educational requirements, two thirds of the first
group are secondary school graduates, mostly from technical schools, who
lack practical training.
24.       While the quality of instruction in the vocational training centers
is high, the amount of specific occupational skills and of related theore-
tical knowledge that can be imparted during one six-month course would in
most cases be at the upper end o:E the semi-skilled range rather than being
that of a skilled worker.
25.       Instructor training has been given at the PLK in Bandung and
Singosari and directly in PLK established with bilateral assistance, with
foreign technical experts doubling as instructors and instructor-trainers.
The quality of the presently ava:Llable Indonesian instructors is satis-
factory but their numbers are too small for the envisaged expansion of
the vocational training system (:including the mobile training units which
use the same type of instructors). The Government intends to re-equip the
PLK at Singosari (East Java) to serve as a second center for instructor
training.
1/   It is expected that the PLK will cease to serve this ancillary but
important role once the techmical senior secondary schools have
reached an adequate standard of equipment.



APPENDIX II
Page 8
On-the-Job-Training
26.       The extent and modalities of on-the-job training in Indonesia
are unknown. Given the scarcity of good technical education and vocational
training facilities, this form of skill acquisition is likely to be of
importance, particularly at operative level where lesser inputs of equipment,
instructors and training time are required, and among larger firms which
would need those workers most urgently and could better afford any production
foregone caused by the training. The present lack of a trade testing system
however, precludes such training efforts from being used more systematically
for meeting the skill requirements of the economy.
MTUs
27.       In an effort to provide rural and urban unemployed youth with
basic agricultural and industrial/artisan skills that would permit them to
earn additional income or to improve homes and farms, the Department of
Manpower has established a system of mobile training units.
28.       Each unit consist of the following elements:
(a) equipment and other training materials;
(b) instructors;
(c) temporary physical shelter; and
(d) transportation equipment, each serving four instructors/
equipment combinations.
The MTU works from a center (a PLK or a small operational base) that serves
as repair and maintenance workshop. Each unit is given a training circuit
consisting of a variable number of villages.
29.       At the end of a course lasting up to two months instructors and
equipment move to the next location on the training circuit, and the
temporary shelter receives equipment and instructors for a different course.
This rotation continues until the basic training needs of a catchment area
are considered satisfied.
30.       The network of MTUs in Indonesia presently comprises 27 units (two
thirds of them of the industrial type) in 19 provinces. The total capacity
is about 1,400 training places; with five courses per year the annual train-
ing potential is slightly below 7,000. This level of output is however,
presently not attained as insufficient operational funds have caused a
number of units to idle for part of the year.



APPENDIX II
Page 9
31.       The age and education of the trainees in the urban units are
similar to those of PLK trainees. They are referred either by industry (60%)
or by the Department of Manpower (30%), the remaining 10% are recruited
from the surrounding rural areas. The rural MTUs enroll exclusively youth
or young adults who might be classified as unemployed or severely under-
employed or who are otherwise (economically-socially-educationally) dis-
advantaged. All courses are given free of charge. The selection of the
itinerary for the mobile training units furthermore assures due consideration
of collective (as distinct from the before-mentioned individual) equity
criteria.
32.       The mobile training units belong to three basic types, depending
on the specific manpower demand and supply conditions of the region to
be served. Two types provide basic industrial skill training geared to
two levels of industrial diversity: one includes woodworking, masonry,
soldering/forging, and radio servicing, the other electric wiring, con-
struction, motor repair, welding/forging, and plumbing/pipe fitting. The
courses usually parallel the ones given in the PLK to which the unit is
attached. These mobile units typically serve rural areas surrounding
population centers or rural high-density areas anticipating non-agricultural
development.
33.       The third, rural, type is geared to the needs of more remote
areas. Its courses comprise rural construction, farm machinery maintenance,
blacksmithing and metal working and handicrafts as well as agricultural
skills proper (animal husbandry, commercial and subsistence crops, inland
fisheries).
34.       Trainees are given certificates of completion upon passing an
informal skill test. The success of this training program is difficult
to ascertain given the mode of operation of the MTUs. Instructors and
Department of Manpower officials are reporting a gradual diversification of
economic activities and life patterns of the villages visited by the MTUs.
The nature and intensity of these changes would have to be recorded at
different intervals after the contact with the MTUs before any systematic
evaluation of the mobile training unit program could be attempted.
35.       Junior Secondary Technical Schools (ST).  These schools under the
Department of Education encompassing grades 7-9 are intended to offer an
elementary vocational course with about 35% of weekly class time spent on
practical work. Over 30% of the teaching force are part-time; more
than half the teachers are unqualified. There is no laboratory work in
science teaching. In reality, these schools offer a sub-standard pre-
vocational course with little practical content, mainly due to lack of funds
for materials, tools and electricity. More than half of the annual output
(about 40,000) continue to further education in STM; the remainder may
join the labor force but are not considered as having acquired basic
vocational skills. The Government is aware of these problems and is phasing
out ST by 1978 and replacing them with SMP. The recent development of



APPENDIX II
Page 10
ST appears to anticipate this development: the number of public ST has
declined from 605 in 1971 to 579 in 1973, and their enrollments have remained
around 140,000.
Public Administration Training
36.       Pre-service and in-service training of civil servants is not
unlike vocational training as it aims at preparing the trainees for jobs
which require technical expertise in a specific segment of Government (e.g.,
law enforcement, public finance, health). Consequently, many countries,
among them Indonesia, have traditionally decentralized their civil service
training around the main user agencies rather than carried out by one single
institution.
37.       As civil service training is increasingly concerned with the
mastering of the discipline "administration" as the common base for all Govern-
ment activities and as the public sector gains in scope and complexity, a
trend towards uniform objectives, criteria and techniques is appearing.
38.       Recent legislation in Indonesia is clearly favoring the develop-
ment of such a common approach to public administration. Examples are
Presidential Decisions No. 5/71 which formulated the terms of reference
for the National Institute of Administration (LAN) and No. 34/72 which
allocated responsibilities for all education and training activities, giving
LAN sole overall responsibility in the field of civil service training.
39.       The direct training activities of LAN comprise three-months in-
service courses for top-level civil servants (present annual output 100),
pre-service training at undergraduate and graduate levels (present annual
output 400), and a variety of specific short-terms courses (e.g., in secre-
tarial skills) totalling 300 trainees per year.
40.       Besides its own training activities LAN has been given two other
functions: (i) to coordinate and monitor staff training activities of
other Government agencies; and (ii) to serve as central research and
development agent in the field of public administration. The Government
intends to expand and strenthen LAN in order to enable it to play its
intended key role in the development of Indonesia's administration.
