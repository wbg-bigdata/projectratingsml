PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 868-EGT)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Education
Project in the Arab Republic of Egypt (Credit 868-EGT), for which a credit
of US$40 million was approved in December 1978. The completion date was
March 31, 1985, and unused Credit proceeds of about US$40.0 million are to
be cancelled on September 30, 1985.
This Project Completion Report was prepared following a field
visit by an Europe, Middle Eass and North Africa Regional Office Education
mission in February/March 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff..  The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments in March 1987. No comments have
been receivred.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 868-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The project was based on a series of pre-investment studies
financed under the First Education Project (Credit 681-EGT) and prepared
by the Government with  assistance  from  a  Bank  group mission in October
1977.  Appraisal  took  place  in March/Arril  1978,  the Board approved a
Credit of US$40 million in  December  1978 which became effective in July,
1979.
The Credit was closed September  30,  1985, 18 months behind sche-
dule.  Civil works for  a  number  of  project institutions, to be financed
entirely by the Government, were however not yet completed by this time.
Project scope and composition underwent a number of minor modifications
(delayed components from the First Education Project beiag transferred to
tne Second and advanced components from the Second Project being included
in the First). An undisbursed balance of US$3.45 million was cancelled.
Total estimated project cost at the end of March, 1985 was
US$104.1 million vs. an appraisal estimate of US$85.2 million. With the
completion  of  some  unfinished  civil  works  (to  be  financed  by  the
Government) total final cost is expected to be about US$126 million.
Oblectives and Prolect Content
The project focused on the expansion and improvement of techni-
cians' and skilled workers' training.   Additional objectives were develop-
ment of practical training in secondary schools, of primary and secondary
teacher training and intervention in specific areas (eecation/manpower
research and planning,. management training, population education, and
provision of education and training opportunities for the urban poor (pars.
2.06).
This multiplicity of objectives was matched by a wide array of
project  components  and  implementing   agencies:      Almost  100  project



- viii -
institutions under five different ministries and one universityl/ were to
be supported, resulting in a capacity expansion on the order of 24,000
places; another 100 schools were to be the subject of pre-investment
studies) (paras. 2.07-2.15, Tables  2.1  and  2.2).    Items to be financed
under the Credit included furniture and equipment and a substantial
Technical Assistance component (242 months of specialist services and 319
months of fellowships).
Credit 868-EGT was complemented by a parallel credit of about
US$8.9 million from the African Development Fund to finance furniture and
equipment purchases for the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources and
a parallel grant of US$1 million from the Overseas Development Agency (UK)
for technical assistance to the Ministry of Education (para. 4.01).
Implementation Experience
Implementation arrangements provided for direct responsibility of
each beneficiary agency for its own sub-project and liaison with IDA, with-
out the usual intermediary of a coordinating unit. This turned out to be a
satisfactory arrangement as it enhanced the interest of the participating
ministries and shortened lines of communication (para. 3.04).
A major factor contributing to implementation delays was slow
progress in civil works undertaken by the overextended public sector build-
ing contractors (who required construction periods from five to ten years,
compared to two to four years in the case of private contractors). As a
result, the (Government-financed) civil works elements of the project will
not be completed  until  1988.    Slow  progress  with  civil works in turn
delayed the installation of equipment provided under the project. Le'.gthy
procurement procedures for equipment were another source of delays fcr one
sub-project (paras. 3.08-3.17 and 3.18-3.32).
Implementation of the technical assistance component despite its
size and complexity met with few difficulties: at the time of completion
97% of funds had been disbursed, with a final anticipated disbursement rate
of 99%. In general the number of specialists hired was reduced, but their
average service extended whereas for fellowships the change was in the
opposite direction (paras. 3.33-3.35 and Annex 6).
1/ Ministries of Education, of Higher Education, of Industry and Mineral
Resources, of Reconstruction and New Communities, and of Social
Affairs; and Ain Shams University. With the exception of the last two,
these agencies had already participated in the First Education Project.

Results
Because of the delays in physical implementation an assessment of
educWinal outcomes and of the sustainability of the project components is
in most cases not yet possible.    A few tentative conclusions can be made:
in the case of the MORNC construction trade centers, the mission noted the
quality of practical instruction but was disappointed by the low utiliza-
tion rate (47%) which was explained by a shortage of qualified instructors
And by the limited demand for the courses offered (paras. 3.47 and 3.50-
3.51). The MOE schools have exceeded anticipated enrollment levels by 25%
but are severely understaffed (which is partly compensated for by the
hiring of temporary  instructors).    Finally,  the  MOSA handicraft skills
training centers are somewhat underenrolled and their output, because of
the increase in course duration, only two thirds (four skills centers) and
one third (one Instructor Training Center) respectively, of appraisal esti-
mates (paras. 3.61, 3.63).
Conclusions
The project provides an example for a successful application of
the decentralized implementation model. The substantial delays encountered
were outside the influence of the project units and reflect institutional
and physical constraints which futute projects ought to take into account.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 868-EGT)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Introduction
i.       An IDA credit of US$40.0 million was extended to Egypt in January
1979 to; (a) expand, diversify, and upgrade the training of technicians and
skilled and semi-skilled workers; (b) assist in improving the relevance and
quality of lower and upper secondary education through provision of
diversified practical training; (c) to increase and upgrade the training of
primary , secondary and technical teachers and instructors; (d) improve
educational and manpower research and planning; (e) increase and upgrade
management training in the industrial and construction sectors; (f) expaad and
improve population education in the public schools; and (g) expand education
and training opportunities for the urban poor (paras. 2.06 to 2.15). The
project consisted of equipment and/or related technical assistance for some 95
project institutions, construction/renovation of 72 project institutions
(Government financed), and preinvestment studies for an eventual third project.
Project Finances
ii.      Final disbursements are expected to reach about US$36.0 million (90%
of the IDA credit) by September 30, 1985. The balance of US$4.0 million will
be cancelled. These savings are attributable to the (a) strength of the
dollar in the latter phase of the project (about US$2.2 million); and
(b) Government decision to purchase locally manufactured equipment valued at
about USt1.8 million with its own funds.
Project Administration
iii.     The planned implementation period of four years and nine months
proved optimistic in the context of a multifaceted project involving five
ministries and one university and 95 different project institutions. An
extension of one year to five years and nine months was necessary to finalize
IDA disbursements. However, implementation of Government funded civil works
will not be completed until June 1988, giving an overall implementation period
of 9-1/2 years. With the exception of delays in the civil works programme
where public sector contractors were used, performance, in terms of equipment
procurement and an effectively implemented TA program was good. The ADF
parallel credit of US$8.89 million for training equipment for eight MOIMR VTCs
and the ODA-UK parallel grant of US41 million equivalent for TA to the MOE
were both fully disbursed before project completion.



- xi -
iv.     Ech project agency was assigned responsibility for its own project
items without any central coordinating unit, and IDA staff liaised directly
with project staff in each agency. This proved an effective arrangement and a
good working relationship between IDA and Project Unit staff was established
(para. 3.04). Capable and well qualified staff, including engineers,
accountants and administrative personnel were appointed within the project
implementation units (para. 3.03).
Physical Execution
v.       The construction of new buildings and the renovation of existing
facilities were Government financed, and accounted for 31.4S of total project
costs (US$26.76 million) as estimated at appraisal. In the case of two
ministries, Higher Education(MOHE) and Industry and Minerar Resources (MOIMR),
serious delays occurred in civil works (para. 3.08), in particular where
public sector contractors were involved (para. 3.02). This will defer
completion of two project institutions to 1986, three to 1987 and one to
1988. All other works will be completed by late 1985.
Eauioment Procurement
vi.      The preparation of equipment lists and bid documents was carried out
under the First Education Project for all project components with the
exception of new courses for MOE five-year technician schools, science
equipment at Aiu Shams University and equipment for the MOSA handicraft
centers (para. 3.18). The Ain Shams University and the MOSA satisfactorily
prepared their own equipment lists. For the MOE technician schools, however,
additional expatriate assistance, in excess of that foreseen at appraisal, was
required to develop equipment lists and packages and also equipment layouts,
curricula, and teaching materials for the new five-year programs (paras. 3.26
and 3.41). Bidding for equipment under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) was competitive and responsive.
Technical Assistance
vii.     The large technical assistance program provided inputs for:
(i) upgrading of teachers and instructors (MOE); (ii) upgrading technical
teachers (ASU); (iii) improvement of management training programs (MORNC and
MOIMR); (iv) a major industrial training needs study (M.,JR); (v) introduction
of new curricula in the five year schools (MOE); and (vi) the upgrading of
curricula and instructional skills in prevocational training for the urban
poor (MOSA). The program was implemented in a timely and effective manner by
the Borrower's agencies, an important achievement given the size: 59
consultants and 427 fellows (paras. 3.33), with one exception - the quality
of technical assistance was deemed good by the Beneficiary agencies (para.
3.43). The original IDA allocation was US$3.31 million and was increased to
US$4.56 million.



- xii -
Proiect Outcomes
viii.    When project institutions are fully operational additional enrollment
capacity and graduate/trainee outputs are expected to be 16,300 and 4,600 for
technicians and 20,000 and 28,000 for skilled and semi-skilled workers,
respectively, the latter mainly in short intensive courses of less than one
year. The achievement of projected levels of enrollment and graduate outpuLs
has, however, been adversely affected within the MORE, MOIMR and to a limited
extent MORNC by the delays in the civil works program (para. 3.45).
Covenants
ix.      All covenants have been met with two exceptions.  The MOE and the
MONE experienced major problems in implementing the covenants relating to
tracer studies. The Government agreed to explore with the Bank different
approaches to the follow-up of graduates which are presently being tested
(para. 3.64). Feedback from this experience will likely benefit the design of
follow-up studies in future projects. Advisory councils have not been
appointed for some project institutions pending their completion (para 3.65).
The Government has given assurances that it will appoint them in timely
fashion."
Proiect Costs
x.       Total project costs including contingencies were estimated at
appraisal to be US$85.17 million. The actual cost of the project, in terms of
funds committed at project completion, is US$104.13 million which is expected
to rise to an estimated US$126.02 million on completion of all civil works
which are Government financed. TA costs (IDA and ODA financed) and equipment
and furniture costs (IDA, ADF and Government financed) correspond closely to
appraisal estimates. The cost overrun is entirely attributable to delays in
tcivil works financed by the Government and rapid inflation in labor rates and
building materials costs over the protracted construction periods (paras. 4.01
to 4.04).
Borrower Performance
xi.      The performance of implementation staff was good. Many had previous
experience in the First Project and this facilitated administration of the
Project. The preparation of equipment lists and equipment bid packaging, and
the processing of contracts both on equipment and TA were carried out
expeditiously and effectively (para. 3.66). With the notable exception of
TOMOeAR, the maintenance of updated records on project components and the
regular submission of quarterly progress reports was, however, a weakness
(para. 3.05).



xiii-
IDA Performance
xii.     IDA performance was satisfactory and good working relationships were
established with staff in the project agencies (para. 3.68). The staffing,
timing and frequency of supervision missions was adequate throughout the
project, and inputs were at a particularly high level in the major phase of
implementation in 1981 (para. 3.68).
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
xiii.    This was a major project which, despite the extensive changes in
project composition and in funding allocations, was generally well
implemented. Delays in the civil works program for project institutions have
deferred achievement of targetted outputs of skilled personnel in some
institutions, but, with the exception of two of the MOHE TTIs, these will be
realized in the next two years. New technologies and specializations relating
to the country's growing industrial needs have been introduced. Quality
improvements in industrial training will follow from the availability of
improved physical facilities, from the new curricula, teaching methodologies
and equipment, and from the anticipated supply of better qualified teachers
for the technician training institutes. The project has also resulted in an
enhanced capability within the project agencies for project formulation and
management and in equ-ipment procurement and curriculum development.
Lessons Learned
xiv.     The principal lessons learned are;
(i)    the importance of ensuring Government commitment to technical
assistance which led to decisive, early planning and programmiag of
technical assistance (paras. 3.35);
(ii)    similarly, the early identification of physical components (in
parallel with the processing of the first credit) was largely
responsible for expediting contracts for civil works and equipment,
resulting in a shorter than average implementation period for
equipment procurement and TA;
(iii)   it is important to assist the Borrower in the detailed planning of
tracer study mechanisms, possibly financing feasibility and design
studies by the loan (para. 3.64).



- xiv -
(iv) Egyptian public sector contractors take significantly longer to
implement civil works contracts than private contractors. This is
largely because of unfavorable wage differentials with the private
sector and overcommitment of resources. To the extent that public
sector contractors are expected to win such contracts in future Bank
projects, appraisal missions should take into account the longer time
scales involved when preparing project implementation schedules.
(v) Timely provision of training instructor programs upstream, so that
intructors are available when project iastitutions come on line, is
an essential prerequisite for effective project implementation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report has been prepared by Mr. A. H. Power, Project Officer
(Training Specialist) and is based on: (a) preparatory desk work at
headquarters assembling project data; (b) the field visit in February/March
1985 which included discussions with high level officials and project staff
within the project agencies (Annex 1), visits to project institutions (Annex
2), and collection and evaluation of basic data within the project agencies;
and (c) discussions with IDA staff who have been responsible for the project.
The field mission by Mr. Power was coordinated in its early stages by a
technical educator within a separate EMPED mission. Staff within the project
agencies and units cooperated. fully in providing as much data as possible
within the constraints of the time available and the records kept.
1.02     The mission compared the original objectives, content, implementation
schedules and costs of the project as conceived during appraisal and
negotiations with the actual achievements of the project. The Borrower's
objectives and social and economic policies at the time of appraisal and the
contribution of the previous education project (Credit 681-EGT approved FY76)
and subsequent projects (Credit 1069-EGT approved FY80 and Loan 2264-EGT
approved FY82) were taken into account.



II.  PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Background
2.01     Since 1974 Egypt has emphasized economic growth in order to modernize
Egyptian society and raise living standards. Key elements in this policy have
been: (a) decentralization of decision making in state owned enterprises; (b)
allowing more scope for the private sector; (c) incentives to encourage
private and foreign investments; and (d) expanding economic cooperation with
Arab and Western countries. The 1978-82 and 1982-86 development plans
confirmed these objectives and added a further emphasis on the development of
export industries. The current Five Year Development Plan allocates a large
share (25%, LE 8.6 billion) to investment in the industrial sector. This
policy of rapid industrialization required a major expansion in the supply of
suitably qualified industrial technicians, skilled and semi-skilled workers.
Education Development Strategy
2.02     In the o,ontext of r.ational economic and social development policies
the Government sought the reform and expansion of the formal and non-formal
education and training system in order to meet expanding demand for more and
better qualified industrial manpower. The Government aimed at universal
enrollment into the basic education system up to age 15 with improvements in
the quality and quantity of primary teachers through in service and preservice
training programs. Greater emphasis was to be placed on practical subjects in
the preparatory schools. At the same time enrollments in the technical
secondary schools were to be increased at an annual rate of 9% whilst
restricting enrollment growth in the general secondary schools to about 4X.
2.03     Technical and vocational education was to be developed on a broad
front through: (a) re-equipping of three-year (grades 10-12) secondary
technical schools (MOE); (b) the establistzient of new or expansion of existing
technician training institutes (grades 13-14 - MOHE); (c) the conversion of
existing three-year (grade_ 10-12) secondary technical (agricultural and
industrial) schools to five-year technician training institutes (grades 10-14
- MOE); (d) the establishment of new or re-equipment of existing industrial
vocat.onal training centers (MOIMR); (e) the establishment of a network of 60
construction trades training centers and three instructor training centers
under MORNC; and (f) expansion of handicraft training centers under MOSA. The
proposed actions were linked to a program of curriculum development and
improvements in instructor teacher training.
Proiect Formulation
2.04     The project was prepared by the Egyptian Government through a series
of pre-investment studies included in the First Education Project and with the
assistance of a preparation mission in October 1977.



-3-
2.05     The project was appraised in March/April 1978.  The Government's
request was modified during appraisal by mutual agreement as follows: (a) four
MOHE technician training institutes were withdrawn because two had been
selected by the Arab Development Fund for financing, a third was withdrawn
because it was an unnecessary duplication of a similar institute in the same
city, and a fourth was not sufficiently prepared for appraisal; (b) the MOE
agricultural schools and cooperating farmer training centers were reduced from
10 to four due to insufficient preparation; (c) the preparatory and primary
teacher training schools were increased from four to 17 and five to 15,
respectively; (d) four handicrafts skills training centers and one instructor
training center under the Ministry of Social Affairs were added; (e) the MOIMR
vocational training centers were increased from nine to 11; and (f) assistance
to MOE research and planning department was added.
Project Objectives
2.06     The project supported the Government's education and training
priorities by financing programs with the following key objectives: (a) to
expand, diversify and upgrade the training of technicians and skilled and
semi-skilled workers to meet urgent manpower needs; (b) to assist in improving
the relevance and quality of lower and upper secondary education through
provision of diversified practical training to all students; (c) to increase
and upgrade the training of primary, secondary and technical teachers and
instructors; (d) to improve educational and manpower research and planning;
(e) to increase and upgrade management training in the industrial and
construction sectors; (f) to expand and improve population education in the
public schools; and (g) to expand education and training opportunities for the
urban poor.
2.07     Technicians.  At technician level support was provided in two areas.
One MORE technician institute (grades 13-14) was to be established and
equipped at Quesna. This was expected to permit the transfer of students and
staff who were housed in inadequate premises at Shebin El Kom. The
construction of a new technician training institute through Government
funding, and equipment with Credit funding, were expected to lead to
significant quality improvements and permit new specializations to be
introduced. In addition, the project was to finance equipment and techrmical
assistance for the conversion of six existing MOE three-year technical trade
schools into five-year technician training schools (grade 10-14).
15.08    Skilled Workers.  At the skilled/semi-skilled worker level the
project provided support for MOIMR through equipment and TA for five new VTCs
and the re-equipping of six existing centers.  With MORNC, the project
provided: (a) construction, furniture and equipment for 20 new training
centers; and (b) six mobile training centers.
2.09     Secondary Education.  The project also provided support to the MOE
for: (a) minor expansion and/or remodelling, furniture equipment and TA for 17



-4-
preparatory and four secondary schools to enable them to offer instruction in
practical subjects; (b) supplemental equipment and technical assistance to
convert an existing architectural technical school into a five-year (grades
10-14) technical teacher training school; (c) equipment and TA for four
agricultural secondary schools and cooperating farmer training centers; (d)
furniture equipment and TA to upgrade instruction in 15 existing primary
teacher training schools and attached primary schools; and (e) support for the
research, planning and population education departments through equipment and
fellowships.
2.10     Teacher Training.  In addition to the support for secondary technical
education provided to MOE, provision was also made for zhe financing of
equipment and fellowship training to develop the secondary teacher training in
mathematics and science at the Faculty of Education, Ain Shams University.
The goal was to eventually improve the science/mathematics base of secondary
students entering technician training.
2.11     Handicraft Skills Training.  To enhance education and training
opportunities for the urban poor the project provided equipment and TA for the
development of four MOSA handicraft skills training centers and one handicraft
instructor training center.
2.12     Management Training.  The project provided TA for the establishment
of an industrial management training center for the MOIMR in Ismailia (para.
3.39) and for the development and implementation of construction management
courses for the MORNC in financial, project and site management at TOMOHAR's
head office in Cairo (para. 3.37).
2.13     The project also provided for the financing of a limited range of
equipment and a fellowship program for the departments of (a) Population
Education, (b) Research, and (c) Planning of the MOE.
Z.14     All construction and building conversion costs in the above
components were Government financed. Architectural drawings, equipment lists,
and layouts and a major patt of the new curricula had been prepared under the
First Education Project.
2.15     Studies.  Finally the project included: (a) pre-investment studies
comprising architectural designs, curricula development and equipment/
furniture list preparation for the Third Education Project; and (b) two
educational planning studies in key areas of the education and training
sector. The composition of the agreed project is shown in Table 2.1.

Changes in Proiect Composition
2.16     In 1979 it became clear that two of the new MOHE technician training
institutes in the First Education Project would not, because of foundatic'i
problems, be completed by the then extended Closing Date. The Credit
Agreement was therefore amended in September 1979 to transfer the financing of
furniture and equipment of these two institutes to the Second Education
Project. At the same time, to compensate for this, the financing of furniture
and equipment for some of the more advanced components of the Second Project
was transferred to the First Project, viz.:

2.17     In August 1982 the location of one MOIMR VTC was changed from Wasta
to El Saf. In February 1983, as a result of a reduced funding need by the MOE
in regard of equipment, funds were reallocated to perait the financing of
furniture and equipment for two more MOE technician training schools, four
more MOIMR VTCs and three more MORNC mqbile training centers within the
project. TLe net result of these changes is given in Table 2.2 which shows
the final project components after the above amendments had been implemented.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Evolution
3.01     The project was ambitious and complex covering five ministries and
one university and, in its final form after amendments, 95 different project
institutions. Much useful experience had been gained in implementing the
First Project by four participating ministries (MOE, MORNC, MOIMR, and MOHE).
For two of the agencies, the MOSA and Ain Shams University, it was their first
experience of IDA-supported projects. The scheduled implementation period of
4-3/4 years was optimistic and required a one-year extension to give a 5-3/4
year period in which to finalize IDA disbursements. However, implementation
of Government financed civil works will not be completed until June 1988,
giving an overall implementation period of 9-1/2 years. At least one year of
this period is attributable to the MORE Benha TTI which was transferred from
the First to the Second Education project almost a year after the latter got
underway. This institution was plagued early on both by foundation problems
and a shortage of Government counterpart funds and then by delays on the part
of the contracted state construction company. The project's implementation
was also complicated by a series of inter-project transfers, additions and
reallocations. These included the transfer of; (a) nine institutions from the
Second to the First Project ; (b) two from the First to the Second project in
September 1979; (c) the addition of six more institutions and three mobile
training centers at a late stage in the project in February 1983; and
(d) three major reallocations of IDA funds. Nevertheless, at completion
(31 March 1985) equipment procurement and the extensive TA program had been
implemented in a timely and effective manner, and more than 75% of Government
funded civil works had been completed. Overall institutional performance is
considered good. Disbursements at project completion (March 31, 1985)
totalled US$32.21 million (80.5% of the total credit) with further coutracted
orders for an additional US$4.01 million to be disbursed by Credit closing
(September 30, 1985). Total disbursements of about US$36.0 million (90%) at
the end of this period will leave an unallocated balance of about US$4.0
million, or 10% of the total IDA allocation of US$40 million, to be cancelled.
3.02     One major obstacle to effective implementation has, however,
persisted throughout the project. This is the time required to construct
project buildings for project institutions (for which all civil works were
Government-financed) and, having achieved completion on civil works, to
finalize the provision of electrical and water services. The peziods involved
in the project range from two to four years with private contractors and five
to ten years with public sector contractors. Some initial delays were
experienced through inadequate allocation of Government funds for civil
works. Once this was overcome, further delays then occurred through slow
implementation by public sector building contractors. The indifferent
performance of public sector building contractors is due to overcomitment of
resources to a wide range of projects, and a continuing shortage of building
workers caused by wage rates which are inferior to those in the private sector.



- il -
Project Management
3.03     Four of the six project agencies had gained experience of Bank-group
financed projects in implementing the First Education Project. The appointed
staff, including well qualified accountants, engineers and administrative
personnel, many of whom had already been involved in the First Education
Project, appear to have carried out their assigned tasks in a satisfactory
manner.
3.04     Each of the ministries and Ain Shams University was assigned
responsibility for its own project items without any central coordinating unit
and Bank staff liaised directly with project staff in each project agency.
This proved a satisfactory arrangement since good continuity in project
implementation staff teams was maintained and a very active liaison was
achieved on project progress between Bank staff and the ministries at First
Under Secretary level.
3.05     The maintenance of updated records on project components was,
however, less than satisfactory. Useful data on expenditure by project
institution were obtained after extensive analysis by the project completion
mission with project implementing staff in the case of technician and skilled
and semi-skilled worker training institutes. Such data were not, however,
regularly maintained and, because of this, comparison between actual and
estimate costs at appraisal were never possible during supervision of the
project. These data would have led to a useful feedback both for project
monitoring and in formuIating subsequent projects.
3.06     Quarterly progress reports were not submitted regularly by project
agencies with the notable exception of MORNC whose training wing (TOMOHAR) was
meticulous in this respect. This regular maintenance of records and
submission of reports by TOMORAR greatly facilitated evaluation of this
component by the completion mission.
3.07     Printouts from the Controllers Department showing disbursements and
available balances appeared not to be regularly forwarded to project agencies
and there is a need for improved communications between project agencies and
the Controllers Department.
Civil Works
3.08     Construction of new centers and/or conversion or extension of
existing facilities financed by the Government were essential elements in
project implementation for three of the ministries, MORNC, MOIMR and MORE.
Progress on civil works has been unsatisfactory for all three ministries and
in partizular for MOIMR and MORE where some institutions are still several
years away from completion.
3.09     MORNC. A major building program was required for MORNC to provide an
additional 20 new centers to the 20 centers already built under the first
education project.  This was- the second of three phases which will establish a
network of 60 training centers.  Delays in construction occurred through land
acquisition and foundation problems and shortages of cement and reinforcing



- 12 -
bars. The status of civil works on the 20 new centers is given in Annex 3.
Six of the 20 centers have been completed and are operational. Of these two
centers, numbers 2 and 4 in Annex 3, El Darasa and El Wady El Gadid, only
required conversion of old buildings which was completed in one and two years,
respectively. All but one of the remaining 14 centers still under
construction will be completed by the end of 1985. Training in four of the
centers nearing completion (No. 12 Dyarb Negm, No. 13 Roush Eisa, No. 17
Sohag, and No.19 Badary) is expected to start in September 1985. Average
periods for completion of civil works are seven years for public sector
contractors and three years for private contractors. Current and projected
final expenditures on civil works for each center show that for the 18 new
centers the average cost of constructing a construction trades training center
will be LE 1.1 million.
3.10     MOIMR. Five new centers are to be established under the project.  The
status on civil works and equipment is given in Annex 4. Three of the centers
(No. 1 El Hawamdiya, No. 2 Suez, and No. 3 Kafr El Zayat) will be completed in
June 1985, two after a construction period of five years and one after 2-l/2
years. Civil works on the remaining two centers (Nos. 4 and 5 at El Amriyah
and El Saf, respectively) was only started in the end of 1984/early 1985 after
prolonged delays in site acquisition which involved in both cases, two changes
in site location. Completion of civil works on the two centers is scheduled
for February 1987.
3.11     Equipment for the five new centers and also for replacement of
equipment in three existing centers was funded under the African Development
Fund parallel Credit. Although all this equipment has been delivered, the
delays in construction have necessarily imposed delays in installation and
commissioning of the equipment.
3.12     MOHE. Three major Technician Training Institutes (TTIs) are being
constructed under the project at Quesna, Benha, and Alexandria, with a
projected total enrollment capacity of 10,000 students in the two-year courses
(grades 13-14). Of these TTIs, two (Benha and Alexandria) were transferred
from the First Education Project because of delays through extensive
foundation problems. The status on civil works and equipment for the three
institutes is given in Annex 5 and, because of the major delays involved, is
analyzed in some detail below.
3.13     Benha TTI.  Construction using a public sector contractor started in
1978 for the Benha TTI complex covering 5,000 m2 floor area in a site of
22,500 square meters in area. Government funding is fully available to
achieve completion, but construction is in the hands of a public sector
contractor whose labor force is totally overcommitted on a wide range of
Government projects. Although the superstructure of the industrial wing was
completed two years ago, progress since has been slow, and it is anticipated
that civil works will be completed by June 1988. By then civil works costs
will have quadrupled over those which would have been incurred in the
projected three-year construction period from 1978 onwards. All equipment for
Benha is being securely stored in the nearby TTI at Quesna.



- 13 -
3.14     Alexandria TTI.  Construction, using a public sector building
contractor, started in 1978 for the Camp Caesar TTI in Alexandria. The
industrial wing has now been completed and the commercial wing is scheduled to
be finished in 1986 (construction periods of seven and eight years,
respectively). Electrical supplies sufficient for lighting and laboratory
equipment have been connected. Power supply lines for workshop equipment will
not, however, be installed until the end of 1985 when the equipment can be
fully commissioned. Although works and services are not yet complete, 1,884
students were transferred to this institute in October 1984, at the start of
the academic year, from their previous rented premises in Moharrem Bey. Only
300 students remain in the previous premises. All equipment is in place and
additional furniture is to be purchased shortly.
3.15     Quesna TTI.  Constructior, on the Quesna TTI, using a private building
contractor, started in 1982. In contrast to the two other TTIs at Benha and
Alexandria where public contractors were used, progress has been relatively
rapid. The workshop block phase I was completed in 18 months and the phase II
administration block and industrial and commercial laboratories and classrooms
wings were recently completed in a further 18 months. Phase III, covering
stores, further classrooms and administrative offices, is about to start and
will take another two years for completion. If possible, the Ministry intends
to transfer 22 staff and 1,000 students from their temporary accommodation in
the Shebin El Kom Technical Institute, well before completion of Phase III. A
major constraint in making this move is, however, the connection of water
supplies which is expected to be made in mid-1986 and the connection of
electrical supplies, which will not be possible before the end of 1986 when
the adjacent sub-station is scheduled to be completed and commissioned.
3.16     Equipment, although delivered, has not yet been placed in position
according to the final layout and, even when this is done, cannot be
commissioned until power supplies are connected. It is not anticipated
therefore that the institute will be operational, even on a partial basis,
until early 1987.
3.17     Current and projected final civil works costs for the three
institutes are estimated at LE 14.97 million and LE 25.25 million,
respectively.
Equipment Procurement
3.18     The preparation of equipment lists and equipment bid packaging was
carried out under the First Education Project for all project components
except for: (a) a range of new courses in the MOE five-year technician
schools, (b) science and computer equipment at Ain Shams University; and
(c) equipment for the MOSA handicrafts centers. The preparation of bidding
documents, tendering procedures and contract awards were implemented
efficiently and within a reasonable time scale by all project ministries. In
the case of one ministry (MOIMR) the award of some of the later contracts was,
however, considerably delayed through lengthy procurement procedures within
the General Organization for Iadustrialization (GOFI).



- 14 -
3.19     Procurement was on an individual project agency basis which, as in
the first education project, proved a satisfactory arrangement. Bidding under
international competitive bidding proved very responsive and highly
competitive. The projected total commitment situation at project closing and
projected final disbursement levels against the projecttagencies' allocations
at the end of the six-month grace period after closing are shown for each
agency in Annex 11. It is estimated that of the total Credit proceeds the
allocation for furniture and equipment for project agencies will be disbursed
by September 30, 1985 except for some US$3.52 million which will be cancelled.
3.20     MORNC. Equipment required for the 20 MORNC centers, with minor
variations, followed closely that specified for centers within the First
Education Project and was procured swiftly and effectively. A late increase
in the furniture and equipment allocation in February 1983 allowed for the
procurement of additional equipment and audio-visual aids and three additional
mobile training units bringing the total to nine mobile training units.
3.21     Ninety-five percent of the equipment has been received.  Equipment
installation has been completed in the six centers which are operational, and
is progressively being installed in the other 14 centers, all but one of which
will be constructed by the end of 1985. Only eight out of the proposed nine
mobile training centers were required by the MORNC. All have now been
delivered. Three are already in locations in the North Sinai, South Sinai,
and Red Sea and a fourth will become operational in September 1985. The other
four mobile centers are expected to become operational in September 1986, two
as satellites for the Ismailia center and two will operate in conjunction with
the trade training centers at Menouf and Kafr el Sheikh.
3.22     MOIMR - Productivity and Vtocational Training Department (PVTD).
Equipment for five new cente:-s and three existing centers was financed by a
parallel credit from the African Development Fund (ADF). This equipment has
been fully delivered but because of delays on civil works on new MOIMR
centers, as shown in the table in Annex 4 giving status on civil works and
equipment, only partial installation has taken place in three centers due to
be completed in June 1985 - El Hawamdijah, Suez and Kafr El Zayat. Equipment
on the two other new centers at El Saf and El Amriya for which civil work have
only just begun, are being securely stored in the VTCs at Wadi Hof and
Moharrem Bey, respectively. ADF funded replacement equipment for the three
existing centers at Tanta, Shoubrah El Kheima and Wadi iouf are fully
installed in the Shoubra El Kheima and Wadi Houf centers and 502 installed in
Tanta center.
3.23     At the time of the IDA development credit agreement (Credit 868-EGT)
in January 1979, IDA funds of US$1.67 million were allocated for replacement
equipment for three existing VTCs and one industrial management training
center. These four centers were, however, subsequently transferred to the
First Education Project and the relevant IDA allocation of Credit proceeds was
cancelled in September 1979. In February 1983, a reallocation of proceeds of
the Credit took piace and US$2.89 million was provided for four further
existing VTCs at Moharrem Bey, Torra, Ameria and Helwan. Equipment lists and
specifications derived from those prepared during the First Education Project
were immediately prepared and submitted to the General Organization for
Industrialization (GOFI) which is responsible on .MOIMR equipment procurement



- 15 -
for the preparation of bid documentation, bid invitation, receipt of bids, and
joint evaluation of bids with PVTD. These procurement procedures within GOFT
are now, however, taking one year to 18 months to complete. As a result, five
contracts to the value of US$1.87 million were placed over the last nine
months of the project. Deliveries are scheduled to be made before the end of
September 1985, when disbursements cease. This unsatisfactory situation of a
late award of contracts could have been avoided if GOFI had more efficient
procurement procedures. A major institution building project in GOFI,
financed by USAID, is now underway with the objective of streamlining their
organization and management procedures. It is expected that this will result
in a reduction of the present protracted time scales for equipment procurement.
3.24     MOHE. Equipment lists and specifications for the three Technician
Training Institutes (TTIs) at Benha, Alexandria and Quesna had already been
prepared under the First Education Project, and equipment was procured
promptly and efficiently. Lengthy delays on civil works (para. 3.12 to 3.15)
as shown in Annex 5, however, have delayed equipment installation. Equipment
for Alexandria and Quesna was securely stored in the completed workshop areas
of each TTI. Equipment for Benha, where civil works are proceeding very
slowly, was stored in the Quesna TTI. At Quesna, only the language laboratory
equipment in the commercial wing has been installed and commissioned. At
Alexandria laboratory equipment has been installed, whilst commissioning of
workshop equipment awaits the connection of full power supplies at the end of
1985. Equipment installation at Benha is now scheduled for early 1988.
3.25     MOE. Equipment lists and specifications for the primary teacher
Lraining and diversified preparatory and secondary schools components were
fully prepared under the First Education Project.
3.26     Only a very limited amount of equipment specification and listing for
new curricula required for the conversion of the three year technical schools
to five year technician schools modelled on the Moharem Bey programs was,
however, carried out under the First Education Project. As a result, a
considerable amount of additional technical assistance inputs were required
for the specification of additional equipment required for the introduction of
new curricula in petrochemicals, ship building, diesel, radio and TV and air
conditioning and refrigeration. The inclusion of two further five-year
technician schools in February 1983 also required additional work on equipment
specification and listing and equipment layouts. These inputs were possible
through an additional IDA allocation of US$530,000 for TA in February 1983.
3.27     At an early stage in the implementation of the project the MOE
decided to procure all practical training equipment for the 17 diversified
preparatory schools and part of the equipment required for the diversified
secondary schools on the local market using Government funds. Original
equipment funding allocations for these two components anticipated 100%
foreign procurement.



- 16 -
3.28     At appraisal the equipment costs for converting the three year
technical schools to five-year technician schools were overestimated. In
providing for workshop equipment it was understood that all five years of the
program would include the same proportion of workshop training. This is not
the case. Workshop training is concentrated in the final two years, the
earlier years focussing on remedying deficiencies in general subject areas.
The Bank reviewed the arrangements for workshop training and agreed to this
change.
3.29     The above two elements -  (a) decreased reliance on foreign funds for
the procurement of practical training equipment in the proposed diversified
preparatory and secondary schools and (b) an overestimate of workshop
equipment requirements in the five year technician schools - released US$4.54
million of Credit proceeds for MOE furniture and equipment for reallocation on
February 7, 1983 which, combined with US$3.45 million of unallocated funds,
permitted the inclusion of an additional two technician training schools
(MOE), four VTCs (MOIMR) and three mobile training centers (MORNC) in the
project.
3.30     Overall 88% in value of total equipment requirements for MOE had been
delivered in early February 1985 and an estimated 80% installed.  Remaii.ing
equipment, which is entirely for the five-year technician schools, is expected
to be fully delivered by the end of May 1985 and disbursements finalized by
the end of June 1985.
3.31     MOSA. Equipment specifications and lists for the relatively simple
range of equipment required for the handicrafts skills and instructor training
centers were prepared by a team of local experts. The equipment, which was
rapidly procured and installed in the centers, has proved satisfactory.
3.32     Ain Shams University. Comprehensive lists for science and laboratory
equipment, teaching aids and a computer system were drawn up at an early stage
in the project by a purchasing committee within the Faculty of Education. The
computer and auxiliary equipment and chemical laboratory equipment have been
received and installed and were viewed by the completion mission. Deliveries
are still, however, outstanding on a series of contracts, total value US$ 0.52
million, for scientific equipment initiated shortly before Project completion
(March 31, 1985) but this equipment is expected to be received by June 1985
and disbursements finalized in July 1985.
Technical Assistance (TA)
3.33     The TA program within the project was complex and extensive both in
terms of its funding of US$5.56 million and in its scope. Final consultant
inputs are expected to cover a total of 59 consultants for 300.7 ran-months
and 427 fellowships for a total of 1,396 man-months. IDA disbursements at
project completion for TA are US$4.408 million (97% of allocated funds) which
will rise to a final amount of US$4.5L7 million (99% of allocated funds) after
a further three months.



- 17 -
3.34     The TA program, planned and actual, is detailed in Annex 6.  Five of
the six project agencies' components included technical assistance. Funding
for TA was provided by a parallel grant of US$1 million equivalent by ODA-UK
for assistance to the MOE as well as the IDA allocation which was increased
from the originally agreed sum of US$3.31 million at development credit
agreement (January 1979) to a figure of US$4.56 million with the reallocation
of Credit proceeds. Thus, a total of US$5.6 million became available ftom
both sources for TA. An initial allocation of US$60,000 from the Credit for a
study of vocational training needs of school dropouts with the Ministry of
Manpower and Vocational Training (MOMVT) was not utilized since MOMVT obtained
a grant from USAID to carry out this study.
3.35     The TA program, because of its complexity, was managed directly by
the project implementation units, each being responsible for its own TA
component. Each unit drew up terms of reference in the light of its
requirements and selected the consulting agency/educational institution with
whom the program was implemented. As a result an effective and timely program
of TA was delivered. A more centralized system for implementing the TA
program would not have worked as well. The TA Programs for each project
agency are commented below.
3.36     Another reason for the success of this component lay in a much more
thorough program of language training for fellows than that carried out for
the First Education Project. Extensive additional language training programs
were arranged with the British Council, and certification of language
competency was generally a prerequisite for being sent abroad for fellowship
training. In one agency, MORNC, a British Council consultant provided a
series of in-house courses over a six-month period for potential fellowship
trainees.
3.37     MORNC.  Technical assistance to the training organization of the
Ministry (TOMOHAR) provided expert services and fellowships in prefabricated
construction, concrete construction, quality control, literacy training and
construction management. The initial contract was extended by a supplementary
contract in which further services were provided to develop the construction
management component in such areas as project management, financial management
and site management. TOMOHAR appeared satisfied with the quality of the
services provided and in particular with the development of training courses
in construction management which has resulted. In 1984, 17 courses were given
for 4Z2 trainees in the construction management training center in TOMOHAR's
Cairo headquarters.
3.38     M!OIMR. The first stage of TA to MOIMR consisted of consulting and
fellowship training services for: (a) the development of the Ismailia
management center and (b) assistance to the vocational training centers in the
production of visual aids and the use and maintenance of chemical trades
equipment. The second stage, which was made possible by an increase in the TA
allocation from US$0.51 million to US$1.03 million in May 1984, consisted of a
major study of industrial training needs for skilled and semi-skilled workers
and a review of the adequacy of existing training prigrams in meeting these
needs. The industriaL training study covered the textile and garment making,



- 18 -
agricultural equipment, footwear, food processing, chemicals, electrical and
electronics sectors as well as supervisor instructor and in-plant training.
Its review of existing training programs included those with MOIMR, MORNC, MOE
and MOSA. The series of reports produced have provided a valuable basis for
the formulation of future projects and in particular the proposed fourth
vocational training project which includes footwear, garments and textiles
components.
3.39     The TA services provided in Stage I for the Ismailia management
center, and visual aids and the chemical trades in the VTCs, were, in MOIMR's
opinion, satisfactory. Even though construction of the center will not be
finished until the end of 1985, the PVTD personnel trained under this
component are being usefully deployed in providing in-company training courses
to major employers in the Ismailia region and will be assigned to the center
on its completion.
3.40     MOE.  A very broad range of fellowship training and consultancy
services was provided. These included fellowship training only for the
following: (a) primary teacher training schools; (b) preparatory schools; (c)
agricultural secondary schools and (d) the Research and Planning Departments
at the MOE, and consultancy services and fellowship training for: (a)
conversion of three-year technical secondary schools to five-year technician
schools; and (b) the Population Education Department at the MOE. Apart from
an initial IDA allocation of US$1.08, million additional funding was available
through a parallel ODA grant equivalent to US$1 million.
3.41     The Project included consultancy inputs of five man-months for:
(a) the conversion of six existing three-year technical trade schools into
five-year technician training schools (grades 10-14) and (b) the introduction
of new specializations within the MOE technician schools in shipbuilding,
petroleum, petrochemical, and diesel. Although these were in addition to
inputs under the First Education Project, the needs were clearly
underestimated at appraisal. Initial TA inputs to the five-year technician
schools under the first TA contract were ODA financed and only provided 98
fellowships totalling 273 man-months and three months of consultancy
services. Further TA on curriculum and training materials development,
equipment specification and layout were then required. These were provided
from February 1983 onwards through an increase in IDA funding of US$0.53
million for TA to the MOE. Equipment specification bid packaging and ordering
were completed in 1983, and curricula and training materials satisfactorily
developed by the end of 1984. At the time of the visit of the completion
mission the final stages of equipment layout and commissioning were being
carried out.
3.42     Two overseas study programs in population education were provided in
February and March 1981 for 15 MOE staff in Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, India
and the Philippines and some instructional materials and textbooks were
printed. The population education component for the MOE did not, however,
have the expected impact in helping to institutionalize population education
within the formal education system. This may be attributed to wider issues of
a lack of clear Government policy on and commitment to population education.



- 19 -
3.43     MOSA.  Technical assistance was designed Lo: (a) upgrade the
directors and instructors in one instructor and four skills training centers
in the handicraft trades; (b) develop training materials and courses. MOSA
officials were critical of the consultancy services and overseas fellowships
provided, both of which were considered at too theoretical a level for
effective development of prevocational practical skills training. The lessons
learned from this experience have been incorporated into MOSA's component
within the Third Education Project where a more practical and relevant form of
training by specialists and artisans from handicraft, industries and skills
training centers abroad, and from among the better skilled craftsmen in local
industries is being provided.
3.44     Ain Shams University.  Technical assistance to Ain Shams University
consisted entirely of a fellowship Drogram for 49 professors, lecturers and
assistant lecturers within the Faculty of Education. Fellowships, which were
provided in the UK and the USA, were tailor-made for groups and sometimes
individuals within a variety of disciplines, chiefly in mathematics and
science. The specialized programs arranged were found to be of a very high
standard and the experience gained has led to significant improvements in
teaching curricula and practice within the Faculty.
Project Institutions - Enrollments and Outputs
3.45     When project institutions are fully operational the project is
expected to have a major impact through the creation of additional enrollment
capacity and graduate outputs of 16,300 and 4,600 for technicians and 20,000
and 28,000 for skilled and semi-skilled workers, respectively, the latter
mainly in short, intensive courses of less than a year. The achievement of
projected levels of enrollment and graduate outputs has, however, been
adversely affected by delays in the civil works program within three
ministries (MOHE, MOIMR, and MORNC) where only about 30Z of projected
enrollznt levels have been achieved.  In the MOE, which has only a minor
civil works and renovation program, first graduate outputs in 1985 are on
schedule and in MOSA enrollments conform with those estimated at appraisal.
The detailed situation for each of the ministries is examined below.
3.46     MORNC. Data on enrollment, graduate outputs and teachers and
instructors for 1984 are given in Annex 7 for new construction trade centers
supported by the project.
3.47     Six out of a. total of 20 centers are operational (Numbers 1 to 6 in
Annex 7). A further four (Numbers 12, 13, 17 and 19 in Annex 7) are expected
to be operational in September 1985 and the remaining ten centers in 1986.
The new center of Menouf (No. 1) was visited by the completion mission. The
enthusiasm of the trainees and the high level of practical instruction in the
various trades, including the effective application of the modular training
system (MES), were evident.
3.48     The standard enrollment capacity of 18 of the 20 centers with 10
trades and three courses per annum, which start in January, May and September,
is 300 with a potential maximum annual enrollment of 900 per center.  In two
centers, No. 2 (El Darasa) and No. 4 (El Wady El Gadid) only five trades are



- 20 -
covered with a capacity of 150 and potential annual enrollment of 450 per
center. Total projected enrollment capacity for the 20 centers when all are
operational will be 5,700 as compared to an appraised capacity of 6,000 with
an expected annual output of 15,000 graduates from 1986 onwards.
3.49     Actual enrollments and outputs for 1984 as shown in Annex 7 for the
six operational centers are 2,372 and 2,105, respectively.
3.50     Despite a series of vigorous local campaigns to attract trainees, the
utilization of the five operational centers (excluding No. 6 - Ras El Soda -
which became operational only in 1984) in terms of actual enrollments per
annum, divided by total enrollment capacity, at 47.21, is disappointing. All
five centers are physically complete and fully equipped and this
underutilization is attributable to three factors. The first is the
difficulty TOMOHAR has in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of
suitably qualified instructors. In February 1985 the actual number of
instructors for the five centers (66) is only slightly over half the full
establishment tevel (120). Despite apparent capacity in terms of facilities,
instructional capacity is therefore a constraint. The second is the
reluctance by parents in traditional rural areas to allow their children to
enter the building trades. Finally, attendance at the second of the three
annual courses, which starts in May of each year, is always substantially
lower than for those given in January and September because of the harvest
season.
3.51     Only the first factor of instructor supply can be addressed in the
short/medium-term and this is being resolved by TOMOKAR through expansion in
its training programs for: (a) trainees after military service; (b) its Gezr
El Suez instructor training center with assistance from GTZ; and (c) the
opening of new instructor training centers in Port Said and Alexandria. This
will progressively increase the annual supply of instructors from 210 in 1984
to 850 in 1987.
3.52     Eight of the proposed nine mobile training centers were purchased by
TOMOEAM and delivered. The ninth was not required. Three are operational in
locations at El Arish (North Sinai), El Tor (South Sinai), and El Gardana (Red
Sea).  A fourth will start in Abu Zabil in September 1985.  The remaining four
will start in 1986, two as satellites for the Ismailia Center, and two will be
associated with the Menouf and Kafr El Sheikh centers. Instructors and
outputs from the three operational centers, which work on a one shift basis
and provide three four-month courses in five trades each year, are given in
the table below.

Annual output from the eight centers for 1986 is projected at 1,000 trainees,
which will exceed the final anticipated level ot 811 projected in Bank
estimates for nine centers.
3.53     MOIMR. Data on enrollment and numbers of teachers and instructors for
1984/85 and graduate outputs for 1983/84 are given in Annex 8 for the 12 VTCs
supported by the project.
3.54     New centers, with civil works financed by the Government and
equipment financed through the ADF parallel credit, are Numbers 1 (El
Hawamdiyah), 2 (Suez), 3 (Kafr Al Zayat), 4 (El Amriyah), and 5 (El Saf). As
previously noted , and as shown in Annex 4 - Civil Works and Equipment Status,
MOIMR centers - all equipment has been delivered and civil works on Numbers I
to 3 (El Hawamdiyah, Suez and Kafr Al Zayat, respectively) will be completed
in June 1985. As shown in Annex 8, the recruitment of teachers and five
instructors for the three centers has started. One of the centers (Suez),
where equipment has been 70% installed, is already operational with 291
trainees in Year 1. This center was visited by the completion mission which
was favorably impressed both by the quality of the civil works and by the
effective utilization by instructors of the wide range of sophisticated
electrical and electronic training equipment. The other two new centers due
for completion of civil works in June 1985, (El Hawamdiyah and Kafr Al Zayat)
will enroll students for Year 1 in September 1985. Numbers 4 and 5 (El
Amriyah and El Saf, respectively), where civil works will not be completed
until February 1987, will start enrollment for Year I in September 1987.
Appraisal estimates for new workshop places for the five new centers were
1,185, giving a single shift enrollment capacity of 1,775. Actual single
shift enrollment capacity in the five centers will be 1,500.
3.55     The first three of the existing centers shown in Annex 8, Numbers 6
(Tanta), 7 (Shoubra El Kheima) and 8 (Wadi Houf), are also being supplied with
ADF financed replacement equipmen.t for metal trades. This has been fully
delivered for all three centers and fully installed in two of the centers
(Shoubra El Kheima and Wadi Houf). No additional enrollment capacity will be
created by this equipping program.
3.56     The last four existing centers (Numbers 9 to 12 - Moharrem Bey,
Torra, Ameria and Helwan, respectively) and one center (Number 8 - Wadi Houf),
which is already being supplied with ADF funded replacement equipment, will be
supplied with automotive and electrical trades equipment funded from the IDA
allocation in February 1983 of US$2.89 million. This equipment is designed
both to replace existing equipment and, through additional equipment, to
double the capacity of automotive trades training in Number 12 (Helwan) and
Number 8 (Wadi Houf), and electrical trades training in Number 9 (Moharrem
Bey), Number 10 (Torra) and Number 11 (Ameria). This equipment will be
delivered in September 1985 and will provide a total additional enrollment
capacity of 425.



- 22 -
3.57     MOHE. Extensive delays in the construction of the three technician
training institutes at Benha, Alexandria and Quesna (paras. 3.12 to 3.15) have
deferred the achievement of the projected enrollments and graduate out:Iuts.
In the case of the TTI at Camp Caesar in Alexandria, however, 1,884 students
(1,284 Year 1 students and 600 Year 2 students) have been, transferred in
October 1984 from rented premises in Moharrem Bey to the partially completed
facilities, and the TTI will be fully operational by the end of 1986.  At the
Quesna TTI, a limited transfer of students from the Shebin El Kom Institute
may be possible at the start of the 1986/87 academic year, but the TTI will
not be fully operational until the start of the 1987/88 academic year. At the
Benha TTI, civil works will not, at the earliest, be completed until 1988 and
enrollments, even on a partial basis, are not anticipated before then.
3.58     MOE. Data on enrollments and teachers/instructors for 1984/85 and
graduate outputs for 1983/84 are given in Annex 9 for the eight MOE technician
training schools supported by the project.
3.59     All eight schools are now operational on the full five year
technician training program with enrollments in all five years. Three of the
schools (Port Said, Galal Fahmy, and Dar El Salaam) produced graduates in
1983/84, and the other five schools will all produce graduates for the first
time in 1984/85. Total enrollments of 8,768 exceed the 7,000 projected for
the eight schools. Graduate outputs are expected to rise sharply from 539 in
1983/84 to around 1,400 in 1984/85.
3.60     Eull time teachers and instructors for the eight schools at 336 are
severely under strength as compared to the full establishment level of 749.
This shortage of teachers and instructors, which is particularly acute in the
Dar El Salaam school, is being temporarily resolved through heavy part time
inputs from staff in local three-year technical schools and teacher training
schools. This can, however, only be a temporary solution and.the Directorate
for MOE five-year technician schools is awaiting the output from the new
four-year technical teacher programs in five universities in order to
strengthen full time staff levels in the schools.
3.61     MOSA. Data on enrollments and numbers of instructors for 1984/85 and
graduate outputs for 1983/84 for the four handicrafts skills training
centers and one handicraft skills instructor training center supported by the
project are given in Annex 10. This shows an enrollment of 673 for the four
skills centers (73% of capacity) and 137 for the instructor center (66.8%
capacity). Both these utilization figures and the student-teacher ratios of
8:1 in the skills centers and 11:1 in the instructor center are acceptable.
3.62     A comparison of appraisal estimates for capacity and output at
project closing for the centers and actual capacity and output achieved is
given in the table overleaf.

3.63     Even though actual capacity in both the skills centers and instructor
center is higher than appraisal estimates graduate outputs per year are
considerable less because of longer courses than those anticipated at
appraisal.
Covenants
3.64     The Credit Agreement contained two special covenants on technical
assistance, two on the development of tracer studies, and one on the formation
of advisory committees for technician training institutes. The covenants on
technical assistance which required the agreement of TA contractors by the
Borrower by stipulated dates were fully complied with at an early stage in
project implementation. There were, however, major difficulties in
implementing the tracer studies which concerned graduates from the diversified
preparatory and secondary schools and technician institutes within the
project. Despite conscientious efforts by the MOE to follow up graduates from
the five-year technician schools, these efforts failed because of the
intervention of the three-year period of military service and difficulties of
subsequently keeping track of graduates. Even when these graduates were
located, most failed to fill in the questionnaires. The MOE had similar
problems with students from the diversified preparatory and secondary
schools. As a result of discussions with the implementation agencies, it was
agreed by the Association and the Borrower that these two covenants relating
to tracer studies should not be mandatory and that further exploration of
suitable approaches to graduate follow-up was required. The lessons learned
from this experience in covenanted tracer studies have been utilized in the
current Bank and UNDP-financed eight-country study on "Alternative Modes of
Vocational Training." In this study, clear guidelines and procedures for
tracing graduates have been established and the full cooperation of the
Government agencies concerned has been secured. These guidelines and
procedures are not being applied to the three-year industrial secondary
schools and MOIMR VTCs.
3.65     The final covenant concerned the development and use of advisory
committees for technician training institutes within the MOE and the MOHE.
Advisory committees were formed and operated for MOE technician institutes.



- 24 -
Protracted delays in the civil works program for the three MOHE TTIs, however,
made it unlikely that any of these institutes would be fully operational
before 1986. In view of this, the Ministry deferred formation of these
committees for each TTI until nearer their full commissioning.
Borrower Performance
3.66     The overall performance of Government staff appointed to the five
project implementation units was good. Project staff within four of the
Ministries supported by the project had previous experience in implementing
the First Education Project, and this facilitated administration of the Second
Education Project (para. 3.03). Good continuity in project staff within the
implementation units was maintained throughout project implementation and this
enabled an effective cooperation with IDA staff to be established. The
preparation of equipment lists and equipment bid packaging required for the
MOE, MOSA and ASU components was carried out expeditiously and effectively
and, in the case of MOSA and ASU, without TA (para. 3.18). The processing of
contracts both on equipment and TA was satisfactory, and an acceptable level
of commitment on disbursement was achieved at project close despite changes in
the allocation of IDA funds. The covenants on TA were complied with
satisfactorily but, despite conscientious efforts by the MOE and MOHE, major
problems were encountered in implementing the covenants on tracer studies
(para. 3.64). With the notable exception of TOMORAR, the maintenance of
updated records on project components and the regular submission of quarterly
progress reports was, however, a weakness (para. 3.05).
IDA Performance
3.67     Relationships between IDA staff and staff in the implementing
agencies appear to have been good throughout the stages of identification,
appraisal and implementation. The agencies appreciated the IDA's expeditious
evaluation and approval of equipment lists and spec.fications, bidding
documents and contracts and useful advice on the finalization of proposals for
TA. The project, covering five ministries and one university and 95 different
project institutions, experienced two major changes in project composition and
three major reallocations of IDA funds. Given the multifaceted chara-ter of
the project, the changes it underwent and the considerable volume of contracts
to be processed, it reflects favorably on the project agency and IDA staff
concerned that this was accomplished relatively expeditiously.
3.68     The staffing, timing and frequency of supervision missions was
adequate throughout the project (average input 4.7 staff weeks per year), and
inputs were at a particularly high level in the major phase of implementation
in 1981 (nine staff weeks).
3.69     The incompleteness of records giving  updated information on project
components from the start of the project were, however, a handicap to
effective review of the project by supervision missions. This could have been
highlighted more clearly early in the project implementation phase by
supervision missions and resolved by a mid-term review in which reporting
mechanisms could have been developed or improved.

IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Capital Costs
4.01     The project cost was esimated at appraisal to be US$85.17 million.
The actual cost of the project in terms of all funds committed at project
close was US$104.13 million which is expected to rise to an estimated
US$126,02 million on completion of all civil works (Government-financed).
Appraisal, actual and estimated project final costs are given in the table
below.

4.02     On actual costs a full breakdown of funding by category and Ministry
is given for foreign funding (IDA, ADF and ODA) in Annex 11 and for current
and final estimated Government funding in Annex 12.
4.03     In the above table, comparison between actual and appraisal estimate
costs shows a major increase both in civil works costs, which were all
Government funded, and in their share of total project costs. This was caused
by a variety of factors. Principal amongst these was the transfer of two
major MOHE technician training institutes from the First to the Second
Education Project. This brought into the project major additional civil works
costs estimated at US$3.08 million for the First Project. For the Second
Project the current and projected final civil works costs for these two
additional TTIs at Benha and Alexandria and also the TTI included in the
original project at Quesna are shown below.

4.04     The other major factor contributing to this escalation in civil works
costs from the original provision of LE 17.68 million to a final estimated
cost of LE 57.53 million (Annex 12) is the protracted periods required from
the start of civil works to their completion and the connection of services.
The periods actually required range from 2-1/2 years to five years for MODIMR
institutions, two to seven years for MORNC institutions and 5 to 10 years for
MOHE institutions. Over these periods, a very rapid escalation in the costs
of building materials and, through labor shortage, in labor wage rates took
place. Original appraisal estimates anticipated the completion of all civil
works for the three ministries involved in the new building program (MOIMR,
MORNC, and MORE) by mid-1982. Current projections show final completion by
MORNC in mid-1986, by MOIMR in early 1987, and by MOHE in 1988.
Disbursements
4.05     Disbursements were relatively problem free.  After a period of rapid
disbursement in 1980, which was well in excess of estimated disbursements,
disbursements then lagged behind estimates from 1981 onvards. A comparison of
actual withdrawals onwards against project estimates is given in Annex 13. A
detailed statement of the current and projected disbursement situation at
project completion and credit account closing by project and funding agency is
given in Annexes 11 and 12, and is summarized for IDA funding in the table
below.

commitment levels of 80.5: and 90.511i respectively on IDA funds at project
completion is creditable if two main factors are taken into account. The

first is the significant number of changes in project composition and
allocated funds which took place during the project. The second is the
increasing strength of the US dollar against other currencies over the latter
stages of the project. These are commented on below.
4.07     Changes in allocations of Credit proceeds throughout the project are
shown in Annex 14, and took place in three stages.
4.08     The first, in September 1979, was the result of the transfer of two
MORE TTIs, on which civil works were delayed, from Education I to II and in
compensation, the transfer of five MOE and four MOIMR training institutes from
Education tI to I. This, as can be seen from Annex 14, led to: (a) an
increase of US$3 million for furniture and equipment funds for MORE; (b) a
reduction of US$1.33 million in furniture and equipment funds for MOE and the
cancellation of MCIMR funding on furniture and equipment.
4.09     The second stage in February 1983 was the result of "savings" in MOE
equipment funds. This, in conjunction with the allocation of US$2.91 million
from Category G13 (Unallocated) permitted the addition to the project of: (a)
two further MOE five-year technician training schools;. (b) four MOIMR VTCs;
and (c) three NORNC mobile training centers. Changes in funding allocation to
all categories resulted. Major changes were: (a) for MOE a reduction of
US$4.538 million in furniture and equipment funding and an increase of US$0.53
million for technical assistance; (b) an increase of US$1.185 million on
furniture and equipment for MOHE; (c) the restoration of equipment funding for
MOIMR in the sum of US$2.89 million and an increase in its funding for
technical assistance by US$0.52 million; and (d) an increase of US$2.468
million in equipment funds for MORNC.
4.10     The final stage in May 1984 resulted from the decision by MOHE to
purchase some of its machine tools from Egyptian manufacturers without
recourse to Credit proceeds. As a result the two major changes were a
reduction of US$1.3 million in the MORE equipment allocation and the
restoration of a further US$1.45 million to the MOE equipment allocation.
4.11     The si%bstantial strengthening of the US$ dollar against other world
currencies over the last year of the project to March 31, 1985 led to a
reduction in dollar amounts required for payment of contracts quoted in other
currencies. This in turn led to an increase of about US$ 2.2 million in
unallocated balances at the end of project implementation as opposed to those
foreseen when orders were placed.
4.12     One major piece of disbursement to be made at proj-ect completion is
in equipment category C4 for MOIMR where US$1.826 million remains to be
disbursed on five contracts. This was caused by two factors. The first is
that funding for this equipment (para. 4.09) became available only with the
reallocation in February 1983. The second, as commented on in para. 3.23, is
that, although equipment lists and specifications were prepared promptly by
v  the Productivity and Vocational Training Department (PVTD),. delays of over a
year occurred within the General Organization of Industrialization (GOFI) in
the process of tender document preparatio_, and bid. invitation, evaluation and
award. To overcome these delays PVTD took over the processing of all
procurement for the last two orders which were awarded in the last month of
the project.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
5.01     The project has met its main goals of expanding, diversifying and
upgrading technician and skilled worker training programs. Additional
training capacity is 16,000 places for technicians and 20,000 for skilled
workers. While. the project was n4t implemented as swiftly as expected at
appraisal, the expected final implementation period of 9-1/2 years for
completion of all physical components is in line with the performance of other
borrowers in the Region (average of ten years). Credit proceeds would have
been fully utilized had not the dollar strengthened in the latter phase of
implementation. Project management, entrusted to the beneficiary agencies,
was good and experience in the first credit paid off in the effective, early
arrangements for technical assistance. Finally, the project's broad,
multisectoral approach laid the foundation for subsequent longer term training
investment to meet the growing manpower needs of such participating agencies
as the Ministry of Industry.
Lessons Learned
5.02     The principal lessons learned are;
(i)    the importance of ensuring Government commitment to technical
assistance which led to decisive, early planning and programming of
technical assistance (paras. 3.35);
(ii)    similarly, the early identification of physical components (in
parallel with the processing of the first credit) was largely
responsible for expediting contracts for civil works and equipment,
resulting in a shorter than average implementation period for
equipment procurement and TA;
(iii)   it is important to assist the Borrower in the detailed planning of
tracer study mechanisms, possibly financing feasibility and design
studies by the loan (para. 3.64);
(iv) Egyptian public sector contractors take significantly longer to
implement civil works contracts than private contractors. This is
largely because of unfavorable wage differentials with the private
sector and overcommitment of resources. To the axtent that public
sector contractors are expected to win such contracts in future Bank
projects, appraisal missions should take into account the longer time
scales involved when preparing project implementation schedules;
(v) Timely provisioa of training instructor programs upstream; so that
intructors are available when project institutions come on line, is
an essential prerequisite for effective project implementation.
