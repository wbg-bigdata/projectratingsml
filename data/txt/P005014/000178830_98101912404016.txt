I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic Background
1.01      Since 1974 Egypt has been pursuing a policy designed to accelerate
economic growth as a co-requisite to the modernization of Egyptian society.
To realize the country's promising growth potential, the government initiated
a new economic strategy characterized by liberalization of a hitherto rigidly
centralized economy. This policy derives from President Sadat's 1974 October
Paper in which the following basic objectives were elaborated: (a) decentral-
ization of decision-making in state owned enterprises; (b) allowing more scope
for the private sector; (c) provision of incentives to stimulate and encourage
private and foreign investments; and (d) expanding economic cooperation with
Arab and Western countries. The 1978-82 Plan reconfirms these objectives.
To facilitate progress toward attaining these objectives, the government has
placed a high priority on improving the quality and quantity of its efforts
in basic education and in vocational and technical training.
1.02      The Plan envisages a total investment by Government and the private
sector of 11.6 billion Egyptian pounds (US$16.6 billion at market rates).
Almost half of this investment is directed to industry, transport, and commu-
nications. Petroleum and minerals production, electricity, utilities, housing
and services will also command a major share of capital funds. Expansions in
irrigation, land reclamation, crop rotation and land reform are proposed to
enhance the development of agriculture. Investment in the productive sectors
and infrastructure is expected to stimulate related activities such as con-
struction, food processing, mechanical industries, electronics, shipbuilding
and maintenance. The Plan's targets for sectoral growth and investment imply
the need for a major expansion in the supply of suitably-trained commercial
and industrial technicians, skilled and semi-skilled workers (para 1.13).
Development and Reform of the Education and Training System
1.03      National economic and social development policies and programs
are dependent upon the continuing efforts of the formal and non-formal edu-
cation and training system in improving the quality and quantity of appro-
priately trained manpower to meet the rapidly evolving needs of the economy.
Accordingly, the educational development strategy is directed toward meeting
these needs. The major policy objectives upon which the strategy is based
include:
(a) Universal enrollment of the 6-14 age-group by 1985 in the
nine-year compulsory cycle incorporating both the current
primary and preparatory levels, with improvements in quality
and quantity of primary teachers required to attain this
objective being made through in-service and pre-service
training programs (para 2.06 and 2.10).



(b)  Improvements in quality and relevanice of education in
preparatory and general secondary schools through provision
of practical pre-vocational studies for all students to
prepare them to make more informed choices concerning
secondary and post-secondary education/training and future
employment, and develop healthier work attitudes. Teacher
education programs are being re-oriented and reorganized
accordingly.
(c)  Resrructuring and re-orienting education and training to meet
manpower needs better through increasing technical secondary
enrollments at an annual rate of about 9% while restricting
the increases in general secondary to about 4% during the
1978-82 Plan period. Technician enro'Llments would also be
increased at an annual rate of about 7.2%.
(d)  Expanding and improving the skilled and semi-skilled labor
force by increasing the quantity and quality of the annual
outputs of industrial, construction and handicrafts skills
trainirng centers to meet the serious shortage of such workers
(paras 2.22, 2.25 and 2.28).
(e)  Improving adult literacy, mainly through universal primary
enrollments thereby eliminating the source of adult illiteracy.
In justification of this position, the government maintains
it cannot afford the co-ts of both untLversal primary enroll-
ments and extensive adult literacy programs and assigns
priority to the former and is current:ly looking for cost
effective methods of literacy training for adults.
1.04       Progress since 1970 in the overall development of the education
and training system is remarkable in view of the country's scarce resources.
1976-77 enrollment rates of 76%, 56%, 34% and 12% in primary, preparatory,
secondary and higher education respectively are comparatively high and reflect
enrollment increases of 13%, 69%, 48% and 55% respectively since 1970-71.
However, female participation rates are low and make up only 40%, 36%, 36%
and 31% respectively of the above. Secondary education is diversified, with
49% of enrollments being technical, of which one-fourth is in industrial
courses. Moreover, math and science students comprise 80% of general
secondary enrollments.  Enrollments in technicia-n training (grades 10-14 and
13-14) increased by 127% from a base of 16,000 in 1970-71.  Enrollments in
the vocational training programs of the Ministries of Industry, Housing,
and Social Affairs in 1976-77 were 16,330, 11,000 and 3,500 respectively.
Despite these considerable achievements of the education and training system,
maay problems and deficiencies remain.
Educational Issues
1.05       The principal issues, which must be addressed, relate to the areas
of: (a) basic education, (b) manpower training needs, and (c) educational
planning.



-3-
(a) Basic Education
1.06      With only about 76% of the relative age-group (40% female) enrolled
in primary grades in 1976-77 and 56% (36% female) in preparatory grades, the
goal of universal enrollments in grades 1-9 by 1985 will be difficult to
achieve especially as female enrollment, as a percentage of relative age-group,
has increased by only 2% since 1971. The repetition rate of 30% in the final
year of each level and the steady drop-out rate of 3% per year further com-
plicate the problem. While concerned about the low-enrollment and drop-out
rates in the formal system, the government has no significant plans for
alternative methods of basic education and is concentrating on the expansion
of the formal system. However, these efforts are hindered by inadequate and
insufficient facilities and equipment, a shortage of qualified teachers and
insufficient budgets.
1.07      The adult literacy rate in 1976 was only 44% and, despite the enact-
ment of a 1970 law requiring various ministries and agencies to organize adult
literacy programs, little progress has been made. Instead, the government
currently opts to utilize its scarce resources in eliminating the source of
illiteracy by ensuring that all children complete the primary education
cycle.
(b) Relevancy of Education and Training System to Manpower Needs
1.08      One of the most critical issues facing educational planning authori-
ties is that of restructuring and improving the curricula to make the system
more relevant to the country's manpower needs. Both lower and upper secondary
curricula are excessively university entry oriented, and their generally poor
equipment and housing cause an overly theoretical approach. While secondary
technical enrollments make up 49% of the total, its skills oriented industrial
courses account for only about one-fourth of these. It is expected that
government plans, being initiated under the first education project and
included in the proposed project, on the inclusion of practical studies within
the curricula of all preparatory and secondary students will lead to greater
enrollments in secondary technical and post-secondary technician training
courses. The generally poorly equipped and often inadequately staffed
secondary industrial schools have been unable to attract sufficient numbers
of vocationally motivated students. Student interest in these courses should
be significantly increased as a result of plans, included as preinvestment
studies in the proposed project, for upgrading both equipment and instructor
qualifications in these industrial schools.
1.09      Post-secondary technician training, with the exception of the tech-
nician training schools in the MOE, is generally poorly housed and equipped.
Enrollments in 1976-77 were only about 10% that of university enrollments,
with industrial and agricultural technicians together comprising one-third
and commercial technicians comprising two-thirds. Due to the lack of equip-
ment, inadequately prepared instructors and insufficient practical laboratory/
shop experiences, the quality of graduates is low.



-4-
1.10      The current output of skilled and semi-skilled workers, including
the industrial skills graduates of the technical secondary schools, lacks more
in quantity than in quality, with their 1977 output being only about one-third
of the projected average annual demand for the 1977-82 period. While govern-
ment plans for training of construction workers, being implemented under the
first education project and included in the proposed project, are adequate for
the construction sector, plans for increasing the outputs of industrial workers
are severely inadequate (para 1.13). Furthermore, much of the equipment in
existing industrial training centers is unsatisfactory and requires urgent
replaciing.
1.11      Despite government plans to improve the quality and relevance of
the formal education system and to restructure education and training to meet
manpower needs better, it has failed to properly address itself to the issues
in the socially sensitive area of university education. Enrollments, already
at a very high 410,000 in 1976-77, are projected to increase to about 480,000
during the 1978-82 Plan period with an annual output greatly in excess of
real demand. In view of the disproportionate amount of the annual recurrent
and capital budgets required to support its excessive enrollments and the
guaranteed employment of its graduates irrespective of need, university
education is clearly a critical issue to which the government must address
itself. The government is, however, fully aware of the problem and is study-
ing possible changes in its plans for administral:ive reforms. In practice,
the number of graduates relying on the government for employment has already
started to decline, both as a result of the long waiting times involved and
of increased opportunities in the private sector.,
(c) Educational Planning
1.12      Urgent aLttention needs to be given to iLmprovements in educational
research and planning. In recognition of this, the ministry requested assis-
tance for these areas (para 2.13). Improvements in the coordination of edu-
cational programs require prompt and continuing attention, especially in the
more costly technician training programs with limited demand, and in such
university programs as engineering, medicine and others where annual outputs
are greatly in excess of demands. As annual outputs of construction and
industrial skilled worker training programs approach annual demands of the
sectors, close coordination in regard to expansion plans will be required by
the Ministry of Education and the Ministries of Industry and Reconstruction.
In awareness of these needs, the government has created an interministerial
committee to facilitate the coordination of programming and translation of
manpower needs data into appropriate education and training targets, and, in
further recognition of this need, a presidential decree was issued in late
1976 establishing a top policy making Higher Council on Manpower and Vocational
Training.

1.14      While much remains to be done in the expansion, restructuring and
reorganization of basic and general secondary education, teacher training and
the university system, the manpower data clearly show that the training of
technicians, skilled and semi-skilled workers remains a top priority. The
annual supply of industrial technicians will not only fall far short of the
r-inual needs during the 1977-82 Plan period but will still supply only about
3..  of the average annual needs during the 1983-87 Plan period unless immediate
steps are taken. In the interim period, and perhaps even over a much longer
period, the annual output of about 1,000 from the more practically oriented
engineering courses of the Technological University of Helwan will continue
to be utilized in filling the technician needs of industry, as will a signifi-
cant number of the 5,000 annual engineering graduates from other universities.
Even then, the major portion of annual technician needs will continue to be
met through on-the--job training, an undesirable situation for this level of
training and for such large numbers. The indicated shortfall of commercial
technicians is less critical, as much of it can be met through relatively
short on-the-job training of secondary commercial graduates.
1.15      The annual shortfall of skilled and semi-skilled industrial workers
is even more critical than that of technicians. The annual outputs of training
centers during both the 1978-82 and 1983-87 periods, will fill about only
26-30% of the average annual demands. These data do not include replacements
for migrating workers. Clearly much remains to be done in this area of
training, especially in accelerated training of adults who have completed
their military service requirements, and in handicraft skills training
for adult women and for male and female school dropouts.
1.16      The situation is much more encouraging in the construction industry
where the anticipated outputs from all training centers, with the assistance
from the first and proposed IDA education projects will be kept approximately
in balance with the annual needs during the 1978-37 period. There is a degree
of elasticity in the supply, inasmuch as the training period, which was only
three months in 1977 because of the urgent need for numbers with some training,
however limited, can be increased to ten months beginning in about 1981, with
a corresponding increase in the skill level of the output.
1.17      To provide for the continuing availability of reliable data upon
which to base the planning of manpower training, l:he government is strengthen-
ing its data analysis capability with the assistRlice of the Bank's Technical
Assistance and Special Studies Division. Additionally, the ongoing Bank study
of migration in the Middle East is expected to produce by 1980 reliable
estimates of this additional demand on Egypt's trained manpower.
Educational Finance.
1.18      The recurrent costs of education have increased significantly in
recent years, while education's share of central government's recurrent expendi-
ture has varied from 17% in 1973 to 13% in 1975 and appears to have stabilized
since then at about 14%. The decline in the proportion of government expendi-
ture devoted to education may reflect the effect of sharply rising prices on
the Government's overall budget, whereas education expenditures, of which 80-
90% comprise teachers' salaries, are less responsive to inflation. The unit



-7-
costs per student show marked discrepancies between levels and types of
education and reflect poor remuneration of teachers and insufficient expendi-
tures on instructional materials in many schools. However, in view of economic
and social priorities the distribution of expenditures within the non-university
system is reasonably equitable.
1.19      During the 1978-82 and 1983-87 periods, educational enrollments are
projected to increase by 46% in the formal system, by 32% in higher education
and by about 25% in non-formal skills training. The government also plans to
decrease teacher:pupil ratios, increase funding for consummable supplies and
maintenance, and carry out extensive curricular reforms. Consequently, public
recurrent expenditures on education by 1985-86 are estimated at about LE 608
million (constant 1977 prices) compared with LE 318 million in 1977, which is
a 6.75% annual increase; less than the minimum (7%) projected annual growth in
GDP. If capital expenditures for 1985-86 comprise the same percentage of
total expenditures on education as in the projected 1981-82 budget (15%), then
the total educational expenditures would be in the order of LE 715 million or
5.5% of the Plan projected GDP, as compared with the 5.9% of GDP in 1976.
However, if GDP should grow only at 7% instead of the projected 9% annual
rate 1/, then the estimated total education expenditures in 1986 (LE 715
million) would represent 6.6% of GDP. Should the lower GDP growth rate be
realized, total education expenditures are likely to be reduced, especially
the capital component. Under these circumstances the quantitative targets
could be met but such qualitative targets as reduced student:teacher ratios,
more adequate consummable supplies and better maintenance of facilities would
not likely be achieved.
Bank Strategy and Lending for Education
1.20      Attainment of the economic and social development objectives of Egypt
is becoming increasingly dependent upon the formal and non-formal education
and training system to improve the general educational level of the people,
and to provide the numbers of trained personnel required to meet the needs of
medium and long term development. Government education and training policies
have increasingly been directed toward these ends, especially since 1970
(paras 1.03 and 1.04).
1.21      Bank lending in the education sector has been consistent with these
policies, and the first project (Credit 681-EGT of March 1977) was designed to
(a) expand, diversify and upgrade the training of technicians and skilled and
semi-skilled workers; (b) introduce diversified preparatory and secondary
schooling, on a pilot basis, to provide more instruction in practical courses;
(c) increase and upgrade the training of technical teachers; and (d) improve
education and manpower planning. The first project mainly provided equipment
and technical assistance for 47 institutions with combined enrollments of
35,600. Implementation of this project is proceeding very well and all but
2 of the 47 institutions are expected to open on schedule.
1.22      With public and private investments for the modernization and
expansion of the industrial, commercial and social sectors projected to grow
1/   Bank estimate of the probable maximum growth rate.



-8-
at a fairly rapid rate (para 1.02), the increasing demands for greater num-
bers and better qualified skilled workers and technicians will be large
(para 1.13). In view of this and supported by vast:Ly improved manpower
data, the proposed project will continue the first IDA education project's
emphasis upon manpower development. In addition the project will assist in
the development of the formal education system by fiinancing the training of
primary and secondary teachers and population educat:ion in the formal system.
1.23      Future lending is expected to provide support in all of the above
areas selectively, and expansion of handicrafts training and adult literacy
training is anticipated in the future projects, basetd upon the experience
gained in the small programs in these areas included within this project.
II. THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01      The proposed project was prepared by the Egyptian government through
a series of preinvestment studies included in the first education project and
with the assistance of a reconnaissance/preparation mission in October 1977.
The project was appraised by Messrs. W. Hobbs (technical educator, mission
leader), C. Germanacos (educational planner consultant), J. Socknat (manpower
economist), J. St. Gernmain (architect), T. Meta (population education consul-
tant) and Ms. C. Fallert (economist/YP).  During appraisal the government's
request was modified by mutual agreement as follows:  (a) two MOHE technician
training institutes were withdrawn as they had been selected by the Arab Fund
for financing, a third was withdrawn because it was an unnecessary duplication
of a similar institute in the same city, and a fourth was not sufficiently
prepared for appraisal; (b) the MOE agricultural schools and cooperating farmer
training centers were reduced from 10 to 4 due to insufficient preparation
because of the death cf the senior staff member responsible for their planning;
(c) the preparatory schools and primary teacher training schools were increased
from 4 to 17 and 5 to 15, respectively, in response to an urgent need for
teachers trained in the newly-adopted curricula; (d) four handicraft skills
training centers and cne associated instructor training center under the Min-
istry of Social Affairs were added; (e) the MOIMR vocational training centers
were increased from 9 to 11 to include two centers providing much needed
accelerated training for textile plants financed by the Bank Group; and (f)
assistance to improve MOE research and planning departments was also included.
Objectives and Scope
2.02      The project would assist in implementing programs fully consistent
with the government's educational development strategy (para 1.03) through the
following key objectives: (a) expand, diversify and upgrade the training of
technicians and skilled and semi-skilled workers to meet urgent manpower needs;
(b) assist in improving the relevance and quality of Lower and upper secondary
education through provision of diversified practical training to all students;
(c) increase and upgrade the training of primary, secondary and technical



-9-
teachers and instructors; (d) improve educational and manpower research and
planning; (e) increase and upgrade management training in the industrial and
construction sectors; (f) expand and improve population education in the public
schools; and (g) expand education and training opportunities for the urban poor.
The contribution of the project towards the attainment of these objectives,
in quantitative terms, was determined in many instances by the capacities of
the existing institutions that are to be re-equipped and upgraded.
2.03      The construction trades and handicraft skills training components
would cater almost exclusively to the urban poor, would train about 7,200
skilled workers annually, and would jointly comprise about 30% of total
project costs ($25.5 million) and utilize about 20% of the foreign financing
required.

Preparatory and Secondary Diversified Schools (MOE)
2.05      This project item would comprise minor expansion and/or remodelling,
furniture, equipment and technical assistance for 17 preparatory and 4 sec-
ondary schools to enable them to offer instruction in practical subjects and
to re-orient their objectives.
2.06      The preparatory schools would have an enrollment capacity of 20,880
(46% girls) and are dispersed throughout the country; 15 of them are located
in the same cities as the primary teacher training schools (para 2.09) thus
serving as laboratory schools for training experience in practical studies.
The curricula and course syllabi have been revised to include four hours per
week for all students in two of the practical areas of home economics, agri-
culture, industrial crafts, handicrafts and elementary commercial studies.
The objectives of the curricula are to assure that those leaving the formal
system would be readily trainable, with the basic skills helpful in further
vocational or on-the-job training programs; and those continuing on with
secondary education would have the skills and understandings necessary for
a more informed choice in types of secondary education. The additional
teachers for these practical studies are expected to be recruited without
difficulty from among commercial, agricultural and industrial schools' gradu-
ates who are given pre-service and in-service pedagogical training.
2.07      The four secondary diversified schools have a combined enrollment
of 3,120 (58% girls) with about 70% enrolled in the math-science branch.
Along with the two comprehensive secondary schools in the first education
project, which have been changed to the diversified concept, these four
schools are to be equipped with appropriate workshop and laboratory equipment
to pioneer a general secondary school requiring all students to include in
their curriculum, for each of the three years, four hours per week of practical
studies in either commercial, industrial, agricultural or home economics.
The course syllabi in each of these practical studies would be sufficiently
flexible to allow for relating the work to the main economic activities and
needs of the region. As a result of these studies and a more applied approach
for science studies, it is expected that a significantly greater proportion of
graduates would choose to enroll in post-secondary technician training insti-
tutions or accept jobs in commerce or industry. The additional 31 teachers
required for these practical studies are expected to be recruited without
difficulty from among the outputs of the university faculties of education and
the technical teacher training schools.
2.08      In order to evaluate the effect of the diversified curricula upon
the graduates' career paths, the government has provided an assurance that
a study to compare graduates' choice of further studies and job placement with
that of control schools' graduates in the same cities would be developed and
operational by the time the first classes graduate.
Primary Teacher Training Schools (MOE)
2.09      This project item would finance furniture, equipment and technical
assistance to upgrade instruction in 15 existing primary teacher training



- 12 -
schools and attached primary schools. The schools, located in 15 of the
country's 27 educational districts, would have a combined enrollment of
11,400 (40% women) with an annual output of about 2,280, an increase of about
435 in current outputs.
2.10      The curricula and syllabi of the five-year course (Grades 10-14)
have been satisfactorily revised to reflect the proper balance of general
studies and practical activities, basic and applied pedagogics, and demon-
stration and practice teaching in primary and preparatory schools.  Elements
of remedial teaching, counselling and population education have been integrated
into the syllabi and new textbooks have been developed. Students will also be
prepared for teaching in multi-grade rural schoo:Ls and undertaking community
development resporsibilities. Students will specialize during the last two
years and among the specializations will be the preparation of practical sub-
jects teachers for primary schools (Grades 4-6). Additionally, the schools
would accept graduates of commercial, agricultural and industrial secondary
schools into a two-year pedagogical course to prepare them for teaching of
practical subjects in preparatory schools. The schools will also expand
evening class instruction (18-20 hours per week for two years) for upgrading
of currently unqualified primary and preparatory teachers, most of whom are
graduates of technical and agricultural secondary schools.
Technical Teacher Training School (MOE)
2.11      To prepare teachers for architectural sections of the three-year
secondary technical schools and for the practical studies of the preparatory
and general secondary schools, the project would provide financing for sup-
plemental equipment and technical assistance to convert an existing architec-
tural technical school into a five-year (Grades 10-14) technical teacher
training school. The school would have an enrollment of 750 and would
graduate its first annual class of about 120 instructors in 1985.
2.12      The curricula and course syllabi for the technical skills section
need only minor reviisions, while that of the pedagogical section will be the
same as at the Kobba Technical Teacher Training School. The additional 11
teachers required for the pedagogical courses would be prepared by enrolling
selected experienced teachers from the present faculty of the existing archi-
tectural. technical school in pedagogical courses at the Kobba Technical
Teacher Training School and in fellowship training abroad.
Research and Planning (MOE)
2.13      To improve the ministry's research capability, especially in the
area of curriculum development, the project would finance a total of 12 man-
months of internship training for 8 staff members in appropriate curriculum
development centers abroad. The educational planning directorate is seriously
understrength, with the general director as the only planner having adequate
training. Consequently, the project would provide for 87 man-months of
fellowship training abroad for 10 staff members (Annex 1, Schedule 1.1).



- 13 -
Population Education (MOE)
2.14      To help improve living conditions, the government includes in its
national development plans renewed emphasis upon population and family plan-
ning. In recognition of this, the project would finance equipment and tech-
nical assistance to help institutionalize population education within the
curricula of the formal educational system, beginning with primary schooling
and extending through the preparatory, secondary and teacher training levels.
Specifically the project would assist in (a) preparing and printing of instruc-
tional materials; (b) developing necessary methodology of presentation;
(c) conducting training courses for teachers at the pre-service primary
(para 2.09) and secondary teacher training levels, and in-service training
programs at the local governorate level for existing teachers; (d) orientation
for supervisors and administrators; and (e) institutional development at the
central ministerial level.
Agriculture Secondary Schools (MOE)
2.15      The project would finance equipment and technical assistance for
four existing agricultural secondary schools and four cooperating farmer
training centers as paired institutions in a pilot cooperative training
scheme with an annual output of about 830 secondary agricultural graduates
and 200 adult farmers. Each of the four paired institutions would utilize
the secondary school's teachers and facilities for regular students during
the days and the laboratories and workshops, in particular, for farmer training
in the evenings. The secondary teachers, farmer training center personnel and
specialists from the agro-industry would conduct the adult farmer classes.
Appropriate course syllabi will be jointly developed by MOE and MOAG special-
ists. The farmer training center personnel, assisted by agricultural extension
specialists, would arrange special on-the-farm training activities and expe-
riences for the secondary school student program and secondary teacher improve-
ment, as well as for regular adult farmer training. To facilitate this new
cooperative training effort, the project would finance four months of intern-
ship training abroad in similar programs, for the program coordinator in each
of the four schools and for the MOAG training department coordinator (Annex 1,
Schedule 1.1).
Technician Training Schools (MOE)
2.16      To help meet the urgent need for industrial and agricultural tech-
nicians (paras 1.13 and 1.14), and to further expand the technician training
system assisted by the first IDA education project, this project would finance
equipment and technical assistance for the conversion of an additional six
existing three-year technical trade schools into five-year technician training
schools (Grades 10-14). The project schools would produce about 1,100 tech-
nicians annually by 1985 in the specializations of ship building, petroleum,
petro-chemical, electrical, electronics, mechanical, automotive and diesel,
farm power and machinery, land reclamation and agricultural production.
Facilities will also be available for either upgrading training of employed
workers or accelerated training for new workers on an evening shift basis.



- 14 -
2.17       Curricula, course syllabi and equipment needs are complete and suit-
able for all specializations except shipbuilding, petroleum, petrochemical
and diesel which are being completed through specialist assistance provided
under the first education project.  To provide a proper balance of theory and
practice, about one-third of the instructional time is allocated to laboratory!
shopwork practice. To assure the continuing relevance of the instructional
program to the needs of business and industry, the government has provided
an assurance that advisory committees, comprising representatives of business,
industry and government, would be formed and become operational in. each school
by the opening date of classes; and a follow-up system to trace graduate place-
ment and performance would be developed and opera: ional by the time the first
class graduates in 1985.
2.18       The 120 additional technical instructors will be provided from the
280 annual outputs of the Kobba Technical Teacher Training School and from
selected engineers and technicians in industry.
Technician Training Institute (MOHE)
2.19       The project would comprise construction, furniture, equipment and
technical assistance for a new two-year post-secondary (Grades 13-14) insti-
tute. The institute for which curricula, course syllabi and equipment needs
were prepared under the first IDA education projec:t, would have an annual
output by 1984 of about 720 (45% women) from the automotive, electricity,
machinist, civil construction, agricultural power and machinery, and business
technologies. This output, along with an additional 1984 annual output of
about 1,400 from institutes being considered for f inancing under a credit
from the Arab Fund, will supply about 4% and 9% respectively of the 1983-87
average annual requirements of industrial and business technicians (paras
1.13 and 1.14).
2.20       The project institute will be located in the industrially and agri-
culturally oriented Delta Region which would facilitate the maintenance of
close contacts necessary for continuing relevance of instructional programs
and graduate placement. To promote effective communications among these
groups the government has provided an assurance that an advisory committee
comprising representatives of business, industry and government, would be
formed and become operational by the opening date of classes and a follow-up
system to trace graduate placement and performance would be developed and
operational by the time the first class graduates in 1984.
2.21       About 60% of the total enrollment of 1,800 would be in business
and 40% in industrial and agricultural courses. An average of 40% of the
total instructional hours would be allotted to laboratory/workshop practice.
The 135 instructors required will be recruited from the 220 annual outputs
of the Technical Teacher Training School at Mataria, univers'ty faculties
of commerce, and from selected personnel of the lozal university, industry
and commerce on a part-time basis.

Vocational Training Centers -- Industrial Trades (MOIMR)
2.22      To improve the quantity (para 1.13) and quality of training neces-
sary to meet skilled industrial worker needs, the project would provide
financing of additional equipment and replacement of old equipment for six
existing centers, equipment and furniture for five new centers and technical
assistance for all of them. Engineering designs and furniture and equipment
lists are being developed under the first education project. The project
would also provide financing of equipment and technical assistance for an
industrial management training center having a capacity of 20 trainees and
operating within an existing vocational training center.
2.23      The eleven centers would have a full-time equivalent (FTE) enroll-
ment capacity of 6,040 (12% women) and an annual output of about 3,230 skilled
and semi-skilled craftsmen in the textiles, electric, chemical, metal and
printing trades. The curricula for the textiles training program would be of
the accelerated training type, with varying durations, and the required
revisions in the present course syllabi would be made with the assistance of
representatives of textiles plants financed under IDA credits. Enrollments
would be open to any person over 15 years of age and preferance would be given
to referrals from the textile industry. The training program for the other
trades, and for which appropriate curricula either exist or are being devel-
oped under the first education project, would consist of one year of formal
trades training with equal time allotted to theory and practice, followed by
on-the-job training in selected local industries with additional theory
instruction for two days and one day per week in the second and third years
respectively. Trainees in these latter trades must have completed preparatory
school and be over 15 years of age. The additional 355 instructors for the
five new centers would be selected from among the 200 annual graduates of the
instructor training center financed under the first education project.
2.24      The industrial management training center would provide modern
planning and management training for about 200 trainees per year from among
the supervisory and management personnel of industrial companies in the Suez
Canal and Red Sea Governorates. Program length would vary according to the
individual groups' needs, and would be planned and conducted by a core of
trained and experienced local staff assisted by 45 man-months of expatriate
specialists over three years. Prior to the Spring 1981 opening, the center's
ten key staff members would have interned for six months each in similar
management training centers abroad (Annex 1, Schedule 1.1).
Vocational Training Centers - Construction Trades (MORNC)
2.25      The project would comprise construction, furniture and equipment
for 20 new training centers and six mobile training units to provide urgently
needed semi-skilled and skilled construction workers (para 1.13). The govern-
ment would use the engineering designs, equipment lists, curricula and course
syllabi developed for the training centers under the first education project.
The project would also finance equipment for a construction management training
program and technical assistance for all of them.



- 16 -
2.26      The centers would have an annual output of about 6,000 skilled and
semi-skilled workers from ten month courses with 90% of the training time in
practical work. If the construction manpower needs are still critical by the
opening date of the centers in late 1982, the length of the training program
would be reduced to five-six months with a corresponding increase in the annual
outputs. While there are no formal education eiitrance requirements, trainees
normally would be literate and at least 15 years of age and would come mainly
from among the urban poor. However, on a pilot program basis, 25% of the
training places (75) in each of five centers would be allotted to illiterates
of above age 15 who would receive three months of literacy and numeracy
training prior to entry into skills training and an additional one hour per
day concurrently with skills training.  The mobile units training programs
would be more flexible in terms of length to reflect local needs and desires.
The maximum annual output from the mobile training units program would be
about 540 from four-month training courses and double shift utilization. The
612 required instructors for the total program are expected to be supplied
from the 600 annual outputs of the three instructor training centers developed
under the first education project.
2.27      The construction management training center would provide training
in modern construction planning and management for about 200 trainees per
year selecLet' by i.lLiy from among existing constiaction supervisors and
management personnel. Programs would be of varying lengths as determined by
desires and needs of the industry, and would be conducted by a core of local
management specialists and assisted by 36 man-months of short-term specialists
from abroad, especially during the initial three years of operation. Five
of the local staff members would intern in similar management training pro-
grams abroad prior to the Fall 1980 opening dateb of the center (Annex 1,
Schedule 1.1).
Handicraft Skills Training (MOSA)
2.28      To provide for the development of handicraft skills in out-of-school
boys and girls of ages 12-16 who would not otherwise have access to such
training and to prepare them for gainful employment, the project would pro-
vide financing of replacement and additional equipment and technical assis-
tance for four existing skills training centers and one existing instructor
training center. The centers would be operated by the Ministry of Social
Affairs with the cooperation of the local governorates and are located in the
poorer urban areas.
2.29      The four skills centers would have a maximum total enrollment of
770 (50% girls) in 1-3 year training programs according to individual trainee
ability and needs. Skills training specializations would be alabaster art
works, decorative metal art works, decorative iron works, decorative leather
works, weaving, knitting, sewing and ceramics, but could vary slightly as a
result of differing local needs. The instructor training center would have
an enrollment capacity of 192 skills trainees and/or full-time instructor
trainees, and in-service training courses of varying lengths for experienced
instructors in groups of 12.



- 17 -
2.30      The course syllabi and job worksheets will be developed with the
48 man-months of assistance by 16 specialists and artiqans from hhandicreft:
skills training centers and industries abroad (para 2.35).
Ain Shams University - Faculty of Education
2.31      Because of the urgent need for upgrading the training of matfs -Snd
science teachers for secondary schools, the project would finance replacer It
of equipment, fellowship training for maths and science instructors, and
curriculum development. The maths and science programs would have an enroll-
ment capacity of about 4,000 with an estimated annual output of 800 or about
30% of estimated total annual needs in 1985.
2.32      Because of a history of overcrowding of facilities and a very highl
pupil:teacher ratio in many classes, the university has provided an assurance
that the agreed upon student density of 40 in laboratory classes will not be
exceeded and adequate numbers of qualified faculty will be provided.
Manpower Training Study (MOMVT)
2.33      As a corollary to the manpower study being completed by the govern-
ment, the project would provide one man-year of consultant services to study
the vocational training needs of school dropouts and to inventory the training
facilities available.
Pre-Investment Education and Engineering Designs
2.34      The project would include government financed architectural designs
and/or curricula development and preparation of furniture and/or equipment
needs for the following institutions for consideration within a possible
third Bank Group project: (a) 18 existing agricultural secondary schools and
18 cooperating farmer training centers; (b) 41 existing technical secondary
schools - mechanical and electrical sections; (c) five new industrial trades
training centers; (d) ten existing handicraft skills training centers; (e)
five technician training institutes; and (f) a second phase of the population
education program. This is a continuation of the same successful procedure
which greatly facilitated the process of preparing and appraising the present
complex project. As no expatriate services would be necessary for these
activities, no IDA financing is required.
Technical Assistance
2.35      As the project's expected contribution to institution building
would be of equal importance with the qualitative and quantitative outputs of
the institutions, a substantial technical assistance component (Annex 1,
Schedule 1.1) would be required. About 71 consultants, of which perhaps 7 or
8 could be local specialists, would be employed by the six ministries for a
total of ahbout 21 man-years to assist in:



- 18 
-    use and maintenance training of instructional equipment;
-    technical and handicraft skills teacher training methodology;
-    population education curricula;
- - industriail and construction management lraining;
-    curriculum development for the construction trades;
-    artisan skills upgrading; and
-    special studies on training needs of sclhool dropouts.
2.36      Additionally, fellowships for about 147 man-years of teaching,
administrative and artisan internship/formal studies would be provided for
about 319 selected faculty and staff of the project institutions. The
government has provided an assurance that project technician training insti-
tutions directors iand senior instructors would be sent abroad for internship
training sufficienitly early to permit them to complete and return to the
country at least six months prior to opening date of schools to enable them
to participate in a two-month program of training for Jaboratory/i-rkqhop
instructors in the use and maintenance of the new instructional equipment.
2.37      Because of the large number of consultants and fellowships, the
technical assistance program will require considerable skill in its manage-
mnent, time ly recruitment of consultants and placement of fellowship recipients
in appropriate institutions abroad. Consequently, the government and the uni-
versity have provided an assurance that qualified educational/training institu-
tions abroad would be contracted to provide both the required consultants and
fellowship training within the proposed technical assistance program, and have
confirmed their intention that the technical assistance will be carried out
substantially as scheduled (Annex 1, Schedule 1.1).

Total project cost   18.32   40.46   58.78   215.55   58.62   85.17
3.03      Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the pro-
posed project are based on unit prices derived from current contracts and
detailed estimates of other projects of similar character, and were adjusted
for regional cost differences. Furniture and equipment costs are based on
current CIF unit prices and adjusted upward to include local transportation
and installation. Costs of the technical assistance component are based on
prevailing international costs of specialists and of fellowship training
abroad. Baseline cost estimates have been adjusted to reflect the antic-
ipated price at the scheduled date of negotiations.
3.04      Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions equal. to 10% of the estimated cost
of civil works, furniture and equipment and consultant architects' fees and
5% of the estimated cost of technical assistance. It also includes price
escalation contingencies calculated for the period beginning at the scheduled
date of negotiations and in accordance with an agreed schedule of implemen-
tation (Annex 1, Schedules 1.1 and 1.2). For civil works, in view of dif-
ferences in prevailing rates of price escalation for local and international
market prices, escalation contingencies were estimated separately for local
and foreign costs (Annex 1, Table 1.8). Prices are expected to increase
during the project implementation period by a weighted total of about 29.3%



- 21 -
for civil works, 21.3% for furniture, 21.3% for equipment, and 14.7% for tech-
nical assistance. Accordingly, aggregated price increases are estimated at
about 25% of baseline cost. Total contingencies are estimated to be 34.6% of
project cost without contingencies and 25.7% of project cost including
contingencies.
3.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$58.6 million equivalent or about 68.8% of the total project cost. The
calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the assumption
that (a) all civil works and related professional services will be awarded
to local firms, (b) all equipment will be directly imported, and (c) about 50%
of the furniture will be awarded to foreign suppliers. The resulting foreign
exchange content of each category of expenditure is as follows: (i) civil
works, 33.4%; (ii) furniture 50%; (iii) equipment, 90%; (iv) consultant
architects' fees, 0%; and (v) technical assistance, 80%.
Project Financing
3.06      The proposed IDA credit of US$40.0 million would meet all foreign
exchange costs of furniture, equipment and technical assistance except for (i)
furniture and equipment for 5 new vocational training centers and equipment
for 3 existing centers for the industrial trades (MOIMR) and (ii) part of the
technical assistance for MOE and MOHE. The African Development Fund (ADF)
would finance (i) above under a parallel credit of US$8.89 million equivalent
and the United Kingdom (UK) has agreed to provide technical assistance inputs
of about US$1.0 million under (ii) above on a parallel grant basis. The
government would finance the residual costs of furniture and equipment (US$0.1
million) for tCae institutions financed by the ADF, the foreign exchange costs
of all construction (US$8.6 million) including contingencies, and all local
costs. The government would make US$2.58 million of the IDA credit available
to Ain Shams University to carry out its part of the project. Conclusion of
an arrangement to this end between the government and university, satisfactory
to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (para.
5.01).

Recurrent Costs
3.07      When fully operational, in 1982, the project institutions are esti-
mated to require LE 13.0 million annually in recurrent costs, corresponding
to about 2.7% of projected public recurrent expenditure on education in 1983.
However, as most of the institutions in the project are existing ones, the
marginal recurrent costs would be about LE 6.7 million or 1.4% of the pro-
jected 1983 recurrent costs.  In view of the high priority of the proposed
project and the government's very strong commitment, it is expected that these
expenditures will be fully met.
Implementation
3.08      The construction, furnishing and equipping of all schools is scheduled
to be completed by October 1982 while the technical assistance component would
be completed by March 1983 (Annex 1, Schedules 1.1 and 1.2). This schedule is
considered to be reasonable and within the capability of the government, uni-
versity and contractors. To allow sufficient time for submission of the final
withdrawal applications, the Closing Date would be March 31, 1984.
3.09      The existing project implementation units of the four ministries
in the first education project have been very effective and would be respon-
sible for their respective components in the proposed project. The Ministry
of Social Affairs and the Ain Shams University would be responsible for
implementing their respective components and each has appointed a project
director, a procurement officer and such support staff as required for



- 23 -
efficient project implementation. Additionally, the Ministry of Education
has appointed additional education officers to assist in the implementation
of the non-technical institutions and another procurement officer and an
architect.
3.10      All designs for the new construction trades training centers have
been completed and the equipment required will be the same as in the first
project.  Final drawings for the new industrial trades training centers have
also been completed. Equipment lists for technician training schools and the
technician training institute will also be nearly identical with those in the
first project.  The schematic design of the technician training institute was
reviewed and found satisfactory. The designs for the minor additions and
alterations for 26 of the preparatory schools, teacher training schools and
secondary diversified schools are expected to be completed by January 1979 and
seven by January 1980. Special care would be taken to see that procurement of
furniture and equipment would be closely coordinated with the construction of
each institution to ensure that construction would be completed when furniture
and equipment arrive; and that the institutions will be ready for classes on
the scheduled dates.
3.11      Sites for the new training centers of the Ministries of Reconstruc-
tion and Industry and the technical institute of the Ministry of Higher Educa-
tion have been acquired. All other project institutions are in existence with
sufficient space on their present sites to accommodate the planned expansions.
3.12      Procurement.  Detailed lists and specifications of furniture and
equipment to be financed under the credit would be presented to the Associa-
tion for review and approval prior to procurement. Equipment and furniture
items (amounting to US$52.7 million including contingencies) would be grouped,
to the extent possible in large packages to permit bulk procurement. Con-
tracts for equipment and furniture in excess of US$50,000 would be awarded in
accordance with the Association's guidelines for ICB. Small items or groups
of items estimated to cost less than the above figure or items of specialized
nature for which ICB would not be practical, and items which must be compati-
ble with other equipment procured under ICB, would be procured under normal
government procedures satisfactory to the Association and would include to the
extent possible quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers; the
total value of equipment and furniture so procured would not exceed US$3.7
million equivalent which would represent about 10% of estimated equipment and
furniture cost including contingency allowances to be financed under the
credit. For the purpose of comparing foreign and local bids under ICB, local
manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of preference
equal to the existing rate of customs duties applicable to competing imports
or 15% of CIF price, whichever is lower. All civil works will be government
financed and would be awarded under government procedures, which are satis-
factory. The ADF financed equipment and furniture would be procured according
to the procedures of that institution.
3.13      Disbursements.  Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 1.3) would be
on the basis of:



- 24 -
(i) 100% of foreign expenditure for importied furniture and equip-
ment andl of local expenditures ex-factory;
(ii) 75% of local expenditures for off-the-shelf procurement of
furniture and equipment; and
(iii)  100% of foreign expenditures for fellowships and expatriate
consultants; and 80% of local expenditures for local con-
sultants. These percentages would be adjusted as required,
to assure continued financing for each category for the
implementation period.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01      The main expected benefits of the project would be:
(i) an improvement in educational research, planning and
management through the provision of specialist assis-
tance and fellowship training in these key areas;
(ii)  improvements in the quality and relevance of primary,
preparatory and secondary education through project
assistance in teacher training for these levels, and
through the introduction of practical studies for all
students (48% girls) within the curricu.la of the 21
preparatory and secondary schools;
(iii) an additional annual output of about 1,940 technicians
(17% women), 1,900 skilled industrial and 6,500 construc-
tion workers, and an increased level of skills in an
annual output of about 1,300 industrial workers, 400
industrial and construction managers, 830 agricultural
secondary graduates, and 200 adult farmers;
(iv) an increase in the quality and quantity of outputs of
handicraft skills workers and instructors from five
centers, having combined annual outputs of 690 (50%
girls), through improvements in curricula, and the
provision of technical assistance and more appro-
priate instructional equipment;
(v) the introduction of population education at all levels
in the educational system, through the provision of
technical assistance, equipment and instructional
supplies;



- 25 -
(vi)  through the project's pre-investment studies and designs
for (a) 18 agricultural secondary schools and 18 co-
operating farmer training centers, (b) 41 technical
secondary schools (mechanical and electrical sections),
(c) 5 industrial trades training centers, (d) 10 handi-
craft skills training centers, (e) 5 technician training
institutes, and (f) the second phase of population educa-
tion, a basis would be available for early action to
improve further the quality and quantity of the education
and training system; and
(vii)  the construction trades and handicraft skills training
components would cater almost exclusively to the urban
poor and would train about 7,200 workers annually.
Risks
4.02      As. the technical assistance proposed in the project is large
(para 2.35), efficient management will be required to ensure timely recruit-
ment of specialists and placement of fellowship trainees in appropriate
institutions abroad. Consequently, the government will again use the insti-
tutional contract method so successfully used under the first education
project.
4.03      The degree of risk inherent in a project of this size and complexity
is significant and due to the tight time frame for implementation with regard
to the existing institutions within the project, more than an average amount
of supervision by Bank staff will be required during the early stages.
However, the excellent performance of the ministries in implementing the
first education project minimizes this risk considerably.
Key Implementation Dates
4.04      The government confirmed its intention to implement the project in
accordance with Schedules 1.1 and 1.2 of Annex 1 and with the expected comple-
tion dates indicated in the following table for the listed critical activities
in project implementation. Such dates are achievable with the proposed project
management arrangements; and will serve as a basis for project implementation
and monitoring.

V.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECO[MENDATION
5.01      As a condition of effectiveness the Government, under an agree-
ment satisfactory to the Bank, would make US$2.58 million of the proceeds of
the IDA credit available to Ain Shams University to carry out its part of the
project (para 3.06).
5.02      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following prin-
cipal points:
(i) a follow-up study to compare the choice of further studies
and job placement of graduates of the project preparatory
and secondary schools with that of graduates from control
schools in the same cities would be developed and operational
by the time the first classes graduate (para 2.08);



- 27 -
(ii)  to assure the continuing relevance of instructional programs
in the technician training institute and technician training
schools to the needs of business and industry, advisory com-
mitees comprising representatives of industry, commerce and
government would be formed and become operational in each
school by the opening date of classes, and a follow-up
system to trace graduate placement and performance would
be developed and operational by the time the first class
graduate (paras 2.17 and 2.20);
(iii) the agreed-upon student density of 40 in the science labo-
ratory classes of the Ain Shams Faculty of Education would
not be exceeded and that adequate numbers of qualified
faculty would be provided (para 2.32);
(iv)  project technician training institution directors and senior
instructors would be sent abroad for internship training
sufficiently early to permit them to complete and return
to the country at least six months prior to opening date
of schools to enable them to participate in a two-month
program of training for laboratory/workshop instructors in
the use and maintenance of the new instructional equipment
(para 2.36); and
(v)  qualified educational/training institutions abroad would
be contracted to provide both the required consultants and
fellowship training within the proposed technical assis-
tance program and that the technical assistance will be
carried out as scheduled in Annex 1, Schedule 1.1 (para
2.37).
5.03      As described above, the project constitutes a suitable basis for an
IDA credit of US$40.0 million.
