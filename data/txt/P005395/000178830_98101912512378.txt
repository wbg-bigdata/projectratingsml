I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
Urbanization Trends
1.01      Morocco's population at the beginning of 1980 numbered some 19.5
million people of whom about 41% or 8 million lived in urban areas. Largely
as a result of rural immigration, the urban population is estimated to have
grown at an average rate of some 5% per annum during the last decade, almost
double that of the overall population (3%). Despite Government efforts to
improve living conditions in the countryside, it is expected that the above
pattern will continue over the next 10 years and that the urban population
will reach 15 million or 50% of total population by the end of the 80s. Like
most countries in Africa, Morocco is encountering great difficulties in pro-
viding job opportunities, shelter and basic services to an increasing number
of young urban dwellers and unskilled rural migrants. The magnitude of this
problem is illustrated by the fact that over 2 million people, or about 28%
of the urban population, have incomes below the 1979 Bank-defined absolute
urban poverty threshold of US$400 (DH 1,516).
1.02      Two-thirds of Morocco's urban population live in the central and
northwestern part of the country (the Casablanca/Rabat/Fez area), where most
of the industry and modern agriculture is also located. Historically, the
concentration of urban population has been in large centers, mainly along the
Northwestern Atlantic coast. More recently, many mid-sized cities have also
experienced fast increases under the pressure of rural immigration and natural
population growth. The inability of local governments to manage the rapid
pace of growth has resulted in a proliferation of haphazard shanty towns,
which are now a common feature of most Moroccan cities, and which call for a
comprehensive nationwide urban upgrading policy.
Urban Administration
1.03      Morocco is divided into 36 provinces or prefectures.  These in turn
are divided into rural and urban communes. The province is under the Ministry
of Interior and is headed by a Governor who represents the King. The Governor
is responsible not only for maintaining law and order but also for supervising
and coordinating the activities of all central government agencies operating
within his jurisdiction as well as local governments. The provincial assembly
contains representatives of professional organizations and members elected by
the communes; it is responsible for approving budgetary expenditures.
.
1.04      Communes are the basic local government units.  They are governed
by an elected council chaired by a President who is responsible for executing
Council decisions as well as representing the Local Collectivity in all
civil and administrative functions. Central control of the Communes by the
Ministry of Interior is carried out through a local executive official
("Pasha" or "Khalifa"), who represents the Governor and is specifically
charged with ensuring proper application of regulations. The 1976 Communal
Charter ("Loi Organique des Collectivites Locales et des Finances Locales")
gives the communes very broad powers in formulating the economic and social



- 2-
development plan and the level and organization of public services. However,
in practice, these poujers are severely limited by the lack of qualified staff
to implement development programs and by dependence on Government for budget
funding.  The direct linancial resources of the Local Collectivities amount
to about 50% and cons:ist mainly of local property taxes ("taxe urbaine" and
"taxe d'edilite"). The remaining resources come from Government subsidies.
In order to finance capital expenditures the Communes may borrow from local
financial institutions and in particular from the Communal Infrastructure
Fund ("Fonds d'Equipernent Communal" - FEC), managed by the "Caisse de Depots
et Gestion" (CDG). So far borrowing has been very limited. All borrowing
must be reviewed and authorized by the Ministry of Interior.
Urban Conditions and Policies
1.05      Responsibil:Lty for meeting the needs of the growing urban population
is shared by central and local government institutions. The central admin-
istration finances the delivery of most social services such as education and
health, including soc-ial housing. Local provincial Delegations of the various
Ministries ensure the implementation and administration of government action
at local level. Loca:L Government is generally responsible for providing
adequate environmenta:L services such as sewerage, garbage collection and solid
waste disposal. Water and power supply are either provided by the National
Utility Agencies (ONEP' and ONE), or in major cities, by local autonomous
utility agencies ("Regies").
1.06      Housing.  Over the last decade, Morocco's private and public housing
production lagged behi.nd the increase in urban population. As a consequence,
it is estimated that some 25% of the urban population lives in squatter
settlements and another 10% in aged structures deteriorated beyond repair.
The new cheapest housing units cost about DH 40,000 or US$10,800 and
are beyond the reach of 50% of urban households.
1.07      Overall housing production over the last decade has been limited
by the inability of the Moroccan cities to provide serviced land for housing
development, as well as by inadequate Government policies in housing construc-
tion and finance. Despite considerable Government efforts, during the 60s and
the 70s, public housing construction failed to achieve any significant social
and economic impact. This was mainly due to costly design and construction
standards resulting in much lower levels of production than could have
been achieved with thE same total investment. Moreover, because of these
standards, the social housing program benefitted mainly middle-income house-
holds which could have afforded private sector housing. The private sector
in turn has operated n3ainly in the more profitable market of high and medium-
high income housing where returns are commensurate with those of other invest-
ment sectors. In the absence of any significant amount of housing being
produced for low-income groups, a substantial housing stock has developed in
the form of squatter s.ettlements. However, the illegal nature of this process



- 3 -
as well as financial constraints have prevented municipalities from upgrading
infrastructure and the lack of secure tenure has discouraged residents from
improving their dweilings.
1.08      The Government-owned "Credit Immobilier et Hotelier" (CIH) is the
only financial institution responsible for conventional housing finance in
Morocco. Its interest rates range from 8% to 13% according to the type and
size of the house. The loan repayment period is 10 years. A special housing
finance program ("Habitation a Bon Marche" - HBM) aimed at lower income groups
is administered by the "Banque Centrale Populaire" (BCP) - also Government-
owned - on behalf of CIH. HBM's interest rates are 6 and 7%, according to
the type of housing, and the repayment period is 20 years. Moreover, in the
early 70s, GOM promoted a housing savings and loan program to be implemented
by several commercial banks. Only BCP has been active in this program, but
its efforts have been largely ineffective because of unfavorable terms (2.75%
to 5% interest on deposit, 10.5% interest on borrowings). Despite the exist-
ing credit facilities, only 10% of private sector dwelling units constructed
during the 1973-77 five-year economic plan period benefitted from bank finan-
cing; the remainder having been entirely financed by the households themselves
through accumulated savings or non-banking borrowings. This is primarily
because, as a result of current banking practices in Morocco, most urban
households either do not qualify for conventional housing loans or find the
restrictive lending conditions of the HBM program unsuitable. Several
studies are now being prepared by GOM and the above financial institutions
to address the problem of setting up a more attractive system of housing
savings and loans within the framework of a national plan for the mobiliza-
tion of national savings.
1.09      Infrastructure Services.  Access to basic utilities by the low-
income urban population constitutes an acute problem in most Moroccan cities.
In 1971, the time of the latest survey, 48% of urban households were without
water connections, 32% without electricity and 45% without sanitary installa-
tions. This situation has probably worsened in recent years because of the
rapid increase of the low-income urban population and the spread of squatter
settlements.
1.10      Because of their limited financial resources and cost recovery poli-
cies, municipalities and utility agencies have in the past primarily extended
their services to central and higher income peripheral areas. However, local
administrations are increasingly sensitive to the need for extending municipal
services and infrastructure, particularly to squatter settlements in order to
achieve a better integration of these areas into the city and to prevent major
health hazards. The improvement of municipal services such as road maintenance,
garbage collection and solid waste disposal would depend on the development of
adequate municipal financial resources as well as on the strengthening of
municipal organization and management. A technical assistance program to
strengthen local governments is being implemented by the Ministry of Interior
with the assistance of the French Government. A more extensive provision of
utilities would require increased coordination between the municipal authori-
ties and the utility agencies, revised municipal regulations and appropriate



- 4 -
credit to households. Even though many households could afford to pay for
the use of water and sewerage facilities, they lack the initial capital (e.g.,
DH 2,000 or US$526 per connection for water) required to make the necessary
connections and install sanitary fittings.
1.11      Social Services. Provision of social services such as education
and health in urban areas is on the average adequate. The distribution of
these services remains, however, uneven and is partîcularly poor in many low-
income urban sections. Schools in these sections are generally overcrowded
and sited in unsuitable conditions. Similarly, health facilities cannot cope
with the health needs of the low-income urban areas where lack of safe water
and proper solid waste disposal generate diffuse gastro-intestinal diseases.
1.12      Employment.  Urban areas in Morocco hold most of the country-s
industrial, commercial and administrative jobs, and have a per capita income
three times that of rural areas. However, the unemployment rate in the cities
(13% in 1977) is estimated to be two times higher than in rural areas. Unem-
ployment affects particularly the active population in the age group of 15 to
24 years. The private sector provides jobs to some 75% of the urban labor
force of which about 40% is employed in small artisanal and commercial units.
Limited market outlets and lack of adequate loan capital often prevent small
units from growing into more prosperous economic activities. Lack of mana-
gerial skills, trained personnel and suitable urban services often constrain
productivity of established firms and jeopardize their financial stability.
In addition, the limited supply of low-cost serviced land restricts the expan-
sion of existing activities as well as the development of new ones. Future
development of small-scale economic activities is critical to relieve urban
unemployment and in particular urban poverty.
New Responses to Urban Needs and Bank Strategy
1.13      During the last decade, Government policy towards urban needs has
been to emphasize investments in rural areas to reduce rural-urban migrations
by improving the conditions in rural areas. At the same time Government has
continued investments needed to accommodate the needs of the urban population,
particularly in disadvantaged regions and secondary urban centers. An indus-
trial zones program tD redirect industrial investments away from Casablanca
and Rabat to small and medium-sized cities is in preparation and should help
to deflect migration, largely motivated by a search for job opportunities.
1.14      The Bank has assisted the Government in carrying out these priori-
ties; about 40% of Bank loans have been made for agriculture and integrated
rural development projects.  Other pronipets provide for education, sanitary
facilities and development of productive activities in semi-rural areas and
secondary urban centers. A significant Bank-supported initiative in this
regard is the propose,l program to expand the role of the FEC so that it
can serve as a develo?ment bank for local governments in order to increase
productive infrastructure in hitherto disadvantaged areas. Through the
1724-MOR loan--Second Water Supply Project--the Bank has assisted GOM in
providing credit facilities to low income households to connect to the water
supply in the cities of Casablanca, Kenitra and Rabat-Sale. It is planned
that this program be extended to the entire country.

1.15      In the early 1970s Government policies with respect to decaying
urban areas and squatter settlements basically consisted of their progressive
replacement through urban redevelopment and social housing programs. However,
between 1973-77, only one-quarter (98,500 units) of the low-cost housing
program envisaged under the Five-Year Plan was completed, leaving a substantial
unsatisfied demand for low-cost housing. Two new public agencies were created
during that plan period which were to improve performance during the 1978-80
Plan: the National Fund for Land Purchase and Infrastructure ("Fonds National
d'Achat et d'Equipement des Terrains" - FNAET) and the Regional Planning
and Construction Agencies (Etablissements Regionaux d'Amenagement et
Construction' - ERAC), both under the tutelage of the Ministry of Housing and
Regional Development ("Ministere de l'Habitat et de l'Amenagement du
Territoire" - MHAT).
1.16      The FNAET was established to purchase and develop serviced land for
low-cost housing construction. The plot beneficiaries are required to con-
tribute, in advance, part of the funds necessary for commencing land develop-
ment. However, managerial constraints have partly hampered FNAET's effective-
ness, so that only about 53,000 plots, or 65% of those originally envisaged,
would be completed by the end of the 1978-80 Plan. Moreover, low densities
and costly infrastructure standards make these plots unaffordable to low-income
urban households. The ERACs, which were to construct middle-income housing
(costs between DH 60,000 and DH 150,000), also encountered major operational
problems because of lack of adequate financing and management. At the end of
1979, only 5,000 residential units or 30% of those envisaged for the Plan
period, were completed. However, in 1980, construction of the entire program
has resumed, following intensive efforts by MHAT.
1.17      Conscious of the shortcomings of its social housing programs, the
Government has introduced new urban policies designed to capitalize on exist-
ing resources by upgrading slum areas and by providing low-income households
with low-cost serviced sites for self-help housing construction. The Rabat
Urban Development Project - Loan 1528-MOR, approved in February 1978 - was
instrumental in setting up the GOM policy of slum upgrading versus demolition.
The Ministry of Housing played a major role in implementing the above policy
by sponsoring and coordinating the implementation of the Rabat project, as
well as by preparing other similar projects. These include a loan guarantee
program in Casablanca recently approved by the US Agency for International
Development, and the upgrading of sewer networks in small squatter settlements
throughout the country. Development of new projects would largely depend on
increased participation of local governments in the process of project prep-
aration, implementation and financing.  MHAT will maintain its role of setting
policy, promoting projects and assisting local governments with implementation.
In the longer term, the proposed expansion of the role of FEC in providing
loan funds to municipalities could further support the ability of local
governments to implement projects.
Bank Involvement in Urban Projects
1.18      The Rabat Urban Development Project provides financial assistance
to the Moroccan Government for implementing an urban upgrading program aimed
at addressing the problem of urban poverty in three major squatter areas of



the capital city, comtprising some 45% of its total slum population. The
project includes the upgrading of infrastructure and social services, the
development o.f serviced sites to accommodate households displaced because
of project construction works, and the implementation of a program to create
additional job opportunities.
1.19      After initial delays, implementation of the project's physical compo-
nernts is now proceeding expeditiously. Construction works for new serviced
residential, business and industrial sites are almost completed; those for
slum upgrading are under way and are expected to be completed in two years.
Some difficulties remain in finalizing the registration of slum area
residents and providing them with credit facilities for housing improvement
and development of small-scale economic activities. These difficulties
mostly stem from problems of coordination among the project implementing
agencies, M4HAT's inability to adequately staff the Project Unit, as well as
limited participation of local government in project implementation.  Measures
are being taken to offset the above difficulties by increasing the role of
the Rabat Governorate in supervising project execution, including secondment
of staff to the Project Unit.
1.20      Although the first urban project is not yet completed and conse-
quently it is premature to fully assess its impact, GOM attaches great impor-
tance to an immediate extension of similar projects throughout the country
to co-e Tith-tng    problem of housirig for 1ow-nc-oe groups.  In order
to maintain both the momentum and the direction of GOM policy, a second urban
project is proposed for implementation in the two secondary cities of Meknes
and Kenitra.  These cities have been selected by government for immediate
intervention because they contain the largest squatter settlements outside of
Casablanca. Meknes and Kenitra are also characterized by high immigration
rates and a shortage of housing.
1.21      Meknes.  The fifth largest city in Morocco, Meknes has a population
presently estimated ai: 360,000 which is projected to grow at 4.1% during the
next five years. This implies an annual increase of about 15,000 people (2,700
households), of whom nearly 30% will be below the urban poverty threshold.
About 30% of the popuLation in the city do not have access to municipal ser-
vices and infrastructure facilities. Total housing output by the formal
sector (public and private) has been equivalent to roughly half the growth
in new household formLtion over the last decade. The deteriorating housing
supply situation has led to the rapid growth of squatter settlements. It is
estimated that 70,000 people (20% of the population of the city) now live in
these unauthorized developments.
1.22      KeDnitra.  Lccated 3u km north of Rabat, Kenitra is the seventh
largest city in Morocco, with a population of about 216,000, which is
projected to grow at 4.6% per annum over the next 5 years.  This implies an
increase in population. of 10,000 people (1,850 families) each year. Of these
people over 20% are expected to be below the urban poverty threshold. It is
estimated that 40% of the population do not have access to municipal services
and infrastrucnture faci7lities.  Kenitra is included in the second World
Bank-assisted water supply project, which provides credit facilities for 7,000



- 7 -
individual water connections to low-income households. The Second Urban
Project would be implemented in other areas; it deals with land tenure and
complementary urban and sanitation facilities in addition to water supply.
MHAT, in cooperation with the municipality, would ensure effective coordina-
tion between the two projects.  The inability of the formal housing sector
(public or private) to provide shelter opportunities affordable to lower
income families is reflected in the growth of unauthorized settlements.
It is estimated that 65,000 people (30% of the city's population) live in
squatter areas.
Il. THE PROJECT
A. Summary Features
2.01      The project would continue the policies of the first urban project
in Rabat by introducing low-cost proposals for addressing problems resulting
from urban poverty, primarily in the shelter sector. The project is also
designed to serve as a further step toward strengthening the institutional
framework in the urban sector and developing a policy framework for urbaniza-
tion in Morocco.  As a result of the experience presently being gained on the
first project in Rabat, the second project initiates the following changes:
(a) improving affordability, by reducing land-use and infra-
structure standards, and therefore enhancing full cost
recovery from the beneficiaries;
(b) shifting the emphasis towards dealing with the shelter
problems of future urban growth, in addition to upgrading
major portions of the cities existing slum areas;
(c) intervening at a scale designed to have maximum impact on
the shelter sector of both cities;
(d) improving the delivery of municipal services by strengthening
urban management in the project cities; and
(e)  respecting the architectural and urban design traditions of
the project cities.
2.02      The project would include four components:
(a) Slum Upgrading Program. This component would provide secure
land tenure, and basic off-site and on-site infrastructure to
the existing residents in three squatter areas--Bordj Moulay
Omar and Sidi Baba in Meknes, Saknia in Kenitra. The three
settlements comprise approximately 81,500 people and cover
an area of about 130 ha. Total base cost investment for this



- 8 -
component would amount to about DH 105 million (US$27.6 mil-
lion), 44% of total project base cost. Also to be provided are
1,512 infill plots, as well as some 7,000 construction mate-
rials loans for home improvement.
(b) Sites and Services Program. This will include provision of
about 3,760 and 2,640 serviced plots in Meknes (Sidi Baba and
Ain Chebik) and Kenitra (Saknia) respectively, comprising an
area of 72 hla, with individual sewer and water connections up2
to each plolt boundary. Plot sizes range between 60 and 110 m
and several plot options, with different levels of on-plot
development,, are to be available. Approximately 60% of the
plots will be in the form of core units. Building materials
loans for home construction and additions are also provided.
Total base cost investment would amount to about DH 112
million (USé29.2 million), representing some 47% of total
project base cost.
(c) Employment Generation Program. Each project city would
be provided with serviced land for business activities.
About 770 and 1,500 jobs would be supported in Meknes and
Kenitra, respectively, at an average cost of DH 13,600
(US$3,600) per job. The total base cost for this component
is approximately DH 4 million (US$1.05 million), about 1.5%
of total project base cost.
(d) Improvement in Municipal Services. This component provides,
in each city, a central municipal depot, as well as vehicles
and equipment for garbage collection, and the maintenance of
roads and sewerage networks. Also included is technical
assistance to prepare a sewerage master plan for Kenitra,
and to improve accounting procedures and the municipal tax
collection svstem in Meknes. The total base cost is about
DH 11.7 mill:lon (US$3.08 million), about 5% of total project
base cost.
(e)  Studies for the Preparatoin of New Urban Development Projects.
These studies would range from feasibility to final engineering.
Their total cost is estimated at DH 6.5 million (US$1.7 million)
or about 2.5% of the total project base cost.
2.03      The project would require a total investment of DH 308 million
(US$81.0 million). Prcject costs are given in Table II-1, and discussed
in Chapter III.
B. Detailed Description
Slum Upgrading Program
2.04      The project would have a substantial impact on the squatter popula-
tion of the project cities. In Meknes, 43,000 people, representing 60% of
the squatter population of the city (12% of the total city population), are
included. In Kenitra the upgrading component comprises 38,500 people--60%
of the population living in squatter areas (18% of the total city population).

2.05      Two sites--Bordj Moulay Omar (BMO), which includes the adjacent
settlement of Ain Chetik and Sidi Baba--have been selected in Meknes. In
Kenitra, three sites--Saknia, Bouchtyne and Fath--are included, and because
of theîr proximity to one another are collectively referred to as Saknia.
These sites are the largest slum areas in the two cities and exhibit the
characteristics of the worst urban housing conditions found in iaorocco. About
48 and 44% of the inhabitants have incomes below the absolute urban poverty
threshold and the median household income is about DH 725 (US$191) and DH
775 (US$204) per month in BMO/Sidi Baba and Saknia, respectively. As the
population has grown, and the provision of shelter failed to reach this
sector, these areas, which were established in the 1930s, have expanded.  Land
is generally publicly owned, though there are pockets in private ownership.
About 27 ha will have to be acquired from the private sector (13.5 ha in
each city). With respect to this land Government has already started the
relevant expropriation procedures by issuing a "declaration d'utilite publique"
as the first step of expropriation.
2.06      Location and topography.  The project upgrading sites have several
locational benefits: they are well served by public transportation and major
access roads; they are adjacent to middle- and upper-middle income neighbor-
hoods and to the major sources of employment opportunities--the modern city
center, the Medina and industrial areas; and are near major trunk infrastruc-
ture (see Maps IBRD Nos. 15133 and 15136). A major constraint on the BMO
site in Meknes is the presence of subsurface rocks and several rocky outcrops
within the development. In Kenitra, the Saknia site is flat and low lying
with a high water table. Particular consideration has been given to ensuring
that the selected project sites are not subject to flooding, and that the
sewerage and drainage facilities for the project are appropriately designed.
In the Bouchtyne section of the site, about two-thirds of the area is
frequently flooded during the rainy season. Relocation of households living
in this area will be effected under the project.
2.07      The size of the project areas and the number of people directly
involved are as follows:
(i)  BMO comprises 46.18 ha with a present population of 31,800
living on 4,520 plots, an additional 725 infill plots would
be provided;
(ii)  Sidi Baba has 12.11 ha and 11,200 people accommodated on
1,592 plots, a further 37 infill plots would be developed;
and
(iii)  Saknia compri-ses 73.11 ha, housing 38,500 people on about
7,100 plots, including 750 infill plots.
2.08      Existing conditions.  While all sites have relatively good, surfaced
access roads, the limited number of internal vehicular streets need consider-
able repair and resurfacing. The pedestrian paths, the major circulation



- il -
element in all sites, are either completely unimproved (Saknia) or in bad
condition (BMO and Sidi Baba). However, in the latter case, some pedestrian
paths were built by the residents themselves and a few are in good repair
and well mnintained. A water supply network serves all the areas through
standpipes (40 and 13 in BMO and Sidi Baba, respectively, and 40 in Saknia).
Several standpipes need major repairs or replacement.  The networks are
presently operating almost at capacity and improvements in distribution would
necessitate replacement of the existing pipes to meet the increased supply
requirements. Waste and storm water in BMO is disposed of through open
channels built by the residents and connected to a small sewer network which
is in poor condition. There are no individual sewer connections. In Sidi
Baba an underground sewer network serves about 50% of the households. In
the remaining areas of Sidi Baba, surface waste water either runs in the
pathways or is collected in open ditches built by the residents. In Saknia,
there are no on-site facilities for dealing with storm water drainage or
sewerage collection. None of the sites in either city has electricity
networks and few streets have street lighting.
2.09      Plots in the two cities yary in size, ranging from 30 m  to 100 m
with most typical sizes being 60 m . The plots, generally of irregular pro-
portions, are organized into more or less rectilinear blocks, separated by
circulation routes allowing relatively easy movement and facilitating the
introduction of infrastructure into most areas, with minimum impact on existing
structures. There are, however, several locations in the Bouchtyne section of
Saknia and in BMO, where blocks are irregular and paths too constricting to
permit the construction of insfrastructure without affecting existing dwellings.
This would require relocating to infill plots within the project areas about
200 households in BMO and 750 in Saknia/Bouchtyne where flooding is also a
major problem.
2.10      The dwelling units in BMO are constructed out of mud and woodframe
walls with a plaster and lime finish. Walls exposed to prevailing rain
bearing winds are often covered with an additional skin of used corrugated
iron sheets. Roofs are usually corrugated iron. In Sidi Baba, the walls
are generally of masonry construction. The roofs and walls of the shelter
structures in Saknia are built out of recycled corrugated iron, supported
by flimsy woodframes.
2.11      Proposed Improvements.  The following improvements would be imple-
mented under the project (see Maps IBRD Nos. 15134, 15135 and 15137):
(a)  Demarcating of plot boundaries.  Plot boundaries would be
established according to the present settlement pattern,
with minimum disruption of existing structures.
(b)  Granting security of tenure.  Ownership of individual plots
would be established and secure land tenure provided. Charges
to beneficiaries are to be based on the size of the plot.
Owners unable to afford the payments required for their



- 12 -
present plots w2uld be permitted to subdivide, the minimum
size2being 40 m . Households occupying plots smaller than
40 m would not be moved if an acceptable affordable alter-
native caniot be found.
(c) Impoving t:he efficiency of the layout. Land use distribution
is summarized in Table II-2. The provision of infill plots
would ensure the most efficient use of the infrastructure
improvement:s. There would be 725 infill plots in BM0O 37 in
Sidi Baba and 750 in Saknia.
(d)  Improving the level of infrastructure provision.  The road
system would include off-site streets designed to carry buses
and heavy vehicles.  All vehicular streets would be surfaced
with double layers of asphalt, and would have curbs and sealed
sidewalks. Pedestrian paths would be improved by the residents.
Off-site sewer requirements include extending the mains in BMO
(+ 200 meters) and a more complex range of improvements in
Saknia, including about 2,450 meters of mains, improvemenits
to existing pumping facilities, construction of a new pumping
station and 450 meters of force main. A sewer network would
be constructed on site to allow 100% individual optionlal plot
connections. The secondary network would collect sewerage and
surface water from internal patios, exclusively. In Kenitra,
due to sandy soil conditions, special manhoies have been
designed to trap sand buildup and facilitate its easy removal.
The water network would be designed to provide for public
standpipes (1/100 households) and, at the same time, allow for
100% individual optional connections with an estimated water
consumption of 80 lpcd. An overhead electricity network would
be built to allow optional individual connections for all
households.  All circulation routes would have street lighting
(250 watt lamps for off-site streets, 125 for vehicular streets,
and 50 for pedestrian paths) supported by the poles carrying
the electri,ity network. Levels of service to the infill plots
would be the same as for the rest of the upgrading components,
except for the 200 plots in Meknes which Tould be provided with
core units 4comprising a toilet and a 12 m room,
(e)  Providing building materials loans for home improvement and/or
extension as well as for improving pedestrian pathways. An
average loan of DH 3,465 (US$912) has been established. The
loan amount is based on the îosts (materials and labor) of
building a ioilet and a 12 m room. It is anticipated that
2,525 households in BMO, 815 households in Sidi Baba and 3,550
households i n Saknia would take up loans.  Construction materials
loans would also cover the upgrading of residential/commercial
buildings.
(f) Providing community facilities. Community facilities would be
improved to the average level of services currently prevalling
in Meknes and Kenitra. No additional facilities are necesary
in Meknes, except for the expansion of an existing primary
school in th.e Ain Chebik section of BMO, by the addition of
10 classroonms. In Kenitra two new primary schools of 20 class-
rooms each and a dispensary would be built in Saknia.

(g)  Providing on-site administrative facilities.  A field admin-
istration building would be provided in each upgrading site
and would be shared by the adjacent sites and services areas.
Sites and Services Program
2.12      Sites and services schemes would be developed at Sidi Baba and Ain
Chebik in Meknes.  Approximately 46 hectares are included and the project is
designed for a population of about 3,760 low-income families. In Kenitra a
26 hectare site would be developed to accommodate about 2,640 families.
While being adjacent to the squatter settlements to be upgraded under the
project, all the sites and services areas have been located on the basis of
proximity to suitable employnent, availability and efficent use of existing
off-site infrastructure, accessibility to existing asphalted roads and public
transportation, and availability of land at affordable prices.  The Meknes
sites are in private cwnership; Saknia is owned by "collectivites".
Land acquisition is proceeding as outlined in paragraph 2.05.
2.13      Site layout and land use.  Layouts for sites and services schemes
in Meknes and Kenitra have been designed to ensure the most cost effective
use of land and infrastructure (see Map No. 15138).  Most residential plots
would be provided witL pedestrian access only.  Vehicular access would be
limited to primary and secondary roads, providing service to within 50 meters
of every plot.  Residential areas would be distributed in such a way as to
provide vehicular access to the larger plots which would bear a greater part
of the total infrastructure cost and would eventually develop commercial
frontages. Developed land would be differentially priced according to
location and accessibility. Land use distribution for all sites and services
is summarized in Table II-3.
2.14      Plot optionE. and levels of infrastructure provision.  Some 3,360    2
plotf would be d veloped in Meknes, and four plot sizes provided:  60 m , 70 m
80 m , and 100 m . Of these plots, 3,260 would be at the Sidi Baba site, and
500 in Ain Chebik. Ir Kenitra, approximatgly 2,640 plots a5e to be developed,
and there would be three plot siz`es:  60 m , 72 m  and 90 m
2.15      Off-site streets would be designed to carry buses and heavy vehicles.
All vehicular streets would be surfaced with twin-coats of asphalt, provided
with curbs and sealed sidewalks. Pedestrian paths would be built by the plot
owners. All plots would have individual water and sewer connections provided
up to the plot boundary.  One connecting manhole would serve two plots.  The
design of the secondary sewer network is similar to that of the slum upgrading
component (para. 2.11(d)). Off-site sewer requirements are described in the
upgrading component (para. 2.11).  The water network would be designed to
supply an average of 80 lpcds and would be built up to the meter box of each
plot.  An overhead electricity network would be built to allow optional
individual connections for 100% of the households. New 400 kva transformer
stations would be built as needed (8 in Meknes, 4 in Kenitra). All streets
and pedestrian paths would have street lighting supported on the same poles
carrying the electricity network. Solid waste would be collected from refuse
bins located on vehicular streets, with no plot further than 100 meters from
a bin.

2.16      In addition to the above infrastructure, four levels of on-plot
development would be provided: serviced plot only, a serviced plot with
perimetral walls, a serviced plot with perimetral walls and a sanitary
core and a serviced plot 2with a saîitary core plus a room (the size of
which ranges between 12 m  and 16 m ).  In Kenitra some of the plots
with the best location for commercial potential would have arcades.
2.17      Building materials loans would also be provided.  These loanis are
optional and it is ex3ected that about 85% of the households would take them
up.  The average loan size varies for each plot option and is based on the
ability of the beneficiaries to pay, and the type of on-plot development
proposed. The various plot options together with the materials loans are
described in more detail in Table II-4, and allocable costs, prices
and affordability ind:icated in Table V-2. Building materials loans would
also cover the improvement of pedestrian pathways as well as the construc-
tion of residential/commercial buildings.
2.18      On entering into the contract to purchase the plot, the allottee
would be provided with a choice of standard plans which already have the
requisite building permit approvals from the Municipalities.  Modifications
to these standard plans by the beneficiary are permitted but would require
approval.  The establishment of temporary structures would be allowed for a
period of 18 months before construction of the final dwelling is commenced.
2.19      Two primary schools of 20 classrooms each, one dispensary and
one youth center would be provided at Sidi Baba and Saknia, respectively,
and one dispensary at Ain Chebik. On-site administration facilities
would also be provided as described in paragraph 2.11.
Employment Generation Program
2.20      In order to enhance job opportunities for the low-income population
in the project, the de.velopment of business activities would be promoted
through the provision of serviced land in each city. Identification
of demand and justific.ation of space requirements were carried out by
MHAT and ODI in late 1979, on the basis of surveys which were reviewed by
the Bank during the appraisal mission. The proposed serviced areas have
been designed in accordance with the general development strategy of the
project cities as defined by the existing master plans and land use
plans.
2.21      In Meknes, the master plan provides for the development of about
40 hectares of industrial land, of which the areas already serviced are
sufficient for the projected requirements of the city.  Consequently, the
project is limited to the provision of serviced plots to small-scale economic
activities which are compatible with, and integrated into, the residential
areas of the project sites. One area of 1 hectare in Bordj Moulay Omar and
three areas of 5,000 m in the Sidi Baba sites and services would be developed.
The provision of infrastructure would be similar to that of the upgrading
and sites and s rvices areas (para. 2.11). Plot sizes wguld range from
150 m to 750 m with the majority being less than 250 m . It is estimated
that the enterprises to be established in the project area would amount

to about 80 units mainIly belonging to the electromechanical, textile and
construction materials sectors. These enterprises are expected to
come on stream between mid-1983 and 1985, and to employ some 770 persons.
2.22      In Kenitra, the master plan under preparation proposzs land for
heavy industry to be :Located in the northwestern part of the city. There is
presently limited availability of serviced land for small-scale industrial
development.  The pro ject site, adjacent to the proposed sites and services
and slum upgrading area, is particularly suited to the establishment of
small-scale enterprises, and an area of 10 hectares of municipal land is
expected to be included in the master plan. About 6 hectares of this site
would be serviced withl basic infrastructure under the project. This would
include the surfacing of the main access road, the provision of (i) water
and sewerage networks allowing individual connections, (ii) drainage through
open-lined channels, and (iii) a double electricity network (medium and low
voltage).  Street lighting would not be provided.  It is estimated that
about 45 enterprises creating some 1,500 jobs would be established. As in
Meknes, most enterprir,es would belong to the electromechanical, textile and
construction materials sectors, but they would be of a larger size because of
the location of the iadustrial plots which would attract more structured
activities. It is expected that superstructure development would take place
between the end of 1982 and 1985.
2.23      The project industrial land would be either sold to investors
against cash payment Dr leased to them according to the modalities described
in paragraph 5.05. T'he project would also provide technical assistance funds
to market the industrial land in the project areas as well as to help in-
vestors in preparing loan applications for construction works, procurement of
equipment and land purchase. Funds for technical assistance would also be
included in order to promote industrial development in the project areas.
MHAT would sign a contract with ODI for the provision of some 18 man-months
of technical assistance in each project city. ODI has a special unit
dealing with the development of industrial zones. Arrangements for the
provision of the above technical assistance were reviewed during negotiations.
2.24      Development of industrial activities would be carried out by
private investors who would use the existing channels of industrial and
commercial credit in Morocco. In this respect, it is expected that most
investors would qualify for and make use of the credit facilities provided
under the SSI program--credit to small-scale industries. GOM established the
SSI program with the financial assistance of the Bank (Loan 1687-MOR) in 1979.
The purpose of the program is to promote development of small-scale, labor-
intensive, industrial activities. This is achieved by providing financ-
ing for on-lending to the commercial banking system as well as strengthening
its operational capability in the sector. Only one year after approval of
the above loan, practically all the SSI funds have been committed. Commercial
banks responsible for implementing the project, in particular BCP, have
acquired considerable experience in managing such loans. The Bank (EMP/IDF)
is proposing to replenish the SSI line of credit in FY1981. The FY81 SSI



- 19 -
loan would be ready for disbursement by September 1981. Particular attention
would be given to ensuring that the SSI funds would be available to the
small-scale industries to be developed in the project areas. Depending on the
time the industrial areas become available, financing could be provided under
the FY81 SSI loan, or any subsequent SSI financing provided either by the Bank
or from other sources. The SSI funds would be made available through a
combined promotional action by ODI and BCP which are responsible for assisting
MHAT in promoting industrial development (para. 2.23) and administering cost
recovery (para. 4.25 and 4.28) in the project areas, respectively.
2.25      The estimated average total investment per job, excluding land,
would amount to DH 13,560 (US$3,570) in both project cities.  This entails a
total investment of DH 10.4 million (US$2.7 million) and DH 20.3 million
(US$5.3 million) in Meknes and Kenitra, respectively.
Improvement in Municipal Services Program
2.26      The following improvements in each city would be introduced under
the proposed project:
(a) The construction and equipping of a Central Municipal Depot
on municipal land. All the activities of the Public Works
Department would be located in the Depot. At present the
various units and sections of the Public Works Department
are scattered throughout each city. Building facilities
are often in need of repair and space availability is
inadequate. The Municipal Councils of Meknes and Kenitra
have already reserved municipal land for the construction
of the Central Municipal Depots. Preliminary engineering
studies, including bills of quantities are being completed.
Construction of the Depots would be combined with the
reorganization of the Public Works Departments of each
municipality into five functional units: Administration,
Studies, Civil Works, Workshops and Maintenance.
(b) The procurement of equipment and vehicles necessary for
improving garbage collection, street cleaning, and roads
and sewerage maintenance. It is planned that the project
municipalities would establish special agreements with the
suppliers of equipment and vehicles for which the suppliers
would provide training to the municipal technical staff in
maintenance and operation.
(c) The provision of qualified professional staff to each
Department of Public Works. One experienced engineer would
be attached to the study section of the Department of
Public Works in each municipality. These engineers are to
be provided by the Ministry of Interior.  In Kenitra, a
qualified technician would also be attached to the mainten-
ance section. Job descriptions have already been prepared.
Assistances that this staff will be promptly provided by
the Ministry of Interior were obtained during negotiations
(para. 7.01 (iii)).



- 20 -
(d)  The financirng of organization and management studies (8 man-
months of foreign experts) for reorganizing the accounting
and tax departments of the Municipality of Meknes. This
would includle the provision of a minicomputer.
(e)  The financing of some 60 man-months of foreign expertise for
preparing a sewerage master plan in Kenitra leading to a
first phase rehabilitation program. This study is prompted
by the crit.cal situation of Kenitra's sewerage system which
is partially silted, does not have treatment facilities and
needs urgent improvements to avoid health hazards. Draft
Terms of Re:erence have already been prepared; they would be
submitted to the Ministry of Interior for review and would
be discussed and agreed upon with the Bank. The investment
package described above was defined on the basis of a study
prepared by each project Municipality. These studies were
reviewed during appraisal in order to size the investment
program according to the technical and financial capability
of the project Municipalities to implement it (para. 4.23).
Studies for the Preparation of New Urban Development Projects
2.27      The five-year economic plan 1981-85 provides for the extension of
slum upgrading and sites and services programs to a number of Moroccan cities.
Government has requested that the Bank participate in the financing of the
studies needed for preparing projects in four mid-sized cities. These studies
would range from feasibility analysis to final engineering and would include
cartographic surveys, topographical works and soil tests as well.
2.28      The final work program for the studies, including selection of the
cities and the areas to be upgraded or developed, would be discussed between
the Moroccan Government and the Bank at completion of a sector review mission
which would be carried out by the Urban Projects Department in the second part
of 1981. This mission would assess the results of present Bank urban lending
and would explore the possibility of developing improved organizational and
financial arrangements for implementing future urban development projects.
III.  PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Cost Estimates
3.01      The total cost of the project including taxes and contingencies
is estimated at DH 308 million (US$81 million), of which US$20.6 million,
or approximately 25% represents the foreign exchange component. Summary
cost estimates by project component are given in Table II-1 and detailed
cost estimates in Annex 1.
3.02      The base cost estimates are in July 1980 prices.  Estimated costs
for civil works are based on preliminary engineering studies and are derived
from prices for similar construction works in the project cities. The cost
of communally and publicly owned land are based on prices nrgotiated between
MHAT and the relevan- owners (Collectivites, Municipalities, and Services



- 21 -
des Domaines). The cost of privately owned land is based on estimates made
by "Commissions d'Evaluation" established by the "Service des Domaines" for
this purpose in each city. Estimated costs for vehicles, equipment and
construction materials are based on the latest quotations from suppliers and,
where necessary, have been adjusted upward to include transportation and
installation costs. The cost of professional services for final design and
supervision is estimated as a percentage of the total construction cost
according to prevailing rates in Morocco. The cost of professional services
for preparing new urban development projects is estimated on a lump sum basis
according to the average cost incurred by MHAT for preparing previous similar
projects. In addition, professional services include about 36 and 38 man-months
of local and foreign consultants, respectively, for implementing other project
components. The cost of these consultants is estimated at $4,000 and $8,000
per month. Total project costs include all taxes, which would be approximately
DH 30.2 million (US$8 million) or 12% of the total project cost (excluding
land).
3.03      Physical contingencies of 10% have been allowed for infrastructure
works, building facilities, vehicles, equipment, consultant and advisory
services. No physical contingencies have been included for the construction
materials loans. Since it is estimated as a lump sum, the cost of studies for
preparing new urban projects does not include physical and price contingencies.
Rates applied for price contingencies are 10% in 1980, 9% in 1981, and 8%
thereafter. These rates reflect projected average price increases in Morocco
and in the industrialized countries for the project construction works and
equipment to be procured. Total contingencies amount to 29% of the estimated
base cost, with about 6% representing physical increases and 23% price increases.
B. Financing
3.04      The project would be financed from the national budget and by the
Bank loan. The Bank loan would amount to US$36 million, approximately 50%
of the total project cost net of taxes. This would cover 100% of the direct and
indirect foreign exchange cost (US$20.6 million) and about 30% (US$15.4 million)
of the project's local cost. Local cost financing by the Bank is recommended
because of the social character of the project combined with the low foreign
exchange component and the limited financial resources available in the
country to address the problem of urban poverty. The Bank loan would be made
to the Government of Morocco at an interest rate of 9.25% and would be amortized
over a period of 17 years, including a grace period of 4 years.
3.05      The Bank loan proceeds supplemented by GOM counterpart funds would
be allocated by GOM to the project implementing agencies according to the
flow of funds shown on Chart III-1, and would be passed on:
(a) in the form of budgetary allocations, to:
(i)  MHAT for financing land acquisition, on-site infra-
structure of the squatter upgrading, sites and
services and small-scale enterprise programs,
housing core units, project administration
buildings, and the relevant expenditure for
consultant and advisory services, and project
management;

(ii)  MEN for financing the construction and equipping

of dispensaries; and
(iv)  MJS for financing the construction and equipping
of youth centers.
(b)  in the form of transfer of funds to BCP for providing
construction materials loans to project beneficiaries; and
(c) in the form of a loan to the Municipalities of Meknes and
Kenitra for financing the construction of off-site infra-
structure and the Central Municipal Depots, the procurement
of vehicles and equipment, and consultant and advisory
services.
3.06      GOM would establish special agreements with:
(a) BCP to define the modalities under which BCP would administer
(i) cost recovery for the slum upgrading, sites and services,
and industrial sites programs, and (ii) the provision of
credit for construction materials; and
(b) the project Municipalities to define terms and conditions for
(i) prefinancing, through budgetary allocations to MHAT, the
construction of off-site infrastructure; and (ii) financing
the municipal services components; the GOM loan to the
Municipalities would be made at the same conditions of the
Bank loan to GOM (interest rate of 9.25%, with a maturity
period of 17 years and 4 years grace).
3.07      The draft agreements would be reviewed during negotiations.
Entering into an agreement between GOM and BCP on the procedures and
administrative arrangements for cost recovery and for BCP on-lending for
building materials would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 7.02).
Entering into agreement between GOM and the Municipalities of Meknes and
Kenitra on the terms and conditions for financing the municipal components,
would be conditions of disbursement of the relevant loan proceeds (para.
7.03 (i)).
C. Implementation Schedule
3.08      Project construction is planned over a four and a half year period,
with an additional year for completing disbursement of the materials loans to
project beneficiaries. The expected completion and loan closing dates are
January 1986 and July 1986, respectively. Annex 3 shows a summary project
implementation schedule by project component. Preparation of final design is
under way. For those infrastructure works to be started during the first year
of project implementation, construction drawings and tender documents would be
completed by the time of Board presentation.

D. Design and Construction Control
3.09      The MHAT Delegations as well as the Municipalities of Meknes and
Kenitra would rely substantially on consultants for both the preparation
of final desig&i and tender documents, and the supervision of the project
construction works. Morocco has a number of consulting firms qualified to
carry out the proposed consulting services. Their employment in connection
with the proposed project would also establish local expertise in the field
of poverty-oriented urban projects, which could be advantageously used in
future projects.
E. Procurement
3.10      Civil Works.  Contracts for civil works, excluding price contingen-
cies, would amount to some DH 154 million (US$40 million) of which about DH 78
million and DH 76 million would be awarded in Meknes and Kenitra, respectively.
Each implementing agency would tender for the construction works for which it
has responsibility. During appraisal, the Bank reviewed with the relevant
implementing agencies cender procedures and contract grouping.  Since most
construction works are to be implemented in slum areas which would require
labor intensive techniqlues and call for contract of relatively small size, it
is expected that the project will not attract the interest of international
contractors. The only works large enough to justify international competitive
bidding would be the on-site infrastructure included in three contracts
ranging between US$1.5 and 3 million each. However, these works are to be
implemented in the sluni upgrading sites which would require labor intensive
techniques entailing high overhead costs. This is likely to discourage
international contractors from bidding unless they are already locally repre-
sented. Consequently, procurement of civil works would be awarded on the
basis of local advertising and local competitive bidding according to procedures
commonly used by the Mcroccan Administration. These procedures have already
been applied under other Bank-assisted projects and are acceptable to the
Bank. Foreign contractors would be allowed to bid whenever interested.
3.11      Construction of the water and power supply facilities would be
carried out by the public utility companies which, according to Moroccan
legislation, have a monopoly on such works. MHAT's Delegations would there-
fore sign a special agreement under which RADEM and RAK would procure the
necessary equipment and implement the relevant civil works at cost
plus provision for professional services, under the Delegations supervision.
Draft agreements between the interested parties were reviewed by the Bank
during negotiations. Signing of these agreements would be a condition of
disbursement of the loan proceeds for these components in each project city
(para. 7.03(ii)).
3.12      Prior review by the Bank of the relevant bidding documents, adver-
tising procedures, bid evaluation reports, and, in cases of prequalification,
the bidders' selection reports would apply to all contracts for civil works
above the equivalent of US$300,000. Other contracts would be subject to
ex-post review promptly after their execution and prior to submission to the
Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds.



- 25 -
3.13      Equipment, Furniture and Vehicles.  Procurement of equipment would
amount to about DH 12 million (US$3.5 million), excluding contingencies and
professional services. Procurement would be carried out by the relevant
implementing agencies which would package the items to be acquired according
to the type of supplies: MHAT would be responsible for acquiring the equip-
ment to be used by the Permanent Secretariat. During negotiations it was
agreed that MHAT and the Provincial Administrations of Meknes and Kenitra
would exchange letters to this effect.
3.14      All contracts above US$75,000 equivalent would be awarded through
ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Other contracts would be awarded
according to local procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts awarded
through ICB would be subject to prior Bank review of the bidding documents,
advertising procedures and bid evaluation report. Other contracts would be
subject to ex-post review. In evaluating international bids for equipment
contracts, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of
15% of the CIF price of competitive goods or the prevailing level of custom
duties, whichever is lower.
3.15      As an exception to the above general procedures, procurement of
furniture and equipment needed for the various community facilities would be
allowed as part of the bulk contracts that the Ministries concerned annually
award for their general needs, provided that these contracts are awarded
according to procedures acceptable by the Bank. Since the amount of furniture
and equipment to be purchased under the project is relatively small (US$0.5
million equivalent) and spread among various types of facilities, the proposed
procedure is expected to result in speedier procurement and better prices.
3.16      Professional Services.  Consultant, advisory and training services,
excluding contingencies would amount to about DH 14.1 million (US$3.7 million),
of which DH 3.2 million (US$0.8 million) would be for assistance in improving
the municipal services of Meknes and Kenitra. Professional services would be
procured individually by the appropriate agencies and awarded in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
F. Disbursement
3.17      Disbursement of the Bank loan proceeds would be made on the
following basis:
(a) 55% of expenditures for civil works;
(b) 35% of the amount disbursed by BCP for building materials
loans;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment,
furniture and vehicles, and 75% of the expenditures for
off-the-shelf items locally procured; and
(d) 60% of expenditures for consultant, advisory and training
ser-vices, including surveys and laboratory tests as well
as services provided by government agencies under con-
tractual arrangements.



- 26 -
Disbursements would be fully documented and identified by project city.
Disbursements for building materials loans would be made against certified
statements of expenditures.
3.18      Retroactive financing would cover expenditures for professional
services and surveys needed to prepare final design and carried out after
project appraisal in April 1980. The total amount of these expenditures
is estimated at DH 6 million (US$1.6 million). Bank participation is
estimated at US$0.8 million. Table III-1 shows the schedule of estimated
Bank disbursement, including retroactive financing:

G. Accounts and Audits
3.19      Each executing agency would maintain separate accounts for the
project; the Permanent Unit of the Project Steering Committee of Meknes and
Kenitra (paras. 4.08 and 4.09) would keep a consolidated account of all
project components imp:Lemented in their respective cities, and prepare at the
end of each year, a coraprehensive statement on the project financial status.



- 27 -
Moreover, the "Housing Bureau" (paras. 4.16-4.17) of MHAT-s Delegations would
prepare detailed financial plans and cash flows of the squatter upgrading,
sites and services, and employment generation programs. The financial
performance of the Ministerial Departments and the Municipalities executing
the project would be audited once a year by the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Interior, respectively. The relevant documents would be sent
within six months from the end of each calendar year.
H. Supervision
3.20     Bank supervision of the project would require about 130 man-weeks
over 5.5 years of project implementation. A large part of the supervision
efforts (some 60 man-weeks) would be concentrated during the first two years
when most construction works will be awarded. The required basic staff would
include a planner, an engineer and a financial analyst. Participation of
experts in the supervision of small business activîties and in municipal
management and finance would also be occasionally needed.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.  General Features
4.01      The arrangements for project organization and management are the
result of a long standing dialogue between the Moroccan Government and Bank
missions on multi-component urban projects. They respond to the basic
principle of using to the maximum possible extent existing institutions
while ensuring their effective coordination and operational control. Five
Ministries--MMAT, MEN, MJS, MSP and MF--as well as the Municipalities of
Meknes and Kenitra, and the Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP) would be respon-
sible for the implementation of the various project components as indicated
in the following table:

Project Administration                                    listed above
4.02      In executir,g the squatter upgrading, sites and services, and small-
scale enterprise programs, MHAT would operate as a private developer. After
completion of construction works, it would: (i) sell the residential and
commercial/industrial land to the project beneficiaries, (ii) transfer at
cost the land for community facilities to the relevant ministerial departments
(para. 5.03), and (iii) hand over the infrastructure networks to the Municipal-
ities and Public Utility Agencies for maintenance and operation.
4.03      Implementation of off-site infrastructure would be carried out by
MHAT on behalf of the Municipalities, which would be responsible for the
financing of this corponent (para. 3.05(c)). The Municipalities would parti-
cipate in reviewing bidding documents, awarding construction contracts and,
on completion, approving the take-over of construction works.
4.04      Execution of all other project facilities would be the responsibility
of the same agencies which would be responsible for their maintenance and
operation as well as financing.
4.05      Policy guidance and coordination among the various agencies involved
in the project would be provided by Steering Committees which have already been
formed at central and local levels. At the central level, the Interministerial
Project Coordinating Committee, established under the Rabat Urban Project,
would define general policy issues related to the implementation of urban
development projects, and ensure that the organizational and financial arrange-
ments for the execution of such projects are satisfied, and that appropriate
budgetary allocations are planned according to schedule. The Committee would
also resolve disputes between agenciese At the local level, coordination of
the various executing agencies would be provided by a Project Steering



- 29 -
Committee in each city. This Committee would include local representatives
of each Government Agency and the Municipal Departments invoived in project
implementation. It would be chaired by the Provincial Governor and would be
endowed with a Permanent Unit (paras. 4.07-4.08) charged with ensuring,
on behalf of the Governor, centralized project coordination as well as monitor-
ing and supervision. The Project Steering Committee would be represented in
the Interministerial Committee.
4.06      The major departures in organization and management from the first
project relate to a shift in emphasis towards greater participation by the
Governorates in project coordination through the establishment of the
Permanent Units, and a more active role in project preparation and implemen-
tation by the Municipalities. This responds to the fact that the project is
being implemented in secondary cities and the Ministries in charge of execution
of project works would be represented by their local delegations, which are
more directly accountable to the Governors than in the case of Rabat.
4.07      The general organization of project implementation is shown in
Chart IV-1; the main agencies involved in project implementation are described
below.
B. Main Agencies
The Permanent Unit of the Project Steering Committee
4.08      The Permanent Unit of the Project Steering Committee would coordinate
and supervise the overall activity of the various project implementing
agencies and assist them in solving any major operational problem they might
encounter during project implementation, including availability of adequate
staff. The Permanent Unit would also prepare the agenda of meetings of the
Steering Committee, edit semi-annual project progress reports for the Steering
Committee and for the Bank, keep consolidated project accounts, monitor
project financing and ensure a timely preparation of withdrawal applications
of the loan proceeds to the project implementing agencies.
4.09      In view of its centralized tasks, the Permanent Unit would constitute
the principal local counterpart of Bank supervision missions. The Unit
would be permanently staffed with a full time engineer with at least five
years experience in project management, an accountant and a bilingual secretary.
It would be administratively attached to the Provincial Administration which
would be responsible for its staffing and its operation. The engineer would
be provided by the Ministry of Interior. The establishment of the Permanent
Unit of the Project Steering Committee and the appointment of its staff would
be a condition of disbursement of the loan proceeds relevant to each project
city (para. 7.03 (iii).

The Ministry of Housing and Regional Development (MHAT)
4.10      MHAT is organized into three Directorates:  Housing, Urban Planning,
and Regional Development. MHAT participation in project implementation at the
central level would be through the Housing Directorate and at local level
through the Provincial Delegations of Meknes and Kenitra.
4.11      The Housing Directorate would be responsible for coordinating all
aspects of the project within MHAT. This would include administering the
project funds budgeted to MHAT, carrying out the studies of new urban upgrading
projects, providing technical assistance to the Delegations and monitoring
their activities it implementing the project.  The Housing Directorate would
carry out the last two tasks through the "Urban Upgrading Unit" already set up
for this purpose under the Rabat Urban Project. Another function of this unit
is to promote and prepare new poverty oriented urban development projects
throughout Morocco in collaboration with MHAT's Provincial Delegations and
Local Governments. The Urban Upgrading Unit requires additional staff to cope
with its present and prospective work load. Technical assistance funds are
earmarked and still available under the Rabat Urban Project to assist the unit
in dealing with the financial aspects of project preparation, appraisal and
monitoring. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the upgrading
unit would be adequately staffed.
4.12      The Provincial Delegations would be responsible for implementing
construction works and administering plot allocations. Present staff of the
Delegations of Meknes and Kenitra amount to some 80 and 120, respectively,
organized into three departments: project implementation, urban and regional
planning, and administration. These departments are under the direct control
of the Provincial Delegate. Managerial and professional staff represent some
20% of the total staff in each Delegation.
4.13      The investment program for implementing the proposed slum upgrading
and sites and services projects would amount to an average annual cost of
about DH 15 million in each project city, which exceeds the annual investment
programs recently carried out by the Delegations. Consequently, a major orga-
nizational effort by the Delegations is under way, as described below. Because
of the Delegations' constraint in hiring staff, most operational work would be
contracted out to consultants (para. 3.09).
4.14      Project implementation in each Delegation would be carried out
through (i) a special "Project Technical Unit" (PTU), which would manage the
execution of construction works, and (ii) the existing "Housing Bureau" (HB)
of the Delegations wbich would administer plot allocation. Each PTU would be
estabiished as a new department within the Delegation and would report directly
to the Delegate. The PTUs would be responsible for:



- 32 -
supervising the consultants  activities in preparing final design
and bidding documents and in controlling construction works;
-    preparing and organizing contract awarding;
-    planning and coordinating the implementation of project works;
-    monitoring quantities of works executed by contractors;
-    preparing payment orders to contractors for completed works;
-    keeping detailed accounts of project investment expenditures; and
-    preparing quarterly reports for the Permanent Unit on the progress
of construction works.
4.15      The PTUs would be similar to each other in structure.  In addition
to a manager, each of them would include the following full-time staff:
2 engineers, 1 architEct, 1 accountant, as well as at least 12 paraprofes-
sionals--assistant engineers, quantity surveyors and clerical staff. The
schedule for appointing professional level staff (Annex 4) was discussed
during appraisal and agreed upon during negotiations (para. 7.01(iv)).
Both Delegations have already established their PTUs and appointed managers
satisfactory to the Bank. These managers have been previously involved in
project preparation and have a good knowledge of the project.
4.16      In addition to executing infrastructure works, MHAT's Delegation
would have to administer the social, financial and legal aspects of the imple-
mentation of the squatter upgrading, sites and services, and small-scale enter-
prise components.  Each Delegation already has a "housing bureau" responsible
for administering the selection of beneficiaries for social housing programs.
Each "housing bureau" presently includes six staff members. In 1979 these
bureaus allocated about: 1,200 and 2,000 plots in Meknes and Kenitra, respec-
tively.
4.17      The complexity and scale of the proposed project would require a
major increase in staff in order to strengthen the operational capacity of the
HBs. The additional staff would be partly located in special branch offices
to be established at the project sites and would be responsible for carrying
out the following tasks:
-    determining and allocating land tenure in the project squatter
areas;
-    relocating those squatter residents displaced by project
upgrading works;
-    establishing the individual files for al! project beneficiaries,
of the squatter upgrading, sites and services, and small-scale
enterprise comnponents;



- 33 -
examining the applications and selecting applicants for final
approval by the Provincial Selection Commission;
establishing the monthly payments by the project beneficiaries
according to the terms and conditions for cost recovery;
assisting the "Service des Domaines  of the Ministry of Finance
in registering and issuing land titles;
-    assisting the project households in obtaining credit facilities
for upgrading and/or constructing housing facilities; and
-    assisting small-scale enterprises in preparing loan applications
for credit facilities under the SSI project.
4.18      The additional staff required by each HB for implementing the
project includes 1 economist, l accountant, 1 lawyer, assistant engineers,
land surveyors, social workers and clerical staff. As with the PTUs, the
schedule for appointing professional level staff (Annex 4) was discussed
during appraisal and agreed upon during negotiations (para. 7.01(iv)).
The Project Municipalities of Meknes and Kenitra
4.19      The Municipalities of Meknes and Kenitra would be responsible for
(i) financing off-site infrastructure included in the project; (ii) financing
and executing the municipal services component; and (iii) operating and
maintaining all project infrastructure (off-site and on-site) 1/ and the facil-
ities provided under the municipal services component.
4.20      The Municipalities of Meknes and Kenitra are organized into nine
operational departments: social services, planning, taxation, general admin-
istration, registration, health, personnel, general accounting, and public
works and maintenance. They account for a staff of 1,240 and 630 in Meknes
and Kenitra, respectively, of which more than 50% operate in the public works
and maintenance department. Although the two cities differ in size and level
of organization, the pattern of their financial activity over the last few
years has followed similar patterns. Budgetary resources were mainly gen-
erated through local direct taxes (42% and 53%), Government subsidies (20% and
16%), and indirect taxes (23% and 20%). Investment expenditures, which in
1975 equalled operating expenditures, dropped dramatically during the
next three years and in 1979 shrunk to 20% and 8% of the operating expendi-
tures, in Meknes and Kenitra, respectively. Not since 1976 have the two
Municipalities contracted loans for capital expenditures, which reflects very
tight restrictions imposed by Government on municipal borrowing. The Govern-
ment now intends to permit more flexibility to local governments in financing
future capital expenditure, including raising additional loans. 2/ Recent
1/   With the exception of water and power supply which would be the respon-
sibility of RADEM and RAK in Meknes and Kenitra, respectively.
2/   The planned strengthening of FEC (para. 1.14) is part of the policy.



- 34 -
financial activity suggests that both project Municipalities have the capa-
bility to develop along these lines. However, the resulting debt charges and
higher operating costs will necessitate concentration by the Municipalities
upon improved operating efficiencies and require stability and growth in
revenue collection.  The development of programming and budgeting capability
is also essential to ensure that expansion of activity is kept within the
constraints of available financial resources.
4.21      In spite of the relatively large size of their staff, the two
Municipalities have had difficulties in meeting the demand for urban services.
Furthermore, the two Municipalities have been unable to spend the total budget-
ary allocations for investment despite the limited size of the investment
programs. These limitations are due mainly to lack of qualified and expe-
rienced managerial and technical personnel as well as to organizational
constraints. In order to carry out project implementation, the existing
organizational structure of the two project Municipalities would be strength-
ened. The Ministry of Interior would provicde an engineer, assisted by an
accountant, to the Public Works Department of each Municipality and would be
responsible, under the direction of the Municipal Engineer, for:
(i) planning and coordinating the investment program;
(ii) preparing, with the assistance of consultants, specifications and
tendering documents for the equipment to be procured under the
project;
(iii) preparing, with the assistance of consultants, final design and
bidding documents as well as supervising construction works of
the Central Municipal Depot;
(iv) keeping consolidated accounts of all municipal project components;
and
(v) preparing quarterly reports on the progress of project implemen-
tation to be forwarded to the Permanent Unit of the Project Steering
Committee.
4.22      The total investment to be implemented by the Municipalities of
Meknes and Kenitra under the project amounts to DH 6.4 and DH 8.6 million,
respectively. Its impact on the prospective budget of the two Municipalities
over the project's implementation period (1980-85) is summarized in the ratios
below:



- 35 -
Meknes    Kenitra
(M)        (%)
Project capital investment as a percentage
of the estimated total municipal capital
investment (1980-85)                                      4          6
Project debt service as a percentage of the
estimated municipal debt service (year 1988)             30         29
Project operating expenditures as a percentage
of total municipal operating expenditures                 9         12
4.23     As shown in the ab:iv-z Table the project entails a relatively small
increase in the municipal capital investments of Meknes and Kenitra. Apart
from the project, future municipal borrowing in both cities is very limited
which explains the relatively high ratio of the project debt service as a
percentage of the total estimated municipal debt service. The operating
expenditures generated by the project would be partially compensated for by
efficiencies resulting from improvements in the delivery of services. In
addition, it is expected that municipal tax revenues will continue to expand
in both cities as a result of increased assessments and gradually improving
collection procedures. Indeed, some of these improvements will be financed
under the project. A ten-year projection of the municipal budget indicates
that over that period project expenditures can be accommodated into the overall
municipal program. During project preparation, the municipal components were
selected with specific reference to the debt service and financial capacity of
each city.
4.24      Evidence that the Municipal Councils of Meknes and Kenitra have
approved the relevant investment programs to be carried out under the project
was provided at negotiations.
Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP)
4.25      BCP would participate in project implementation by (i) administering
on GOM's behalf collection of plot charges for residential and industrial land;
and (ii) allocating construction materials loans. It is also expected that
BCP would play a major role in providing credit facilities to small-scale
enterprises in the project area within the framework of the proposed second
SSI project (para. 2.22).
4.26       Established in 1961, BCP is a fully government-owned bank.  It is
well managed and staffed and can be considered as the major commercial bank
In Morocco. BCP's headquarters are in Casablanca. BCP's regional branch
offices, the "Banques Populaires Regionales" (BPRs) are located throughout the
country. Each BPR has territorial boundaries and enjoys autonomy of manage-
ment within defined limits of responsibility. BCP coordinates the BPRs'
financial and promotional policies and acts as their clearing house. A func-
tion of BCP/BPRs is to provide short and medium-term loans to small firms and
individuals who normally would not have access to commercial banking facilities.



- 36 -
4.27      As in the first urban project, BCP would be responsible for the
administrative aspects of recovering plot charges and providing materials
loans. BCP would be remunerated for its administrative expenses by receiving
a fee on the interest rates charged by GOM to the project beneficiaries. BCP
is presently negotiating with GOM the size of this fee (1% in the first urban
project) and the type of responsibility that it would assume with respect to
risks and litigative costs. Entering into agreement between GOM and BCP or.
the procedures and alministrative arrangements for cost recovery and for
on-lending for building materials is a conditions of effectiveness (para.
7.02).
4.28      The housing bureau of 2OHAT-s Delegation would be responsible for
contacting all beneficiaries and assisting them in preparing loan application
forms. These would be forwarded to BPRs for processing. Thereafter, BPRs
would be responsible for collecting the applicants monthly payments. Branch
offices would be established on the project sites for this purpose and will be
in place by June 30, 1983.
4.29      Payment for plot charges under the first urban project has not yet
commenced.  Consequently, there is no actual experience for judging the finan-
cial discipline of squatter households. It is proposed that for the first
three years after payments have commenced, the BRPs collect monthiy payments
directly from the project beneficiaries. Following this familiarization
period, beneficiaries would make their payments to the BRPs site offices0
The BRPs of Meknes and Kenitra would prepare a quarterly report on the collec-
tion of charges from beneficiaries and submit it to the "Service des Domaines
so that appropriate legal action can be initiated in case of payment default
(para. 5.07).  Cost recovery would be monitored by MHflAT's Urban Upgrading Un-t
(para. 4.11).
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Cost Recovery
5.01      About 75% oi: the total project costs would be directly recovered
through plot charges paid by the individual beneficiaries. Of the 25% not
recovered directly, 92% would be incurred by the municipalities and 16% by the
Government.
5.02      Costs recovered through plot charges relate to developing and
servicing the residential and industrial land. These costs, which would be
fully recovered, include land acquisition, site preparation, on-site infra-
structure, on-plot development, project administration buildings, design and
supervision, project management as well as interest during construction.
Minor off-site infrastructure works for water and power supply would be
included in the plot c"Iarges. This arrangement is the result of Z agrenment
between MHAT and the Public Utilities Agencies under which the latter would
execute the water and electricity infrastructure works at cost (para.
3.11) and waive their usual, more expensive billing procedures. Confir-
mation of this agreement was provided to the Bank during loan negotiations.
Building materials loaiis would be recovered through monthly installmrents paid
by those plot allottees electing to take up this option (paras. 2.11 and 2.17).



- 37 -
5.03      Municipal expenditures not directly recoverable from beneficiaries
include the costs of off-site infrastructure for the slum upgrading and sites
and services components as well as improvements to municipal services. The
Ministry of Interior has prepared draft regulations for establishing sewerage
agencies to be combined with those responsible for water and electricity, in
the major municipalities, including Meknes and Kenitra. The Ministry of
Interior has also prepared draft legislation which would establish surcharges
on water tariffs to pay for sewage disposal. It is expected that the above
regulations and legislation would be enacted before project completion.
National budget expenditures not directly recoverable from beneficiaries
include the costs of land, site preparation, on-site infrastructure and the
buildings required for primary schools, dispensaries and youth centers. MHAT
would sell the serviced land for community facilities to the relevant Ministries
at the average cost per marketable square meter.
5.04      The cost recovery sources for each project item are summarized in
the following table.

B. Lending Conditions of Beneficiaries
5.05      Cost recovery from beneficiaries would entail the following terms
and conditions:
-    Slum upgrading and sites and services program.  Repayment
would be at a nominal interest rate of 7% over a period of
20 years. A down payment of 10% would be required for all
residential plots in the sites and services areas and for the
infill plots in the upgraded slum areas. Building materials
loans would be repaid at an interest rate of 7% over 10 years.
-    Small-scale enterprise program.  Repayment would be at a
nominal interest rate of 10% over a period of 10 years. A
down payment of 20% would also be required. Prospective
entrepreneurs would be given the option of acquiring land for
cash. It is expected that 50% of the beneficiaries would take
up this option.
5.06      The proposed interest rates for residential land and construction
materials loans would be in line with those currently charged by housing banks
in Morocco for social housing. In July 1980, these were increased by GOM from
3 to 6% to 6 to 7% according to the type of housing unit. The proposed rates
also coincide with those applied under the first urban development project in
Rabat. GOM considers this double alignment essential to avoid discrimination
between the project beneficiaries and those of social housing programs and the
first project. Interest rates for industrial land are comparable with those
presently charged by commercial banks for industrial projects in Morocco. The
latest information indicates projected inflation rates in the country of about
12% in 1980 declining to 8% by 1982. If this occurs, Government subsidy would
be limited to interest rates for residential development only.
5.07     The overall arrangements for cost recovery would be also similar to
those applied under the Rabat Urban Project. On taking occupancy, the plot
allotees would enter into an agreement with GOM under which they would lease the
premises for five years with the right of purchase after this period. Lease
payments would be applied to the purchase price which is fixed at the time
the agreement is entered into. GOM would have thé right of cancelling the
agreement in case of default on payment for six consecutive months during the
lease period. Draft agreements including the above clauses, were reviewed
during negotiation. Collection of payments would be carried out by BCP
according to the procedures already described in paras. 4.27 to 4.29. Terms
and conditions for cost recovery, and arrangements for collection of payments
would be included in the land sales contracts between GOM and the project
beneficiaries. These terms and conditions would also be included in adminis-
trative agreements between GOM and BCP. Draft contracts for land sales were
reviewed and agreed upon by the Bank during negotiations.

C. Pricing of Residential and Industrial Plots
5.08      The pricing policy in the squatter upgrading and sites and services
programs would aim at ensuring: (i) effective overall cost recovery,
(ii) affordability by the population already living in the squatter areas, and
(iii) differential pricing according to size, location and accessibility of
new lots.
5.09      In order to achieve the above objectives, all residential and commer-
cial plots in the sites and services program would be priced at market value.
The surplus generated from plot sales in the sites and services areas would be
used as a cross-subsidy to establish plot prices in the slum upgrading areas,
thus reducing possible displacement of existing population as well as possible
defaults in cost recovery. In Kenitra, cross-subsidies between sites and
services and slum areas are also justified by the higher cost of land acquisi-
tion in slum areas, where land is primarily in private ownership.
5.10      As with the residential plots in the sites and services areas, plots
for small-scale enterprises would be priced at market value. Prevailing sale
prices have been based on a recent survey carried out by ODI in the framework
of a pilot study on industrial zones in 22 Moroccan cities and would be updated
by the Delegation of MHAT before the beginning of the sale process.
D. Affordability Analysis
5.11      The affordability analysis is based on detailed surveys on household
income and housing expenditures in the project areas, conducted by the two MHAT
Delegations in late 1979.
-    'Slum Upgrading.  The cost of the smallest existing plot would be
affordable to more than 95% of the resident population. This estimate is
based on monthly payments representing about 10% of household incomes. These
monthly payments correspond to the percentage of income that households are
willing to spend for infrastructure improvement over and above their current
housing expenditures. The cost of infill plots would represent about 20% of
monthly household income. However, the proportion of income spent on housing
would be much lower for relocated families because they would receive compen-
sation in the form of a reduction in the plot purchase price. Plot charges,
monthly repayments and percentiles reached are indicated in Table V-1.
Sensitivity analysis shows that if household incomes were to increase by 10%
less than costs, the smallest existing plot would then be affordable to about
90% of the resident population.

-    Sites and Services.  The surveys indicate that beneficiaries would
devote between 20% and 25% of their income to total monthly housing expendi-
tures, including utility charges and the optional building materials loan
repayments.  The down payment of 10% would not exceed 3 months' income
equivalent and corresponds to the amount that households declared they were
ready to contribute. The cheapest plot option inclusive of building materials
loan repayments would be affordable to about 85% of the urban population of
Meknes and Kenitra. It should be noted that building materials loans are
optional and consequen'ly, even lower income households could afford the basic
plot (serviced land only). In addition, the substantial increase in supply of
serviced plots would aLlow both for internal movement in the housing stock and
rental opportunities, wehich would also benefit the poorest segment of the
population in each city. Plot options, charges, monthly repayments and per-
centiles reached are indicated in Table V-2. Sensitivity analysis shows that
if household incomes were to increase by 10% less than costs, the cheapest
plot option inclusive of building materials loan repayments would then be
affordable to 80% and 85% of the urban population of Meknes and Kenitra,
respectively. The beneficiaries would be selected according to general
criteria established in an existing ministerial circular (No. 1871 of November
17, 1977). During negotiations specific income requirements as wel1 I :S
procedures and a timetable for selecting beneficiaries were also agreed
upon.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      At the national level, the project would assist GOM to further
develop its capacity to cope with the problem of urban poverty through the
implementation of integrated projects involving the interaction of various
ministries, agencies and levels of responsibility. By extending GOM's expe-
rience in this field from the capital city to other cities, the project would
further demonstrate the appropriateness of squatter upgrading and sites and
services programs as against more expensive and subsidized conventional
housing. Moreover, by operating in provincial cities, the project would help
to build up essential experience for transferring increased responsibilities
to Local Governments in eventually promoting, implementing and financing
future projects.
6.02      At the local level, the project would promote the integration of the
majority of the slum dwellers of Meknes and Kenitra into the social and
economic life of the two cities. This would be achieved by improving the
environmental conditions of the project slum areas, by extending to their
inhabitants essential urban services, and by providing additional job oppor-
tunities. The project would also provide the cities present and future
populations with sufficient serviced land to adequately develop low-cost
shelter over the next :ive years, thus removing the major cause of squatting.
Finally, the project would assist Local Governments to effectively manage
urban development and growth over the coming decades.
6.03      Replicability is a major general objective of the project.  Conse-
quently, there would be full recovery of all relevant costs. In order to
achieve full cost recovery while at the same time ensuring that the proposed
facilities are affordable to the greatest number of families (particularly
households below the urban poverty threshold), there have been substantial
revision to and reduction in layout design, infrastructure, and housing
standards currently in use in Morocco. Funds generated through direct cost
recovery would be recycled into new projects through the national budget
process.
A. Project Benefits
6.04      The economic benefits of the various project components are described
below. The ERR for slum upgrading and sites and services which together
represents about 93% o- total project cost, is estimated at 18%. Due to
difficulties in the quantification of benefits, a reliable computation of
economic rates of return (ERR) could not be established for the small-scale
enterprise and municipal services components.
Slum Upgrading and Sites and Services
6.05      The following costs were included in the ERR calculation:  (a) land
and site development, :including site preparation and on-site infrastructure;
(b) the share of off-site infrastructure allocable to the sites; (c) on-plot



- 43 -
development, including core units and sanitary cores; (d) self-help building
materials and related labor; (e) physical contingencies; (f) administration,
design and supervision; and (g) annual operation and maintenance (estimated at
3% of total development costs).
6.06      The evaluation of benefits in the upgrading and sites and services
programs is based on estimates of imputed incremental rental values for
housing and market sale prices for small-scale enterprise plots. Information
regarding rental values in areas with similar locational characteristics was
obtained through surveys carried out by MHAT during project preparation.
Actual and estimated values are as follows:

The economic analysis was done on the basis of domestic market prices.
Calculation of the rate of return based on shadow prices of project inputs
led to increases of the rate of return in excess of 30%.
6.07      Taken separately, the upgrading schemes (including infill plots)
would have a return of 19%, and the sites and services schemes a return of
16%. Sensitivity analyses show that an increase of 10% in the benefits, or
a decrease of 10% in the costs, would increase the rates of return by 2 percen-
tage points for both the upgrading and sites and services programs. A 10%
decrease in benefits or increase in costs would decrease the rates of return
by 2 percentage points as well.
Employment
6.08      It is estimated that small-scale enterprises on the serviced land
provided under the project would employ about 770 and 1,500 persons in Meknes



-   44    --
and Kenitra, respectively. In addition, employment opportunitlies would also
be provided to the population presently  iîving in the project slum. areas
through the construction activities of the upgrading and sites and services
programs.  During the construction period, it îs expected that at least 1,000
residents of the upgr ading areas would be employed in constructLon activities.
Improvement in Munici- al Services
6.09       The creation of a Central Municipal Depot, anrd  he          fssitin cf
equipment for garbage collection, street cleaning and Infrastructlre mainte-
nance would allow (i) an increase in the operational effieiency of the munic-
ipal departments of public works, ard (ii) an extenIsion of serk7îv c         o the
project areas and urban areas presently neglected.  Ry  i rc--asing their
operational efficiency, the Public Works lepartments of the Municipaiities cf
Meknes and Kenitra would be able to free some 10% and 6% of their present
personnel from working3 in urban sections currently serviced and tC use them
in unserviced urban areas, including areas to be serviced in thi-e project.
It is expected that the project would reduce operating costs in the already
serviced areas by about 20% in both cities and considerably increase the
overall delivery capacity of public services by the MunicpcaIities,
B. Urba. Poverty Impact
6.10       The project is primarily designed to initiate citv-wi de programs to
service the basic need's and increase the incomes of the population with incomes
below the Bank-defined. absolute urban poverty threshold. Approximnately 28 and
22% of households living in Meknes and Kenitra respectively fal1 înto this
category.  It is estinLated that 39,200 peo-nle in Meknes and 27,100 in Kenitra
below the poverty threshold would benefît from the project. These represent
about 39% and 57% of the urban poor in the two cities. Improvements provided
through slum upgrading would benefit 24,800 people in Meknes arnd 16,950 in
Kenitra within this target income group.  Under the sites and services program,
20,600 people in Meknes and 14,500 in Kenitra would have access to low-cost
shelter opportunities. Of these people, 70/' would have incomes be-1OW
the urban poverty threshold.
6.11       The strengthening of the technical departmernts cf the MIunicipali.ties
would provide for improved delivery cf basic urban services in iow-încome
neighborhoods which are presently inadequately served.  It is estimated that
this would benefit some 70% of the total urban population wi th incomes below
the poverty threshold in each project cityv
C.  Project Risks
6.12       Despite the fact that the proposed project continue  the croarams
initiated under the first urban project in Rabat, it stili iîntroduces icnnova-
tive approaches to urban development in MoroccoO  Consequently, this may
entail a number of riscs.



- 45 -
6.13      Lack of experienced managerial and technical staff could delay
implementation of the project construction works, resulting in substantial
cost overruns. This risk has been reduced by ensuring that qualified profes-
sional staff is provided to the Project Permanent Units (para. 4.09) and
employing consultants for the preparation of final engineering and bidding
documents, as well as the supervision of construction works (para. 3.09).
6.14      There is often a danger that the pressures in demand resulting from
a shortage of housing could lead to higher income groups obtaining the shelter
facilities targeted for the lower income population and the urban poor. Under
the project this risk has been reduced by establishing precise procedures to
be implemented by the Housing Bureau for selecting beneficiaries. Moreover,
the project provides much lower standards than currently practised, which
would reduce the attractiveness to the higher income groups, while enhancing
affordability to the poor.
6.15      Cost recovery under the project may be hampered by the fact that
most of the beneficiaries have limited experience in contracting formal debt
obligations and, consequently, might overextend themselves. In order to reduce
this risk, BCP, with the assistance of MHATs Housing Bureau, would ensure
that the allottees of new serviced sites have the requisite qualifications and
borrow according to their ability to pay. In the upgrading areas, difficulties
with cost recovery might be encountered because many of the families do not
have steady incomes. The Housing Bureau would assist these families in plan-
ning for meeting their payments. This could include advice on possible sub-
dividing of large plots or rental or rooms in order to obtain additional
income. Surveys in the project areas indicate that beneficiaries are prepared
to pay for the amounts to be recovered under the project in order to obtain
secure tenure and essential services.
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following assurances were obtained:
(i)  GOM will pursue with due diligence acquisition of the project
privately-owned land for which it has already initiated
expropriation (paras. 2.05 and 2.12);
(ii)  MHAT will furnish to the Bank for review and comments by
December 31, 1981 land use and building regulations for
residential and industrial plots;
(iii) the Ministry of Interior will provide a qualified engineer
and an accountant to each Permanent Unit of the Project
Steering Committee (para. 4.09), and an engineer to each
project Municipality (para. 2.26 (c));
(iv)  MHAT and the project Municipalities will provide the
managerial and staff resources needed for implementing



- 46 -
the project according to the schedule discussed during
appraisal and agreed upon during negotiations (paras. 4.15
and 4.18); and
(v) GOM's terms and conditions for cost recovery from beneficiaries
are as described in paras. 5.05, 5.09 and 5.10.
7.02      As a condition of loan effectiveness, GOM and BCP shall enter into
agreements on the procedures and administrative arrangements for cost recovery
and for on-lending for building materials loans as reviewed and agreed upon
during negotiations (para. 4.27).
7.03      As conditions of disbursement:
(i)  No disbursement will be made against expenditures for
implementing the project in Meknes or in Kenitra until
the relevant Permanent Unit of the Project Steering
Committee has been established and appropriately staffed
(para. 4.09);
(ii)  No disbursement will be made against expenditures for
executing the municipal services program in either project
city until GOM and the Municipalities of Meknes or Kenitra
have entered into agreement on the terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank for financing the relevant works
(para. 3.07); and
(iii)  No disbursement will be made against expenditures for
executing water, power supply and street lighting works in
either project city until MHAT has signed contracts with
RADEM or RAK, respectively (para. 3.11).
7.04      With the assurances received and subject to the above conditions,
the project is suitab]-e for a Bank loan of US$36 million to the Government of
Morocco.
