APPRAISAL OF TROMBAY IV FERTILIZER EXPANSION AND
PLAiT OPERATIONS IMPROVETMNT PROJECT
STIMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a proposed IDA Credit of US$50 million equiv-
alent consisting of two parts: US$33 million to help expand capacity of the
Trombay Unit, near Bombay, of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), a
public sector company and the country's largest fertilizer producer; and
US$17 million to provide urgently needed assistance, to improve operations
in other Government-owned fertilizer plants. The expansion project would
increase Trombay's complex fertilizer production capacity by 355,000 tons
per year (TPY) in the form of nitrophosphate of 21:21:0 grade, i.e., 21%
nitrogen and 21% phosphate content, equivalent to 75,000 TPY each of nitrogen
and phosphate nutrients. The project is estimated to cost nearly US$64 mil-
lion (including initial working capital and interest during construction), of
which US$25 million would be in foreign exchange, and it is expected to be
completed by May 1977.
ii.       FCI has five operating fertilizer units which are all being expanded
and another seven are under construction, or under planning, and this program
is to be completed by 1979 when FCI's fertilizer capacity would increase by
about eight times over the 1974 level.  However, as pointed out in reports on
the IDA Credits for the Gorakhpur and Nangal Expansion Projects, the Corpora-
tion's operations continue to be hampered by low capacity utilization in some
of the existing plants and delay in commissioning new plants. The latter
generally is due to procurement and start-up difficulties. As a result, FCI's
recent earnings as a wlhole have been unsatisfactory -- less than 1% return
on capital. Financial forecasts show a steady increase in earnings but the
anticipated imiprovement is dependent upon successful operation of the plants
to be commissioned in the next few years and better capacity utilization of
existing plants.
iii.      The US$17 million part of the proposed IDA Credit for plant operations
improvement is to be used to assist FCI as well as the Fertilisers and Chemicals
Travancore Ltd. (FACT) in overcoming some of their problems by making possible
the import of critically needed equipment, spare parts, some consumable materials
and technical assistance for the commissioning of new plants and improving the
operations of existing units. It is the prime objective of this portion of the
Credit to increase fertilizer supply in India within the next 2-3 years, thus
making a significant and immediate impact on the country's agricultural pro-
duction.
iv.       The expansion project (Trombay IV) is part of a continuing invest-
ment program at Trombay, estimated to cost about US$225 million over the
next five years, to increase capacity from about 81,000 to 304,000 TPY of N
and 36,000 to 129,000 TPY of P205. The project is relatively independent of
the rest of Trombay's operations with two exceptions: (1) part of the nitric
acid to be produced by the project as an intermediate product will feed the
existing nitrophosphate plant at Trombay, now being expanded; and (2) the
project will obtain ammonia, one of its two major raw materials, from planned



- ii -
surplus production of a new ammonia/urea plant (Trombay V) to be commissioned
about one year after Trombay IV. Until the time Trombay V can provide ammonia,
the project will have to rely on other domestic sources of ammonia and on
imports. The other principal raw material input - phosphate rock -- will be
imported until local supplies become available within a few years after comple-
tion of the project. Considering the shortage of ammonia and urea in the
world and sharp rises in fertilizer prices, India's decision to undertake
Trombay V, rather than import ammonia and urea as an alternative, seems jus-
tifiable.  This conclusion is supported by the satisfactory economic return
envisaged, the availability of heavy fuel oil feedstock in adjacent refineries,
the large nearby markets for fertilizer and India's acute foreign exchange
problems. The Government has presented a firm plan for implementation of
Trombay V on a schedule compatible with the needs of Trombay IV.
v.        The project (Trombay IV) will utilize commercially proven processes,
with FCI as the overall contractor. However, substantial responsibility for
project implementation and start-up will rest with the foreign contractors
of the two production units -- the nitric acid and the nitrophosphate plants.
Tihus, there is reasonable assurance that the project will be executed on
schledule and without major difficulties. Furthermore, no significant com-
mercial risk is foreseen because: (1) the fertilizer grade (21:21:0) to be
produced by the project is very close to one of the popular grades (20:20:0)
Trombay is already selling; (2) fertilizers in general will continue to be
in short supplv in India; and (3) Trombay's marketing system is well developed.
The operating and financial performance of Trombay has improved significantly
over the past few years with net income before taxes reaching 22% of capital
employed in 1974, and this trend is projected to continue in the future. The
single most important risk that this project faces lies in the present very
tight fertilizer equipment supply conditions which -- although ample price
contingencies have been provided for in the capital cost estimates -- could
cause more than anticipated price increases and lengthen equipment delivery
periods with a consequential rise in project costs.
vi.       While the Trombay Unit could finance most of the local currency
expenditures of its modernization and expansion programs out of internally-
generated funds, its cash surplus, as is the case with the surpluses of all
FCI constituent units, is transferred to FCI. Therefore, Trombay IV will be
financed by an equity contribution of the Government equivalent to US$30.7
million and the proposed IDA Credit portion of US$33.0 million and Trombay
V is expected to be financed by suppliers' credits from Italy and Austria
and by an equity investment of the Government. The proposed IDA Credit
portion for Trombay IV would be on-lent by the Government to FCI in rupees
for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at an annual interest rate of 9.5%;
it would be used for equipment, supplies and spares (20% of which is expected
to be manufactured in India) procured under Bank/IDA Guidelines, as well as
to cover almost all expenditures of engineering, license fees, erection and
commissioning. Upon project completion, the Trombay Unit is expected to have
a sound financial structure with a debt/equity ratio of about 25/75 and a
satisfactory debt service coverage and liquidity position.



- iii -
vii.      On the basis of international prices of inputs and fertilizer
prices expected to prevail in the late 1970's, which are consistent with the
assumptions made in other fertilizer projects presently being considered by
the Bank Group, the project's economic rate of return is about 16% at 90%
capacity utilization. A six-month delay in project implementation combined
with a 10% capital cost overrun and 80% capacity utilization, would drop the
return to about 13%, still a satisfactory figure. The net annual foreign
exchange savings from the Trombay IV project are estimated at about US$18
million, once it is operating normally at 90% of capacity, and its output
would help increase food production in India by about 700,000 tons per year.
Trombay's employment will increase by about 20% and existing staff will be
utilized more efficiently as a result of the project. Indirect employment
benefits are limited primarily to construction and marketing activities.
viii.     In addition to the fertilizer projects already financed in India by
IDA (Cochin II, Gorakhpur and Nangal) and IFC (Indian Explosives and Zuari-
Agro), the Bank was Executing Agency for a UNDP project for an evaluation of
the phosphate rock deposits in Rajasthan. The Bank Group intends to continue
being active in this priority sector in India and is presently appraising an
expansion phase of FCI's Sindri Unit and a project sponsored by the Indian
Farmers' Fertiliser Cooperative.
ix.       Based on the agreements spelled out at the end of the report, a
US$50 million IDA Credit to the Government of India is recommended.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested an IDA Credit of US$50
million equivalent consisting of two parts--US$33 million to help expand
capacity of the Trombay Unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI)
and US$17 million to provide urgently needed assistance- to FCI and FACT (The
Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore, Ltd.) fertilizer plants in general. The
Trombay project, referred to as Trombay IV, will add 355,000 metric tons per
year (TPY) of nitrophosphate fertilizer (21-21-0) capacity, equivalent to
75,000 TPY each of nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P205). 1/ The project will
obtain ammonia, one of its two major raw materials, from a new ammonia/urea
plant (Trombay V) to be constructed nearby and on essentially the same
schedule as that for the project; the other principal input--phosphate rock--
will be imported until local supplies become available within a few years
after the completion of the project. The balance of the proposed Credit
would help expedite completion and commissioning of FCI and FACT plants and
eliminate actual and possible production constraints.
1.02      Trombay is located in the industrial zone of Bombay (Map IBRD
10453R).  The original plant was commissioned in 1966 2/ and, in the begin-
ning, experienced operating difficulties resulting in low capacity utilization.
Trombay lias a modernization program now underway to improve operations, the
final phase of which will be carried out concurrently with the project.
The proposed IDA Credit portion of US$33 million equivalent to for Trombay IV
will cover about 95% of the project's foreign exchange costs (US$25 million)
plus nearly 23% of its local costs; the remainder of the Credit (US$17 million)
will be needed entirely for foreign exchange expenditures.
1.03      FCI's financial situation and prospects were analyzed in the Nangal
appraisal report (Report No. 46-IN, dated January 2, 1973); they are summarized
and updated in this report. FACT's operations were reviewed in the Cochin II
appraisal report (Report No. PI-8, dated Nay 14, 1971). Its present situa-
tion is described in paras 3.04 and 3.05. This appraisal is based on missions
to India in May/June 1973 and October 1973, consisting of Messrs. D.E. Brown
and A.R. Perram and subsequent review in Wlashington with the addition of Y.T.
Shetty, all of the Industrial Projects Department.
II. FERTILIZER CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)
A.   Organization and Mlanagement
2.01      FCI was incorporated in 1961, merging two public sector companies--
Sindri Fertilizers & Chemicals (Sindri) in Bihar and Hindustan Chemicals &
Fertilizers Ltd. (Nangal) in the Punjab, which began production in 1951 and
1/   A glossary of technical terms is given in Annex 1.
2/   All years refer to fiscal years ending March 31.



- 2 -
1961 respectively. FCI today has five operating units and is India's largest
fertilizer producer, accounting for about 25% of nitrogen and 10% of phosphate
capacity in the country. During 1974, FCI produced 279,000 tons of N and
32,000 tons of P205.
2.02     Miajor FCI projects under implemention (Map IBRD 10453R) are: (a)
Durgapur, (b) Barauni, (c) Namrup Expansion, (d) Ramagundam, (e) Talcher,
(f) Sindri Rationalization, (g) Gorakhpur Expansion, 1/ (h) haldia, and
(i) Nangal Expansion. 1/ Five other projects are being planned: (a) Trombay
IV Expansion (the subject of this report), (b) the ammonia/urea plant at
Trombay (Trombay V, which is closely tied to the project), (c) Sindri Moderni-
zation 2/, (d) Korba and (e) Paradeep. FCI is described in more detail in
Annex 2-1. By 1979, when all these projects are to be completed, FCI is
expected to have a capacity of about 2.5 million TPY of N and 0.65 million
TPY of P205 compared to the present capacity of 376,000 TPY of N and 36,000
TPY of P205 ill its five operating units.
2.03      Total existing FCI employment is approximately 19,000, which is high
even though it includes staff for schools, hospitals, townships and training
programs. FCI recognizes overstaffing to be a serious financial problem,
particularly at Sindri, and although no politically and socially acceptable
solution has as yet been found, the expansion projects should enable FCI to
better utilize its staff.
2.04      FCI has a 13-member board:  six senior officers of FCI, two from
Government ministries, four from other public sector organizations, and one
retired head of a research institute. The Board functions as a control body
and as a coordinating group between FCI and the Government, whose influence
on operations, finance and planning is strong.
2.05      There were changes in the top management of FCI last year (Annex 2-2);
in particular, there is a new Managing Director, Mr. K.C. Sharma, who was for-
merly responsible for the Corporation's expansion program.  He and five senior
Directors (Production, Marketing, Projects, Finance and Personnel) are res-
ponsible for policy development and operations; they lhave accumulated substan-
tial industrial experience within FCI and are considered capable. Each fer-
tilizer plant operates as a separate profit center under its General Mtanager.
The large expansion program now in progress has been straining available
experienced staff in middle management for both project execution and opera-
tions, and thie provision of adequate personnel and know-how is becoming an
increasingly important consideration for each of FCI's projects and operating
plants.
1/   IDA Credits of US$10 million and US$58 million equivalent, respectively,
have been made for the Gorakhpur (279-IN of January 7, 1972) and Nangal
(357-IN of February 9, 1973) expansion projects.
2/  C(01 lhas requested IDA to assist in financing a new ammonia/urea plant
at Sindri expected to be similar in size to the Nangal expansion project.

for the period 1970-1982 together with the major assumptions made are given
in Annexes 2-3 and 2-4, and are summarized below:

/1   Based on the revised fertilizer prices of October 1973.
2.07      FCI's net income and debt service coverage were unsatisfactory in
1973 and 1974 because of operational losses in Sindri and Namrup, and sub-
stantially higher raw material costs. However, these financial indicators
are projected to reach satisfactory levels in 1975 and improve further during
the Trombay IV implementation period and beyond. Agreements already included
in the credit documents for the Gorakhpur and Nangal expansion projects have
been reiterated, namely that the Government will provide adequate funds to
FCI to complete its on-going and new projects on terms compatible with FCI's
sound financial position.
2.08      The above income projections for FCI show increasingly large sales
revenues and profits as new plants come on stream. However, particularly
over the next few years, their achievement will depend on the performance of
new plants such as Durgapur, Barauni, Namrup, Talcher and Ramagundam, and on
increased capacity utilization in the existing plants. The plant operations
improvement part of the proposed IDA Credit is designed to help achieve the
necessary operational improvements and accelerate plant commissioning (paras
3.03 - 3.06).

2.10      The Corporation has a satisfactory debt/equity ratio of 27/73 (1974),
indicating that its fixed assets have been financed on a sound basis. Also
during project implementation, the debt/equity ratio is expected to remain
satisfactory. In this context, the agreement already reached with GOI and FCI
in connection with the Gorakhpur and N4angal projects was reiterated requiring
the Government to provide adequate funds to FCI so that the Corporation can
maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2:1 and that FCI will not at any time
have a debt/equity ratio of more than 50/50. Further, FCI will not declare
dividends or prepay any debt if, after the payment of such dividends or debt,
FCI's current ratio shall be less than 1.5:1.
D.   Trombay Unit
2.11      The existing Trombay plant has an annual design capacity of 240,000
tons of NPK fertilizer (15-15-15); 99,000 tons of urea; and 30,000 tons of
methanol. Intermediate products include ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric
acid. In addition, some minor quantities of industrial chemicals such as
argon, concentrated nitric acid, sodium nitrate and ammonium bicarbonate are
produced. The Trombay complex includes necessary facilities such as mainte-
nance shops, storage, utilities, offices and townships; it is near to the
Bombay port and has good rail and road connections. Present plant facilities
are described in detail in Annex 2-6. The General Manager of the Trombay
Unit, Mr. R. S. Kachwaha, 52, and the Project Manager for Trombay IV, Mr.
S. C. De Baksi, 45, are capable and are assisted by well-trained, experienced
executive and technical personnel. FCI agreed that it will consult with IDA
before making any change in the positions of the General Manager or the Project
Manager in the Trombay Unit and will promptly staff any vacant position related
to the project with experienced and competent personnel.

2.12      The original Trombay plant was financed by loans of US$37.8 million
and Rs 134 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development and its
total cost was about Rs 495 million (US$66 million). The plant was built
during 1962-65 by two US firms--the Chemical Construction Corporation (Chemico)
and the Chemical and Industrial Corporation (C&I), now C&I-Girdler which is
owned by the Bechtel Corporation. FCI has withheld the last payment due to
C&I-Girdler and has sued IDI Management Inc. (C&I-Girdler's holding company
at that time) for alleged design deficiencies.
2.13      IDI Management Inc. has filed a counterclaim for non-fulfillment
of the original contract, and arbitration is now proceeding through the
International Chamber of Commerce. While a series of hearings has been held,
as is usual in such cases, it is difficult to form an accurate opinion of
where the major fault lies and how the arbitration will be settled. However,
since the claims discussed are large, ranging from US$13-23 million with an
interim award of US$250,000 agreed by a majority of the tribunal in February
1974, IDA has obtained agreement from GOI that payment, if any, resulting
from the countersuit will be settled in a manner which would not impair FCI's
and Trombay's financial position.
2.14      During the initial years of operation, the technical problems, in-
cluding maintenance, at Trombay limited production in the ammonia, NPK and
methanol plants which, in turn, adversely affected the output of urea. In
1968, Trombay embarked on a number of improvements to overcome the then
existing limitations (Annex 2-7). Emphasis was placed on removing the bottle-
necks in the ammonia and nitrophosphate plants which have now achieved about
90% utilization of attainable capacity. Production of several industrial
chemicals has also been expanded. These operations are small but profitable
and will continue to be enlarged in the future as markets develop. Finally,
facilities have been erected to increase methanol output and to produce
phosphoric acid. The cost of the above plant improvements and additions is
estimated at about Rs 80 million, financed by the Government on a 50/50 loan-
equity basis.
2.15      To conclude the streamlining of the existing plant facilities,
Trombay has embarked (under the so-called modernization program) on four
additional investments to (1) increase the 15-15-15 NPK production capacity
from 240,000 to about 330,000 TPY; (2) improve NPK quality from about 35% to
60% phosphate water solubility; (3) increase urea capacity from 99,000 to
about 129,000 TPY; and (4) improve pollution control--all described in more
detail in Annex 2-7. FCI has prepared detailed engineering for these projects
and Trombay has received approval from the Government for the modernization
program as well as the necessary foreign exchange to begin procurement. This
program is not part of the proposed IDA-assisted project, but will be implemented
concurrently and is important to Trombay's expected operational and financial
improvements. The only links between the project and the modernization pro-
gram are a nitric acid plant and sDme common utilities, both included in
Trombay IV. The modernization program is estimated to cost about Rs 45 mil-
lion and, considering the preparatory work already undertaken, it should be
completed by the end of 1976.

2.17      The large losses in 1970 were mainly due to an explosion in the
ammonia plant that caused unusually low capacity utilization. Since then
Trombay has improved capacity utilization and increased profitability,
indicating that the investments to overcome the earlier operating problems
are beginning to show results. In 1974, however, power shortage limited
nitrogen production to about 80% of capacity. The increased earnings reflect
lower fixed costs per unit of production; lower per unit raw material con-
sumption; increased production and sales of urea, methanol and other products;
and higher sales prices since October 1973. Total sales revenue in 1973 showed
a drop over 1972 when a high volume of imported fertilizer for Trombay's seed-
ing program (Rs 96 million in 1972 versus Rs 50 million in 1973) inflated the
sales figures.
2.18      Trombay's historical balance sheets given in Annex 2-9 are summarized

2.19      Trombay's current ratio in 1973 and 1974 was reduced, falling below
1:1, primarily because of large and accelerated debt repayments to GOI out of
surplus cash, but it is projected to improve to 1.2:1 in 1975 (para 7.01).
Through 1971, Trombay had a negative net worth, but thereafter capitalization
quickly improved and the debt/equity ratio reached an estimated 15/85 at the
end of 1974 due to debt repayments and increased earnings. Trombay's account-
in" and internal reporting systems are satisfactory; they are computerized and
management has up-to-date daily and monthly operational and financial reports
at its disposal for proper decision-making. Trombay's accounts are independently
audited in addition to the Government audit. FCI has agreed to submit to IDA
detailed annual and quarterly production, income and cash flow statements for
the Trombay Unit. In addition, FCI will submit consolidated annual and quar-
terly financial statements including income, balance sheet and cash flow
statements.
III.  THE NEED FOR IMPROVELENT OF PLANT OPERATIOI%S
A.   Problems of FCI and FACT Units
3.01      FCI has five operating fertilizer units of wyhich Nangal, Gorakhpur
and Namrup are undergoing expansion, Trombay is being modernized and will be
expanded on a large scale, and Sindri is being rationalized and its subsequent
modernization is being planned. In addition, FCI is building six new
fertilizer plants (Durgapur, Barauni, Talcher, Ramagundam, Haldia and Korba)
and a seventh (Paradeep) is in the planning stage. FCI's operations are



-8-
affected by:  (1) Low capacity utilization (less than 80%) in some existing
units; and (2) delays in the commissioning of new projects, particularly
because of procurement and "start-up" difficulties. The major causes for
these problems are power shortages and variations in supply; inadequate avail-
ability of imported spare parts and consumable materials; lack of timely tech-
nical assistance; design deficiencies necessitating modifications and replace-
ments; shortages of cement and steel; and delays in the supply of local equip-
ment. The problems of FACT (Annex 3) are also similar to those of FCI. To
help overcome these adverse factors, GOI is seeking US$17 million from IDA for
the foreign exchange costs of critical equipment and spares, engineering and
consulting services and some consumable materials.
3.02      For three of the existing FCI plants -- Gorakhpur, Namrup and Nangal
-- the attainable capacity is the same as the installed capacity, whereas for
Trombay the attainable capacity has been placed at 90% of the installed capa-
city primarily because of the shortfall in the capacity of the naphtha gasifi-
cation unit. This will, however, be rectified as soon as the new naphtha
gasification unit, presently under commissioning, comes on stream. As for
Sindri, it has practically outlived its economic life but is being kept in
operation in part for social considerations, especially because it employs a
large labor force. An expert committee of FCI has estimated that Sindri's
attainable capacity is only 75,000 TPY of N, i.e., 83% of the installed ca-
pacity of 90,000 TPY. The coke-oven batteries and gas plants in Sindri are
fast deteriorating from age, and raw materials like gypsum and coal are not
available in required quality. To overcome these problems, measures are being
taken to repair and renovate the coke-oven batteries; to use by-product gypsum
in the place of high-cost, poor-quality natural gypsum; and to rationalize and
modernize the facilities by replacing the outmoded process of making ammonia,
and to expand ammonia and fertilizer production. IDA is currently appraising
the Sindri Modernization Project.
B.   Capacity Utilization in Existing Units

/1   1973 figure.
3.04      The above table indicates that the attainable capacity utilization
in FCI was the lowest in Nangal, which is experiencing drastic cuts in power
supply from the Bhakra Dam. However, this unit had been operating at near-full
production before 1971, when the power cuts were imposed. Since then, it has
not been able to achieve more than 70% capacity utilization until recently.
In 1973, the average power supplied to Nangal was only about 63% of the con-
tracted quantity, i.e., 103 MW out of 164 MW. Although the power supply sit-
uation improved during 1974, the supply still fell short of requirements.
FCI has asked the Government to ensure adequate power to this plant as well
as to Namrup, Gorakhpur and Trombay, which are also affected by power interrup-
tions, voltage dips and low power frequencies. Because of the power problems
alone, FCI suffered a production loss of 48,000 tons of nutrients in 1974
valued at about Rs!40 million (US$5.3 million); at present import prices (May
1974), it is worth about US$15 million. Nangal alone is estimated to have
experienced a production loss from power shortages of about Rs 23 million
(US$3.1 million) in 1973. In spite of that, it showed a pre-tax profit of
nearly Rs 35 million (US$4.7 million). In the case of the FACT unit at
Udyogamandal, the capacity utilization is very low mainly because of obsolete
equipment needing replacement, power shortage, and labor and management prob-
lems. It showed a net loss of Rs 23 million (US$3.0 million) in 1973.
C.   Implementation of New Projects
3.05      Of the FCI projects under implementation, Durgapur, Barauni and
Namrup (Expansion) are three years behind schedule, mainly because of design
and engineering problems and delays in supplying equipment. The Durgapur
plant went into trial production in October 1973 after considerable "start-up"
difficulties and consequent modifications and replacements. However, it has



- 10 -
not yet been possible to achieve continuous stabilized production because of
equipment failures, mainly in the ammonia section. As a result, the commis-
sioning period has been lengthened and some of the imported equipment still
needs replacement. Barauni and Nazirup (Expansion) are also at an advanced
stage of construction and are scheduled to be commissioned in calendar year
1974. However, they too are facing technical problems which could be overcome
without additional adverse effect if corrective measures are taken promptly.
Furthermore, additional improvements might be necessary to achieve high capa-
city utilization in all three plants, judging by the present situation. FACT's
new projects - Cochin I and Cochin II 1/ -- have experienced delays and cost
overruns. Further, Cochin I has not yet fully overcome its technical defi-
ciencies though the plant was mechantcally complete in December 1971; it needs
additional modifications and replacements to attain sustained production.
Cochin II is expected to be completed by March 1975, about 1 year later than
originally forecast due to procurement delays and strikes.
3.06      Durgapur, Barauni, Namrup and Cochin I are all of equal size with an
aggregate capacity of some 600,000 TPY of N (in the form of urea) compared
to the estimated 770,000 tons of nitrogen imported in 1973/1974 and the esti-
mated shortfall in supply of 800,000 tons (paras 4.06 - 4.08). It is, there-
fore, urgent to complete these projects as well as other FCI and FACT units
under construction as quickly as possible, particularly in view of the current
worldwide shortage of fertilizers and their high prices. The following table
shows the capacity and completion targets for these plants:
1/   Cochin II is being assisted by an IDA Credit (264-IN dated July 30, 1971)
of US$20 million equivalent.

IV. THE MARKET
A.   Supply and Demand
4.01      A detailed analysis of the market for fertilizers in India is pro-
vided in Annex 4.1. This analysis is based on data collected during ap-
praisal of the project and a more recent appraisal of another fertilizer
plant in India and has been updated by information supplied by GOI/FCI of-
ficials during negotiations. 1/
4.02      In 1974, the total installed capacity in India was 1.95 million
TPY of N (58% in the public sector and 42% in the private sector) and 571,400
TPY of P205 (one-third in the public sector and two-thirds in the private
sector). The total production in 1974 was 1.06 million tons of N and 0.32
million tons of P205, representing a capacity utilization of about 54% for
N and 56% for P205. Although some 517,000 TPY or 21% of the presently
installed capacity became available only during 1974, and has, therefore,
to be discounted, capacity utilization is nevertheless very low for the
various reasons described earlier (paras 3.01 and 3.02).
4.03      Starting from a low base, fertilizer production increased more than
fourfold during the last seven years (1966-1973) but it continues to fall short
of requirements. As a result, India still relies on imports, putting a lheavy
burden on its scarce foreign exchange resources. Imports nearly trebled during
1966-1973, reaching about 691,400 tons of N, 211,400 tons of P20s and 316,300
tons of K20 in 1973 with actual import cost in that year estimated at about
US$158 million; it is worth about US$435.0 million at present (May 1974) prices.
4.04      During 1966-1973, the consumption of N expanded at an annual rate
of 18.0%, while P205 and K20 consumption increased at a higher annual rate of
24% and 23% respectively from a low base. During that period, the average
annual rate of growth for all plant nutrients was 20%. In 1973, the total
consumption of plant nutrients reached nearly 2.7 million tons, of which
approximately 1.8 million tons (67%) was N, 0.6 million tons phosphate (22%)
and 0.3 million tons potash (11%).
4.05.     The proportion of N consumed is still far higher than that of P205
and K20 because of the immediate effect that nitrogenous fertilizers have
on the luxuriant growth of crops and their consequent popularity with farmers.
Ilowever, it has to be noted that the ratio of N:P205:K20 consumption has
improved from 16:2:1 in 1951 to about 6:2:1 in 1973, but it will take many
years to bring the ratio to 4:2:1 which is considered desirable for Indian
farm conditions. To achieve this balanced fertilization, complex (NPK)
fertilizers are gaining in importance. Trombay is one of the pioneering
fertilizer plants in India to produce complex fertilizers.
1/   Some figures thus differ slightly from those given in the Economic Report
(Report No. 402-IN dated 'lay 7, 1974) chapter on Fertilizers and Steel.

4.07      A joint Bank-GOI report 1/ forecast that the demand for N would
range between 4.0 million tons and 5.2 million tons by the end of the Fifth
Five-Year Plan in 1979. The level of 5.2 million tons now appears optimistic
considering more recent data which show a slower growth rate in consumption
in recent years because of delays in the build-up of domestic production
capability, and scarce and high-cost imports. The figure of 4.6 million tons
of N for 1979 given in the above table is the "median" of the "low" and the
"high" forecasts made in the report, and it appears to be a realistic projec-
tion. However, the N consumption in 1979 could be as low as 4.0 million tons
because of a probable continued shortfall in domestic production, continued
scarcity of fertilizers in world markets, strained availability of foreign ex-
change and agricultural credit, lack of irrigation and rainfall, and related
factors which are difficult to evaluate with a degree of certainty at this
time. Further, even if domestic nitrogenous fertilizer production is pretty
well on target, India's consumption needs beyond 4 million tons in 1979 will
have to be met from imports.

March 1972, based on 1959-1969 data.



- 14 -
4.08      There was only a marginal increase in fertilizer consumption during
1972-1974, primarily because of sharp increases in fertilizer prices and short-
ages in world supply. But for this abnormal situation, the 1974 consumption
could have reached 2,660,000 tons of N as forecast in mid-1973 by GOI. From
this level, according to the implicit assumption in the "median" of the Bank-
GOI forecasts for 1979 as well as 1984, the N consumption would grow at an
annual rate of 11.5% during the Fifth Plan and at a slower rate of 9% during
the Sixth Plan (1979-1984). Phosphate and potash consumption forecasts are
based on the continuation of the present nutrient balance of 6:2:1 until 1979
and the attainment of a better balance of 5:2:1 by 1984 compared to the gen-
erally recommended level of 4:2:1.
4.u9      Indian planners forecast in mid-1973 that the N consumption would
expand at an annual rate of 14% during the Fifth Plan, with the total consump-
tion reaching somewhat more than five million tons in 1979. They also pro-
jected that the P205 and K20 consumption would increase to nearly two million
tons and one million tons respectively by that year. Further, they forecast
that the N consumption would grow at the annual rate of 9.5% during 1979-1986,
with the total consumption reaching 9.6 million tons in 1986. Their corres-
ponding projections for P205 and K20 consumption for that year were 6.2 mil-
lion tons and 4.2 million tons, respectively. The Indian forecasts are based
on what now seems to be a rather optimistic assumption namely that the proj-
ects under construction and planning would be completed and commissioned on
schedule and these projects as well as the existing ones would operate at 90%
capacity by the end of the Sixth Plan (1984). However, indications are that
there will be delays in the commissioning of some of the projects and overall
capacity utilization may not be realized as envisaged. Because ot these and
other reasons already cited (para. 4.07), the projections by the Indian plan-
ers for fertilizer consumption are most likely to be underfulfilled, partic-
ularly if at the same time the shortage of imported fertilizers and their
high5 prices were to continue.
4.10      Although inter-country comparisons of fertilizer application rates
lmPve Lo be used with care because of differences in crops, soils, climate,
exteiit of irrigation and agricultural practices, prospects for potential
fertilizer consunption in India are good because the use of plant nutrients
per l,ectare of arable land is still low at about 16 kg compared to 45 kg in
tile U.S.S.R,, 60 kg in Romania, 81 kg in the U.S., 82 kg in Yugoslavia, 140
'   in Lgypt, 259 kg in Korea, 390 kg in Japan and 709 kg in the Netherlands. 1/
lainiy because of the low fertilizer consumption rate, per hectare yields
ir sdia are low as shown in the following table:

B.   Market for Trombay Production
4.11      The principal marketing area for Trombay is Maharashtra but its
products are also sold in a few nearby districts of Gujarat, Mysore, Andhra
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh States (Annex 4-2), where Trombay has a freight
advantage over its nearest competitors in Gujarat and Goa. Trombay is the
only producer of complex fertilizers in Maharashtra and its current produc-
tion capacity for various fertilizers is shown below:

81    36
/1   In 1973, Trombay produced about 70% of total
complex fertilizer output in the form of 15-15-15
grade NPK.
4.12      The Trombay plant is currently operating at about 90%O of attainable
capacity, but its production is not adequate to meet the demand in Maharashtra,
and this situation is likely to continue in the near future even with the
Trombay IV and V projects. This is shown in the following table prepared on
the basis of the "low" estimates in the joint Bank-GOI report cited earlier
(para 4.07):

/2   Trombay 36,000 tons and superphosphate producers 35,000 tons.
4.13      Most of the fertilizers in India are manufactured in the form of
straight N fertilizers (e.g. urea) and there is an obvious shortage of phos-
plhate which is often produced as part of nitrophosphate fertilizers as is done
in Trombay. The project will help increase Trombay's complex fertilizer ca-
pacity from about 330,000 to 685,000 TPY in terms of products. The grade pro-
posedfor production by Trombay IV is 21-21-0 NPK which is agronomically very
similar to the two grades, 20-20-0 and 28-28-0, already in use in India, but
the new product will have a higher phosphate water solubility (60% as compared
to 30-35% now produced at Trombay), helping farmers to obtain better results
from its application. Considering these factors, the project is not expected
to face any difficulties in marketing the new grade of NP fertilizer.
C.   Fertilizer Marketing
4.14      FCI has three marketing zones -- eastern, northern and south-western
-- with Trombay serving mainly the southl-western zone.  Each zonal division
of FCI is responsible for sales, promotion, and market research in its area
and all activities are coordinated by FCI's Director of tiarketing. Lach
division also handles transportation and distribution, dealer contacts as
well as farmer ecducation services including soil analyses, introduction of
new seeds and modern agronomic practices.
4.15      Fertilizer is generally sold through private dealers as well as
cooperatives which provide many services including credit. Credit is also
available from State and commercial banks for fertilizer. However, lack of
adequate credit could become a constraint in the future as fertilizer consump-
tioni increases and this matter will have to be kept under review.
4.16      Fertilizer prices for straight N products are statutorily controlled
in India. The last price revision took place in October 1973. For four years
prior to that, the Government had allowed no increases in these prices. Since
the last price revision, the prices of fuel oil and naphtha, the main raw ma-
terials for fertilizer in India, have risen sharply in the world. In the light
of this, although the Government is trying to control as far as possible the
prices of the major raw material inputs, another upward fertilizer price re-
vision is most likely to occur in the near future.



- 17 -
4.17      In the case of complex fertilizers, prices are not directly controlled
by GOI but it normally distributes sufficient quantities of imported complex
fertilizers through the Government Fertilizer Pool to insure that the pool pri-
ces are in effect the listed sales prices throughout the country. As domestic
production increases and imports decline, the Government may decide to estab-
lish more direct price controls for complex fertilizers as well. Assurances
were received from the Government that future fertilizer prices will be allowed
to reflect increases in production costs.
4.18      Typical sales prices for Trombay products after the 1973 revision
are shown below:
Retail Sales Prices /1
(per ton)
In Rs       In US$
Urea (46-0-0)                        1,050        140

15-15-15 NPK                         1,375        183
/1   Including excise duties, freight and dealers'
margin.
4.19      The prices shown in the above table are low compared to the present
abnormally high international fertilizer prices 1/ because of the worldwide
fertilizer shortages, high fuel and phosphate rock prices and the sharply
increased cost of fertilizer plants. However, the prices given in the table
are in line with the long-term prices for fertilizers as projected by the
Bank Group (Chapter VIII). It has to be noted that because of the present
acute shortage of fertilizers, Indian farmers in some cases are paying two
to three times the listed prices.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      As noted previously, the proposed credit consists of two parts:
(1) the Trombay Expansion Project; and (2) an operations improvement program
for FCI and FACT fertilizer plants in general. The two credit components
are described below.
1/   For example, the present (May 1974) import price for urea (c.i.f.,
Bombay Port) is about US$300 (Rs 2,250) per ton.



- 18 -
A.   Trombay Expansion Project
1.   Project Scope
5.02      The project will add 355,000 TPY of fertilizer capacity equivalent
to 75,000 TPY of nitrogen and 75,000 TPY of P205 in the form of the 21-21-0
grade nitrophosphate production (Annex 5-1).  Two large units are involved,
each one being of single-train Zodern design: (1) a 250,00-TPY nitric acid
plant, and (2) a 355,000-TPY nitrophosphate plant whicih would ut,lize nitric
acid to solubilize phosphate rock. The process is referred to as "nitrophos-
pliate technology" and is commonly used in Europe in producing phosphate fer-
tilizers. Offsite facilities to be added consist mainly of storage, utilities
and housing.
2.   Raw Mlaterials and Utilities
5.03      The principal raw materials to be used are ammonia, phosphate rock
and diammoniuni phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate (TSP).  The ammonia
requirements (about 100,000 TPY) will be rmiet from the new ammonia plant to be
established at Trombay as part of the Trombay V project which is to be carried
out concurrently with the expansion project (Trormbay IV) but will go into
operation about one vear later than Trombay IV. The Government has stated
that during the first year of operation in particular and in the subsequent
years until Trombay V reaches full production, the ammonia needs of the proj-
ect will be met from various local sources as well as imports, possibly from
Kuwait, Iran and Qatar to the extent necessary.
5.04      The proposed Trombay V project will be similar in size and product
mix to the Nangal (Expansion) project. Considering sharp increases in equip-
ment costs since 1973, Trombay V is likely to cost at least 30% more than
Nangal. It will have a 900 TPD (or 300,000 TPY) ammonia plant and a 860 TPD
(or 280,000 TPY) urea plant. The ammonia plant will have surplus product
available for sale, of which about one-third would be transferred to Trombay
IV to meet its entire ammonia needs. The ammonia plant will utilize residual
heavy fuel oil as a raw material to be received through the existing pipelines
to Trombay from the two adjacent refineries. According to latest indications,
preliminary engineering proposals for Trombay V are expected to be received
by June 1974. The financing arrangements include suppliers' credits from
Italy and Austria. Assurance on the availability of financing was given by
the Government and FCI and arrangements for project implementation were agreed
to, all stipulating that Trombay V will be completed by May 1, 1978.
5.05      India produces small quantities of phosphate rock in Rajasthan,
but meets most of its requirements for fertilizer production from imports.
As Rajasthan production increases, eventually all of Trombay's needs could
be met locally. However, for the purpose of this report, it is assumed that
all phosphate rock requirements (about 150,000 TPY) of Trombay's new nitro-
phosphate plant would be met from imports as supply from Rajasthan is not yet
assured. Nevertheless, with high rock prices and freight rates which together
have recently doubled the c.i.f. price of imported rock, the development



- 19 -
of the Rajasthan phosphate deposits has become even more urgent. Since Trombay
will be a natural recipient of Rajasthan rock, and a recent UNDP-financed study,
for which the Bank was Executing Agency, has demonstrated the feasibility of
a mine and beneficiation plant, the Government has told IDA that it intends to
proceed with execution of the Rajasthan project as rapidly as possible.
5.06      Trombay currently imports DAP for use in the production of the
15-15-15 grade NPK fertilizers. DAP as well as TSP are widely traded commod-
ities in the world, and no serious problem is foreseen in meeting the project's
relatively small requirements of about 44,000 TPY of DAP or TSP. According
to present plans, Trombay IV will be using locally-produced TSP.
5.07      Tata Power Company (generating capacity:  615 MW) currently supplies
40 MW to Trombay through a sub-station--located adjacent to the factory--
urhich has two 90 1'NA transformers.  Two additional transformers will be in-
stalled under the project whose power requirements are estimated at 9 tW; and
a new sub-station is expected to be established by Tata's, which has informed
FCI that it could meet fully the additional requirements of Trombay subject to
the approval of the Maharashtra State Government.  FCI, with the Government's
full support, has agreed to take prompt steps to obtain necessary action by the
State of .laharashtra in regard to electric power and water, and in regard to
pollution controls with the municipal authorities of Bombay, to enable the
full utilization of the facilities to be constructed at the Trombay Unit.
3.   Project Execution
5.08      FCI's difficulties in executing projects on time and within the
budget have been mentioned earlier (para. 3.01).  IDA's approach in financing
FCI projects has been concentrated on utilizing outside engineering companies
to supplement FCI staff in project execution. In the Gorakhpur project, FCI
used the services of Toyo (Japan); and Uhde (FRG) and Tecnimont (Italy) are
assisting FCI in the execution of the Nangal project. In Trombay IV, the
nitric acid plant contractor is Power-Gas (FRG) and the nitrophosphate plant
contractor is Uhde, both selected after international competition. FCI will
be the prime contractor and, through its Planning and Development (P&D)
Division and Trombay staff and the two engineering contractors, will--on the
basis of a detailed plan--share responsibility for engineering and procure-
ment of the entire project. The timing of project implementation is given
in Annex 5-1. The commissioning of the nitric acid and nitrophosphate plants
is planned for October 1976 and April 1977, respectively.
5.09      Trombay staff and local contractors will assist the foreign engineer-
ing firms in erection. FCI is to arrange the necessary expansion of utilities
and services, and nas prepared a Critical Path Schedule and a project imple-
mentation plan, including staff assignments. These were reviewed during nego-
tiations and FCI has agreed, appropriately supported by the Government, that
it will use its best efforts to carry out the project in accordance with the
implementation plan and the Critical Path Schedule.



- 20 -
5.10      Execution of the Trombay modernization program is the responsibility
of the Trombay staff with assistance from FCI's Planning and Development (P&D)
Division. For Trombay V as well, detailed technical work is to be carried
out by the P&D Division. These arrangements, together with advanced training
for selected managerial and technical Trombay personnel as envisaged under the
project, should ensure the capable execution of the large-scale expansion of
Trombay's capacity.
4.   Employment and Training
5.11      Trombay has a present staff of about 1,900 in manufacturing and about
500 in marketing. This personnel strength is high by international standards
but is reasonable in the context of employment practices in India. The proj-
ect will directly create about 440 additional jobs, while enabling Trombay to
better utilize the existing manpower. Indirect employment generation is pri-
marily limited to increased marketing activities. During construction, some
2,000 workers will be needed for a period of about two years. Management/
labor relations at Trombay are good and recent labor disputes have been settled.
Workers with industrial experience are available in the Bombay area and FCI has
a good training program to provide the specific skills needed in a modern chem-
ical factory. Under the project, 60 personnel of Trombay will be provided ad-
vanced training abroad under a program to be drawn up with the assistance of
Power Gas and Uhde.
5.   Ecology
5.12      The factory is located In the Bombay industrial zone.  The Trombay
township proper, adjacent to the factory, contains a population of about
10,000 people. Several potentially harmful waste materials and gases will
be produced by the project, including fluorides and nitrogen oxide. The
project scope provides for adequate equipment to control pollution (Annex 5-2)
and satisfactory arrangements regarding all aspects of environmental control
for inclusion in the detailed engineering of the project have been agreed.
It is difficult to separate the costs solely attributable to pollution control;
thev are estimated at approximately US$2 million, about 4% of total project
cost. FCI has also assured IDA that it will comply with the environmental
quality standards set by the Bombay Munnicipal Government and those specific-
ally agreed to for the engineering of the project will be strictly followed.
B.   Plant Operations Improvement Program
5.13      As noted above US$17 million of the proposed IDA credit will be used
to assist FCI and FACT in completing and commissioning some of their projects
presently under construction--with particular emphasis on those plants closest
to commissioning--and achieve in the shortest possible time high capacity
utilization in these plants as well as in units already operating. To this
end, the credit portion will be used to meet the foreign exchange costs of
critically--needed equipment, spare parts, consumable materials and technical
assistance



- 21 -
5.14      FCI and the Government has submitted an implementation plan which
is described in more detail in Annex 5-3 and which has been approved by the
Association. GOI will also obtain FACT's agreement to the plan and related
undertakings consistent with those reached with FCI. In brief the implementa-
tion procedures will involve:
(a) the establishment of a Coordination Group by June 30, 1974
including representatives of the Ministry of Petroleum and
Chemicals, FCI, FACT, and consultants as necessary, the latter
appointed in consultation with IDA;
(b) a preliminary review by the Coordination Group of the six
operating units of FCI and FACT (Gorakhpur, Namrup, Nangal,
Sindri, Trombay and Udyogamandal) and the four plants about
to be commissioned, (Barauni, Cochin, Durgapur and Namrup)
with a view to establishing priorities and constituting small
groups of specialists (including consultants as necessary)
to study the operations of each plant;
(c) the development of a detailed optimization program, including
estimated costs and benefits, for each plant for review by the
Coordination Group and IDA; this program is expected to be
developed by November 1974;
(d) a formal request to IDA for disbursements against a specific
list of goods and services to meet the foreign exchange costs
of the measures agreed upon. Disbursements are expected to
be completed by June 1976.
5.15      A list of the plants to be assisted and the items expected to be
financed under the plant operations improvement program is contained in
Annex 5-3. These are subject to change on the basis of the detailed
plant-by-plant optimization programs. This list indicates that the major part
of the funds would be needed to overcome technical difficulties in the three
FCI plants (Durgapur, Barauni and Namrup), and one FACT plant (Cochin I) which
are now undergoing trial operations or are about to be commissioned. Their
problems spring essentially from the facts that (i) their financing (bilateral
suppliers' credits) permitted only very limited choice of equipment and (ii)
the involvement of the process licensors was limited to specific process
considerations. Unlike the more recent IDA-financed projects, no engineering
firm had overall responsibility for the total project execution, including
design, engineering, procurement, construction, and performance guarantees.
The plants are based on similar designs and two of them (Durgapur and Cochin
I) are identical. The Durgapur plant, which is the farthest along, has never
been able to operate at more then 50-60% of capacity due to equipment limita-
tions, most of which could be overcome with the investment of about US$3 million,
as indicated in Annex 5-3, permitting attainment of at least 90% of capacity
utilization. The 60,000 tons of additional nitrogen which could be produced
each year from Durgapur alone would be worth US$15 million at projected 1978
prices or over US$30 million annually at current prices. Comparable costs
and benefits would be obtained at Cochin, Namrup and Barauni.

5.16      Discounting production losses due to power shortages (primarily at
Gorakhpur and Nangal; in the latter case this problem is being dealt with
through the on-going IDA credit) existing PCI plants achieved about 80% ca-
pacity utilization in 1974 as a result of recent investments and other meas-
ures. Therefore, these existing plants will absorb the smaller part of the
IDA funds available for the operations improvement program; most of the funds
are intended to be used for a trubo-alternator to provide captive power to
Gorakhpur (which lost 23,600 tons of nitrogen production over the last
year due to power shortages) and some equipment for the FACT plant at
Udyogamandal.
5.17      In view of the high priority being accorded to better utilization of
FCI's and FACT's fertilizer plants, the Government will make available any
additional funds that are needed to carry out the detailed optimization program
(para 5.14, c) expeditiously.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN

6.02      These estimates have been prepared on the basis of April 1974 costs
after reviews with the engineering firms selected to assist FCI.  Physical con-
tingencies provided are 15% of local and foreign erected plant costs. Price
escalations assume 15% annual increase in 1974 and 10% in 1975, for the foreign
costs, and 15% annual increase in 1974 and 1975'for local -nsts. Virtually all
supplies are expected to be ordered by the end of 1974. Price escalation was
detenrriined in consultation with several engineering contractors. With respect
to procurentent, 10% of the equipment in terms of cost is reserved for local
siippllers and will not be financed under the IDA Credit.  Indian suppliers
are expected to win about 20% of the remaining equipment to be bid interna-
tionally. The initial working capital requirements at start-up is estimated
to be Rs 20 million, including Rs 8 million for imported raw materials.
B.  -Financing Plan
6.03      Financing for the project would be provided as shown below:

6.04      The nortion of the proposed IDA Credit for Trombay IV (US$33 million)
will be onilent to FCI for 15 years, including 5 years' grace, at an annual in-
terest rate of 9.5%.  The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government.
GOI's equity contribution of nearly US$31 million equivalent will be indepen-
dent of the earnings capacity of the Trombay Unit or FCI as a whole. Any
additional funds needed for the timely completion of the modernization pro-
gram, the expansion projects (Trombay IV and V) and all other projects (para.
2.07) and the settlement of present litigation would be provided to FCI by
GOI on terms and conditions normally applicable within FCI's obligation to
IDA to maintain a debt/equity ratio of better than 50/50.
6.05      The portion of the proposed credit to be used BY fci and FACT for
plant operations improvement will be made available to the companies by the
Government against cash through the banking system (as is normal for the sale
of foreign exchange) with payments to be made by FCI and FACT in rupees out
of their own resources.

whose delivery is critical for process or schedule purposes, and (iii)
packages under US$50,000 equivalent. For the exceptions international
shopping will be used whenever possible and the amount is not expected
to total more than US$6 million. No local supplies are to be financed
by this part of the credit.
6.08      The IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:
For Trombay IV
(a) 100% of the total eligible expenditures (excluding taxes) for
equipment, materials, foreign freight and spares.
(b) 100% of the total expenditures (excluding taxes) for license
fees, design engineering, erection, commissioning, project
management and training.
For FCI and FACT Plant Operations Improvement

7.02      During 1974-1982, net sales are expected to increase by 156% to
Rs 938 million (US$125 million) and pre-tax profit by 143% to Rs 216 million
(US$28.8 million), reflecting the impact of the modernization and expansion
of the Trombay Unit. Projected improvements in sales and pre-tax profits in
1975 are due to higher prices and the greater capacity utilization forecast.
Income taxes for Trombay are difficult to predict since they are paid by FCI
only at the corporate level. FCI has not so far paid any income taxes due to
its overall low profits (Annex 2-7) as well as to tax holidays and exemptions
related to new and expansion projects. The Corporation is expected to continue
having substantial tax exemptions which are likely to exceed its tax liabilities
until at least 1979. However, taxes for purposes of the above table have been
assumed to be 50% of the pre-tax income of Trombay.



- 28 -
7.03      The Trombay modernization and expansion programs are being financed
on a sound basis, with the Unit as a whole forecast to have a debt/equity
ratio of 21/79 at the end of 1977 and a current ratio of at least 1.2:1 after
1974. The equity builds up significantly because of increased retained earn-
ings. Agreement was reached that Trombay's debt/equity ratio will not exceed
50/50 and the current ratio will be at least 1.2:1 at all times. Debt service
coverage would be more than satisfactory for the Trombay Unit after 1975.
However, it would be low in 1975 as it was in 1974.
7.04      Trombay V's projected impact on the Trombay Unit's financial position
and prospects is reflected in the table below. The financial covenants agreed
with FCI are designed to assure that Trombay V as well as all other new FCI
projects are carried out on a sound financial basis. Trombay V is estimated
to cost about US$150 million (Rs 1,125 million) to be financed by GOI half in
equity and half in loan with the equity to be invested first. The Trombay
Unit's revenue and net profits before taxes would increase by about Rs 250
and Rs 120 million respectively on account of the 232,000 tons of urea and
surplus ammonia forecast to be produced and sold from Trombay V at about 90%
capacity from 1981 onward.

B.   Project - Trombay IV
1.   Production, Prices and Sales Revenue
7.05      The project is forecast to produce in 1980--the first year of full
(90%) production --about 325,000 TPY of nitrophosphate (21-21-0 grade) and
179,000 TPY of nitric acid. Most of the nitric acid (141,700 TPY) will be
used internally by the project, while 27,100 TPY will be transferred to the
existing NPK plant of Trombay and another 10,000 TPY sold in the open market.



- 29 -
7.06      As mentioned current world market prices are abnormally high but
are expected to decline, possibly as early as 1977. Therefore, prices as
projected for 1978 have been used to value both fertilizer and its inputs.
On this basis, the ex-plant price for the 21-21-0 grade NPK is assumed to be
Rs 1,010/ton (USS135/ton). This is in line with the long-term fertilizer
price forecasts of the Bank Group.
7.07      The production build-up and income projections for the project are
shown below (Annexes 7-4 and 7-5):

7.08      Reveiue forecasts are based on a build-up of production in the
nitrophosphate plant from 50% of capacity in 1978, the first year of commer-
cial operation, to 90% of capacity in 1980 and thereafter; and in the nitric
acid plant, from 46% to 72% during the same period. Some reserve capacity
will be available in the nitric acid plant for future use by Trombay and
outside chemical plants as their requirements increase. With designs of
commercially proven efficiency, the performance guarantees by the engineering
contractors, assured supply of coal and power from nearby sources, and ammonia
and phosphate rock from Trombay V and established sources respectively, the



- 30 -
assumed capacity utilization for the project appears reasonable. The sales
revenue in 1980 from the project is forecast at about Rs 364 million (US$48.5
million), representing approximately 39% of the projected total revenue of
Rs 938 million for the Trombay Unit in the same year. The project is expected
to earn a profit before tax from the third year of operations, reaching a level
of about 11% of net sales by 1980. Debt service coverage is expected to exceed
1.3 times throughout the project life.
2.   Production Costs
7.09      Production costs are shown in more detail in Annex 7-6 and are
summarized below:
Trombay IV - Direct Production Cost /.
(Rs/ton of NP)
Production Cost       % of Total
Ammonia                                        283.5                 39.1
Triple Superphosphate                          141.0                 19.4
Phosphate Rock                                  167.0                23.0
Fuel Oil and Coal                               37.5                  5.2
Other Raw Materials and Supplies                58.0                  8.0
Utilities                                       27.5                  3.8
Labor                                            11.0                 1.5
Total                                      725.5               100.0
/1   At 90% capacity utilization and 1978 prices.  Excluding general overhead
expenses, depreciation, insurance and other operating expenses. Price
assumptions for inputs are given in Annex 8-1.
7.10      Import prices have been calculated based on Bank Group estimates of
1978 prices for imported materials and US$140 for ammonia from Trombay V based
on other Bank Group projects under study. Duties and taxes average about 20%
of the delivered cost of materials. Including these taxes, the costs of raw
materials, supplies and utilities constitute about 98.5% of the project's pro-
duction costs, with labor accounting for about 1.5%. The (incremental) labor
costs are low for the project, partly because of overstaffing in the existing
Trombay plants, and partly because many labor-intensive activities (e.g.,
repair shops and township facilities) are adequate and need, therefore, not
be expanded under the project. Assurances were provided that adequate quanti-
ties of all materials, including ammonia and phosphate rock, for the project
would be ensured through timely imports to the extent that local supplies
fall short.



- 31 -
3.   Financial Rate of Return
7.11      The project provides a pre-tax incremental financial rate of return
of 13.5%. Detailed assumptions are contained in Annex 8-1. Capital costs
used for the rate of return calculations include Rs 6 million (US$0.8 million)
for the construction of a housing colony for employees for the project.
7.12      Sensitivity tests have been conducted to determine the effects of
various events on the financial rate of return; the results are shown in
Annex 7-6 and are summarized below:
Trombay IV - Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Case                                                           %
1.     Base case                                             13.5
2.     Sales revenue decrease by 10%                          5.5
3.     Operating cost increase 10%                            7.8
4.     6-month project delay and 10% capital
cost overrun                                        11.4
5.     80% capacity utilization                              11.3
7.13      The rate of return is more sensitive to changes in sales revenue
than in operating and capital costs. It would drop to 5.5% if sales revenue
were to fall by 10%; and decline to 7.8% if operating costs were to increase
by 10%. Further, a six-month project delay, combined with a 10% capital cost
overrun and the eventual attainment of only 80% capacity utilization, would
reduce the financial rate of return to 9.2%. However, except for the overly
tight equipment supply situation worldwide that is affecting all fertilizer
plant construction proceeding at this time, the likelihood of this happening
is low, particularly in view of the involvement of outside engineering firms.
4.   Break-Even Point
7.14      The profit break-even point for the Trombay IV project in 1980 would
be 68%, and the cash break-even would be 54%. A break-even chart is provided
in Annex 7-7.
5.  Major Risks
7.15      The project design is based on modern commercially proven techno-
logy for economically efficient large-scale production, thus minimizing
technical and obsolescence risks in the project. Further, no commercial
risk is foreseen because: (1) the fertilizer grade (21:21:0) to be produced
by the project is very close to one of the popular grades (20:20:0) Trombay
is already selling; (2) fertilizers in general will continue to be in short
supply in India; and (3) Trombay's marketing system is well developed. The
operating and financial performance of Trombay has improved significantly,
especially since 1970, and this trend is projected to continue. Nevertheless,
it is conceivable that the project could be affected by delays in implementa-
tion and temporary difficulties in getting imported materials in adequate



- 32 -
quantities. As noted, the risk of project delays is reduced because of the
involvement of outside firms; however, it could increase significantly should
the period of equipment deliveries lengthen further, with a consequential
rise in project cost.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   World Fertilizer Prices
8.01      Future international fertilizer prices are difficult to determine
as they fluctuate over relatively short periods of time. Freight charges,
which constitute a major part of fertilizer costs, also vary widely. These
fluctuations, combined with continuing foreign exchange shortages, have made
it difficult for India to rely on imports to a major extent to meet the
growing demand for fertilizers. During 1969-1971, world fertilizer prices
were low due to over-supply. Beginning in 1972 and continuing to the present,
there are worldwide fertilizer shortages, and prices have increased sharply,
partly due to scarcity and partly due to price hikes of hydrocarbons and
phosphate rock, the major raw materials for fertilizer production.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The economic rate of return for the project (Trombay IV) is 16.3%
at 1978 constant prices (Annexes 8-1 and 8-2). The underlying price assump-
tions as given in those annexes are based on a Bank Group review, which
included many outside discussions, of future fertilizer prices in general.
The economic accounting price per ton (c.i.f., delivered Bombay Port and
including costs of handling and transportation to warehouses) used for bagged
21-21-0 grade nitrophsphate is US$130; for bagged triple superphosphate,
US$125; for ammonia, US$127; for phosphate rock, US$46; for fuel oil, US$54;
and for nitric acid, US$100. Duties and taxes are excluded from capital and
operating costs. No shadow wage rate has been used for labor because the
total wage bill as a percentage of production costs is very small (para. 7.10).
8.03      Sensitivity tests performed on the economic rate of return (Annex
8-2) show that a 10% drop in the nitrophosphate price reduces the economic
rate to 8.0%, while a 10% decrease in operating costs brings it to 21.4%.
The return is also sensitive to delays in project implementation, cost over-
runs and underutilization of capacity--common problems experienced by many
Indian fertilizer plants in the past. A six-month delay in project implemen-
tation combined with a 10% capital cost overrun and 80% capacity utilization
(as against 90% assumed) would drop the economic rate of return to about 13.0%,
still a satisfactory figure. Therefore, under moderately adverse conditions,
the project yields an acceptable rate of return.
C.   Supply of Fertilizer and Food
8.04      The project would augment the annual fertilizer supply capacity in
India by 355,000 TPY of product or 150,000 TPY of plant nutrients. Assuming



- 33 -
90% capacity utilization, the increased actual supply of plant nutrients would
be 135,000 TP¶Y. Under present farm conditions, a ton of plant nutrient helps
produce on average about 5 tons of foodgrains in India. 1/ Thus the annual
supply of plant nutrients from the project would help increase food produc-
tion in the country by about 700,000 TPY.
D.   Direct Foreign Exchange Savings
8.05      One of the most important benefits from the project is the annual
net direct foreign exchange saving to the economy after deducting the foreign
exchange components of operating and capital costs. As shown in Annex 8-3,
such net direct annual foreign exchange savings at the projected world prices
of 1978 would be about US$18 million annually after the project achieves full
production. Thus, the foreign exchange cost of the project--US$25 million--
would be more than covered in less than two years of operation of the project
at full production.
E.   External Economies
8.06      The project will have a surplus of 37,000 TPY of nitric acid
available for supply to other chemical plants. Of this, 27,000 TPY would go
to the existing NPK plant at Trombay, helping to increase its production by
41,000 TPY of fertilizers. The remaining 10,000 TPY would be sold in the
open market to meet part of the needs of the Indian chemical industry in
general.
F.   Use of Nitrophosphate Technology
8.07      The use of sulfur is common in the production of phosphate fertilizers,
but India has hardly any indigenous source of sulfur. With the use of nitro-
phosphate technology based on nitric acid instead of sulfuric acid, Trombay
IV would in effect overcome the need for about 54,000 TPY of imported sulfur
which at 1978 projected international prices of US$60/ton (c.i.f., Bombay
Port) would cost approximately US$3 million per year. However, it has to be
noted in this context that generally a nitrophosphate plant based on nitric
acid involves somewhat higher capital costs than one based on sulfuric acid.
G.   Impact of Plant Operations Improvement Program
8.08      Delays in the construction and commissioning of new plants result
in higher capital costs and outflow of foreign exchange on imports during
the intervening period. The plant operations improvement program will help
FCI and FACT in the earlier commissioning of their new fertilizer plants
as well as in the achievement of greater production in their existing units.
The economic impact of this on the economy is expected to be very significant--
though difficult to quantify--because of increased supply of fertilizers
1/   Under controlled conditions on the farmer's field, a ton of plant nutrient
applied to wheat and rice helps to produce 10-12 tons of grains.



- 34 -
within a short period of time. It is conse:rvatively estimated that the
program would help increase FCI and FACT annual capacity utilization by at
least 3-5Z during 1975-80, thus resulting in an average incremental annual
production of 60,000-90,000 tons of plant nutrients. Assuming that the
international price and direct production cost per ton of fertilizer nutrients
on an average are US$280 and US$120 respectively in 1978, the incremental
production would account for a net annual benefit of US$10-15 million to the
economy.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      During negotiations, the implementation plan for the proposed
ammonia/urea plant (Trombay V) was confirmed (para 5.04); and the follow-
ing principal agreements were obtained:
A.   From the Government that it will:
(i)  provide adequate funds to FCI to complete all its on-going
and new projects (para. 2.07 and 5.17);
(ii) allow FCI to observe certain financial covenants (para. 2.10);
(iii) not impair FCI's or Trombay's financial position while
settling payments under litigation (paras. 2.13 and 6.04);
(iv) not take any action which would preclude efficient fertilizer
manufactuers from meeting their expenses, servicing debt and
earning a reasonable return on invested capital out of revenues
(pars. 4.17);
(v)  assure adequate supplies of utilities and consumable
materials for the Trombay Unit (para. 5.03, 5.07 and 7.10);
(vi) take or cause to be taken all steps necessary to implement
the Plant Operations Improvement Program of FCI and FACT
(para. 5.13);
(vii) obtain agreements satisfactory to IDA from FACT to permit
FACT's inclusion in the Plant Operations Improvement Program
and have it carried and according to the implementation
Plan (para 5.14);
(viii) on-lend the Trombay IV portion of the Credit to FCI at 9.5%
(para. 6.04).
B.   From FCI that it will:
(1)  consult with IDA in making changes in Trombay's top management
(para. 2.11);



- 35 -
(ii) submit annual and quarterly reports (para. 2.19);
(iii) maintain a debt/equity ratio of not more than 50/50 and
a current ratio of not less than 1.2:1 (para. 7.03);
(iv) carry out the project according to the Critical Path
Schedule and the Implementation Plan (para. 5.09 and
5.14); and
(v) ensure satisfactory environmental protection (para. 5.07
and 5.12).
9.02      The foregoing agreements provide a sound basis for an IDA Credit
to GOI equivalent to US$50 million for 50 years, including a 10-year grace
period.

GLOSSARY OF TECT211CAL TiEPR31
1.        Following is a description ofi the technical terms used in this
report:
2.        Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements,
6 in large and the remainder in small or iacro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
axrgen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potasmium comprise the first six, and others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc,
iron, aluminium, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Carbon., hydrogen and
oxygen are readily available from the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium -- three main nutrients -_- ard the other elements
are drawn from the soil. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials
containing the three main nutrients, moil is soon dopleted of fertility by
cropping. Ue;e of organic materials such as animal and vegetable wast'es c&an
be utilized but the scale and intensity of modern agriculture have far exceeded
the availability of natural "fertilizers." Consequently, the tn'jority of the
world's primary plant nutrient needs are now suppzlied in the form of mara-
factured or "chemical" fertilizers. To an increasing degree, secondary
nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and micro nutrients such as
boron, zinc, copper and manganese are also added to soils along with the
primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by agronomists according to specific
crop and soil reeds.
3.        Chemi6al Fortilizers: Chemical compoundrs suitable as fertilizers
should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards and hand-
ling problems; and readily water soluble and availab'le to plant root syste=s.
Conxrcially available materials meeting these requirements to a large
degree are:
Primary Fertilizer Yiaterials
% of N                % of P20g                   % of K20
Nutrient               Nutrient                    Nutrient
Urea               46%     Triple Super-          PotassiUm Chloride   61%
Aunonium Nitrate   34.%      phosphate   46%    Potassium Sulfate   54%
Amonium Sulfate   21%      Single Super-
Diammonium                   phosphate   18%
Phosphate        18%     Diammoniuwi
Phosphate   46%
Because of the higlh nutrient content of urea, dia:mmonjum  phoaphate and
potassium chloride (Y-CL), they are soio* of the nOt posular fortilizer
materials in the world today. It ia the co=on ]-;zactice to report the
nutrient content of materials in ternr of percentgean of 1N and. P205
(phosphorus pentoxido) and potassium K20 (potacscum oxide).



ANNEX 1.
4.              ex or NFX Fertilizers: All three primazry nutrients (N,
P205, K20) are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios
varying with the nmtrient requirement3 of different crops. To facilitate
handling, the several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uni-
form granules for distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as
a ratio to describe the NPK product. Thus 15-15-:5 complex fertilizer
contains 15% each of N, P205, and K20; and 12-214-12 complex fertilizer
contains 12% 11, 24% P205 and 12% K20.
5.           Phosphate Water Solubility:  The agronomic availability (or
efficiency) of phosphate materials vary substantially. A common practice is
to use water solubility as a criterion although in acidic soils it is a less
significant factor.  Higher P205  water solubility permits the fertilizer to
be absorbed more rapidly. The minimum recommended in most cases is about
60% solubility but in some cases up to80-85% solubility is praferred.
6.          Ammonium Nitrate (AN) is produced by reacting ammonia with nitric
acid. Nitric acid (HN03), in turn, is made from ammonia (NH3). AN contains
34.51 nisrogen, half in the ammoonium form and half in the nitrCte form, and
is very hydroscopic.  It also is a commercial explosive.  i, many countries, a
diluent -- e.g. limestone -- is added to lower the analysis arid negate the
explosive properties as well as to minimize the hydroscopic properties.
7.        Nitrophosphatesare mixtures of ammonium phosphates, ammonium nitrate
and a small amount of dicalcium phosphate. Thus, they are combinations of con-
ventional fertilizer or salts and are not unique chemical compounds. They are
made by dissolving phosphate rock in nitric acid instead of sulfuric acid and
separating the undesired calcium as useful calcium nitrate crystals instead of
waste calcium sulfate (gypsum) prior to ammoniation. A more appropriate name
would be ammonium phosphate-nitrate instead of nitrophosphate which is mislead-
ing. Some earlier nitrophosphate (NP) processes made fertilizers with low
phosphate water-solubility that gave slower responses under certain soil and crop
conditions. Modern processess produce ammonium phosphate-nitrate mixtures with
P205 water solubilities of at least 80%. These give crop yields at least as
good as those obtained with ether nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and millions
of tons annually are produced and used in Europe. By-product calcium nitrate from
the NP plant can be converted to a solid prilled or granular product. Or, it can
be reacted with ammonia and carbon dioxide to produce ammonium nitrate (AN) and by-
product calcium carbonate. The AN is usually converted to solid granules or prills
containing 35% N, or combined with some by-product calcium carbonate beforehand to
produce fertilizers containing 26% to 33% N, as desired. The by-product calcium
carbonate can be used as a soil dressing, or as a "chemical chalk" in chemical and
cement production, or simply discarded. Throwing away unwanted calcium carbonate
compared to discarding gypsum from phosphate plants using sulfuric acid, represents
a much lower economic loss. The chalk represents merely unwanted calcium from the
phosphate rock and by-product carbon dioxide from the ammonia plant.
8.        Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) or chemically (NH14)2HPO4, is produced
by reacting NB3 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) followed by granulation and
drying.
9.        Partial Oxidation is a meth,d of producing hydrogen from hydro-
carbon fuels of almost any type by a ron-catalytic reaction with oxygen
followed by removal of the by-product, carbon rmonoxide.

10.      Feedstocks are the hydrocarbons used to produce hydrogen for the anionia
qntbesi8. Natural gas is usually the most economical choioe wben avallable. Otber
pst*tial feedstocks are naphtha, fuel oil, crude oil, coal or lignite

nds eof ca;";Aic acid; this compoud containS about lr6% N, all in the
ammonium form.  It is considerably, less hydroscopic than azmaonium nitrate
and it is the most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
12.        Urea Synthesis: Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon.
dioxide. Sin.ce both o°trhe materials are produced during the ammonia
synthesis, urea production is usually undertaken alongside an armonia plant.
sorlmnately, the corresponding acid of catbon dioxide (carbonic acid) de"
not form stable aownium salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phospheosic acids.
7hk*fore, simple neutralization as used in saking -sdIvm nitrate   S   -d
aqate fertilizers in not possible. Instead, ammsia and carbon dioxUd
are combined under heat and pressure to make aimonium carbomate ul-ich-
although umstable, can be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable
compound. Avaln.,wlnfortunatelv. the overall reaction is completely reversible
and even at 300 atmospheres pressure and 2000C, the conversion to urea in a
single pass through the reactor is under 7   . This introduces several
complications: high pressure rust be used to mai ize conversion; unconverted
reactants must be separated and recyc:led; incre_sed corrosion under the high
temperatures and pressures used must be overcoirR., and urea deconposition into
undesirable products must be minimized. In racent years, several engineering
and producing companies have developed ways of minmonaiting these problems,
and large p'lants capable of producing a thousand tons per day, or mLore, of
urea to rigid chemical and physical specifications are now operating success-
fully for long periods throughout the world.
Petroleum Units and Measures
13.       The petroleumn industry historically has used units of measure
based on the English measuring system. Conversion rates for same units
are given below:
1 barrel        = 42 US gallons;
US gallon     = 0.95 liters = 0.00095 M3;
1ton crude oil = 7.0 barrels (approximately, based on the crude
oil specific gravity); and
1 ton oil       = 1.25 13 of natu:ral gas (approximately, based
orn oil and gas compositions)
The conversion rates between vol-metric units, susch as gallons, and weights
are approximate since the specAfic gravity of the oil varies slightly with
its comrposition.
14.      Materials that Gxist in the form of gases, such as methane
(natural gas), are measured in volumetric unita.  Since gases are compressible,
standard conditions of temperature and pressure (00 C and 1.0 atmosphere )
are used to define the quantity (in volume) of gas, and designated as
"normal cubic meters" or "normal cubic feet."

ANNEX 2-1
INDIA: TROMBAY EXPANSION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF FERTILIZER CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)
A. Existing Operating Divisions of FCI
1.        FCI is the largest fertilizer company in India with five operating
units, plus the Planning and Development Division, which are described below.
Production capacities in these operating units as well as FCI's new projects
are summarized in Table 1. Historical performance of the operating divisions
is given in Annex 2-3. Capacity utilization has averaged about 70% for nitro-
gen and about 55% for phosphate over the past three years (1970-1973).  Gorakhpur
and Nangal have had relatively little difficulty (except recent power shortages)
and have consistently operated at high efficiency. Sindri and Namrup have
continuing operating problems and operate considerably below desirable levels
of capacity utilization. Trombay has showed good performance in recent years
with the net profit reaching about Rs 81 million (nearly US$11 million) in
1973.
2.        The overall performance of FCI has been relatively poor.  As indi-
cated above, the performance of its individual units vary widely for complex
reasons and these are discussed below.
Trombay (Maharashtra State)
3.        The existing Trombay plant has an annual design capacity of 240,000
tons of NPK fertilizer (15-15-15); 99,000 tons of urea; and 30,000 tons of
methanol. Intermediate products include ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric
acid. In addition, some minor quantities of industrial chemicals such as
argon, concentrated nitric acid, sodium nitrate and ammonium bicarbonate are
produced. The Trombay complex includes necessary facilities such as mainte-
nance shops, storage, utilities, offices and townships; it is near to the
Bombay port and has good rail and road connections. Present plant facilities
are described in detail in Annex 2-6.
Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh State)
4.        This plant, which produces urea only, began production in early
1968. Gorakhpur was financed with a Japanese credit plus funds from GOI and
was built by Toyo (Japan) at a total cost of about US$45 million. This cost is
considered high due to imbalances and excessive spare capacity of some equipment.
The plant units at Gorakhpur are ammonia and urea, with low-grade naphtha serving
as the feedstock. The ammonia plant is designed to have two streams, each with
a capacity of 175 TPD of ammonia. Partly because the plant uses electrically-
driven reciprocating compressors, it has a relatively high operating cost and
high dependence on outside power. The project operates well and can easily
exceed 100% of design capacity on a daily basis. Outpuu has been seriously
impaired by power supply problems; were the reliability of power supply to imprcve
in Uttar Pradesh, the performance of this plant should steadily increase.

5.        In January 1972,  IDA approved a US$10 million credit to Gorakhpur
to increase its capacity from 180,000 TPY to 314,000 TPY of urea by 1975.
Nangal (Punjab State)
6.        The Nangal plant produces heavy water and calcium-ammonium nitrate
(CAN) fertilizer containing 25% N, using a process involving intensive use of
power. Initial production began in 1961 with a rated capacity of 80,000 TPY
nitrogen. Power supply has been severely restricted, thus limiting production
to 60-70% of capacity.  Ammonia and urea capacity expansion is underway,
utilizing an IDA credit of US$58 million. Included in the expansion program
is a provision to reduce Nangal's heavy reliance on power by using a new
process in the old plant.
Namrup (Assam State)
7.        The Namrup factory produces urea and ammonium sulfate.  The plant
started commercial production in January 1969 but has not achieved full pro-
duction so far. The factory has small process units for ammonia, urea and
ammonium sulfate. A detailed evaluation of Namrup was not made but it is
doubtful if the existing facilities can ever be profitable without major
modifications. The plant is being expanded to produce 330,000 TPY of urea, with
the new units expected to go on stream in 1975. As the total market for ferti-
lizer in Assam is limited;most of the increased production must be shipped to
the neighboring States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
Sindri (Bihar State)
8.        The Sindri plant produces ammonium sulfate, urea and industrial
chemicals. Most of the existing production facilities are old and ineffi-
cient, involving high maintenance costs; and the plant has an excessively
high employment of about 8,000 persons. It operates at about 70% capacity,
with major causes for low capacity utilization being power and equipment failures;
and the high cost of gypsum feedstock for ammnonium sulfate is also responsible
for the plant's operating losses. Sindri's financial performance has deteriorated
sharply in recent years and it is a major reason for FCI's poor financial results.
A rationalization program is underway for additional production facilities for
phosphoric acid and triple superphosphate (TSP), and reduction in a-rnonium su-:>: 
production costs.  Possibly, some old facilities would be shut down after th,s p,or-i-n.
Following this, modernization and expansion of Siridri is envisaged. ID . is c.irert;
evaluating this project.
Planning and Development (P&D) Division (Bihar State)
9.        The P&D Division is the engineering and research and development arm
of FCI. It is located adjacent to the Sindri plant in Bihar. It has a total
staff of about 2,000 with about 700 engineers and designer-s working directly
on engineering, planning and technical service functions for FCI units. In
addition, the division develops and manufactures catalysts for use in ammonia
plants and has extensive pilot plant and research development facilities. The
catalyst manufacturing program is technically sound and some catalysts have



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
been sold for use in fertilizer plants in India. Over the next few years as
the catalyst consumption grows in the country, FCI catalyst production should
become profitable.
10.       The P&D Division has several license agreements with international
process engineering firms, the most notable being: Montecatini-Edison, Italy,
for ammonia and urea; Lurgi, Germany, for rectisol C02 removal; Shell, the
Netherlands, for fuel oil gasification; Koppers, Germany, for coal gasifica-
tion; and Nissan, Japan, for phosphoric acid. Licensing arrangements for
other process technology are obtained when needed for other projects. The
Division has developed its own process know-how for ammonium sulfate,
ammonia synthesis gas purification and some others. For all of the present
ammonia-urea plants under implementation, the Division has been responsible
for engineering, design and project schedule as well as procurement based on
process design packages from various licensors. Where suppliers' credits are
involved, the foreign process collaborator handles most procurement from out-
side India.
11.       Project implementation responsibilities under FCI are not clearly
defined and, as a result, the completion of a number of projects has been
delayed as long as three years. Except for the Nangal Expansion Project,
there is no one project manager with overall responsibility; instead, the
functions are divided between the general manager of a particular unit and
the P&D Division. Supervision of work at the site is the responsibility of
the General Manager of the unit. Although the P&D Division is responsible
for the project schedule, its completion time can be greatly affected by the
General Manager's staff. Communications from the Division headquarters at
Sindri are poor and procurement delays are inevitable. The Division could
function considerably better if its engineering operations are moved to a
major city like Bombay. Budget control is another critical area of split
responsibility with the P&D Division being responsible for design and pro-
curement and the management of the unit concerned being responsible for con-
struction costs. The Division appoints a project coordinator to supervise
project work and maintains liaison with project management. Major decisions
on design and procurement are made by a committee consisting of the top
management of the Division; as a result, the project coordinator does not have
full responsibility for project management. The general engineering capabi-
lities of the Division, however, are quite good. Typical design drawings and
specifications were reviewed for the several projects now in the design stage
and they appear to be satisfactory.
12.       The overall responsibility of the Division in executing the several
ammonia-urea projects is greater than heretofore generally recognized by the BalLk.
The responsibilities of the process licensors appear to include only the
initial process package, a limited amount of checking, and supply of construc-
tion and commissioning advisors. The guarantees offered are process guarantees
and are not likely to be enforceable to any significant degree. FCI as a whole
has total responsibility for project management, project schedule and budget.
13.       Project coordinators and newly-appointed General Managers are not
always experienced in the complex task of procuring adequate equipment,
materials and manpower required for the new projects involving heavy capital
investments. Furthermore, the expansion program of FCI has taxed management



ANIEX 2-1
Page)4
capabilities, especially of the middle management.  Causes for many delays
are outside the control of the P&D Division;  they include license restrictions,
suppliers' credit limitations and domestic difficulties with respect to coni-
munications, transport and fabrication. These probelms require more attention
in project implementation and more advanced planning than at present.
B. FCl's Expansion Program
14.      FCI will be one of the world's largest fertilizer producers after its
expansion program is completed in 1979.  It has nine major projects (including
three exparsions) under implementation at present. The capacities, costs and
expected commissioning dates are given in Table 1. All these projects are
being executed by the P&D Division of FCI with the assistance of various proc-
and engineering firms.
15.       Durgapur, Namrup (expansion) and Barauni are similar plants based on
process designs obtained from Montecatini-Edison (Italy), and include process
units for ammonia and urea. These projects are being financed with Italian
credits and funds from GOI. Haldia (capacity: 152,000 TPY of N and 75,000 TPY
of P205) will be producing both urea and nitrophosphates. The Sindri Rationali-
zation Project includes a triple superphosphate (TSP) unit and facilities for
sulfuric and phosphoric acid production. Haldia is the first of the fuel oil
based ammonia plants under construction with an ammonia plant capacity of 600 TPD
and facilities for the production of methanol. The ammonia is converted partly
to urea and is utilized partly for the production of nitrophosphates. The facili-
ties include a soda ash plant based on the use of by-product chalk. The knowhows
used are from Shell, Lurgi, Temnimont, Stamicarbon, Nissan and Polimex. The
project is scheduled for completion by 1977. Much of the engineering for it is
domestic, including a subcontract with FACT. GOI is providing all funds including
foreign exchange from Belgian and Bulgarian suppliers' credits.
16.      Talcher and Ramagundam as well as the Korba plant (under plannirg)
are large ammonia-urea units with ammonia to be produced by coal gasification.
Montecatini-Edison is the major engineering collaborator with additional
assistance from Koppers (Germany), Lurgi (Gernany), and Technoexpori; (Czecho:!ovas
Coal gasification is a relatively unproven techrnology in large comrnercial pi.gnts
and the projects are ambitious undertakings.  They are in the early decign st.a,¢e
and, because of anticipated design problems, are not expected to be cormplt`-J
befcre 1977.
17.       All the new projects would be financed about half by equity and half
debt. All expenses including interest during construction on new projects are
being capitalized so that FCYI's profit performance will not be affected by these
projects until production starts. Three projects under construction - Durgapur,
Namrup (expansion) and Barauni - have experienced about three-year delays in
implementation, primarily because of desing, procurement, and project management
problems. Work on the IDA-financed Gorakhpur and Nangal Expansion Projects
started in 1972 and 1973 respectively. Agreements on procurement between GOI and
IDA are designed to prevent delays on these projects.
C. FCI Board of Directors and 2lanagexment
18.       The FCI Board of Management is shown in Table 2.  Cf the total 13 meers,
six are from FCI, two from Government I'inistries, four from other public sectoj- enter-
prises and one retired head of a research institute.  Te influence of Gi      , n    cr
the I4inistries of Finance, anid Petroleum and Chemicals is felt very stronr   in
the FCI's management and operations.  The org-:nization chart of PCI is Riven
in AN1EX 2-2.

made for design deficiencies. Capacity for the NPK plant
depends on which product is being manufactured. For the
15-15-15 product, the design capacity is 240,000 TPY and attain-
able is 210,000 TPY. Or, for the 20-20-20 product, the attain-
able capacity is about 180,000 TPY.
2.        A general flow sheet of the complex is given in Figure 1.
3.        Raw materials and intermediates used are naphtha (for ammonia), phos-
phate rock, diammonium phosphate, potash, and sulfur.
4.        Production plants use commercially acceptable technology although they
are small by present standards. They have a staff of about 2,h00; their employ-
ment level is rather high. No significant labor problems have been experienced
at Trombay. Management is experienced and appears capable of implementing the
various projects and maintaining reasonable performance. Trombay was financed
by the United States (US AID funds) and built by two US firms; the Chemical
Construction Co. with responsibilities for the ammonia, urea, nitric acid and
sulfuric acid plants; and the C & I Girdler Corporation with responsibilities for
the methanol and nitrophosphate plants. Construction began in 1962 and the units
were commissioned in 1966. Because of the alleged design deficiencies, FCI is
sueing C & I Girdler's former parent organization, IDI Management Inc., and arbi-
tration is now proceeding through the International Chamber of Commerce.



ANNEX 2-6

5.        Arbitration involves both the methanol and nitrophosphate plants
supplied by C & I Girdler. Performance guarantees were allegedly not fulfilled
for either plant; in particular, the nitro-phosphate plant failed to produce even
at half of its rated capacity. FCI withheld the last payments due to C & I Girdler,
and initiated a claim for about US$21.8 million to fulfill the original
contract. (At that time, C & I Girdler consisted of two companies -- the Chemical
and Industrial Corporation, Cincinnati, Ohio, and the Girdler Corporation, Louis-
ville, Kentucky. These companies were merged in 1969, and then the new
company was purchased by the Bechtel Corporation, San Francisco, California,in
1972). FCI is also suing the Chemical Construction Co. for tax liabilities
amounting to US$ 1.1 million equivalent.
6.        A series of hearings by the International Chamber of Commerce have
been held in New Delhi and Geneva. As usual for a case such as this, it is
difficult to form an aocurate opinion of where the fault lies in the malperfor-
mance of the plants or even to predict when or how the arbitration will be settled.
Si,nce the sums of money being discussed are large, GOI should assure that any
adverse ruling against FCI would not adversely affect the financial viability of
the Company.
7.        As stated previously, the Trombay plant has experienced problems.
However, many of them have already been corrected and several modifications are
in progress or planned which should considerably improve the Trombay operation.
8.        Generally, the production efficiency has improved considerably from
the very low levels in the early years of operation. Current operational levels
in the urea'and NPK units depend on management decisions since insufficient ammonia
is available to run both units at maximum levels.
9.        The most significant factor for increased future production of ammonia,
urea, and methanol is the addition of a new reformer furnace for the methanol plant
and the addition of an ammonia storage tank (see Trombay Modernization Program,
Annex 2-6). The furnace and storage tank are under construction. After their
installation, the present reforming capacity from the methanol unit will be
diverted to the ammonia unit to produce additional ammonia (and C02) for the urea
and NPK plants.
Ammonia Unit
9.        The ammonia unit was designed and built by Chemical Construction
Company (the U.S.). The designed capacity is 350 TPD utilizing two streams of
175 TPD each. Naphtha and refinery gas were to be used in the partial oxidation
process. Naphtha is now used exclusively since the refinery gas could not be
used successfully due to its varying composition and supply. The naptha pumps
were not designed to supply the entire load.
10.       The operation based on refinery gas requires less oxygen than that
based on naphtha. The air separation plant also has problems, (para. 13) and the
diversion of refinery gas to the methanol unit has further limited the attainable
ammonia capacity. The maximum attainable capacity under present conditions is
considered to be 320 TPD for 300 days. Discounting any unforeseen difficulties,



ANNEX 2-6
Page 3
the staff at Trombay feel that the equivalent ammonia production can be maintained
at 96,000 TPY. Equivalent ammonia production is defined as the actual production
plus the production that could have been achieved from gas diverted to the methanol
unit.
2.1.      Once the new methanol reformer is operative, the attainable ammonia
production should increase by approximately 20,000 TPY. Therefore, by the latter
part of 1974, the ammonia unit should be producing at a rate of approximately
116,000 TPY.
12.       In addition to design deficiencies, many minor recurring problems have
limited the production rate in the past. Many of these have been solved and
others have been identified and corrective action begun. Individual parts of the
ammonia plant are discussed briefly below.
13.       Air Separation Unit:  Since more oxygen is required for naphtha than
refinery gas, the capacity is not enough for the naphtha-based operation.  There-
fore, the air separation unit even at capacity operation is a limiting factor on
ammonia production.
1h.       Gas Generation Section:  There are four Shell reactors with integral
waste heat boilers and a common steam drum for all the four. There is no standby
reactor. Under boiler inspection regulations, the four waste heat boilers and
one steam drum are treated as a single unit. Therefore, if one fails, all four
must be shut down and inspected. Naphtha pumps were not designed to supply the
full feedstock requirement since the specific gravity of the naphtha as received
is-less than the designed: 0.70 vs 0.76. As a result, the pumps are required to
run at excessive speeds, lowering their life and causing pressure fluctuations.
15.       The new reformer furnane being constructed for the methanol plant will
allow the present reforming capacity of the methanol plant to be used to generate
gas for increased ammonia production. Operation and maintenance of the naphtha
pumps will also be improved by the installation of larger motors.
16.       Carbon Monoxide Conversion Section: The design of this section is
generally good. There have been problems with the desuperheaters of the carbon
monoxide (CO) converters. The original design used a complicated concentric flow
arrangement. There were a number of problems such as extensive cracking on the
CO converter desuperheaters,and leaking tubes on the CO feed preheater.
17.       Purification (CO and C02 Removal) Section:  This section generally meets
the design conditions. There were several problems which have been or are being
solved. The monoethanolamine (NEA), caustic wash, and liquid nitrogen wash systems
in this section are free from problems.
18.       Ammonia Synthesis Section:  The operation of this section is satisfactory.
The design operating pressure in the synthesis loop is 365 kg/cm2. The actual
operating pressure is less than 300 kg/cm2.
Urea Unit
19.       The urea unit was designed and built by the Chemical Construction
Corporation. It has three streams of 100 TPD capacity each with a total annual
rated capacity of 99,000 tons. The unit has never operated at a consistently
high level due to lack of ammonia and carbon dioxide. During the past three years,



AN1TEX 2-6
Page 4
the unit has been operating on average at aLbout 60C of the rated capacity,
(see Table 1).
20.       In general, the synthesis section gives good performance.  However,
its primary problems have been with the ammonia charge pumps (total of six).
The ammonia and carbamate pumps are vertical, piston-type pumps. The shaft
speeds of both, especially the ammonia pumps, are excessive when compared to the
more modern horizontal pumps.
21.       There are problems even at the current rates (55,000 to 60,000 TPY)
of operation in the evaporation section. The second-stage evaporators are rotary
film evaporators operating under vacuum. The close clearances necessary for them
cannot be maintained. Also, because of steam pressure fluctuations, the proper
vacuum cannot be maintained. Therefore, the solution concentration cannot be kept
as high as is neoessary for good quality; as a result, excessive amounts of fines
are generated.
22.       Major causes for production losses have been: (1) Deficiencies in ammonia
charge pumps, carbamate recycle pumps, and the evaporator rotating system; (2)
ammonia and/or C02 limitation; and (3) lack of steam for the evaporator system.
Production losses because of the high pressure ammonia and carbamate pumps are higher
particularly, since all the pumps are Zully spared. Production leakages from the
ammonia pumps have decreased markedly during recent years. However, physical loss
of ammonia through the pumps continues to be a problem. Consequently, the ammonia
consumption per ton of urea is excessive: 0.661 ton in 1971 vs. the designed level
of o.580 ton.
23.       If the urea unit is to operate at higher levels of production,
replacement of one carbamate pump for each line with a new horizontal pump
is essential. One of the existing pumps could be removed to be used
for spare parts. One new ammonia pump should be installed on each line. The
synthesis section should produce from 100,000 to 105,000 TPY, with new pumps and no
limitation on ammonia supply. As production rates are further increased, the eva-
poration capacity will become a limiting factor. Therefore, replacement of the
rotary evaporators with one large falling film avaporator is recommended.
Complex Fertilizer (NPK Unit)
2h.       The Ni)K fertilizer plant was originally designed by Chemical and
Industrial Corporation (C & I) to produce 900 TPD of the 16-13-0 grade fertilizer
utilizing the carbo-nitric process and 1,100 TPD of the 13-13-0 grade fertilizer
utilizing the sulfo-nitric process. There are two reaction trains for acidulation
and ammoniation, four spherodizers for granulation, and four trains of screening
and recycle equipment.
25.       The original design was based on an assumption of 20¢ water in the slurry
fed to the spherodizers. Experience proved that a 20% water slurry was too viscous
to pump. Additional water was required which seriously affected the overall heat
balance. In addition, the design slurry temperature was 1000C. This temperature
limitation further adversely affected the process heat balance. The temparature and
which had to be increased to compensate for the lower temperature and higher water
content of the slurry. This higher temperature caused heavy scaling in the sphero-
dizers. For these and other reasons, the original processes have never operated
successfully. The water solubility of such products also was lower than desired.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 5
26.       In 1967, FCI modified the processes successfully with the use of
purchased diammoniun phosphate (DAP). In this process, phosphate rock is
acidulated with nitric acid and DAP is added to the acidulate. The slurry is
then carefully ammoniated in a series of reactors so that P205 from DAP reacts
with the free calcium nitrate to convert it into calcium phosphate. The excess
phosphoric acid, on ammoniation, forms water-soluble ammonium phosphate.
27.       The process, which has been patented, has the following advantages:
(1) It is possible to produce a slurry containing less than 2C0 water; (2) scale
formation in the spherodizers is much less because of lowered operating temperatures;
(3) raw material efficiencies are improved; and (4) the water-soluble P205 content
is 30% vs 1% for the original product.
28.       In addition to deficiencies in the original processes, there were also
problems with mechanical equipment which are too numerous to list here. However,
most of these have either been solved or would be solved under the Modernization
Program (Annex 2-7).
29.       The Modernization Program would give particular attention to three
major problems:
(1)   Inadequate screens:  The original screens were of the oscillating
type and were too small. New screens with adequate capacity
have been imported for installation;
(2)   Inadequate fume scrubbing:  As mentioned previously, there are
two reaction trains and four granulation trains is necessary
for producing 180,000 to 190,000 TPY of the 20-20-0 grade
fertilizer using four spherodizers. The fume scrubber system
for one reaction train operating at high rate is not adequate; and
(3)   Inadequate dust removal: The original dust removal system consisted
of bag filters. Due to the hydroscopicity of the dust, the filters
have never worked properly.
Methanol, Nitric Acid, and Sulfuric Acid Units
30.       The methanol unit was designed to produce 100 TPD or 30,000 TPY of
methanol. Attainable capacity is only 18,000 TPY at present because of inadequate
reformer capacity. Construction of a new reformer is in progress. When completed,
the methanol unit should be able to produce 35,000 to 37,000 TPY.
31.       FCI reports that both the sulfuric and nitric acid units operate well
and produce at designed capacity rates. Therefore, these units are not included
in the detailed analysis of Trombay facilities.

INDIA: TROMBAY EXPANSION PROJECT
TROMBAY MODERNIZATION PROGRAM V
1.        The large number of problems at Trombay in the early operating
years limited production capability and the subsequent process improvements
in the NPK plant caused a significant imbalance in ammonia supply and the
operating levels of several other plants. In 1968, Trombay began a program
to improve operations and supplement production by the addition of several
units. Major emphasis was placed on improving the NPK and ammonia plants,
and the overall maintenance.
2.        The NPK plant was adapted to a process developed by FCI to achieve
the present design capability of 240,000 TPY of 15-15-15 NPK with 30-35%
phosphate water solubility. This production level is a substantial improvement
on the original production. To achieve this production, Trombay makes use of
only half of the original reaction system; it also uses purchased diammonium
phosphate to blend in the process. These modifications have created surplus
capacity that will be utilized in the next phase of modernization as described
below.
3.        Trombay is now expanding the methanol plant to increase production
of methanol and indirectly ammonia. Even with this, there wiU be insufficient
ammonia available and, therefore, Trombay is installing a 15,000 TPY ammonia
storage tank to utilize purchased ammonia. The ammonia storage tank should be
completed soon. After that, there would be sufficient ammonia capacity to permit
all plants to operate at full capacity.
4.        Trombay is also building a 100-TPD phosphoric acid plant which is
expected to be commissioned in 1975. The existing sulfuric acid plant is no
longer needed for NPK production due to the process changes made by Trombay.
However, by utilizing this plant along with the new phosphoric acid plant,
Trombay can produce phosphoric acid to.replace the use of DAP in the NPK plant,
leading to improved operations and reduced costs.
5.        Trombay has also expanded operations to include the production of
several industrial chemicals, such as argon, concentrated nitric acid, sodium
nitrite, ammonium bicarbonate, and anhydrous ammonia and sulfuric acid for
industrial sales. These operations are small but profitable and will continue
to be expanded in the future as the market develops.
6.        There are some major phases of modernization that remain to be
implemented including:
(1) further NPK plant modernization and expansion to 330,000 TPY and
improvement of NPK quality to 60% phosphate water solubility;
(2) urea plant modernization and expansion to 129,000 TPY; and
(3) improvement in pollution control.
/ Excluding Trombay IV and V.



ANNEX 2-7
Page 2
These measures were identified as of major importance during an IDA mission in
1972, and the IDA consideration of the proposed expansion project was made
contingent on satisfactory progress in modernization as well as improved
overall profitability.
7.        Trombay has prepared project implementation plans including detailed
engineering for the modernization of above mentioned facilities and has
received GOI financing to begin procurement. With this advance work by
Trombay, the program should be completed in 24 months. Each part of the
modernization program is discussed below.
8.        NPK Plant Modernization and Expansion (to be canpleted by January
1975): The existing mPK plant has a spare reaction train. The modernization
and capacity expansion to 330,000 TPY of product will help utilize this train
and will also add two granulation lines similar to the four existing lines.
Trombay, using its own know-how plus consulting services of Uhde (who operates
similar plants in the Federal Republic of Ge--many) will incorporate substan-
tially larger and better equipment in the near facilities compared to the
existing plant. The proposed scheme will utilize the existing storage, bagging
and shipping facilities without expanding them. The additional nitric acid
required would be provided by the excess capacity envisaged in the proposed
IDA-assisted expansion project.
9.        The present plant produces 15-15-15 NPK with a P205 water solubility
of 30-35%. While Trombay is able to sell this grade, the Ministry of Agriculture
has generally recommended a minimum of 60C P205 water solubility. Trombay has
initiated a series of in-plant tests to evaluate increased addition of DAP (or
MAP or phosphoric acid) to either the reaction system or the granulation system
to increase water solubility.
10.       Urea Plant Modernization and Expansion (to be completed by February
1976): The existing urea plant can operate close to the design capacity of
99,000 TPY capacity when additional ammonia raw material is available. Further,
Trombay, in consultation with Technip, a French firm, has determined that the
urea capacity can be expanded to 129,000 TPY and the efficiency of the use of
raw materials and utilities can be improved with only a few equipment
modifications. Technip has submitted a preliminary proposal on this matter and
Trombay is now completing the design and cost estimates.
11.       Pollution Controls  Emission levels of S02, N02 and dust are
relatively high in the existing plants at Trombay and a small amount of flour-
ide gas is exhausted. Water effluent containing a minor amount of impurities
is discharged into a nearby stream and then into the bay.
12.       The NPK plant modernization and expansion will include better
designs for the scrubbing equipment to lower fluoride emissions and improve
dust recovery as product and thereby improve plant efficiencies as well as
the surrounding environment. The water effluent then would normally
contain no harmful impurities.



ANNEX 2-7
Page 3
13.       Trombay is investigating methods to lower S02 emission levels in
the existing sulfuric acid plant. There are two choices: (a) ammonia scrub-
bing to recover amMonium sUlfate; and (b) double absorption to recover more
sulfuric acid. Both methods are technically feasible but have to be evaluated
for the least cost method. GOI has approved the necessary capital expenditures
for this project.
14.       The existing nitric acid plant was designed with high emission levels
of nitrogen oxide of about 2,200 ppm. The plant has a combustion unit to
lower NO levels but it is inefficient. Trombay will evaluate the possibilities
of replaging the combustion or scrubbing with tie use of caustic soda to produce
sodium nitrite. This evaluation will not start until after the other modernization
works are underway.
15.       The emission levels of Trombay before and after the Modernization
Program will be:
Emission Levels
(Kg/day)
Before Modernization     After Modernization
S02              2,600                        30
NO2              1,000                        50
Flaorides           30                        12
The Bombay Municipal Corporation, in general, has not set emission standards
that can be used by Trombay in planning its environmental studies. However,
it has banned SO2 emissions from new plants which was instrumental particularly
for the cancellation of a major fertilizer project (Dharamsi Morarji).

INDIA: TROMBAY EXPANSION PROJECT
PRESENT SITUATION OF FACT
..        The Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd. (FACT), a public
sector organization like FCI, has its original plant located at Udyogamandal
near Cochin Port in Kerala State. The Udyogamandal plant has been in
operation for 26 years. Most of the equipment is worn out and obsolete,
needing replacement. To keep the plant in operating condition and safe-
guard the jobs of its 3,500 employees, FACT has undertaken a rationalization
program.  The plant has an installed capacity of 82,000 TPY of N and 36,000
TPY of P205 and produces fertilizer;; in the form of ammonium sulfate, ammonium
phosphate, ammonium chloride and sinigle superphosphate. In addition, it
produces other products such as sulfur dioxide, oleum, hydrated calcium
silicate, dry ice and synthetic cryolite. The capacity utilization in the
plant is low,e.g., 30% for N and 30% for P 0 in 1973 when the plant showed a
net loss of Rs 23 million (US$3.0 million3 gn sales of Rs 232 million (US$31
million). Apart from obsolete equipment, the main reasons for the poor
performance of the plant are: unreliable power supply, voltage drops and
power interruptions; low quality of phosphate rock used as a raw material;
neglect of plant maintenance; overstaffing; labor unrest; and delayed mangge-
ment response to solve problems because of internal dissension.
2.        FACT's problems at Udyogamandal have been compounded by difficulties
in commissioning its new ammonia-urea plant (Cochin I) which has been built
20 km from Udyogamandal with an installed capacity of 152,000 TPY of N in the
form of 330,000 TPY of urea. Work on Cochin I began in 1967 and the plant was
to be commissioned in mid-1971. Though the plant was mechanically complete in
December 1971, it could not go into commercial production
because of design and technical deficiencies and equipment failures. Defective
equipment includes particularly reformed gas boiler and waste heat recovery
system, high-pressure boiler feed water and circulation pumps, boiler feed
water heat exchangers, and the ammonia synthesis unit. As a result, the plant
has not yet been able to achieve uninterrupted production.
3.        On July 30, 1971, IDA provided US$20 million (Credit No. 264-IN) to
FACT for its Cochin II project which is being built adjacent to Cochin I with
an installed capacity of 485,,000 of granulated NPK (using 47,000 TPY of N,
115,OO0 TPY of P205 and 54,000 TPY of K20), and 7,500 TPY of cryolite (which
is used in the manufacture of aluminum). This project is based on imported
sulfur, ammonia, rock phosphate and potash, and is planned to use about one-
third of the urea from Cochin I. Cochin II was originally scheduled to be
completed by March 31, 1974 but has experienced delays of about one year
mainly because of labor strikes, which caused slippage in the civil works
schedule, and management problems. As a result, there has been a cost overrun
of about US$9 million equivalent from the original estimate of US$50.7 million.

FETILIZER SECTOR IN INDIA
A. Present Situation in India
1.        Consumption of fertilizers has been growing at a high rate and
reached about 2.7 million nutrient tons in 1973. The supply of ferti-
lizer materials is a major part o-f the agricultural program in India.
Currently, about half of the required nitrogen fertilizer is imported
but steps have been taken by GOI to increase domestic production.
Nitrogen is now produced in India primarily as ammonia and urea based pn
naphtha from imported petroleum feedstocks.  India has plans for incresed
reliance en fuel oil and indigenous coal as raw materials for ammonia
feedstocks.  Several plants have been sanctioned based on imported
ammonia but few such additional projects are expected.
Consumption of Primary Nutrients
2.        The following table shows consumption of the three primary
plant nutrients from 1955-1973:

3.        Consumption of nitrogen fertilizer increased fivefold, phosphate
fertilizer sevenfold, and potassium fertilizer ninefold during the last 10
years. While consumption of fertilizers grew substantially starting from
a low base, in recent years the growth rate has decreased. Optimum
nutrient ratios are functions of specific soils, crops and other con-
ditions. For India, advisable minimum nitrogen, phosphate and potash
ratio is 4:2:1. On this basis, the above table shows a need for higher
rates of growth of P205 and K20 consumption.

6.        The historical data show a considerable shortfall in production
of fertilizers necessitating large imports. Production improved somewhat in
the latter half of the 1960's when some fertilizer units, namely GSFC,
Coromandel, IEL, Delhi Cloth Mills Ltd., Trombay, Gorakhpur and Namrup were
commissioned. But despite these projects, the gap between production and
consumption has been steadily increasing.
7.        The product pattern of fertilizers in India has undergone a
significant change over the years. Tnitially, a substantial part of pro-
duction was low-analysis fertilizers containing only a single nutrient. The
following table shmfs end-product capacity of nitrogen fertilizers:

8.        Ammonium sulphate was formerly a substantial part of N productign
and reached 95% in 1956. However, its use is declining and this can be
expected to continue. Urea (which is now the most popular nitrogen ferti-
lizer) accounted for only 4% of total nitrogen capacity in 1961 but grew
to 64%   of the total in 1973, and its use may increase further in the
future.
9.        There has also been an appreciable expansion of phosphate and
complex (multi-nutrient) fertilizer capacity in recent years. Until 1961,
only about 2% of total nitrogen capacity was in the form of complex
fertilizers.  This rose to about 13% in 1966 and 14% in 1973, rising from
66,000 tons of N in 1966 to 282,5h0 tons of N in 1973. With the increasing
production of DAP and NPK fertilizers, there is relatively less production
of superphosphates. The trend for high-analysis fertilizers such as urea
and DAP should continue during the next several years.

11.        There were appreciable increases in imports of all three
nutrients from 1966. Maximum imports occurred in 1968 when about a
million tons of nitrogen fertilizers, 370,000 tons of P205 and 280,000
tons of K20 were imported. Although imports of nitrogen fertilizers
started declining from 1969, import levels during 1973 were still fairly
high, when 691,000 tons of N were imported. Regarding phosphatic fertilizers,
imports have been somewhat erratic over the years. There was a considerable
increase in 1968 and 1972 when substantial quantities of DAP/complex
fertilizers were imported.
World Comparison of Fertilizer Consumption

depending on availability of land resources and the intensity of
cropping, as shown by the following data from the FAO Annual Fertilizer

of rice and wheat,is a function of the fertilizer application rate. In
India, this is low and the above table indicates the scope for growth in
Indian fertilizer consumption.
B. Review of Market Forecasts for India
14.        Consumption of fertilizers in India, as previously stated,
has shown a rising trend over the years. Several atteFpts have been
miade by various agencies to estimate future fertilizer needs in. India.
Smrie of these estimates are given below:

15.       In general, the forecasts represent demand targetr rather than
consumption forecasts. Apparently no considerationwas given to the effects of
constraints such as supply, seeds, farmer education, water, credit and priaes.
Actual consumption, especially of N, has proved to be well below tbe forecaste.
16.       The projection considered to be the most reliable is the Donde-
Brown -oint IBRD/G0I study published in 1972.2/ This study was based on
detailed analysis of data, on a district-by-district basis, for the period
19'9-1969. The forecast technique involved primarily a trend projection
based on a five-year sliding average and quoting from that report,:
"Projections were based on a close examination of
the factors that influenced changes in sales during the
ten years up to 1968/69. During this period, demand
was influenced most oy the cultivator's previous gxperience
from the use of fertilizers (the learning process) and the
area irrigated and planted to selected crops known to have
consumed most of this material. These factors erplained
70 to 90 percent of the changes in demand. Other factors,
not measurable with the available data and assumed to be
important, included the availability and use of -agri-
cultural credit, market and transport facilities and
promotioral efforts.
"The above factors were used to project demand for
N plus P205 for each district after making appropriate
assumptions regarding changes in their growth rates.
Inherent in these assumptions were the investments needed
and time required to expand irrigation resources, develop
and adopt new technologies, increase the availability of
agricultural power and expand the agricultural .nput and
commodity marketing systems. It was assumed that cost/benefit

relationships would be about the same as observed during
1967 to 1969. In some districts assumptions included
improvements in agricultural credit and transportation
resources.1"2/
17.       The summary proJection from the Donde-Brown study is shown below
and compared       with actual results over 1970-1973:

1974        2.40    2.91          -            1.10    1.51          -
1979        h.00    5.16                       2.00    2.62          -
18.       Consumption of nitrogen during 1970-1973 is generally within the
forecast range, but on the low side. The very low 1973 figure can be
attributed mainly to a short-term lack of supplies since production fell far
short of targets and imports could not be made in time. The Nangal appraisal
report (IDA-46-IN) based   the nitrogen consumption forecast on the arith-
metic average of the low and high forecast of Donde-Brown, or 4.6 million
tons N in 1979. In view of recent consumption data, 4.6 million ton of N should be
consideredonly as a target for 1979 but actual consumption is not likely to
exceed the low forecast figure of 4.0 million.
19.       One of the major dangers in using the Donde-Brown forecast is that
one of its most important recommendations has not been followed, i.e.,
"It is suggested that these data be updated each year
and supplemented by additional information as needed to
continue the study of demand for fertilizers. Factors such
as multiple cropping and application of fertilizers to crops
not usually fertilized would change the values of independent
variables in the future. Particularly, a technological break-
Donde-Brown Study.



ANi Ex 4-1
Page 8
through in respect to paddy, pulses, oilseeds and
cotton among the specified crops would change the
projections, as the past influence for some of these
crops on fertilizer demand had been low or insignificant.
The dry farming program is yet another area which would
make a difference in future demand. Further studies
should concentrate on the farm business unit to determine
the factors influencing the cultivator's expenditures for
fertilizers. Also the role of agricultural credit, market
facilities, promotion activities, and transportation
resources may be delineated.  Assembling and ana.lzing the
data each year would provide guidance in achieving fer-
tilizer targets and plan objectives and would be most
rewarding for the future of Indian agriculture."ll
20.       GOI has now formulated its Fifth Plan (1975-1979) goals on the
basis of about 5 million ton N consumption. It should be apparent that the
target of 5 million is not going to be reached unless the recent trend
is quickly reversed. GOI should commission a continuing study of the
demand forecast including improvirg the Donde-Brown model to include other
variables. With a more realistic demand forecast, the planning for addi-
tional fertilizer capacity during the Fifth Plan could proceed onia more
orderly basis.  The production capacity now being discussed is 6.5-7.0
million tons N by 1979, but this level is also unlikely to be achieved.
C. Revised Market Forecast
21.       Considering all of the above factors, a revised forecast for
nitrogen and phosphate demand in India has been made. The nitrogen demand
projection up to 1979 is based on the median Donde-Brown estimate as given
in the Nangal report.  Beyond 1979 no projections are available but it is
assumed that the growth rate would decrease to an average of 9-lC% per year
compounded for nitrogen, reaching 6.4-7.0 million tons of N in 1984.
22.       The phosphate forecast fell far short of the projection and
substantially no progress was made toward achieving a 2:1 nutrient balance
for N and P205. The forecast in para 23 assumes a 3:1 balance as the probable
consumDtion ratio for 1974-1979 and a 2.5:1 target for 1984. This assumption
fits the actual data for 1970-1973 reasonably well.
23.      IWith these assumptions, the revised forecasts of probable consump-
tion and targets for planning purposes are given below:
1/ Donde-Brown Study.

24.       The somewhat arbitrary nature of the assumptions leading to these
forecasts is recognized but in the absence of any study to update the Donde-
3rown study, they are considered more realistic than the forecasts being used
by GOI. The demand target for 1974 and 1975 is unrealistically high in view
of lagging domestic production in 1973, 1974 and 1975, unless India can
import large quantities of fertilizer.
25.       The following tables give the median and low demand forecasts on
a regional basis for India. Figures for individual States are prorated
from the Donde-Brown report. The median forecast as shown in Tables 1 and
2 is then used in the subsequent tables to evaluate potential new projects
on a regional basis.
26.       The market forecasts given above are considered as realistically
attainable. They are, however, apparently far from the optimum demand to
produce total projected foodgrains requirements and to maximize farmers'
revenue. The demand should be higher if population, nutrition and optimum
use of area cropped are considered. The following indicative forecasts were
made in 1969 by the Fertilizer Association of India:

D. Nitrogen and Phosphate Production Forecasts
28.       The regional production forecasts for nitrogen and phosphate are
showni in Tables 3 and 4. The assunptions used in preparing the forecasts
are discussed below. Production figures for 1960-1973 are actual data from
Fertilizer Statistics of FAI and 1974 data are provisional estimates.
Production from existing plants after 1973 has been estimated at 70-950; of
design capacity depending on type and condition of the individual plants.
In recent years, production in public sector plants has averaged 60-70.' of
capacity but for several units, modernization programs are being implemented
so that a higher utilization factor is optimistic but achievable. A 90,
production estimate for the private sector is considered achievable based
on its operating performance.
29.       For most proJects under construction, production has been assumed at
50% of design capacity in the first operating year, 75% in the second year, and
°0A thereafter.  The three coal-based plants (Talcher, Ranagundam and Korba)
are assumed to achieve only 75% utilization in the second and subsequent
years.  Assumed new projects and commissioning dates are Bank staff estimates,
and do not necessarily agree with (OI estimates.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 11
30.       The projects designated as probable for the near future are in
various stages of planning. In most cases, project identity is not known, and
all assume 230,000 or 320,000 TPY of N capacity, It is assumed implementation
and operation will improve and in each case a three-year implementation period
will be followed by production at 75% capacity the first year and 90% the second
year and thereafter. The average capacity utilization assumed for 1974-1984
ranges from 70-87% largely depending on the nuimber of plants being commis-
sioned in any one year.
31.       Although capacity utilization has been low over the past few years,
experience varies widely and generally units operate well when timely
supplied with the necessary inputs such as raw materials and power.
With an expanding industry, limitations in infrastructure, however, are
becoming increasingly more common. Power is particularly critical. Nangal,
which uses a power-intensive process, is an unusual case in that its power
supply has been limited to about 60, of normal need.    Power rationing has
been threatened in several other states but has not so far been imposed.
Power interruptions are a major problem throughout the fertilizer indLstry
since even a brief low voltage supply can cause lengthy production losses.
Unless power supply and reliability is improved capacity utilization will
continue to be low.
32.       Labor unrest has been increasing in a number of plants and this
factor has lowered overall utilization by several percent although accurate
data are not available. This problem is compounded by overstaffing in most
plants and so far there is little indication that major corrective steps will
be taken.
33.       Feedstock supply has been a constraint in some cases and oroblems
are likely to increase in the future unless the refining capacity expansion
program achieves its Fifth Plan goals or large imports of naptha and crude
oil are permitted.
31h.      The 'ifth Plan should include an assessment of capacity utilization
and a development prograrm to eliminate problems and improve operations.
Failing this, the assumptions of capacity attainment made in this forecast
will prove to be high and forecast production goals would not be met.

INDIA: TRONBAY EXPANSION PROJECT
TROMBAY MARKET AND MARKETING SYSTEM
A. Status of Agriculture in Maharashtra
1.       The marketing area of Trombay is concentrated in the State of
Maharashtra. Principal crops grown are coarse foodgrains (jowar and
bajra) which form the staple food of the economically weaker section of
the country's population, and commercial crops such as cotton, groundnut
and sugarcane.
2.       Maharashtra has a total area of 30.8 million hectares, about
9.4% of India's total geographic area. Land utilization is about 60%
compared to about 40% for all India. The crop area represents 12 percent
of India's total cropped area. However, intensity of cropping is lower,
with only 4% of the total area sown more than once. The following table
gives details of land utilization in Maharashtra:

3.       Maharashtra has a semi-tropical climate with three distinct
seasons:
Rainy season - (June to September)
Winter season - (October to February)
Summer season - (March to May)
h.       Average rainfall is around 1,000 mm varying from about 800 mm in
Central Maharashtra to 2900 mm on the Konkan coast. In 17 out of 26 dis-
tricts, rainfall is more than 750 mm which is normally adequate to grow

most crops. Over 85% of the rainfall in most of the area occurs between
June and September and October to December. 'The distribution of rainfall
is given in the following table:

5.       However, several districts in Maharashtra experienced severe droughts
for the third straight year in 1972. The immediate effect has been to dis-
rupt the agricultural community, but the long-range effect with regard to
fertilizer consuwption is difficult to predict.
6.       The predominant soil type is black cotton soil which is well suited
for various crops like cotton, jowar and groundnut. On the western coast
and in the central plains, the soils are mildly acidic. In the rest of the
State,the soils are very mildly alkaline. In most parts of the State, the
soil is poor in phosphate and potash. The low acidity indicates phosphate
should be highly water soluble.
7.       Agriculture is based on rainfall and limited irrigation facili-
ties. Iith 22% of the net sown area irrigated in India. the corresponding
proportion in Maharashtra is only 8% or about 1.4 million hectares. The
potential for creating irrigation facilities is for another 2.1 million
hectares. A part of this, nearly one million hectares, could be exploited
by 1974 and the remaining by about 1981. The table below gives details of
irrigated areas and comparative figures for other States:

13.      Yield rates in Maharashtra are conparatively low for almost all
crops. There is considerable scope for improving agriculture through
larger use of fertilizers and other agricultural inputs. Efforts in this
direction are being made in two ways: (1) Bringing more area under high-
yielding variety programs;and (2) introducing dry farming practices on an
extensive scale through use of better inputs like fertilizers and improved
seeds even under dry conditions of cultivation.

14.      Most irrigated area under rice and wheat is already under the high-
yielding variety.  High-yielding variety practices have also been extended
to crops like jowar, bajra and maize.  The Government is introducing improved
practices in dry farming areas and for this purpose two districts have been
selected in Maharashtra.

15.      Yield rates for several major crops in India are conpared below
with several other countries. In most cases, India is well below the
highest producer but this usually can be attributed to especially intensi-
fied cropping techniques in other countries for specific crops. The data,
in general, though, show that substantially better yields can be achieved
in India.

D. Supply and Demand in Trombay Marketing Area
18.      As mentioned earlier, the marketing operation of the existing
plants of Trombay is largely confined to Maharashtra. The quantities that
are supplied to other States like Andhra Pradesh and Mysore are partly to
meet the existing obligations of the marketing units functioning there or
for meeting the seeding requirements of the Haldia Fertilizer Project (Went
Bengal) which will be producing similar products.

NOTE:  All India figures taken from Fertilizer Statistics, 1971-72.
Figures up to 1967 refer to distribution and from 1968 to 1972, to
consumption.
For Maharashtra,all figures referred above are consumption
figures.
Figures up to 1967 are taken from Donde/Brown report and
thereafter from Fertilizer Statistics, 1971-72.
12.      Various consumption estimates are available for future years with
regard to nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. Of these, the most thorcugh
one is that prepared by Donde and Brown, as a joint World Bank-GOI study.
Donde and Brown made projections Statewise for future years up to 1979,
based on historical data through 1969 and giving a high forecast and a low
forecast. Both the high and low levels of demand have been considered in
this analysis. The estimated consumption of N and P205 fertilizers in
Maharashtra for the years 1974 and 1979 according to Donde and Brown and
the pro-rata estimates for 1977 are given below:

22.      &xcluding Trombay, there are five other fertilizer plants in
Maharashtra which produce only phosphate fertilizers. Two more fertilizer
plants are expected to be established by 1979 when the total fertilizer
capacity in the State would be:

23.      Against an estimated "low" consumption of 417,000 tons of N and
241,000 tons of P205 in Maharashtra in 1979, the total capacity for produc-
tion in the State will only be about 372,000 tons of N and 175,000 tons of
P205. As normally these units on an average could be expected to produce
at about 90 percent of rated capacity, the likely production in 1979 is
about 335,000 tons of N and 158,000 tons of P205. Thus if only the realiz-
able capacity of Maharashtra units is accounted, the production
would be substantially less than demand, whereby despatches from units
situated outside the State or from imports would be necessary. The net
balance position would be:

E. Competitors Outside Maharashtra
24.      The main competing units operating in Trombay1s marketing area
are GSFC and Zuari Agro. GSFC, 400 km from Bombay, has been in produc-
tion since 1967. Zuari Agro, 750 km from Bombay, was commissioned in
1973. The estimated sales of various companies in Naharashtra in 1974
are:

25.      Other units outside Maharashtra are selling relatively small
quantities in Maharashtra since their principal marketing areas are their
respective States. The only expansion of any consequence that is expected
in these units by 1979 is that of Zuari Agro.  The rated capacity for the
two main competitors by 1979 will be:

26.      GSFC in 1974 marketed in Maharashtra only 5 percent
of its N production and no P 01.  It could be expected by 1979 to stop
completely its marketing in  2aharashtra as the market in Cukjarat increases.
Similarly, for Zuari Agro the economic marketing area is in Goa, 2ysore
and some southern districts of Maharashtra. Only relatively small
quantities offertilizers could be expected to be sold by this unit in
Maharashtra in 1979.
27.      However, to take into account the most adverse situation, it is
assumed that the demand for P205 in the State will first be met by the
straight P205 producers within the State and,in the case of the remaining
nutrients,both GSFC and Zuari Agro will also be marketing in Maharashtra
together with FCI Trombay on the basis of relative freight advantages.
The following are the assurptions with regard to share of each of these
major producers with regard to their N and P205 production:
a)   FCI's share of market will be 80% in the districts where
it has a freight advantage of Rs 10/ton or more over the
closest competitors;
b)  Where the freight advantage is more than Rs 5/ton but
less than Rs 10/ton, FCI's share will be 75%;
c)   Wherever freight advantage or disadvantage to FCI is
less than Rs 5/ton, 80% of the total market will be
shared by the competitors in proportion to their capa-
city of production;
d)   Where FCI's freight disadvantage exceeds Rs 5/ton but
less than Rs 10/ton, 75% of the market will be shared
by the competitor having most favorable location and the
remaining 25% will be shared by others along with FCI
in proportion to their capacity; and
e)   Where the freight disadvantage exceeds Rs 10/ton, 80%
of the market will be shared by the manufacturers located
most favorably and the remaining 20% by FCI and other
competitors in proportion to their capacity.
28.      The following table gives the historical distribution of Trombay's
production in different States during the years 1971 and 1973, and projec-
tions for 1979 based on the above analysis of freight cost advantages:

28.      There are a few districts in Oujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra
Pradesh and Mysore with favorable freight rates compared to some dis-
tricts of IMaharashtra, and FCI will maintain marketing organizations in
these districts to assure maximum flexibility and minimum freight costs
in marketing.
F. Credit
29.      Most farmers in India continue to be marginal or sub-marginal
and depend to a large extent on credit for purchase of fertilizers. It
is estimated that the credit requirement of farmers for purchase of
fertilizers would be about 70% of the total sale -value of fertilizers
in any particular year. The credit to farmers in Maharashtra is usually
advanced by Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies. About
25% of the credit advanced by Cooperatives is normaIly for fertilizers.
The following table gives the value of fertilizers sold in Maharashtra
for the years 1968 to 1971, the estimated requirement of credit of
farmers for purchase of fertilizers for those years, and the estimated
credit distributed by Primary Agricultural Societies for this purpose.

30.       Future requirements of credit in Maharashtra have been based on
the projections of fertilizer consumption given by Donde and Browr.  The
likely requirements of fertilizer credit for 1977 under the two sets of
projected consumption for N and P fertilizers are:

Total                  691          1,479           1,035

p           203           453              317
Total                  559          1,195             836
31.       The total estimated credit of  farmers would be of the order
of Rs 1,035 million at the higher estimate and Rs 836 million at the
lower estimate of consumption of N and P205 fertilizers by 1977.
32.       The entire farm credit is expected to be channelled through
cooperatives or through nationalized commercial banks. The nationalized
commercial banks have large expansion schemes for meeting rural credit
including that for fertilizers. Distribution credit would be met by the
Reserve Bank and apex cooperative institutions as far as the distribution
through cooperative channel is concerned. As cooperatives account for 50%
of the distribution, their requirement of credit for N and P205 fertilizers
is of the order of about Rs 300 million to 400 million in Maharashtra in
1977 which will be met from these sources. The private dealers will have
to depend on nationalized banks. The credit to dealers for fertilizers is
guaranteed by the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Corporation if the sale
of the dealer is within Rs 500,000. This would cover about 80% of the
fertilizer dealers in the country. On the whole, there should be little
difficulty with regard to farmers' credit as far as Trombay's marketing
area is concerned.
G.   Transportation
33.       The entire production of Trombay will be marketed within a freight
zone of Rs 32 per ton under the "high" projected demand by Donde and Brown.
In this case, urea would be marketed within a freight of Rs 23/ton and NPK
would be marketed within a freight of Rs 32/ton. For both urea and NPK
the average freight under the high demand forecast would be Rs 22/ton.
34.       If the low forecast is used as a basis, urea will be marketed
within a freight of Rs 24/ton and NPK within a freight of Rs 85/ton.  The
average freight in this case would be Rs 24/ton.

39.       During the peak period, i.e., in June, Trombay would need about 170
wagons per day for loading both urea and NPK. Trombay has already been
handling over 100 wagons on some days even at the present level Ci capacity
and production.

40.       With the Trombay Expansion Project (Trombay IV) going into
production, the proportion of quantity despatched by road is likely to
increase. It is estimated that despatches up to 200 km radius is
cheaper by road than rail. There are four districts in Maharashtra within
this distance from the Trombay factory and estimated sale in these
districts is given below:

Total Sales    84        158        242        79        123       202
41.       The total likely sales in these districts, it may be seen,
amount to 242,000 tons accounting for about 30% of total sales, if we
take the higher projected demand and 202,000 tons,accounting for 25%,
if we take the lower projection of demand. To this extent, the require-
ment of railway wagons is likely to be reduced. If the likely despatches
by road are also taken into account, the peak period requirement is likely
to be reduced from 170 per day mentioned to 120 or 130 per day.
42.       The expansion of existing railway facilities inside the unit has
been planned for in the project with additional tracks of about 4 km cover-
ing the new bagging plant and other areas. The interchange yard with rail-
ways ensuring direct reception and despatch of trains to and from FCI's siding
is also provided for in the project.
43.       The outward despatches by rail have to traverse through three
lines originating from Bombay, two of which are of the Central Railway and
the third of the Western Railway. The bulk of the despatches would be made
via two Central Railway routes, viz. Bombay-Manmad in the north-western
region and Bombay-Poona in the south-eastern region. About 88% of the
despatches would be made via the Central Railway route.

ANNTEX -1
INDIA: TROMBAY EXPANSION PROJEC'
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The Project is an expansion of the FCI's production facilities in
the Trombay Unit designed to increase the production capacity of nitric acid
by 250,000 tons per year and nitrophosphate fertilizers by 355,000 tons per
year including:
(i) Construction and commissioning of a single-train nitrophosphate
production plant with a capacity of 355,000 tons per year (1,200
TPD);
(ii) Construction and commissioning of a single-train nitric acid plant
with a capacity of 250,o0o tons per year (750 TPD);
(iii) A steam generation unit, cooling towers, bagging machine and
storage equipment, water treatment plant and miscellaneous equip-
ment for Trombay IV; and
(iv) Utilization of engineering services for procurement and erection
of equipment, materials and facilities for Trombay IV.
Nitric Acid Manufacture from Ammonia
Nitric acid production from ammonia takes place in two main stages -
conversion and oxidation-absorption. In the first stage, liquefied ammonia is
vaporized, mixed with the correct proportion of cleaned air and converted to
nitrous oxides by burning over an assembly of platinumrhodium alloy screens.
The nitrous oxides are converted to nitric oxides by tne appropriate admission
of air or oxygen and these gases absorbed by water in a tall column to produce
a nitric acid solution containing 57 to 60% HN03. The conversion reaction
produces much heat, which is used to raise steam for driving a turbine which
powers several gas compressors used in the process. After absorption of most
of the nitrogen oxides, process gas leaving the column is heated by transferring
heat, via a suitable exchanger, from other in-process gas and expanded in a gas
turbine to produce additional compressor power.
Nitraphosphate Manufacture
The nitrophosphate plant will produce 355,000 TPY of 21-21-0 grade
nitrophosphate from phosphate rock and nitire acid. The product will contain
75,000 TPY N and 75,000 TPY P205 (with at least 60% of the P205 in a water
soluble form). Phosphate rock containing about 35% P205 is digested with nitric
acid and ammoniated. Reaction products include phosphoric acid, ammonium phos-
phate, ammonium nitrate and calcium niurate. The reaction liquor is centrifuged
or filtered to remove insolubles and then chilled with brine to crystallize the
calcium nitrate (CN), which is separated by centrifuging or filteration. The
CN crystals are washed, melted and converted by reacting with ammonia and carbon
dioxide to ammonium nitrate plus precipitated chalk, which is filtered off and
can be used as outlined above.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 2
The ammonium nitrate liquor is utilized in existing Trombay facilities.
The highly concentrated solution is prilled by spraying from the top of a large
cylindrical tower and the solid spheres or prills cooled, coated with a moisture
resistant agent and bagged. The NP liquor, after removal of CN, is also evaporated,
prilled, cooled, treated and bagged. The NP product will contain about 21% N and
21% P205 but provision will be made to add a potassium salt at a future time to
make N-P-K grades. If desired, AN and NP liquors can be combined before prilling
to give different ratios of N and P205 in the NP product.
Raw Materials and Utilities
The principal raw materials to be used are ammonia, phosphate rock
and diammonium phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate (TSP). The ammonia
requirements (about 97,000 TPY) of the project will be met from the new
ammonia plant to be established at Trombay as part of the Trombay V develop-
ment program which is to be carried out simultaneously with the expansion
project (Trombay IV) but will go into operation about one year later (in 1979)
than Trombay IV. The Government has stated that during the first year of
operation in particular and in the subsequent years until Trombay V reaches full
production, the ammonia needs of the project will be met from various local
sources as well as imports possibly from Kuwait, Iran and Qatar to the extent
necessary.
The proposed Trombay V project will have a 900 TPD (or 300,000 TPY)
ammonia plant with surplus product available of which about 97,000 TPY to be
transferred to Trombay IV to meet its entire ammonia needs. The ammonia plant
will utilize heavy fuel oil as a raw material to be received through the
existing pipelines to Trombay from the two nearby refineries--Burmah Shell and
Esso.
India produces small quantities of phosphate rock in Rajasthan, but
meets most of its requirements for fertilizer production from imports. As
Rajasthan production increases, eventually all of Trombay's needs could be met
locally. However, for the purpose of this report, it is assumed that all
phosphate rock requirements (about 151,000 TPY) of Trombay's new nitrophosphate
plant would be met from imports as supply from Rajasthan is not assured.
Nevertheless, with high rock prices and freight rates which together have
recently more than doubled the c.i.f. prices of imported rock, the development
of the Rajasthan phosphate deposits has become even more urgent.
Trombay current imports DAP for use in the production of the 15-15-15
grade NPK fertilizers. DAP as well as TSP are widely traded commodities in the
world and no serious problem is foreseen in meeting the project's relatively
small requirements of about 44,,000 TPY of DAP or TSP. According to present
plans, Trombay IV will be using locally-produced TSP.
Tata Power Company (generating capacity: 615 MW) currently supplies
40 MW to Trombay through a sub-station--located adjacent to the factory-- which
has two 90 MVA transformers. Two additional transformers will be installed
under the project whose power requirements are estimated at 9 MW; and a new
sub-station is expected to be established by Tata which has informed FCI that
it could meet fully the additional requirements of Trombay subject to the
approval of the Maharashtra State Govermment. The provision of other services
such as water is not expected to pose any problems.

ANNEX 5-2
INDIA: TR(OBAY EXPANSION PROJECT
ECOLOGY
1.        There are several potentially harmful waste streams from the
Trombay expansion project inherent in the raw materials and technology
to be used. Phosphate rock contains about 3% fluorine, about 10% of which
is emitted as gaseous compounds during processing. This gas would be
processed and fluorine emission to the air would be limited to an acceptable
level of about 10 kg/day, comparable to standards in the U.S. Further,
there is a solid waste stream from limestone produced as a by-product of
phosphate rock processing. This material can be used in the cement industry
and sufficient market could be developed in the Bombay area to minimize
disposal problems.
2.        The nitric acid plant discharges nitrogen oxide gas as an effluent
and the emission level has been set at 200 ppm maximun, which is comparable
to the regulation now in force in the U.S. The Bombay City Corporation has
not officially set a limit on emissions but legislation is expected.
The proJect includes modern, efficiently-designed plants with modern po:llution
control equipment, thus minimizing the dangers,from harmful emissions.
3.        The total emissions at TrombayLeven after expansion would be at
an internationally acceptable level as shown below:

FCI
1.        The Fertilizer Corporation of India has at present in operation five
manufacturing units with a total installed capacity of 376 thousand tons of
nitrogen and 36 thousand tons of P205. These include the plants at Sindri,
Nangal, Trombay, Gorakhpur and Namrup with the installed capacities summarized
below:

3.        The following additional projects have been planned and work on them has
been or is being initiated by the Company. These projects would have a total
installed capacity of 873 thousand tons of nitrogen and 375 thousand tons of P205.

4.        The total capacity of 2,534 thousand tons of nitrogen and 660 thousand tons
of P205 in operation and in various stages of implementation would place strains on
the financial, managerial and technical resources of the Corporation. These strains
have been further accentuated by (a) the relatively low utilization of capacity
alre dy in operation, (b) the problems that have been faced in commissioning and
bringing to full utilization of capacity new projects like Durgapur, and (c) delays
that are occurring in completing the projects under implementation, especially
those nearing mechanical completion like Barauni and Namrup Expansion.
5.        The capacity utilization of the five manufacturing units in operation in
FCI during the last three years is summarized below:
(procdction in '000 tons of N)
1971/72            1972/73             1973/74

Trombay           81            66        84        70        86        65        80
Gorakhpur         80            76        95       69         86        64        80
Namrup            45            30        B         35        78        36        80
Tota          376                      77       8          75      286         76
The five operating units of FCI lost a total of 48.2 thousand tons of nitrogen due
to power cuts and fluctuations in the year 1973/74.  Allowing for this loss in pro-
duction, the overall utilization of capacity would be about 89 percent.  Nangal and
Gorakhpur accounted for the major loss in production due to power cuts and fluctua-
tions.
6.        Several steps have been initiated and implemented in the recent past to
improve the levels of capacity utilization in the five units. These are briefly
summarized below:
Sindri     1.  Installation of a supplementary naphtha gasification unit to
improve syn gas availability.
2. Installation of lean gas generators to release coke oven gas
for improving levels of production.



ANNEX 5-3
Page 3
3. Naphtha injection in the gas reformation section to
supplement gas availability.
4. Extensive renovation work in progress to achieve improved
stream factors.
5. A rationalization program to replace natural gypsum from
Rajasthan by Phosphogypsum.
6. A modernization program to replace existing coke/coke oven gas-
based ammonia facilities.
Nangal     1.  An expansion program is under implementation to replace
electrolytic hydrogen based ammonia.
Trombay    1. Extensive modifications/improvements to remove design/
engineering deficiencies.
2. Changeover of carbon dioxide recovery system from hot potash
to Benfield.
3. Installation of naphtha gasification unit which would
supplement gas availability for ammonia production.
4. Use of imported ammonia/ammonia from other domestic sources for
supplementing fertilizer production.
5. Debottlencking of the NPK and urea plants.
Gorakhpur  1.  Modifications have been or are being taken up to improve
plant reliability.
2. An expansion project is under implementation taking advantage
of available installed spares.
3. An in-plant power generation unit of 12.5 M capacity is
proposed to be installed to minimize losses due to power
interruptions.
Namrup     1. Based on plant operating experience, steps have been taken
to remove bottlenecks. There are still some problems in
maintaining sustained operation in the sulphuric acid and
ammonium sulphate plants. There is also a proposal to
introduce an LT conversion catalyst in the ammonia plant.
FACT
7.        The Fertilisers and Chemicals (Travancore) Ltd. has an operating unit
in Udyogamandal, Kerala, with an installed capacity of 82,000 tons of nitrogen.
The Company has also been commissioning the ammonia/urea complex at Cochin.
This plant, which faced considerable difficulties during the commissioning
period, is now operating at around 50% of the installed capacity. The Company
is also implementing a Cochin II project which would add to capacity by 40 thousand
tons of nitrogen and 114 thousand tons of P205. The Udyogamandal plant of FACT
has been operating at less than 50% of the installed capacity.

8.       The following steps have been taken to improve production:
(1) Installation of a spare phosphoric acid reactor.
(2) Installation of thickener for gypsum slurry used for ammonium
sulphate production.
(3) Modifications and improvements to economize on inputs by improving
efficiencies.
(4) Replacement of acid coolers, drying towers and absorption towers
in old sulphuric acid plants.
(5) Supplementing rock phosphate grinding facilities.
(6) Phosphoric acid concentration facilities.
Plan1t Being Commissioned
9.       The two public sector projects at Dargapur and Cochin faced considerable
difficulties and delays both in their completimn and their commissioning. These
two projects, which were mechanically completed in October 1971, have not yet
been stabilized for commercial production due to the various problems that were
encountered during commissianing. Failures occurred during comnissioning in the
various sections of the ammonia plant and it was not until late 1973 that the plants
could be brought to trial production. Even though these plants have operated
through short periods at around 50% of the rated capacity, it has still not been
possible to operate these plants at reasonable production levels on a sustained
basis. The FCI have entered into an agreement w:Lth Tecnimont for carrying our
an end-to-end technical survey of the Durgapur plant and recuimending improvements,
changes and modifications necessary to stabilize production. The recommendations
of the Tecnimont study would be available in about two months.
10.      The Barauni and Namrup expansion projects are nearing mechanical
completion and are due for commissioning during the year 1974L. These two projects
are based on technologies similar to those adopted in Durgapur and Cochin and have
also obtained the major equipment supplies from Italy. Special precautions are
therefore being taken to ensure that the problems encountered in commissioning
Durgapur/Cochin do not recur at Barauni/Aamrup. Already several modifications amd
changes which were required at Durgapur have been carried out at Barauni and Namrup.
Based on the findings of the Tecnimont end-to-end survey, at Dargapur, some further
changes may be considered desirable at Barauni/Namrp.
11.      The large number of projects under implementation by the Fertilizer
Corporation of India includes two major groups based on relatively newr technol-
ogies.  These are the projects for the production of ammonia based on coal
(Ramagundam, Talcher, Korba) and those based on heavy petroleum fractions (Haldia,
Nangal Expansion, Sindri Modemization, Trombay V). Special care is required in
the case of these projects to ensure technical reliability amd ease in com-
missioning. Special detailed studies on these aspects at this stage can



ANNEX 5-3
Page 5
identify likely difficulties and bring out changes or amendments necessary
to minimize delays and problems likely to be encountered during the commis-
sioning.
12.       Considering the importance of maximizing utilization of installed
capacity, expediting plants nearing completion and commissioning them with
speed, it is proposed to set up a Coordination Group with the following terms
of reference.
(a)  Review the progress and performance of the various FCI/FACT units.
(b)  Assess measures necessary to facilitate fuller utilization of
capacity.
(c)  Assess steps required to commission plants nearing completion and
bring them up to reasonable levels of production.
(d)  Assess the technological soundness of the process schemes and
equipment used in the projects and carry out changes and modifi-
cations required to improve reliability and ease of commissioning.
(e)  For the above purposes, have the necessary studies carried out by
FCI/FACT engaging where required consultants and/or specialists.
(f)  Assess the conclusions of such studies and, based on the assess-
ment, recommend schemes for modification involving additional
equipment and supplies, if necessary.
(g)  Monitor the progress of the various studies and modification
schemes and assess periodically the progress and results.
13.       The Coordination Group would have the following composition:
(i)  Adviser (Fertilizers) Covenor
Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals
(ii) Director, Projects (Mr. K. S. Sarma), Fertilizer Corporation of India
(iii) Group Manager, Planning and Process Design (Mr. D. G. Rao)
Planning and Development Division
Fertilizer Corporation of India
(iv) Gaeral Manager (Dr. K. S. Gill)
FACT EngiDeering Design Organization
Fertilisers and Chemicals (Travancore) Ltd.
The Group would be assisted as necessary by consultants who will be appointed
with the approval of IDA. The Coordination Group would carry out the responsi-
bilities indicated in the above terms of reference along the lines broadly
summarized below:
14.       Selection of a Consultant  Since the major areas in which the assistance
would be utilized relates to the commissioning of the newer projects and bringing
them up to fuller utilization of capacity, the FCI and the GOI would consult the
various engineering companies regarding a suitable specialist who has experience



ANNEX 5-3
Pa-ge Z_
with the commissioning of large fertilizer plants. The specialist so selected
would be appointed as consultant to the Coordination Group after approval by
IDA. He would be provided with necessary staff assistance by FCI.
15.       Studies Relating to Existing Operating Units  Dr. K. S. Gill of FACT
would carry out a detailed study of the steps that are required to be taken to
improve the utilization of capacity at Udyogamandal. He would be assisted in
this study by the technical staff of FEDO and the Udyogamandal unit. He could
also draw on the experience available with FCI in carrying out these studies. Mr. D.J.
Rao of FCI would carryout similar studies in relation to the five operating units
of FCI  He would be assisted in these studies by the technical staff of the
P&D Division and the individual operating units. These studies, as and when
they are ready, would be considered by the Coordination Group and recommendations
for remedial measures would be made to IDA and GOI.
16.       Studies Relating to Durgapur, Cochin, Namrup and Barauni Based on the
experience gained during the trial runs and commissioning of the Durgapur and Cochin
projects, the FCI and FACT engineers have identified several areas where modi-
fications and/or changes are necessary before plant operations can be stabilized.
As was mentioned earlier, FCI have also engaged Tecnimont to carry out an end-to-
end survey of the Durgapur plant. The studies would be started in June 1974 and
would take a period of about two months. The major areas of modifications/improve-
ments would be evolved keeping in view the findings of FCI/FACT and the recom-
mendations of Tecnimont. This would be done by the Coordination Group in consulta-
tion with IDA. In the case of Barauni and Namrup Expansion projects, the modifi-
cations would be carried out in two parts. Such of those changes as were necessary
during the commissioning of Durgapur and Cochin are already being implemented.
These would have to be carried forward and completed. In addition, when decisions
become available on the extent of further modifications to be carried out at
Durgapur and Cochin, these would be examined to determine the extent to which
bimilar changes should be carried out at Barauni and Namrup.
17.       Procurement Procedures for Equipmt and Materials  The Bank Group
Guidelines and the procurement schedule of the Trombay IV Project Agreement
would be followed. Wherever the items of supplies are in the nature of spares,
components or replacements, these would be obtained from the original suppliers
through direct negotiations. In the case of items available from a limited
number of qua:lified suppliers and for which timely delivery is critical, procurement
would be through international shopping with the approval of IDA. The Government
of India already has in operation a scheme for a revolving fund of Rs 5 million
available as free foreign exchange to cover the emergency requirements of the
fertilizer industry. Small items of supplies and services required by FCI and
FAfir¶ on ai emergency basis could be covered from the above fund initially, in
anticipation of IDA clearances and IDA reimbursement sought subsequently.  This
fund is operated by a group of three representing the Ministry of Petroleum
and Chemicals, the Department of Economic Affairs, and DGTD. Releases of foreign
exchange and clearances of foreign exchange can be processed under this scheme in a
few days after receipt of full details of the requirments.
18.       Estimated Time Schedule  The program may be implemented as per the
following indicative time schedule;
(i)  Formation of Coordination Group                   June 1974

B. Ocean Freight (C&F Cost): 10,% of the total cost (FOB) of imported
items. This amounts to Rs 11.0 million (equivalent to US$ 1.5 million).
C. Custom Duties:  40% of the total import cost (C&F) of imported items.
They total Rs 46.6 million (US$6.20 million equivalent).
D.  Sales Tax:  5% on the locally-supplied items.  This amounts to
Rs 2.3 million (equivalent to US$0.30 million).
E.  Inland Handling Cost:  2, of the total cost of equipment and spares.
This is estimated at about Rs 3.0 million (equivalent to US$0.40 million).
F. License Fee, Design, Engineering and Procurement Charges are estimated
at Rs 27 million (equivalent to US$3.6 million) broken down as follows:
Rs Million

H. Technical Assistance Cost for Project Management is based on the
assumption that four foreign experts would be required for 90 man-months
of service.  Foreign training for selected Trombay management and engi-
neering personnel will also be part of this program. The following table
shows details of the technical assistance costs:

I. Civil Works: The cost of civil works is estimated on the past experience
in India in building fertilizer plants.  The civil works cost on the nitrophos-
phate and nitric acid plants would be Rs 16.6 million and Rs 7.8 million
respectively. Such costs for other facilities of the project are estimated at
Rs 54 million.
J. Initial liorking Capital: The assumptions for calculating this are given in
Table 1.
K. Contingencies: A 5% physical contingency and 15% price contingency based on
the total project cost (excluding initial working capital) is provided for. The
large price contingency aims at adding escalation for possible price increases
during the delivery period.
L. Cost of Housing Colony: Included in the project cost is Rs 3 million
(equivalent to US$0.4 million) for a housing colony for employees of the Trombay
Expansion Project.

ANNEX 7-.
INDIA: TROMBAY EXPANSION PROJECT
PRODUCTION, RAW MATERIALS, UTILITIES, AND EMPLOYMENT
1.       The Trombay Expansion Project will have a design capacity of
355,000 TPY of nitrophosphate fertilizer equivalent to 75,000 TPY of nitrogen
and 75,000 TPY of P205 in the ratio of 21-21-0. In addition to the nitrophosphate
plant, the project will consist of a 250,000 TPY nitric acid plant which would
supply 141,700 TPY to the nitrophosphate plant, 27,100 TPY to the existing
nitrophosphate plant of Trombay and sell 10,000 TPY to outside
customers. The project also includes expansion of facilities for utilities
(i.e., steam and electricity) and product storage and handling.
2.       The project is based on ammonia, phosphate rock as well as the
phosphate product, TSP or DAP. The entire ammonia needs (97,100 TPY) would
be met by a new ammonia plant of Trombay which is scheduled to go into
production in 1979. The ammonia needs during the first 18 months of operation
of Trombay IV would be imported. As for phosphate rock, part of the needs
would be met from the UdA.pur mines and part of the requirements would be
imported. However, as the local production program is not certain, it is
assumed for the purpose of this report that all phosphate rock needed for the
project would be imported. The annual requirements of phosphate rock and TSP
(or DAP) are 151,200 TPY and 43,710 TPY respectively.
Nitrophosphate Plant
3.       The nitrophosphate plant would use nitric acid to react with phos-
phate rock to form the nitrophosphate fertilizer. The nitric acid would be
used in the place of sulfur (it is normally used in the world in producing
phosphate fertilizers), which is a scarce commodity in the world. However,
the calcium in the phosphate rock will not be removed directly; if left in
the product, it would result in low phosphate water solubility. The
calcium can be removed through an additional processing step using carbon
dioxide from the ammonia plant to react on calcium to produce calcium
carbonate which can be easily removed and discarded.
4.       After calcium removal, additional ammonia and a small amount of
supplemental ammonium phosphate would be added to yield the nitrophosphate
of 21-21-0 grade. The plant design would be flexible to add potash to the
product at a later time and also produce fertilizers in a wide range of
grades with different N, P205 and K20 ratios.
Raw Material and Product Movement
5.       After the expansion project is completed, Trombay inputs and output
would increase as follows:

X FCI intends to substitute coal for fuel oil.
6.        The solid raw materials are received through the Bombay Port and brought
to Trombay by rail over a distance of about 16 km. Fuel oil, coal and naphtha
are obtained from adjacent refineries and present no handling problems. The
phosphate rock handling facilities will be expanded including storage, conveying
and grinding facilities. Facilities in general are adequate to handle raw
material movements. Bags for fertilizers will be supplied locally.
7.        Product is transported from Trombay principally by rail.  Although
product movement by rail could be a problem because of wagon shortages, rail
companies have assured FCI that adequate facilities will be provided.
Utilities
8.        The expansion project requires only a marginal increase in utilities
but the timely supply could be critical, particularly of electricity. The addi-
I.ional utilities required are: (a) Power - 9MW to be purchased from the Tata Power
Co. which is capable of meeting this additional need. However, necessary trans-
forming equipment must be procured and installed which could take up to three years
unless the equipment is purchased from international sources; (b) water - 760 M3/Hr
(hL million gallons per day). The Maharashtra Government has made a commitment to
supply the additional requirements. As the water supply in Bombay as a whole is
being expanded, no major difficulty is foreseen; (c) steam - 70 tons per day.
Additional boiler capacity will be installed to provide sufficient steam for
Trombay. At present the steam capacity is limited.
EBRl2ent
7.        Trombay has a present staff of about 2,400 which appears somewhat
high. The expansion project should increase the staff by about 440 (20%)
and also enable Trombay to better utilize the existing employees.   Indirect

employment effects from the project are limited primarily to increased marketing
activities. Trombay's management appears to be capable and Trombay has experienced
no significant labor problems. Workers with industrial experience are available
and FCI has an excellent training program to provide the specific skills needed
to run a modem chemical factory.

Price Assumption
3.        As the prices of fertilizers and their main inputs have been
rising steeply since 1972 because of worldwide fertilizer shortages and
skyrocketing of prices of petroleum and phosphate rock - the main inputs
- the use of present world prices as economic accounting prices would be
misleading. The price situation with respect to the fertilizer sector is
expected to come to normal in 1978, when the fertilizer shortages are
expected to be overcome because of the current acceleration of investment
in the fertilizer industry. Oil prices are also expected to come to the

equilibrium level at that time because of the increased development of alter-
native sources of energy. However, FCI intends to use coal for Trombay IV.
Because of these factors, the projected 1978 prices are assumed to value out-
put and inputs as well as equipment and spares for the project.
4.        The econamic prices of 21-21-0 nitrophosphate and nitric acid,
the main outputs of the project, are difficult to determine as they are
not commonly traded items in the international market. However, an
attempt has been made to determine the economic price of nitrophosphate
on the basis of the long-term prices of urea (46-o-o nutrient content)
and diammoniuv  phosphate (18:46:0 nutrient content) which are assumed to
be US $110 and US $170 per ton (c.i.f. Bombay port) respectively on the
basis of a review of fertilizer prices by the Bank Group.Y On the basis
of urea and DAP prices, the price of the nitrophosphate (21-21-0 grade)
is calculated to be US $113 per ton (c.i.f.,Bombay port). To this, US $17
has been added to represent the bagging, handling and transportation
costs per ton (from the port to warehouses). Thus, the economic
accounting price for nitrophosphate is arrived at US $130 (Rs 975) per ton.
In the case of nitric acid, the transfer price at the Trombay unit is used
as an approximation to the international price (c.i.f. Troubay). The
following table compares the economic and financial prices used in the
rates of return calculations:
