GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Zaire has asked the Bank, the Libyan Arab Foreign
Bank and the European Investment Bank to assist in financing the expansion of
the copper-cobalt-zinc mining complex of the state-owned General des Carrieres
et des Mines (GECAMINES) located in southern Zaire (Shaba province).
ii.       This report appraises the proposed expansion project which will in-
crease the Company's annual production capacity from 470,000 to 590,000 tons
of copper and from 16,000 to 20,000 tons of cobalt. The project will produce
refined copper and a copper-cobalt alloy, and is expected to be completed in
early 1978. It includes development of two open pit mines; construction of
metallurgical and ancillary facilities; expansion of the industrial and ad-
ministrative infrastructure; and construction of housing and social facilities
for GECAMINES' personnel. Modern pollution control technology will be in-
corporated in the project and the Company has shown a positive attitude to-
wards furthering environmental protection.
iii.      The proposed Bank contribution of US$100 million for the project
would be the first Bank loan to Zaire and the first direct industrial loan to
a Zairian company. In the past, industrial lending in Zaire had been limited
to IDA credits channelled through SOFIDE, the Zairian Development Bank. At
the request of the Zairian Government, the Bank Group agreed to consider Bank
lending for this project, since: (a) the project will significantly increase
foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues; and (b) GECAMINES, the
Borrower, has been and is expected to remain a technically and financially
sound enterprise. The Bank loan would be subject to a special repayment and
security mechanism whereby part of GECAMINES' mineral sales receipts would be
deposited in a trust fund in a bank outside Zaire to service the loans.
iv.       The Company was formed in 1967, following nationalization of Union
Miniere du Haut-Katanga (UMHK), whose mining activities date back to 1906.
The compensation question has been settled and Societe Generale des Minerais,
UMHKst former parent company in Belgium, continues to cooperate with GECAMINES
under a technical assistance agreement. GECAMINES has maintained its strong
technical management while increasing the proportion of Zairian staff from
20% in 1967 to 38% in 1973. Production performance has been good with an
increase of nearly 44% in output since 1967. The operations -- located within
an 18,000 km2 concession -- include complete production facilities from mining
to refining. Presently one-half the copper, 65% of the cobalt, and 85% of the
zinc, are refined in Zaire, with the balance of the copper and cobalt treated
on a toll basis by SGM's subsidiaries in Belgium.
v.        Zaire is a member of the Conseil Intergouvernemental des Pays Expor-
tateurs de Cuivre (CIPEC) and accounts for about 7% of the world's published
proven copper reserves; 8% of its mine production; 3% of world refining and



- ii -
12.5% of global net copper exports. GECAMINES' traditional market for refined
and blister copper has been Continental Europe which is expected to continue
consuming about 90% of the Company's output. GECAMINES has a strong market
position and is not likely to encounter any difficulties in marketing its
expanded production. However, the copper market is characterized by con-
siderable price instability which could have serious repercussions for
GECAMINES profits and Zaire's export earnings and tax revenues. After a
recent period of very high prices, reaching US$1.52 per lb. in early 1974,
the copper price has dropped in recent months to below US$0.60/lb., with a
temporary oversupply situation created by a drop in demand as a result of
the rapid slowdown of world economic growth. The CIPEC countries in November
1974 called for action to halt the decline in prices and agreed to temporarily
reduce their copper exports by 10%. Some of the major US and Canadian
companies have similarly cut back production. The projected supply and
demand structure until 1980 indicates that there may be the possibility of
a slight oversupply in copper, if industrial activities in the developed
countries continue at a slower pace than in the recent past, and thus re-
sult in a price drop in real terms. For the purpose of this report, a
London Metal Exchange (LME) price of US$0.73/lb of copper has been assumed
in 1975, increasing by 4-5% per annum thereafter in current terms.
vi.       In the past, Zaire has dominated the cobalt market accounting for
61% of world production and 72% of world net exports. Major consuming coun-
tries are the USA, Japan and Germany, with whom Zaire has traditionally
coordinated trading and pricing policies. Cobalt prices have been adjusted
periodically to reflect cost increases. A substantial change of the cobalt
market structure is expected after 1980, when production from deep sea nodules
may be expected to commence. By 1985, Zaire's market share may decline to not
more than 30%, accompanied by a drop in real cobalt prices by about 32% below
the 1974/75 level. In July 1974 the Government has formed a Zairian marketing
organization--Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation des Minerais (SOZACOM)--
which in the future will undertake the marketing of GECAMINES' products.
SGM is providing technical assistance to ensure an adequate and gradual trans-
fer of know-how and marketing responsibility to SOZACOM.
vii.      Financing required for the expansion including incremental working
capital and interest during construction is estimated at Z 230 million
(US$460 million), 70% of which is in foreign exchange. It is envisaged that
the total be met by US$240 million from GECAMINES' internally generated funds,
a Bank loan of US$100 million, and loans of Libyan Dinars 30 million (US$100
million) and US$20 million respectively from the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank
(LAFB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB)--with whom the Bank's appraisal
has been closely coordinated. GECAMINES would thus make a major contribution,
providing 52% of the financing required. All loans would be for 15 years
including a 4-year grace period with the IERD loan and the LAFB loan bearing
an interest rate of 8% plus a 2% guarantee fee payable to the Zairian Gov-
ernment, and the EIB loan carrying 10-1/2% interest. The Government would
provide any additional financing that might be needed for project completion.



- iii -
viii.     All loan financed items (equipment, installation, construction, and
engineering services) will be procured according to Bank Guidelines and fi-
nanced under joint financing arrangements between IBRD, LAFB and EIB. The
Bank will make loan funds available towards 10 plant units, a construction
contract, an engineering contract, and 22 equipment packages, thus providing
31% of the project's foreign exchange requirements.
ix.       The project has been designed by the Company's Engineering Depart-
ment, with assistance from OUTOKUMPO OY, the Finnish developer of the flash
smelter process, and LURGI, the German developer of the coal gasification
process, the two most crucial segments of the project. Overall responsibility
for project management will rest with GECAMINES. A project management team
has been created which is headed by an experienced engineer who was in charge
of the successful implementation of GECAMINES' First Expansion Program (1970-
74). GECAMINES also has recourse, under the Technical Assistance contract, to
SGM for any specialized studies, short-term personnel needs, or supplier con-
trol it may require. GECAMINES has considerable operating and planning ex-
pertise, and is well qualified to direct and supervise the expansion project.
Adequate arrangements have been made for recruiting and training the additional
2,000 workers and 250 technicians required for the project with major effort
given to the training of Zairian personnel.
x.        The project has an estimated financial rate of return of 21%,
assuming a copper price of US$0.73/lb in 1975 and an increase by 4% in 1976
and 5% per annum thereafter, thus implying a price drop in real terms of
3 to 4% per year. Projected operating costs of the expansion project will
be 8-12% lower than those in the existing installations, further improving
the Company's competitive position. GECAMINES' projected longer-term per-
formance is strong with the debt/equity ratio reaching its peak of 20:80
in 1977/78, and debt service being amply covered throughout the forecast
period. It is also expected that GECAMINES' comparatively low production
costs make it less susceptible to price drops than many other copper producers.
xi.       The Company plays a major role in the Zairian economy, accounting
in 1973 for 55% of the country's tax revenues and 48% of Zaire's net foreign
exchange earnings. Thus, the expansion project, designed to increase the
Company's output by 20%, will be an important factor in the country's future
economic growth. Net foreign exchange benefits accruing to Zaire through
the project have been estimated at US$160 million per annum, while the
Government's revenues from tax receipts and dividends resulting from the
project over the 1974-88 period average US$60 million per annum. The
project's economic importance is illustrated by the rate of return of 28%.
This rate is unlikely to drop below 10% even under extreme conditions.
xii.      However, the project also has risks, the major one being the un-
certain future development of copper prices. In the short run, downward
price fluctuations could reduce GECAMINES' ability to generate internally
sufficient cash for the project, but probably not to the point of requiring
additional loan or equity funds from the Government. Even assuming that in
addition to a 10% production cut-back in 1975, a price decline by 7% in both



- iv -
1975 and 1976 would occur, the Company would still be expected to make its
financing contribution to the project. In the medium term, a possible over-
supply in the copper market towards the end of this decade could lead to
price declines below the projected prices. However, such price declines over
any extended period of time are highly unlikely since they would force
some existing mines out of production and discourage additions to capacity.
This would tend to bring demand and supply into balance again and move up
prices. Since GECAMINES is a low cost producer by world standards, in part
due to its high grade copper, and has relatively little debt, the Company
should feel any financial pressures much less seriously than many other
copper producers against which it is competing.
xiii.     Based on the agreements reached, as outlined in the last Chapter
of this report, the project is suitable for an IBRD loan equivalent to
US$100 million.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Zaire and Generale des Carrieres et des Mines du
Zaire (GECAMINES), a State-owned mining company, have asked the Bank for a
loan of US$100 million equivalent to help finance the expansion of the Comr
pany's copper and cobalt mining, concentrating and refining facilities in
Kolwezi (Shaba Province), about 200 km northwest of Lubumbashi (Map IBRD
11156).  The project is designed to increase GECAMINES' annual production
capacities from 470,000 to 590,000 tons of copper and from 16,000 to about
20,000 tons of cobalt by opening two open-pit mines, constructing a new con-
centrator, flash smelter and refining plant and enlarging the existing infra-
structure, administrative and social facilities. The project, whose execu-
tion is about to start, is expected to cost US$435 million equivalent. All
project components are scheduled to be in operation by January 1978. A sum-
mary of technical terms may be found in Annex 1.
1.02      The Bank's appraisal demonstrates the technical, financial and eco-
nomic viability of the project and the sponsoring Company. The project has
high priority for the economy of Zaire, for which an increase in mining
activities -- particularly of existing mining operations -- represents in
the medium-term the fastest way of increasing foreign exchange earnings and
raising government revenues. Bank participation is assisting in improving
project management arrangements and in coordinating the needed loan financing
of US$220 million to be contributed by the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (LAFB),
the European Investment Bank (EIB) and IBRD for equipment and services,
all to be procured by international competitive bidding according to Bank
procedures. The remainder of the project cost will be covered by GECAMINES'
internal cash generation.
1.03      The appraisal was carried out during two missions to Zaire in April/
May and August 1974 by Miss M. Haug and Mr. R. Rodger of the Industrial Proj-
ects Department in close cooperation with the two participating banks.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
2.01      Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga (UMHK), a Belgium company and GECANINES'
predecessor, was founded in 1906 by the "Comite Special du Katanga" and the
Tanganyika Concession Ltd. After initially working gold deposits, the Company
started mining copper near Lubumbashi in 1911. Gradually, production and
social facilities were expanded in three mining centers (Map IBRD 11155) around
Lubumbashi (the so-called Southern group); Likasi (Central group); and Kolwezi
(Western group). By 1960, the Company had a labor force of 20,000 people and
was producing annually 300,000 tons of copper, 9,000 tons of cobalt, 100,000
tons of zinc concentrates, and small quantities of cadmium, germanium, radium,
gold and silver. Annex 2-1 gives a summary chronology of the Company's history.



-2-
2.02      Following Independence in 1960 and the political and military
events which took place in the Congo, the Congolese Government nationalized
Union Miniere's assets in 1967 and conferred them upon a new State-owned
Company "La Generale Congolese des Mines (GECOMINES)" which subsequently in
1971 was renamed to GECAMINES. A technical cooperation agreement dated
January 15, 1967 and amended in February 1969 among the Government of Zaire,
GECAMINES and Societe Generale des Minerais (SGM), UMHK's Belgian holding
company, regulated the compensation question and provided for continuing
technical assistance by SGM including the marketing of GECAMINES' mineral
products. In April 1974 the Government of Zaire and GECAMINES concluded a
revised agreement, which provides for (i) a final compensation payment of
FB 4,000 million (about US$100 million) to SGM by March 1975; (ii) increased
copper refining in Zaire; (iii) construction of a new copper casting plant
near Kinshasa; and (iv) marketing of GECAMINES' production by a Zairian
marketing company. More details on these arrangements are given in Chapter
III and Annex 3-4.
B.   Organization and Management
2.03      GECAMINES operates under the direct supervision of the "Bureau de
la Presidence" of the Republic of Zaire. The General Manager and his deputy
are appointed by the President who also has to authorize any long-term debts
and the acquisition, liquidation or transfer of financial assets. The
"Institut de Gestion du Portefeuille" (IGP), the holding company for all
government owned assets, acts as permanent liaison between GECAMINES and the
Presidency. In November 1973, the Government accorded to GECAMINES by decree
five former subsidiaries of Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga, thereby increasing
the Company's assets by about 8% and value of its sales revenues by approxi-
mately 6%. A description of these subsidiaries and their financial position
is given in Annex 2-2. Their incorporation in GECAMINES does not pose any
special problems.
2.04      On November 30, 1973, Mr. Umba Kyamitala, a Zairian mining engineer
with more than 10 years of experience in GECAMINES was appointed as General
Manager.  He is assisted by a well-qualified managerial and technical staff
of 2,500 including 950 Zairians (Annex 2-3). GECAMINES is actively recruiting
and training Zairian personnel to replace expatriates. The portion of Zairian
staff increased from about 20% in 1967 to 38% in 1973. Total staff turnover
is low amounting to less than 10%. However, GECAMINES has lost a considerable
number of experienced technicians and engineers over the past few years. It
is essential for the future viability of GECAMINES' operation to maintain
sufficient competent and motivated staff. The Government has agreed that
GECAMINES may hire appropriate expertise until such time as the positions
can be filled by adequately-trained Zairian personnel.
2.05      As mentioned earlier, GECAMINES can also rely on continuing tech-
nical assistance from SGM. More specifically, the 1974 agreement commits
SGM to provide (i) purchasing services, (ii) recruitment of foreign
personnel and (iii) studies and engineering relating to GECAMINES' activities.
Remuneration is based on a fee basis. The agreement represents a valuable



-3-
technical back-up for the Company's management and facilitates GECAMINES'
transition and Zairisation program.
2.06      Annex 2-3 further discusses the Company's legal position, organiza-
tion and management. Traditionally, GECAMINES has been a production oriented
company, but in recent years has gradually transformed itself from a produc-
tion unit with strong financial and commercial ties to SGM in Brussels to a
self-sufficient organizational entity directed from Lubumbashi. To this end,
Finance and Marketing Departments have been created and the activities of the
Lubumbashi Purchasing Department expanded so that the latter now processes
more than two-thirds of GECAMINES' orders. Better coordination between the
various departments--particularly the Finance and Production departments--is
needed to improve cost-consciousness as well as medium and long-term planning.
In particular, technical alternatives should be evaluated to a greater extent
from financial and economic points of view before decisions are taken. GECAMINES
has agreed to ensure that the Finance Department will be adequately staffed
and its work integrated into the Company's corporate planning process.
2.07      GECAMINES' organizational structure, shown in Annex 2-3, is charac-
terized on the one hand by the centralization of all functional lines of com-
mand such as Production, Finance, Purchasing and Marketing in Lubumbashi and
the geographical separation of three production centers at Lubumbashi, Likasi
and Kolwezi. This structure reflects the Company's history. GECAMINES in-
tends to review its organizational set-up by reassessing the advantages of
centralization versus more independent production and cost control centers
at Kolwezi,
C. Operations and Manpower
2.98      GECAMINES operates a copper-cobalt mining complex within an 18,000
km concession in the Southern Shaba province of Zaire. The operations include
complete production facilities through to the refined stage. Presently about
one-half of the copper and 65% of the cobalt are refined in Zaire. GECAMINES'
operating performance has been very successful, and since nationalization, the
Company increased its copper production level by 44% as illustrated by the
table below and detailed in Annex 2-4.

The output increase is the result of the timely completion of GECAHINES' first
Expansion Plan (1970-1974), which doubled the Company's refining capacity of
copper and cobalt, and added annual production capacities of 100,000 tons of
copper and 5,000 tons of cobalt.
1.   Ore Reserves
2.09      The geology in the Company's concession area and its ore reserves
are described in Annex 2-5. GECAMINES deposits are among the highest grade
copper reserves presently known in the world. Total reserves in sedimentary
ore deposits are 646 million tons of ore grading an average 3.95% copper and
0.3% cobalt, and 10 million tons of ore grading 4.9% copper and 11.8% zinc in
a vein deposit. The reserves are sufficient for over 40 years at the projected
rate of mining, with the overall potential probably twice the known reserves.
2.   Existing Operations
2.10      GECAMINES' existing facilities and present operations are described
in more detail in Annex 2-4. The Company operates seven open pit and three
underground mines which produce respectively some 10 million and 3.9 million
tons of ore per year. The open pit mines use large, modern equipment and
the engineering, planning and operations of these mines are efficient. This
is also true for the underground mines with the exception of one (Kipushi)
which is older and has less favorable working conditions and higher costs;
it is, however, being modernized.
2.11      There are five concentrators in operation; they are based on flota-
tion, and metal recoveries are good. The plants are well maintained and con-
sistently run at high rates of capacity utilization.
2.12      Two hydro-metallurgical plants, one at Shituru and the other at
Luilu, produce 330,000 tons of cathode copper (99.5% copper) and 17,000 tons
of cathode cobalt per year. At Shituru, some of the cathode copper is fire-
refined in reverberatory furnaces, yielding 225,000 tons of copper wire-bars
or ingots (99.95% copper). At Luilu, some 8,000 tons of cobalt are refined
to pure metal (99.99% Co).
2.13      Finally, of the major processing plants, there is a smelter at
Lubumbashi; it uses the classical smelting process and is one of the oldest
facilities in GECAMINES. Some modernization of the plant was undertaken in
the first Expansion Plan (1970-1974) with the installation of an oxygen plant
and a pelletizing unit. Further modifications are expected after 1979, i.e.,
upon completion of the project under consideration.
2.14      Other facilities include a zinc refinery, lignite mine, limestone
quarry and kilns, and an aggregates' quarry and plant. In general, the plants
are in good state of repair, and process control is effective. The plants
have been kept up-to-date, resulting in favorable working conditions for the
Company's employees.



-5-
3.   Infrastructure
2.15      These facilities are dealt with in greater detail in Annex 2-6.
Internal transport between the mines, concentrators and other plants is
effected by GECAMINES' awn trucks, conveyors and pipelines. The transport
of materials between the Company's mining centers is handled by the Compagnie
des Chemins de Fer Kinshasa - Dilolo - Lubumbashi (KDL), a State-owned rail-
way. 'These systems have been functioning well and no problems are anticipated
in the future. GECAMINES operates extensive maintenance workshops which are
well equipped and organized.
2.16      Transport of GECAMINES' products to coastal ports is via four al-
ternative routes, namely to Matadi, Dar-es-Salaam, Beira, and Lobito. This
number of links offers more flexibility, and thus transport security, than
is found in most mining projects. Excluding the adverse effect of political
events, sufficient capacity exists on these routes to handle also the increased
production.
2.17      Electrical energy--supplied by Societe Nationale d'Electricite
(SNEL) is a key element in GECAMINES' operations. The four hydroelectric
plants in Shaba have traditionally supplied GECAMINES with power. Due to
the low rainfalls in 1973 and 1974 SNEL obtained electrical energy from
Zambia under an existing power exchange agreement to meet the demand in the
Shaba area. Future power needs will be covered by the Inga-Shaba Line which
will be in operation by 1978. However, to ensure that GECAMINES will obtain
sufficient electricity to maintain its present production level during the
crucial project implementation years of 1976 and 1977, GECAMINES will sign,
by April 30, 1975, a power supply contract with SNEL for 1975-77 and the
Government and GECAMINES will take whatever additional steps may be neces-
sary to ensure that present production levels are maintained.
4.   Manpower
2.18      In 1973, GECAMINES' labor force (excluding salaried persons) to-
talled 24,520 people of whom 92% were Zairian nationals (Annex 2-7). The
Company's manpower has been stable and turnover rates have been averaging
3-5% per annum. Traditionally, GECAMINES provides social facilities such
as housing, schools, hospitals and sport centers. On-the-job training and
technical education at the Company institute in Mutoshi is an integral part
of the Company's manpower promotion program. Since 1967, the number of
skilled and semi-skilled workers has increased from 5,876 to 10,691, or from
26% to 40% of the total labor force.
D.   Past Performance and Financial Results

2.20      As indicated by the above table the Company's financial performance
has been satisfactory although it reflects the wide fluctuations in copper
prices. Despite an increase in copper sales volume by nearby 70,000 tons
between 1969 and 1972, sales revenues dropped by 9% from 9283 million in 1969
to 0259 million in 1972 only to nearly double in 1973 on account of the
speculative increase in copper prices which continued to rise up to mid-1974
followed by a sharp drop in the fall of that year. GECAMINES is regarded as
one of the lowest cost producers in the copper industry in the world and even
in 1972, i.e., a year of low copper prices, production costs amounted to only
35% of gross sales and 48% of net sales.
2.21      One major reason, however, for GECAMINES' excellent financial
results during the past four years has been special tax exemptions under the
Investment Code which for a period of five years exempted the Company from
payment of a variety of taxes on earnings and sales resulting from new in-
vestments. These tax concessions enabled GECAMINES to finance by internal
cash generation more than 65% of the First Expansion Plan (1970-1974). How-
ever, the termination of this tax exemption at the end of 1974 will signifi-
cantly change the Company's cost structure by increasing export taxes.

2.23      Traditionally, GECAMINES' financial structure has been sound.  The
Company has followed conservative financial management practices by (i) mini-
mizing the level of long-term debts, (ii) writing off as expenses all explora-
tion, stripping, and engineering costs, (iii) establishing special reserves
and (iv) revaluing annually its fixed assets.  The Company carries a high
level of inventories of spare parts, materials and supplies because the lack
of support industries in Shaba, and the Company's isolated location makes it
Imperative for GECAMINES to be largely self-sufficient.
III. THE MARKET
3.01      The structure of the Zairian copper industry, its contribution to
the country's economy and future development prospects are given in Annex 3-1,
while the world market supply and demand for copper and cobalt, their price
structure and the specific markets for GECAMINES' mineral products are dis-
cussed at length in Annexes 3-2 and 3-3. The following gives only a brief
summary and the major conclusions.
A.   The Copper Market
1.   International Supply and Demand
3.02      Proven published copper reserves in the Western world are conserva-
tively estimated at 272 million tons of copper contents -- more than 40 years
supply at the present rate of mining. The USA holds 27% of these reserves,
Chile 18.7%, Canada 10%, Zambia 9% and Peru and Zaire about 7% each. Together
these countries alone accounted for about 76% of the 1973 world mine produc-
tion of 6 million tons, while Zaire accounted for 8% or 476,000 tons.



-8-
3.03      The world copper supply comes from two main sources, (a) from mine
production, and (b) from secondary or scrap recovery and is consumed in two
different forms, i.e., either as refined copper produced from mined ore or
scrap, or as scrap for direct use. Scrap plays an important role in the
world's copper supply. It averages about 40% of total copper production.
Scrap recovery has proven very price elastic and thus acts as supply/demand
balancing factor. World production of refined copper increased by an average
of 4.1% per annum over the 1960-73 period and reached 6.6 million tons in
1973. Refining facilities, historically located in industrial countries,
were recently expanded primarily in Japan, the CIPEC 1/ countries and Australia.
3.04      Copper has important technical qualities such as corrosion resistance,
and electric and thermal conductivity; and is widely used for electrical equip-
ment and supplies, construction and housing, transportation, appliances, etc.
Consumption of copper is concentrated in the developed, industrialized coun-
tries, with the USA, Canada, Western Europe and Japan accounting for nearly
92% of the Western world consumption. During the 1960-73 period refined
copper consumption increased steadily by 4.5% per annum: In general, growth
of copper consumption and industrial production are closely correlated; how-
ever, during the sixties fast growing economies such as Japan and Brazil
experienced over-proportionally high increases in copper consumption, averag-
ing 10%-20% per annum.
3.05      Net exports of copper as concentrate, blister and refined metal
have increased by 7% per annum since 1969, reaching 3.58 million tons in 1972.
During that year, the major importing countries were the F.R. of Germany (16%),
the UK (14%), Belgium (12%), the USA (10%), Japan (9%), while Zambia (20.5%),
Chile (18.3%), Zaire (12.5%) and Canada (9.2%) led the copper exporting coun-
tries. In 1967 Zambia, Chile, Zaire and Peru formed CIPEC, an organization
which coordinates the actions and protects the interests of these copper
exporting developing countries. The four CIPEC countries accounted in 1972
for 37.5% of the world's copper mine production, 20.5% of refined copper pro-
duction and 57% of net copper exports.
3.06      During the past decade, production and sales of copper were generally
in line with one another; however, hedging against political events, strikes,
inflation, as well as speculation and build-up or draw-down of stocks, have
led periodically to supply/demand imbalances. There exists a high degree of
uncertainty about the future copper market. Since 1973, all major copper pro-
ducing countries have been expanding their production in response to rising
copper prices. However, in the future the economic situation in developed
countries may well slow down copper consumption. The projected demand/supply
for refined copper is siunmarized in the following table:

organization coordinating the copper production and marketing policy of
its members, which at present are Peru, Chile, Zambia and Zaire.

3.07      The projections assume (i) realistic completion schedules for the
currently planned mine expansion programs as detailed in Annex 3-2, Table 16,
(ii) 93% utilization of mine capacity, (iii) secondary refined copper produc-
tion continuing to average 15% of total refined copper production, and (iv)
a 3.2% per annum increase in refined copper consumption until 1977, and 4.5%
per annum thereafter. Based on these assumptions and not accounting for the
supply/demand price drops and variations in scrap supply a copper oversupply
of 400,000-700,000 tons per year appears to develop during the seventies.
On the other hand, were copper consumption to grow--as in the past-- at 4.5%
per annum until 1980, such oversupply would amount to not more than 200,000
tons. However, an excess of supply will lead to price drops, and, thus, on
the one hand encourage copper consumption through substitution, stock build-up,
etc. and on the other hand diminish copper supply by making scrap recovery
less profitable.
2.   Copper Price Structure and Projection
3.08      Copper is traded at producer prices, the London Metal Exchange (LME),
and the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) in New York. The bulk of copper's inter-
national trade, including GECAMINES' exports, are sold at LME prices, although
less than 10% of copper sales are actually delivered from LME stocks.
3.09      Copper is characterized by its low short-term elasticities of demand
and supply which create huge and volatile changes in price. Since 1965, copper
prices have not fallen below the US$0.45/lb level, but reached a peak of
US$1.52/lb (in current terms) in April 1974, caused by speculations following
the oil crises and hedging against a US miners' strike, only to drop to a low
of US$0.56/lb in December 1974 as stocks were released and industrial produc-
tion growth slowed down.
3.10      With the dramatic drop in copper prices, the CIPEC countries in
November 1974, called for action to halt the decline in prices, and for the
first time since the establishment of CIPEC, agreed to temporarily reduce



- 10 -
their copper exports by 10%. It is hoped this will maintain the price
above 60§/lb. A decrease in price below this level would not only seriously
affect the trade balance of these countries, but also the viability of some
of the producers. The action is not, however, expected to have any signifi-
cant impact on the short term price. But many of the U.S. and Canadian producers
have also announced cutbacks, and the sum total of these actions may have some
influence on prices in the near term. A major factor affecting this cyclic
decline in price is decrease in demand in the industrial countries. Some
210,000 tons could be withheld from the market in 1975 by the CIPEC action.
The result may be an advance by several months in the cyclic upswing, as
prices move again to normal levels dictated by production costs.
3.11      Copper prices in 1973 terms averaged US$0.93/lb (US$0.65/lb in
current prices) during the 1965-69 period, and declined to US$0.74 (US$0.82/lb
in current prices) during 1970-73. The price increasing factors during the
sixties -- such as miner strikes in Chile (1965/66), the US (1967/68) and
Canada (1969); the economic boom (1969); and copper purchases by the USSR
or the People's Republic of China -- were stronger than in the seventies
when events -- such as production shortfalls in Chile and Zambia; the general
slump in economic activity (1971/72); the new currency alignments; or the
impact of US pollution controls on refinery production influenced the market.
3.12      Price projections for copper, under the best of conditions, cannot
be more than an intelligent guess. In the short-term, i.e., for 1975, it
is expected that copper prices will stabilize between US$0.70/lb and US$0.80
in current terms as releases of consumer stockpiles continue and the decreasing
economic growth in developed countries cannot be counterbalanced by accelerated
industrialization of less developed nations. In the medium run, as mentioned
in para. 3.06, there is the possibility of a slight oversupply of refined
copper until 1980 which could lead to price drops, i.e., copper prices in
current terms may increase at less than world inflation rate. For purposes
of this report and with the objective of being reasonably certain that the
Company can, in fact, generate the internal cash that it is to contribute
to the financing of the project, conservative price projections have been
used.  It has been assumed that LME copper prices will increase from an average
level of US$0.73/lb in 1975 by 4% in 1976 and 5% per annum thereafter, thus
implying a price drop in real terms of 3 to 4% per year.
3.13      Traditionally, continental Europe has been GECAMINES' market,
accounting for nearly 93% of the Company's 1973 copper sales. In 1973 inter
alia, GECAMINES delivered copper to France (25.0%), Belgium (23.5%), Italy
(20.8%), Germany (8.9%), Sweden (2.7%), Brazil (2.7%) and Japan (2.7%). Al-
though the Company still has about 48% of its copper output refined by SGM
in Belgium, its sales to Belgian consumers have been decreasing in absolute
and relative terms by 3%-4% per annum over the past few years.  GECAMINES
has a strong market position as a reliable deliverer of copper and should
encounter no difficulties in marketing the output of the project. The Com-
pany plans to expand its market share in Brazil and Germany as well as
satisfy the increasing demand of its traditional customers.

B.   The Cobalt Market
3.14      Cobalt is a relatively expensive alloying metal which is used in
a number of advanced technology industries because of its heat resistance,
magnetic and chemical properties. Its market is characterized by concentra-
tion of production in a small number of developing countries while consump-
tion is confined to a few highly industrialized countries. In 1972 Zaire
accounted for 62% of world cobalt mine production followed by Zambia (9.0%),
Canada (6.8%), Cuba (7.0%) and Morocco (6.7%). In contrast, in 1972 world
consumption was distributed between the US (44.5%), Japan (16%), the UK
(12.5%) and Germany (10.5%). Overall cobalt consumption which correlates
closely with industrial production, increased by 5.9% per annum during the
1950-71 period, with growth rates averaging 3.4% in the US, 6.5% in Western
Europe and 9.1% in Japan.
3.15      In the past GECAMINES has been acting as market leader, i.e.,
balancing world cobalt supply and demand by adjusting its inventory levels
and fixing periodically cobalt prices to counterbalance cobalt sales from
the US Government stockpile, production levels of other cobalt producers,
and operating cost increases. As for the medium-term future, GECAMINES
will be able to maintain its present market position. Expansions of copper-
cobalt deposits in Africa, nickel-laterite deposits in Cuba and Asia as well
as exploitation of cobalt by deep sea mining of manganese nodules is expected
to result in cobalt mine production of around 45,000 tons by 1982, of which
GECAMINES would still produce 46% (as against 62% at present). In the long-
run, however, deep-sea mining may influence decisively the cobalt market
structure.
3.16      The projected demand/supply position before price adjustments sum-
marized below indicates the likelihood of a cobalt oversupply by 1979, which
may result in gradual price drops. Cobalt price declines are feasible since
cobalt is as a rule produced as a by-product, and the present price of FB
315,000/ton (US$3.57/lb) includes estimated profit margins of 65-80%.
Projected World Cobalt Supply and Demand
(000 tons)
1975  1977  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985
Supply               26.5  30.2  39.4  42.2  43.4  44.9  48.4  52.3  56.7
Consumption          27.2  30.3  33.7  35.6  38.4  41.5  44.8  48.4  52.3
Surplus (deficit)   _0.71 (0.1)  5.7   6.6   5.0   3.4   3.6   3.9   4.4
In the longer run, market equilibrium may be re-established by cobalt
prices decreasing to those of nickel--cobalt's main substitute material.
For the coming years, however, it has been assumed that prices will increase
in line with projected world inflation until 1978. During the 1979-82 period
cobalt prices are assumed to decrease in real terms by 3.8% p.a. to counter-
balance the projected oversupply, but prices would still increase by 5% p.a.



- 12 -
in current terms. No price increases (in current terms) have been assumed
for the remaining forecast period when a new market equilibrium will have to
be established, so that by 1985, real prices are assumed to be only about
64% of present prices.
C.   GECAMINES Marketing Arrangements
3.17      SGM has been the exclusive sales agent for GECAMINES' products.
Generally, the Company sells refined copper on yearly contracts. An exception
are long-term deliveries of blister copper to SGM's subsidiary--Metallurgie
Hoboken-Overpelt. However, these are expected to gradually phase out after
1980. A detailed description of GECAMINES' marketing arrangements is given
in Annex 3-4.
3.18      In April 1974 the Government of Zaire signed an agreement with
SGM whereby SGM will transfer its exclusive marketing rights for GECAMINES'
products and its commercial know-how to a newly established Zairian-owned
marketing company, SOZACOM-"Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation des
Minerais." During the coming years SOZACOM will gradually take over all
marketing activities with strong technical assistance from SGM.  March 31,
1976 has been set as take-over date for SOZACOM, but SGM is committed to
commercialize GECAMINES' output after that date if SOZACOM so requests.
SGM has presented a training program for SOZACOM to the Government and
actual work is about to start since SOZACOM's general manager has just
been nominated by the Zairian authorities.
3.19      While the transfer of sales responsibility to SOZACOM is a con-
structive move in the long run, it would not seem wise to permit SGM's
purchase commitment to lapse until a fully capable SOZACOM staff has been
built up. Therefore, the Government has agreed to operate SOZACOM not
only according to sound business practices but will also from time to
time exchange views with the Bank on the progress of the transfer of
responsibility for such marketing from SGM to SOZACOM.
3.20      The Government of Zaire, with the technical cooperation of SGM,
is planning the creation of a Zairian-owned copper casting plant near Maluku
which will produce 100,000 tons of billets and cakes per year in a first
stage by 1978 and an additional 100,000 tons of copper rod by 1980. GECAMINES
is expected to supply this company with refined copper, i.e., the additional
output of GECAMINES' expansion project will not only be refined but also
transformed in Zaire.  Marketing arrangements between GECAMINES and this new
company have still to be determined.
IV. THE EXPANSION PRO.JECT
A.   Technical Description
4.01      Essentially the project consists of the development of two new
open pit mines of the Dikuluwe and Mashamba deposits near Kolwezi (Western



- 13 -
group) and the installation of treatment facilities--i.e., concentrator,
smelter and refinery--necessary for the annual production of 120,000 tons
of electro-refined copper (99.95%) and 4,000 tons of cobalt as a copper-
cobalt alloy. A detailed description and technical evaluation of the
project is presented in Annex 4-1.
1.   Production Facilities
4.02      The Dikuluwe and Mashamba deposits contain 171 million tons of
ore grading 4.1% copper and 0.3% cobalt, sufficient for 40 years of mining.
While the deposits will probably be mined entirely by open-pit methods, the
presently defined open pit limits include some 66 million tons of ore, more
than 15 years of operations. The deposits have been thoroughly explored and
the reserves conservatively estimated (Annex 4-1).
4.03      The proposed mining equipment is the same as presently used by
GECAMINES in its other open pits--9-7/8" drills, 15 cu. yd. electric shovels
and 100 ton haulage trucks. Mining 4 million tons of ore annually with a
volume of approximately 1.7 million m3 requires the removal of an average
of 12.5 million m3 of overburden per year. The stripping ratio, though high,
is warranted in view of the configuration of the ore zone and the high grade
ore.
4.04      The ore will be crushed to minus 5" in two semi-mobile 700 tons
per hour (TPH) crushers located at the exit of each pit. It will then be
transported by conveyor, one 3,200 m and the other 1,200 m long, to a
stockpile at a new concentrator of an annual capacity of 4 million tons of
ore.
4.05      The flowsheet and equipment of the concentrator are similar to those
already in use by GECAMINES. The testing by the Company's metallurgical
research group of the suitability of the concentrator for the type of ore
to be mined has been thorough and comprehensive. The selection of the flow-
sheet can be supported on both technical and economic grounds.
4.06      The 100,000 ton capacity flash smelter at Luilu will be based on a
process developed by the Finnish firm Outokumpu. It is particularly well
suited for GECAMINES' concentrates, whose high grade, having few metallic
impurities, permits the direct production of blister copper. The process is
also fuel saving, since it gives off heat in the reaction. Although this type
of smelter is new to GECAMINES, there are over 20 Outokumpu-licensed flash
smelters in operation or under construction in the world. Aside from the
usual adjustments necessary in the early stages of operation, those smelters
currently in use function well and are sound technologically. GECAMINES has



- 14 -
signed an engineering agreement with Outokumpu for design, engineering, and
start-up services for the smelter furnace--the most crucial item--and asso-
ciated equipment. Thorough pilot plant and semi-industrial testing by GECAMINES
and Outokumpu have confirmed the feasibility of producing blister copper
directly (Annex 4-1).
4.07      The copper anodes from the flash smelter will be refined electro-
lytically into high grade cathode copper in a new 100,000 ton capacity
refinery to be constructed at Luilu. The basic principles are similar to
those used in the Company's existing electrolytic circuits. The blister
copper from Outokumpu's pilot plant tests was used in semi-industrial scale
tests to produce cathode copper. The tests, covering all the operating para-
meters, produced high quality copper.
4.08      Introduction of the flash smelter will release capacity in the
existing Luilu hydrometallurgical plant. Therefore, an increased quantity
of oxide concentrates, including those from the new concentrator, can be
processed. At the same time, improvements, mainly through the installation
of new thickeners and filters, in the existing circuit will increase the
capacity from 175,000 tons to 190,000 tons of cathode copper per year.
2.   Ancillary Facilities
4.09      Other facilities required at Luilu to achieve the planned expansion
in output are a 3503ton per day (TPD) oxygen plant; a 300 TPD sulphuric acid
plant; a 210,000 Nm per day coal gasification plant; and a lime kiln. With
the possible exception of the coal gasification plant, which will be based on
the German Lurgi process, all the other facilities are widely used and proven
process units. Following preliminary studies of alternative fuel sources,
GECAMINES had samples of Luena lignite tested for its suitability for gasifi-
cation. Tests were executed in the Company's pyrometallurgical laboratory
and also by Lurgi in Germany. The Luena lignite mines, which are located
about 160 km from Luilu and are owned and operated by GECAMINES, will need
to be expanded from a production level of 120,000 tons per year to 200,000
tons per year. No problems are expected.
3.   Administrative and Industrial Infrastructure
4.10      The basic infrastructure already exists within the Western Group,
but some additions or modifications are required, particularly at Luilu.  As
indicated previously (para. 2.17), adequate power supply during project
implementation will need particular attention. Modifications of the elec-
trical transformers and the transmission system in the Western Group are
also needed (Annex 4-1). Water will be available in suitable quantities
from the Luilu River. Expansion of the existing pumping station and construction
of a water treatment plant are included in the project and so are the enlarge-
ment of the maintenance facilities, office buildings, the telecommunications
system and other facilities, such as compressed air and fuel storage. GECAMINES
will be responsible for the engineering, design and construction of these
facilities.



-15-
4.   Housing
4.11      The project calls for considerable investments in Kolwezi's social
infrastructure such as 330 houses for staff, 2,000 houses and basic infra-
structure for workers, community facilities (schools, recreation complexes)
and the rehabilitation and modernization of the Kolwezi hospitals. In addition,
GECAMINES will upgrade the water supply and sanitary installations in the two
settlements adjacent to the construction site, where most of the construction
workers will live. The Company has not yet chosen the site for the construc-
tion of 1,600 worker houses. To ensure timely completion of the project's
housing component, GECAMINES has agreed to choose an adequate town site
and submit an implementation schedule satisfactory to the Bank by April 30,
1975.
B.   Ecology
4.12      The project is satisfactory from an ecological point of view (Annex
4-1, paras. 64-70). The impact of open pit mining is, of course, considerable
but limited in land area. Reclamation is not necessary at this point in time,
since the deposit is located in rolling savannah land which is sparsely popu-
lated and of low agricultural value.
4.13      Tailings from the concentrator are impounded behind an existing well-
engineered and constructed dam. The overflow from the tailings dam, based on
results from the existing Kamoto concentrator is of better quality than the
intake water. The smelter gases which contain 14-17% sulphur dioxide (SO2)
will be treated, resulting in removal of 98% of the S02, subsequently to be
used in the production within the project of sulphuric acid, and 99% of the
dust. Most of the process fluids will be in closed circuits, so discharges
from the plant will be minimal. To ensure appropriate standards of environ-
mental protection, GECAMINES has agreed to take into account and submit for
the Bank's approval adequate pollution control designs during the detailed
engineering stage. In addition, the Company will monitor the discharges
from the new plant units after production start-up and take corrective
measures if necessary.
C.   Project Organization and Management
4.14      For project execution purposes the expansion program has been divided
into 12 technologically homogeneous and virtually self-contained units 1/ and
about 45 miscellaneous equipment and construction packages. For each of the
12 large units a general contractor will undertake engineering, equipment
supply and erection, building construction and start-up. GECAMINES will order
the miscellaneous packages directly and will either construct and erect these
with its own staff or subcontract to local enterprises.
1/   The 12 units are:  Crushing and conveying facilities; concentrator;
dewatering and storage facilities of sulphide concentrate; quicklime
storage and processing; flash smelter; oxygen plant; sulfuric acid plant;
electro-refinery; lime kiln; coal gasification; plant foundations; and
a water treatment plant.



- 16 -
4.15      Overall responsibility for project management, i.e., the supervision
and coordination of the various contractors as well as the engineering and
execution of individual project components such as social infrastructure,
modification of the Luilu plant and the miscellaneous equipment packages rests
with GECAMINES. To this end, GECAMINES created a separate project management
unit under the existing Construction Engineering Division. This new unit is
headed by an experienced engineer, who was in charge of the execution of their
first Expansion Plan (1970-74). An organization chart and staffing plan for
the unit is attached as Annex 4-2 and GECAMINES is actively recruiting person-
nel. The Government has agreed to allow the Company to hire the personnel
required for satisfactory project execution without administrative restric-
tions and delays. For short-term assignments and specialized studies,
GECAMINES may rely on the technical assistance of SGM under the April 1974
Technical Assistance contract (para. 2.02).
4.16      Overall, GECAMINES project execution arrangements are satisfactory
and appropriate to the Company's need. The Company has considerable expertise
among its operating and planning staff and is, from all points of view, well
qualified to direct and supervise this project. In addition, having the
project executed directly by GECAMINES should be an excellent training ground
for young Zairian engineers and administrators.
D.   Employment and Training
4.17      During the construction phase the expansion project will employ
about 4,000 workers and 1,000 technicians. Whereas most of the technicians
will be expatriates, the majority of potential construction workers already
live in the Kolwezi area. GECAMINES will coordinate the recruitment of the
local manual workers for its own labor force and for the outside contractors.
4.18      As indicated in Annex 2-7, the expansion project will create perma-
nent employment for about 2,000 workers (350 for the open-pit mines, 140 for
the concentrator, 770 for the metallurgical plants and the balance of about
740 for support services). GECAMINES does not envisage any problems in re-
cruiting and training the additional labor force, since experienced workers
from the existing operations will constitute a major contingent among the
labor force of the expansion project and training will be among the functions
of the plant contractors.
4.19      Staff requirements for the project have been estimated at 200
people. GECAMINES will make a special effort to hire a majority of Zairians
for the expansion and an initial ratio of 70% Zairians to 30% expatriates
has been envisaged. Here also, training of engineers and technicians on the
job and abroad is to be obtained from the general contractors for the major
plant units; and in particular for the new flash smelter and coal gasifica-
tion plant. GECAMINES will present to the Bank by end 1975 (i) an organi-
zation chart for all new installations and (ii) a detailed staffing, recruiting
and training plan.



- 17 -
E.   Project Schedule
4.20      GECAMINES has already ordered crucial equipment items to be financed
by its own funds such as mining equipment and autogenous grinders (Annex 5-1).
Some housing construction as well as infrastructure works are underway.
Project completion is planned for late 1977 in accordance with the schedule
shown in Annex 4-3. This implies start of civil works for the plants by
mid-1975 and commissioning of the plants in mid-1977 with the last unit
operational by the last quarter of 1977. Development of the open pits should
be complete by early 1975. GECAMINES will submit to the Bank by mid-1975 a
detailed exploitation plan for the Dikuluwe and Mashamba ore deposits. The
schedule is tight and achievable only if the Company can maintain the quality
of its staff and no major unforeseen delays in equipment deliveries occur.
The Company is making a determined effort to meet the target date for project
completion; however, for financial projection purposes a more conservative
assumption has been used: the project will be completed i.e. all components
will be in operation only by January 1978, with production during the remain-
ing months of the year averaging somewhat more than 65%.
4.21      Conceptual engineering and design for the new plant installations
has been completed. Tender documents for the new plants have been prepared
by GECAMINES' Engineering Department in accordance with Bank Guidelines,
assisted by a Belgian consulting firm, CHEMINS DE FERS ET ENTERPRISES (CFE).
Tender documents for all major plant units have been forwarded to prequalified
suppliers. It is expected that orders for 2 or 3 of those items with the
longest delivery periods will be placed just prior to consideration of the
project by the Bank's Executive Directors. Retroactive financing of the down-
payment for these items is recommended, given the tight project schedule and
the importance of the project to the Zairian economy. The Bank's portion of
such retroactive financing, about US$3 million, is small in relation to the
overall size of the loan.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, AND PROCUREMENT

/1   3% import registration fee.
5.02      The project's scope and design were firmed up in April 1974.  Cost
estimates for all plant units and major equipment items are based on October
1974 bids, July 1974 quotations from interested suppliers or actual prices
for already ordered items, such as mining equipment and autogenous grinders,
of US$24.4 million equivalent. The estimate for civil works and infrastructure
reflects GECAMINES' recent experience, using an average 20% price increase
between 1973 and 1974. The Company will be granted tax concessions under the
Investment Code so that no import taxes are payable, except for a 3% import
registration fee. The cost projections for pre-operating and engineering
expenses reflect July 1974 price quotations and GECAMINES' estimated staffing
requirement for project management. Physical contingencies to cover unforeseen
needs during construction reflect different d.egrees of firmness of the design
and engineering plans and have been estimated between 5% and 20% of all fixed
asset items, excluding equipment already ordered. Thus, physical contingencies
average 11.5% of capital cost. 1/ To cover foreign and local inflation aver-
age price escalation rates of 15% in 1974/75, 12% in 1976, and 10% per annum

thereafter have been applied for all project cost components based on July
1974 or October 1974 price quotations. Overall estimating methods have been
adequate and the above capital cost estimates are realistic.
B.   Working Capital
5.03      Incremental working capital requirements for the project during the
1974-78 period are based on GECAMINES' current experience and are estimated
at 915.9 million (US$31.8 million) as detailed in Annex 5-2.
C.   Financing Plan and Security Arrangements
5.04      The proposed financing for the projected requirement of Z230.2
million (US$460.4 million) is as follows:
Financing Plan
(US$ million equivalent)
Source                              Amount                  %

Total Financing                     460.4                 100
5.05      The Bank loan would be to GECAMINES for 15 years including 4 years
of grace, at a prevailing interest rate of 8% p.a., plus a guaranty fee of 2%
p.a. payable to the Government of Zaire, bringing the total cost to the
Company to 10% p.a. The Libyan Arab Foreign Bank will channel its loan of 30
million Libyan Dinar (US$100 million) from the Libyan Government to GECAMINES
on the same interest terms. The loan of approximately US$20 million equivalent
from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to the Company will carry an interest
of 10-1/2%. Repayment terms of the Libyan and EIB loans will be identical to
those of the Bank loan, i.e., 15 years including 4 years of grace.
5.06      GECAMINES will make a US$240 million (52%) contribution to the
financing of the project. The financial projections (Annexes 7-1 and 7-2)
indicate that the Company will be able to provide internally for the required
amount of cash. Funds of about US$180 million have been accumulated in the
form of cash and quick-turnover inventories during the high copper price
period 1973-74 or have been invested for the project during 1974.

5.07      To ensure project completion under any eventuality, the Government
has provided a cost overrun guarantee, i.e., make available any additional
local or foreign funds on terms satisfactory to the Bank as may be needed
to complete the project, 1/ irrespective of whether the need for such addi-
tional funds is caused by a cost-overrun or a shortfall in the Company's
cash generation.  If the situation arises, the Government will review with
GECAMINES and the Bank -- well in advance -- the need for additional funds
and arrange that these funds be subtracted from GECAMINES' tax payments. As
discussed in paras. 7.04 and 7.05, this overrun guarantee is supplemented
by certain financial covenants such as limitation of additional investments,
debts and dividend payments.
5.08      All long-term loans for the project are guaranteed by the Govern-
ment. Nevertheless, considering the substantial amount of loan financ-
ing involved and the absence of off-shore guarantees, special repayment arrange-
ments are needed. GECAMINES, the Government and the Central Bank of Zaire
have agreed to establish a trust fund at an independent commercial bank out-
side of Zaire and satisfactory to the Bank to service the debts of the three
lenders (IBRD, IAFB and EIB). At all times the fund should contain at least
half of the next semi-annual debt service payment due to the lenders and be
replenished by GECAMINES by monthly allocations of 1/6 of the aggregate of
such debt payment. Further, the Central Bank of Zaire will issue promissory
notes equivalent to the debt service payments and deposit them with the
commercial bank.
D.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.09      The proposed Bank loan of US$100 million equivalent is intended to
contribute towards the financing of (i) 10 plant units including engineering,
equipment supply and installation, building erection, and supervision; (ii)
selected equipment and engineering, erection and supervison services for the
flash smelter plant; (iii) the foundations of the above 11 plants; and (iv)
the cif cost of miscellaneous equipment items. A list of items proposed for
financing by each of the lenders is contained in Annex 5-3 and summarized
below:
1/   In this context, project completion is defined as production and sales
over 6 consecutive months at 90X of rated capacity and equivalent working
capital level build-up (minimum quick ratio 1.5:1).

100.00      100.00    20.00
As detailed in Annex 5-3, the LAFB and IBRD will be associated under a co-
financing scheme, in which each bank disburses 50% towards (i) the total
(foreign and local) cost of the 10 plant units and the foundation contract,
and (ii) the foreign exchange cost of miscellaneous equipment items. The
flash smelter (the 11th unit) will be jointly financed by GECAMINES, EIB,
LAFB and the Bank, whereby GECAMINES will pay for the Finnish supplied goods
and services of US$5.68 million equivalent and the EIB, LAFB and Bank loans
will cover the remaining capital costs such as services of the general con-
tractor, supply and installation of the slag and anode furnaces, casting
wheels, estimated at US$32.4 million.
5.10      All loan-financed items will be procured through international
competitive bidding following Bank Guidelines. The 10 plant units and the
foundation contract will be tendered as individual contracts, following pre-
qualifications. The loan-financed miscellaneous equipment will be procured
in 22 packages. For the flash smelter, Outokumpu will be responsible for
engineering and the procurement of selected Finnish-supplied equipment;
however, a general contractor will coordinate procurement, erection and
supervision for the other packages. Due to the complex nature of the plant
and construction units, none of the unit contractors will be Zairian and all
of the miscellaneous equipment to be financed by the Bank will be imported;
therefore, there will be no preference for local suppliers. While the
foreign loans (US$220 million equivalent) will be less than the estimated
foreign exchange requirements of the project (excluding working capital
and interest during construction) of US$268 million, the nature of the bid
packages will require that about 10% of the Bank loan would be used for
local expenditures.

5.11      A quarterly disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is shown in
Annex 5-4. It is based on estimates of order placements, payment schedules
and expected construction and equipment delivery times. The loan is forecast
to be fully disbursed by end-1978.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
6.01      Assumptions for the operating costs and financial projections are
given in Annex 6-1. 1/ The forecasts are based on a realistic period between
start-up of the new installations and full capacity production by mid-1978. 2/
Production build-up has been estimated as follows and takes into account that
GECAMINES will produce a saleable product (concentrates) as soon as the con-
centrator begins operation, even if the other metallurgical installations
come on stream only at a later date.
Expansion Project - Production Build-up
(000 tons metal content)

Cobalt /a          0.4     2.5     4.0      4.0     4.0      2.8
/a   The capacity build-up of cobalt does not correspond to the copper capacity
increase, due to variations in cobalt content of the deposits. The
project will produce a copper-cobalt alloy containing 10% copper and
55% cobalt.
Operating costs have been estimated by GECAMINES on the basis of the Company's
current operations and of projected material, fuel, energy, transport and spare
parts consumption as well as personnel requirements for each of the mines and
plants. All costs have been taken at 1974 rates and adjusted for price escala-
tion varying between 3% and 12% per year as shown in Annex 6-1. Cost projec-
tions are considered realistic. Overall operating costs in the new installa-
tions (excluding financial charges) are expected to be about 8-12% lower than
those in existing installations.
6.02      As for future copper prices in nominal terms, the projections assume
average LME prices of US$0.73/lb in 1975, US$0.76/lb in 1976, and 5% average
increase per annum thereafter. Cobalt prices are assumed to increase from
1/   Details on GECAMINES' operating cost are confidential information.
2/   GECAMINES generally produces at over 100% of rated capacity.



- 23 -
their expected 1975 level of M 3,935/ton (US$3.57/lb) by 8.8% p.a. until 1978,
then increase by 5% per annum until 1982, and stabilize at the 1982 price level
when deep sea mining of cobalt is expected to influence the cobalt price struc-
ture. GECAMINES sales revenues exclude SGM's marketing and refining expenses
but include ocean freight of about US$0.025/lb.
A.   Financial ProJections of the Project
6.03      Detailed income and cash flow forecasts over the first 9 years of
operation are shown in Annexes 6-2 and 6-3 and summarized below:

charges, and administrative charges.
/2   After export and turnover duties & taxes.
6.04      The projections show that the project can operate profitably from
1978 onwards, which is partly due to tax exemptions under the Investment
Code. The Government has granted (i) an export tax exemption until 1982 on
the output of the expansion project, i.e., in excess of the present annual
capacity of 470,000 tons of copper and 16,000 tons of cobalt, (ii) exemptions
from the import and turnover taxes for goods and services required for the
project and (iii) exemptions from profit taxes on the output of the expansion
project (Annex 6-1). These tax exemptions are in line with Investment Code
concessions recently granted to private and mixed mining companies in Zaire.
The Company's profit structure is sensitive to the duration of the tax holiday,
but GECAMINES could meet its debt service obligations and replacement invest-
ment needs, even if the above concessions would end by 1979. In 1983, the
first year in which the project will have to carry the full tax burden, direct
costs are projected to account for 46% of net sales as compared to 26% in 1982.



- 24 -
6.05      The cost structure of the project is satisfactory and thus should
reinforce the Company's high degree of flexibility and competitive position
on the world market. It should also be noted that increases of production
cost have been assumed to occur at a higher rate than price increases. How-
ever, the elements of GECAMINES' production costs are not expected to be much
different from those in other copper producing countries, so that in the
longer run copper prices will increase more in line with world inflation.
B.   Financial Rate of Return of the Project
6.06      The project provides an incremental financial rate of return of 21%.
As detailed in Annex 6-4, all return calculations have been made in real terms
by eliminating inflationary price increases from the cost/benefit streams.
An analysis has been carried out to determine the sensitivity of the project's
rate of return to various cost and price changes. The results of the sensi-
tivity analysis are shown in Annex 6-4 and summarized below:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Rate of Return
Case      Description                                          Z
1        Base Case                                           21
2        6 month construction delay                          20
3        Capital cost increase 20%                            15
4        Operating Cost Increase 10%                          19
5        Sales Revenue Decrease 10%                           16
6        Sales Revenue Decrease 20%                           10
7        Combination of 3, 4 and 5                            7
8        Export tax exemption until end 1979 only            15
6.07      The project is particularly sensitive to the level of export taxes:
Were the Government to grant a tax exemption under the Investment Code through
1979 only, instead of 1982 as assumed in the above projections, the financial
rate of return would drop to 15%. Were the sales prices to drop by 20% (i.e.
to US$0.58/lb for copper, US$3.07/lb for cobalt in 1975 prices), which must
be considered below any long-term floor prices, the project would still main-
tain a 10% rate of return. Only under extreme adverse conditions of 10-20%
increases in operating and capital cost, and simultaneous decline of copper
price levels below 60 cents/lb, would the project show an unacceptable low
financial rate of return.
C.   Break-even Point Analysis of the Project
6.08      The profit break-even points are at production levels of 37,000
tons of copper in 1980 and 72,000 tons of copper (or 61% of full production)
in 1983, when full tax rates would be in effect. The cash break-even points
are at levels of 42,000 and 84,000 tons of copper in 1980 and 1983 respec-
tively, thus illustrating the sound cost/benefit structure of the expansion
project (Annex 6-5).

D.   Major Risks
6.09      The major risks of the project concerns future market prices.
Apart from temporary market disturbances, there is little risk in marketing
GECAMINES' additional output and this aspect should be adequately covered
by the sales arrangments with SGI  and SOZACOM (Annex 3-4).  A major element
of uncertainty lies, however, in the future price of copper. As noted
previously, copper prices are subject to considerable short-term fluctuations.
In the medium-term, a supply/demand imbalance may arise until the end of this
decade and lead to temporary price drops of up to 20% below the projected
prices. Short-term price decreases could have an effect on GECAMINES'
ability to generate the US$240 million required for project financing (para.
5.04). However, since over 60% of GECAMINES' contribution to the financing
plan will come from surplus cash already generated in 1973/74, the risk is
limited. As analyzed in Annex 6-6, the Company is expected to be able to make
its full cash contribution to the financing of the project, even if it would
have to cut back 1975 sales by 10% (vis a vis 1974) and in addition be faced
with 1975 and 1976 prices for copper which are by 7% below those assumed in
the report. Any additional revenue shortfalls could be covered by special
tax concessions in the framework of the Government's project completion
guarantee (para. 6.04). A long-term price drop of 10-15% would nearly erase
the Company's profits, but nevertheless enable GECAMINES to service its debts
and undertake the necessary replacement of operating assets. However, if
taking into account the high ore grade the Company is mining, its relatively
low operating costs and low debt, this risk is comparatively modest because
many other copper producers with which GECANINES is competing are likely to
be hit by such price drops more severely than the Company.
6.10      As for supply of electric energy covering the period 1975 through
1977, adequate supplies of power are expected to be assured by the supply
contract between S,NEL and GECGIINES (para. 2.17).  However, should shortfalls
still arise, the Company has the possibility of redistributing available
supplies internally, i.e. from the highly power-intensive production of zinc
to that of copper, with only marginally lower cash generation.
6.11      Tlhe mining and metallurgical aspects of the project do not present
major risks. The ore deposits have been thoroughly examined and the ore
reserves conservatively estimated. Mletlhods and equipment in the open pits,
the concentrator and thie refinery are identical or similar to thlose already
used by the Company. Flash smelting, while new to GECAMDINES, is particularly
well suited to their concentrates and operational needs and is by now a
proven process, as is coal gasification with which the Company has also had
no previous experience. Tihe project provides for the necessary technical
assistance to familiarize the Company with any new technical features.

VII.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY
A.   Future Profitability

/1   Not including subsidiaries and subsequent expansion programs.
/2   Not including surplus cash.
7.02      The above table illustrates again the financial importance of the
expansion project for the Company's growth and improved productivity. As
outlined in paras. 6.01-6.04, net income and cash generation will decline
significantly in 1983 when the tax concessions will expire, but the remaining
funds are sufficient to cover GECAMINES' replacement investments, debt service,
as well as other new investments.
7.03      GECAMINES's depreciation policy is based on the technical life of
its fixed assets ranging from 5-8 years for mining equipment and rolling
stock to 30-40 years for buildings and infrastructure. The Company's depre-
ciation periods are generally longer than allowed by Zairian law. Due to



- 27 -
inflation and the long average depreciation period, GECAMINES' annual
depreciation allowance has been inferior to the projected replacement
investments. Therefore, to maintain the Company's fixed asset value and
generate sufficient funds for required investments the Company allocates
part of its retained earnings to a special reserve before paying dividends.
GECAMINES will study the financial implications of its present depreciation
policy and discuss with the Bank by June 30, 1975 the results of such study.
7.04      The Company's capital and liquidity position is expected to remain
sound throughout the life of the loan and should allow GECANINES to embark
on further investment programs by the end of this decade. The difference
between the current and quick ratios indicates substantial inventories and
can be influenced significantly by the Company's export financing system. If
SGM discontinues the sales of GECAMINES' production with export financing,
the Company's working capital needs increase by 10-30x. To ensure GECAMINES'
sound financial structure in the future, the Company will maintain at all
times a debt:equity of at least 40:60 and a quick ratio 1/ of better than
1.3. Further, GECAMINES will not distribute dividends unless full provision
has first been made for the investment needs of the expansion and replacement
programs.
7.05      In addition, GECANINES will not without first obtaining the Bank's
approval (i) during the construction period make investments (other than for
the expansion project and normal replacements) in any one year exceeding
US$10 million and will not contract any long-term debts in any one year
exceeding US$7 million; and (ii) after project completion, contract any
long-term debts in any one year exceeding US$25 million.
B.   Debt Service Coverage
7.06      Long-term debt service coverage is good (para. 7.01) illustrating
the Company's relative independence from outside financing sources and its
credit worthiness even in case of a substantial drop in copper prices.
Consistently during the life of the loan debt service (after taxes) is
expected to be covered close to or more than 3-times. In addition, the
security arrangement outlined in para. 5.08 establishes a repayment mechan-
ism which improves overall debt service coverage.
C.   Auditing Requirements
7.07      GECAMINES' annual financial statements have been audited by
Price & Waterhouse Co., following generally accepted auditing methods.
GECAMINES has agreed to continue to employ an auditing firm acceptable
to the Bank.
1/   The quick-ratio is defined as ratio between current assets excluding
inventories to current liabilities.

VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
8.01      GECAMINES plays a major role in the Zairian economy:  in 1973,
it accounted for 55% of Zaire's tax revenues, 48% of net foreign exchange
receipts, and about 20% of GDP at factor cost (Annex 3-1). A 20% expansion
of GECAMINES will, therefore, accelerate the country's economic growth and
maintain the country's market position.
A.   Benefits to the Government
8.02      The estimated fiscal impact (in current terms) from the expansion
project which will accrue to the Zairian Government over a 15 year period
(1974-1988) is detailed in Annex 8-1 and summarized below.

Over the 1974-88 period, the Government of Zaire will receive some
US$1,146 million in revenues from the expansion project.
8.03      The above estimates do not include the indirect benefits which
will accrue to Zaire through the project's investment of 938 million in
social services (housing, schools, hospitals, basic infrastructure).
B.   Foreign Exchange Effect
8.04      The net foreign exchange surplus generated by the project is
detailed in Annex 8-2. After full production has been reached in 1979,
the project will increase GECAMINES' net foreign exchange receipts by 20%

per annum or an average of US$160 million (A 80 million) per annum. The
project will recover its investment in foreign exchange estimated at about
E160 million within less than 3 years after the project start-up.
C.   Employment Effect
8.05      The expansion project will generate additional permanent employment
for 2,000 local workers and 200 technical and managerial staff. Investment
cost per job created averages US$160,000. This figure is comparable to
similar employment creation in other countries, and indicates the high
capital intensity of mining operations. liowever, a major objective of
the expansion project is the accelerated training and integration of Zairian
personnel which should account for nearly 100% of the project's labor force
and about 70% of its staff.
8.06      Indirectly, the project will generate new demand for domestic con-
struction activities and to a lesser extent for domestically manufactured
products.  In the long-run GECAMINES should promote domestic industrialization
by offering to future domestic suppliers and sub-suppliers a stable, continuing
demand for equipment, construction and erection services.
D.   Economic Rate of Return of the Project
8.07      The economic importance of the project far exceeds its direct
financial benefits to GECA4INES as illustrated by the incremental economic
rate of return of 28%. The substantially hiigher economic than financial rate
of return of the project reflects GECAIINES payment of export duties and taxes.
The detailed calculations and sensitivity tests are given in Annex 8-3. The
project would maintain an economic rate of return of about 10%, even if copper
prices were to fall to US$0.60/lb and operating and capital cost were to
increase by 10%-20%.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      GECAMINES obtained the authorization from the Zairian Government
to contract loans for the expansion project of up to US$300 million
equivalent.
9.02      The joint Agreement arong the Republic of Zaire, the Libyan Arab
Republic, IBRD and GECAMINES will record the following major agreements and
assurances:
(a)  The Government will allow GECAMINES to hire without administrative
restrictions and delays sufficient local and expatriate expertise
to maintain the efficiency and productivity of its operations
(para. 2.04) and to ensure satisfactory project execution
(para. 4.15);

(b) GECAMINES and the Government will take any steps necessary to
ensure a supply of electric power for the maintenance of present
production levels until completion of the Inga-Shaba transmission
line (para. 2.17);
(c) The Government will cause the marketing company, SOZACOM, to
operate according to sound business practices, and will exchange
views with the Bank on the timing and transfer of marketing
responsibilities from SGM to SOZACOM (para. 3.20);
(d) The Government will provide project completion and cost overrun
guarantees (para. 5.07);
(e) The Government will cause GECAMINES, SGM, SOZACOM and the Central
Bank of Zaire to make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for
setting aside in a fund part of GECAM¢NES' sales receipts for debt
service payments (para. 5.08);
(f) GECAMINES will ensure adequate coordination between its Departments
and adequately staff its Finance Department (para. 2.06);
(g) GECAMINES will chose an adequate town site for 1,600 worker houses
and submit an implementation schedule satisfactory to the Bank by
April 30, 1975 (para. 4.11);
(h) GECAMINES will present to the Bank by end 1975 an organization
chart staffing and training plan for all new installations
(para. 4.19);
(i) GECAMINES will present to the Bank, and discuss by June 30, 1975,
a study reviewing the Company's depreciation policy (para. 7.03);
(j)  GECAMINES will have its accounts audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank (para. 7.07);
(k) GECAMINES will maintain a quick ratio of at least 1.3:1, and will
not distribute dividends unless full provision is first made for
the investment in the expansion project (para. 7.04);
(1) GECAMINES will not incur debt if this would raise the Company's
debt/equity ratio above 40/60 (para. 7.04);
(m) GECAMINES will consult with the Bank before making investments
in excess of certain limits described in para. 7.05).
9.03      With these agreements and assurances, the project provides a sound
basis for a Bank loan to GECAMINES equivalent to US$100 million, for 15
years including 4 years of grace.
