ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
Glossary of Technical Terms
AGGREGATE: Uncrushed or crushed gravel, stone or rock or artifically pro-
duced inorganic materials which form the major part of concrete.
In Gecamines, aggregate is produced by crushing limestone rock.
CLINKER:    The agglomerated or partly fused residue, following heating in
air to convert sulphide concentrates to oxides.
CONCENTRATOR: A plant which separates ore into economically valuable pro-
ducts (concentrates) and rejects (tailings). Usually refers to
a plant which utilizes the physical properties of the ore-mag-
netism, specific gravity.
DOLOIITE:  A mineral.  A carbonate of magnesium and calcium.  Also applies
to those rocks that approximate the mineral dolomite in composi-
tion.
ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATION: Air or gases are drawn through a high potential
direct current field causing the dust particles to acquire an,
electrical charge, and deposit themselves on the collecting sur-
face (the anode). One of the more efficient dust collection
methods.
ELECTRO-WINNING: Recovery of a metal by means of electrochemical processes.
In GECAMINES, the copper in an acidified copper sulphate solu-
tion is deposited on the cathode of an electrolytic bath. The
product, CATHODE COPPER, requires melting in a furnace to be
marketable as electrolytic copper.
FILTRATION: A process for separating solids from liquids by allowing the
liquids to pass through a finely woven cloth or gauze which
retains the solids. A vacuum or pressure is used to accelerate
the process.
FLOTATION:  A method of separation in which a froth created in water is
used, with a variety of reagents, to float finely ground minerals
whereas other minerals sink.
GERMANIUM: A grayish-white rare metallic element.  Its main use, having
exceptional properties as a semi-conductor, is in the manufacture
of solid rectifiers or diodes, and in transistors.
HYDRO-METALLURGY: The treatment of ores or concentrates by dissolution of
some component and its subsequent recovery from the solution.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
LEACHING:   The extraction of a soluble metallic compound from an ore or
concentrate by selectively dissolving in a suitable solvent,
such as water or sulphuric acid. The solvent is usually recovered
by precipitation of the metal or metals.
LIGNITE:    A coal of low rank with a high inherent moisture and volatile
matter.
ORE:        A naturally occurring mineral, or minerals, which can be mined at
a time, at a place, and at a benefit.
PELLETIZING: A method in which finely divided material is rolled in a drum
or on an inclined disk, so that the particles cling together in
small spherical pellets.  Usually requires the addition of heat
or reagents to ensure formation of pellets.
PRECAMBRIAN: Oldest rocks on the geological scale. Those rocks formed
before evidence of life first appeared on earth.
REFINING:   The purification of crude metallic products.  In copper, repre-
sents the final stage in the processing to relatively pure netal.
Usually accomplished by electro or fire methodls. Product is
usually called ELECTROLYTIC COPPER.
REVERBERATORY FUTRNACE: A furnace, with a shallow hearth, having a roof that
deflects the flame and radiates heat on the surface of the
charge.
ROASTING:   Heating an ore or concentrate to effect some chemical change
that will facilitate smelting. For sulphide ores, the roasting
converts the sulphides to oxides.
SEDIMENTARY: Rocks formed by the accumulation of sediments in water, or
from air.
SELECTIVE PRECIPITATION: The precipitation of specific metals in a solution
by changing its acidity, or through addition of reagents or heat.
SMELTING:   A metallurgical operation in which metal is separated by fusion
from those impurities with which it may be chemically combined
or physically mixed.  In copper, the metal is usually obtained
as a molten matte. The product is usually 70% copper.
STRATIFORM: A synonym for sedimentary rocks, which are usually bedded or
layered.



NTNEX 1

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
GECAMINES - HISTORY
1798      Earliest recorded mention of copper workings in Shaba (Katanga).
1890 -    First Belgian expedition to Shaba and subsequent surveying of
1905    the main mineral deposits in the area by the "Comite Speciale du
Katanga" (CSK) (founded in 1900) and "Tanganyika Concessions
Limited" (TCL) (founded 1899). The main objective was the
extraction of gold, but the considerable copper deposits soon
became apparent. The resulting discoveries were to be operated
in common, the necessary capital being supplied by the two parties
and the profits to be distributed at the rate of 60% for the
Comite Special du Katanga and 40% for the Tanganyika Concessions
Limited.
1906      Foundation of Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga (UMHK).  Comite
Special du Katanga in agreement with Tanganyika Concessions
Limited brought to Union Miniere the results of the mining
studies and prospections carried out in,Katanga, as well as
the rights stipulated in an agreement outlining the geo-
graphical limits of Union Miniere's activities and setting
forth the operations to be undertaken by the same. The
initial capital was set at 10 million Belgian francs, repre-
sented by 100,000 shares, subscribed 50-50 by the Societe
Generale de Belgique and TCL. A further 100,000 dividend
shares were assigned to CSK in consideration of its contri-
bution to be shared with TCL in the ratio of 60:40.
1907      Preliminary prospecting work terminated, continuing problems
with transport, endemic diseases and labor recruiting. Cold
first mined from the Ruwe mine; the working of the gold mines
as such was discontinued in 1911.
1910      The Rhodesian railway reached Lubumbashi (Elisabethville)
providing a link with South Africa and later on with Beira
(Mozambique). For transport in the Shaba province, steam
traction engines were used.
1911      Start-up of crude copper smelting at the Lubumbashi smelting
works.  The minerals are mined at the Etoile copper mine
near Lubumbashi.  Copper production cost amount to about
double the sales price.  Union Miniere's financial diffi-
culties were overcome by a 2-1/2 million BF capital increase
and a 10 million BF bond issue.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
1913      Production rose to 7,400 tons of copper.  Start-up of a
second furnace at Lubumbashi and the Kambove and Luisha
mines. Steam-powered mechanical shovels were being intro-
duced in the mines. Railway line reached Kambove, thus
providing transport within Katanga. Labor was recruited in
Mozambique and in Nyasaland to compensate for the lack of
local manpower.
1918      Mining of cassiterite (tin oxide) begins.  The ore was
worked until 1948. 85,000 tons of copper produced.
1919      The sale of Union Miniere products were entrusted to the
Societe Generale des Minerais (S.G.M.).
1921      First gold and silver recovered by refining blister
copper at the Societe Generale Metallurgique de
Hoboken, Belgium. Start-up of the Panda concentrator.
1922      Copper production reached 43,000 tons per year.  Uranium
bearing ore was worked to produce radium. This production
was stopped in 1960. Preparatory work for the exploitation
of the Kipushi mine; Union Miniere created two subsidiary
companies -- the construction and real estate firm "Compagnie
Fonciere du Katanga" (COFOKA) and the coal mining enterprise
"Charbonnage de Luena."
1924      First cobalt-copper alloy cast.
1927      Foundation of the "Minoteries du Katanga," another Union
Miniere subsidiary. The Panda plants were put into
operation with ore flotation installation, reverberatory
furnaces for the reduction of concentrates, electric
furnaces for the production of crude cobalt, thermal power
plant and laboratories.
1928      Railway reached Ilebo (Port-Francqui) opening up the national
rail-river route from Lubumbashi to Matadi. Union Miniere
experiments with a labor stabilization policy which led to
the settlement of the workers and their families close to
their work.
1929      Start-up of production of electrolytic copper at the
Likasi-Shituru plant. Production reached 137,000 tons
of copper, 700 tons of cobalt and 550 tons of tin ore.
Foundation of UMRK subsidiary "SOGECHIM" -- "Societe Generale
Industrielle et Chemique du Katanga" for the production of
sulphuric acid and palm oil.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
1930      Commissioning of the first hydro-electric power station
on the Lufira River by "SOGEFOR" -- Societe Generale des
Forces Hydro-Electriques du Katanga. Union Mliniere formed
another power company -- Societe Generale Africaine
d'Electricite "SOGELEC."
1931      Railway link to Dilolo completed, thus opening up the
way to Lobito via Benguela Railways of Angola. As
the result of the economic and monetary crisis the price
of copper fell from about 14 cents per pound to about
4 cents. Union Minieres production dropped from 139,000
tons in 1930 to 54,000 tons in 1932.
1932      Foundation of "SUD-KAT" -- Societe de Recherches Minieres du
Sud-Katanga.
1937      Start-up of production of zinc concentrates.  By roasting
the latter, sulphuric acid was produced of which the leaching
plant at Shituru consumes large amounts. Increase of Union
Miniere's capital to 300 million BF and consolidation of the
different securities outstanding to 1,242,000 bearer shares.
1943      Production of uranium concentrates from ores previously
processed only for the recovery of radium. During 1940-44
800,000 tons of copper were shipped.
1941/42   Closing down of the Kambove and Luishia mines.  Development
and expansion of the Kolwezi, Musonoi, Kamoto and Ruwe mines
as well as the Kolwezi and Kipushi concentrators.
1947      Start-up of cobalt metal production at the Likasi-Shituru
plant.
1948      Societe Generale Metallurgique du Katanga (METALKAT) was created
in 1948 for the purpose of transforming zinc concentrates
into electrolytic metal.
1952      Electrification of the railways.  Three new hydro-electric power
plants were installed during the 1950-56 period corresponding to
an average yearly capacity of 2,500 million kwh.
1953      First recovery of germanium and cadmium from Kipushi ores.
1956      Production reached 247,000 tons of copper, 9,000 tons of cobalt,
203,000 tons of zinc concentrates.
1960      Commissioning of the semi-automatic copper and cobalt electrolysis
plants at Luilu (Kolwezi). Production reached 300,000 tons of copper.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 4
1962      Start-up of automatic operations at the Kambove and Kakanda con-
centrators. Labor force reached about 20,000 people.
1961-
1963   Short production interruption and subsequent rehabilitation
of facilities during the political and military events.
Deliveries of metals were not subject to interruption: however,
production dropped to a low of 269,000 tons of copper and 7,300
tons of cobalt in 1963.
1965      A convention between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
the Katanga Company officially dissolved the Comite Special
du Katanga. 222,950 shares, 66,062 debentures and a nominal
certificate with 165,000 voting rights were transferred to the
Congolese Government, thus obtaining an 18% shareholding in
Union Miniere.
1967      The Congolese Government expropriated Union Miniere's assets
and confers them upon a new State-company -- GECOMINES (la
Generale Congolaise des Mines) constituted under Congolese
law with headquarters in Lubumbashi. On January 15, 1967
SGM and GECOMINES concluded a technical cooperation agreement
which assures the continuing operation of the production
facilities, the commercialization of GECOMINES' products and
a system of export financing.              1
1969      Amendments to the January 1967 convention regulated the com-
pensation question between Zaire and Union Miniere. The
compensation and technical cooperation fee was fixed at 6%
of gross sales for 15 years.
1970-
1974   GECAMINES (la Generale des (carrieres et des Mines du Zaire) 1/
initiated its first 5-year program (1970-74) which was to
increase copper production capacity from 360,000 tons per
year to 460,000 tons per year and cobalt production capacity
from 12,000 to 16,000 tons per year. New installations and
expansions included (i) exploitation of the Kamoto underground
mine, (ii) capacity expansions of the concentrators in Kalwezi,
Kambove and Kamoto, of the washing plant at Ruwe and the Luilu plants,
(iii) construction of an oxygen plant in Lubumbashi and (iv)
development of a new shaft at the Kipushi mine. Program
implementation proceeded according to schedule.
1/   GEOCOMINES was renamed GECAMINES in 1971.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSICN PROJECT
SUBSIDIARIES
1.        At the time of nationalization in 1967, GECAMINES had participations
in 11 subsidiaries in Zaire. The 1967 and 1969 convention between the Govern-
ment of Zaire and SGM, which regulated the compensation of Union Miniere's
assets, did not clearly stipulate the future of UMHK subsidiaries. Following
several disputes between the parties concerned, President Mobuto announced
on November 30, 1974 the nationalization of all former UMHK subsidiaries. The
concerned companies are being incorporated into existing State entities, such
as SNEL, GECAMINES, Office d'Alimentation, SONAS, etc. GECAMINES will own
and manage six of its ex-subsidiaries METALKAT, SOGECHIM, LA FONCIERE CML
(Ciments Metallurgique de Likasi), a flour mill (MINOTERIES DU KATANGA), the
coal mine Luena as well as several farms. All subsidiaries are directly re-
lated to GECAMINES metal production by producing intermediate products and
raw materials or processing GECAMINES' output.
A.   Coal Mine Luena
2.        GECAMINES has operated the Luena Coal Mine since 1967 when the
original owner "Societe de Charbonnages de la Luena" stopped production. On
August 16, 1973, the concessions of the "Societe de Charbonnages de la Luena"
were transferred to GECAMINES.
3.        The Luena Colliery has been exploiting the Kaluku deposit located
about 6 km south of Luena since 1962. At an annual production rate of 100,000
tons, the deposit will be depleted by 1976. The main consumers of the Luena
production have been GECAMINES (4,000-5,000 tons/month), CINSHABA (4,000-
5,000 tons/month), BRASSERIES SIMBA, VAP/LUBUMBASHI and AMATO-FRERES (300 tons/
month each).
4.        The Kaluku mine exploits a lignite coal with a high sulfur content
which is difficult to store or transport over long distances. The coal is
sorted and washed to yield 10-30 and 30-80 sized products.
5.        GECAMINES plans to increase its coal production in order to operate
a coal gasification unit (ANNEX 4-1, para. 45-49). After the depletion of the
Kaluku mine, the Company will reopen with modern mining techniques the Luena
and Kiaula mines which have been closed in 1960. The GECAMINES expansion
project includes 9 0.6 million for modernization of the Luena coal mine.
B.   UCS - Usines Chimigues de Shituru
6.        UCS (former SOGECHIM) was created in 1929.  Its installation includes
a sulfuric acid plant, a plant for palm oil hydrolysis and a water purifica-
tion plant.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
7.        The sulfuric acid plant is supplied by zinc concentrates from
Kipushi. Oxydation of the concentrate produces (i) zinc oxide which is trans-
ported and further processed in Kolwezi at UZK and (ii) sulfur anhydride
which after purification washing and drying gives sulfuric acid. Plant capac-
ity is 400 tons of sulfuric acid per day, which is used by the metallurgical
plants of Shituru and Luilu.
8.        GECAMINES requires refined palm oil as a reagent in the concentration
of its silicious oxide ores. USC operates a plant for palm oil hydrolysis in
Shituru which produces annually 5,000 tons of fat acid and 300 tons of glycer-
ine.
9.        The water purification plant treats water from the Panda River.
Daily consumption amounts to about 16,000 M3, of which GECAMINES retains one-
third for industrial uses and REGIDESO, the national water supply company,
distributes the remaining amount throughout Likasi.
10.       The financial position of ex-SOGECHIM has been excellent.  In 1973,
the sales volume reached 9 3.5 million with a net Income of X 0.7 million.
The subsidiary has no long-term debt, but equity of 9 3.1 million and a 2.0
current ratio. No notable expansions and capital investments have been en-
visaged during the seventies.
C.   SZARL - La Fonciere de Zaire
11.       La Fonciere, a real estate company, has been responsible for the
construction and maintenance of GECAMINES staff houses. After November 30,
1973, the management of non-GECAMINES property has been transferred to SONAS
(Societe Nationale d'Assurance). La Fonciere owns land and about 250 build-
ings in Shaba with an estimated value of 9 8.9 million. In 1973, the Company
realized a net profit of 9 1.4 million.
D.   CML-Cim       etalluriuesAejLkasi
12.       CML is the smallest of GECAMINES' subsidiaries.  Net fixed assets
in 1973 amounted to 9 173,000 and sales to 9 123,000. The Company produced
5,835 tons of filler, 2,248 tons of fibro-cement, 1,522 tons of ordinary ce-
ment and 32 tons of plaster. GECAMINES consumed about 65% of CNL's output.
E.   UZK - Usines de Zinc de Kolwezi
13.       UZK (formerly METALKAT) is located in Kolwezi and will be GECAMINES'
most important subsidiary. The company processes the zinc concentrate pro-
duced from the Kipushi ore. Recovery of the zinc ore involves the following
steps:
(a) Differential flotation of the ore in Kipushi yields a 26% copper
concentrate and 55% zinc concentrate.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
(b) Roasting of the zinc concentrate in the installation of UCS, in
Likasi (para. 6) recovers sulfuric acid and roasted zinc concentrate
with a content of 64% zinc, 1% copper, 0.3% cadmium.
(c)  At the UZK plants in Kolwezi the roasted concentrate is further
treated as described in Annex 2-4, para. 26 - 29, and yields
99.995% zinc ingots.
14.       The production facilities in Kolwezi employ about 670 people.  The
production capacity of electrolytic zinc plant is 72,000 tons per year, and
a small flotation plant established in 1970 allows the extraction of about
6,000 tons per year of concentrate from the leached residuals. In addition,
UZK recovers about 300 tons per year of cadmium.
15.       UZK (METALKAT), at the time of its incorporation in GECAMINES, had
a sound financial structure as indicated below:

16.       The known Kipushi ore reserves can supply UZK for another 10 years
at a production rate of 72,000 tons of zinc content per year.  Geological
surveys are underway in Kipushi to ascertain additional zinc/copper ore re-
serves. If these studies prove sufficient reserves, UZK intends to modernize
its production facilities to allow a 97% metal recovery as compared to 86%
at present. Preliminary investment costs for the modernization have been
estimated at s 6 million; however, the project will only be realized in the
early 1980's.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Legal Position
1.        La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines du Zaire (GECAMINES) --
created on January 2, 1967 -- is a state-ownedd company with headquarters in
Lubumbashi. The Company's statutes are defined as of September 14, 1972 and
amended by Law No. 74-011 dated July 10, 1974.
2.        The objectives of GECAMINES as defined by the statutes are (i)
exploration and exploitation of mineral deposits, (ii) the treatment of
minerals mined from these deposits, (iii) the sales of these mineral products
as well as (iv) all operations which are directly or indirectly related to
these activities.
3.        GECAMINES was managed originally by a Bdard of Directors comprising
a President (Mr. Kandolo Lopepe), five Directors, the General Manager and
the Deputy General Manager. On August 10, 1972 the Board of Directors was
dissolved as a result of Decree-law No. 72-034 and the Directors' functions
consequently ceased. Under GECAMINES' new statutes, published by Decree-law
No. 72-050, dated September 14, 1972, GECAMINES is under the supervision of
the President of the Republic and is managed by a General Manager assisted by
a Deputy General Manager, with full powers to conduct the operations of
the Company.
4.        Under Decree No. 72-311, dated August 10, 1972, Mr. Kandolo
Lopepe was appointed President of the Institut de Gestion du Portefeuille
- IGP (Portfolio Management Board) and given responsibility of permanent
liaison between GECAMINES and the Presidency of the Republic of Zaire.
GECAMINES' General Manager and his Deputy are appointed directly by the
President. Further, the Presidency of the Republic of Zaire has to authorize
(i) any debt in excess of one year and (ii) anv acquisition, liquidation of
transfer of financial assets.
5.        GECAMINES' financial operations have to be conducted according to
sound accounting and financial practices. The statutes require an annual
allocation of 5% of net profits to statutary reserves until these reserves
have reached 10% of the Company's equity capital.
B.   Organizational Structure
6.        Chart No. 1 and Chart No. 2 of this Annex give an overall view of
GECAMINES' organizational structure. GECAMINES is sub-divided into functional
departments such as Production, Finance, Purchasing, Marketing, etc., and
regional departments for the Western Group and the Central Group.  However,



ANNEX 2-3
Page 2
the regional directors have mainly administrative and representation functions
and do not direct the Company's production activities.
7.        GECAMINES' organizational structure reflects the Company's history.
Traditionally, all operational aspects were directed from Lubumbashi, but
financial, marketing and purchasing functions centered in Brussels. Conse-
quently, after nationalization GECAMINES had not only to take over UMHK
activities in Shaba, but had to define and form a new organizational entity
in Lubumbashi. This restructuration included:
(i) the creation of a Finance Department in 1971 and
introduction of a cost accounting system.
(ii) the strengthening of the Lubumbashi Purchasing
Department. At present about 35% of orders for
equipment, materials and supplies are channeled
through SCM in Brussels.
(iii) the creation of a Marketing Department in Lubumbashi.
It functions primarily as liaison and iniformation
office, since the commercialization of GECAMINES'
products were entrusted to SGM and in the future will
be handled by the Zairian marketing organization, SOZACOM
(Annex 3-4).
8.        The geographical distribution of GECAMINES' operations in three
centers (Western, Central and Southern Group) contrasts with the Company's
organizational structure which is geared towards Lubumbashi: For example,
the Production Department is grouped according to functions such as mines,
concentrators, metallurgical plants, instead of regional production centers.
An exception is the Western Group where a mining manager is responsible for
all mining activities in the Kolwezi area. Such a coordinating function is
urgently needed, since the Western Group accounts for about 65% of GECAMINES'
metal production. During the next 2 - 3 years, GECAMINES should review its
organizational structure and reassess the functional relationships vis-a-vis
an allocation of operational responsibilities.
C.   Management
9.        On November 30, 1973, Mr. Umba Kyamitala, a mining engineer with
more than ten years experience in GECAMINES, replaced Mr. De Merre as General
Manager. Mr. Umba is assisted by a Deputy General Manager, (presently vacant)
eight Managers, and three advisors including Mr. Kort (technical secretary),
Mr. Sorel (Production) and Mr. Rocher (Finance). With the exception of
Mr. Rocher who joined GECAMINES in 1971 when the Finance Department was
established in Lubumbashi, all managers have been with the Company for many
years. GECAMINES' technical staff appears to be competent, experienced and
compares favorably with the staff of other international mining companies.



ANNEX 2-3
Page 3
10.       The Company has pursued an active Africanization program on the
staff level.  When GECAMINES was formed in 1967, Zairian salaried staff
amounted to no more than 11.5% of total staff, whereas in 1973 African staff
numbered 923 out of a total of 2,427 (38%).

Africans
However, Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 2-7 indicate that
(i)  only 5% of all doctors and engineers are African compared
to a Company average of 37%, and that
(ii)  Africans are primarily employed for general and administrative
services. For example, Africans account for about 70% of the
staff in personnel administration and about 50% of staff em-
ployed for social services and general administration, while
only 20% of the mining staff and 27% of staff in the metallurgical
plants are Africans.
11.       GECAMINES is actively recruiting and training Zairian personnel.  The
Company maintains close contact with local and foreign universities, in partic-
ular engineering schools. However, while sufficient graduates in the social
sciences are available in Zaire, a continuing lack of Zairian engineers impedes
the Africanization of GECAMINES' production facilities. It is thus essential
that a national policy be developed to direct capable young people into tech-
nical careers and that the corresponding university facilities be encouraged.
Table 2 in Annex 2-7 illustrates the objective of GECAMINES' Zairization
program: The Company expects to employ a staff of 2,884 people in 1981 of
which 64% would be African.



ANNEX 2-3
Page 4
12.       Staff training within GECAMINES is directed by the "Division de la
Promotion Professionnelle et de l'Organisation". Staff training has been
progressive, and is an excellent example of integration of national personnel
into a corporate set-up. It is mainly of four forms:
(i) Trainee-ship outside of GECAMINES, primarily in Europe.
These trainee assignments have been organized by "Bureau
d'Etudes et de Documentation Sociales (B.E.D.S.) in Belgium.
Thirty trainees were sent abroad in 1972.
(ii) Scholarships for employees and their children to attend
educational institutions on the technical, secondary and
university level. 302 such scholarships have been awarded
in 1972.
(iii) Seminars for Junior staff in Lumbumbashi, and management
seminars in Kinshasa organized by IRI under the sponsorship
of the "Institut de Gestion du Portefeuille."
(iv)  Audio-visual language instruction.
13.       GECAMINES' recruitment policy foresees hiring of expatriates only
for jobs which require more than 3 years of experience or highly spcialized
training. Following the April 1974 agreements with SGM, all foreign personnel
have a direct contractual relationship with GECAMINES without SGM's back-up
employment guarantees. In the past, the majority of expatriate staff worked
for the Company for a life time, or at least for an extended period of time.
In the future, GECAMINES will experience a higher turnover which should even-
tually approach the job rotation pattern generally experienced by international
companies operating in developing countries, i.e., a turnover of 10-15%.
GECAMINES lost a number of expatriate staff since nationalization. This loss
was only partially overcome by hiring Zairian and temporary personnel. Never-
theless, the technical complexity of the GECAMINES operations will continue
to attract competent and motivated expatriate staff from french speaking coun-
tries. However, the availability of such personnel will depend on the politi-
cal stability in Zaire, the pace of Africanization and, therefore, the career
prospects of expatriates. In addition, recent difficulties in obtaining
working visas for foreigners should be eliminated.
14.       Expatriate staff is hired by SGM's Recruitment Department in Belgium
which requires an average of 6 months to find suitable staff for GECAMINES.
To supplement staff vacancies or recruit for special tasks, GECAMINES engages
professionals on a 6 - 24 month basis. At present the Company employs about
200 temporary staff, primarily engineers from supplier companies. Regarding
future expatriate personnel, a turnover of 9.5% for full-time staff members
and 50% for temporary staff is expected. Taking into account such turnover
and the present vacancies, about 100-250 expatriates per year will be required
until 1976, and annually 80 people thereafter.



ANNEX 2-3

Technical Assistance
15.       An agreement was reached in April 1974 between the Government of
Zaire, GECAMINES and SGM which adopted a new framework for SGM's technical
assistance to GECAMINES. Accordingly, SGM will make available to GECAMINES
or undertake at the latter's demand:
a)   purchasing services; in particular, surveying of suppliers,
contract negotiation, technical control, transport and payment
arrangements of equipment, materials and supplies.
b)   any studies relating to GECAMINES activities, in particular
operations of its production facilities, procurement of equip-
ment and documentation.
c)   personnel administration assistance-non-Zairian personnel; primarily
recruitment, organization of visits and trainee-ships, insurance
and retirement benefits, assistance during home leave.
16.       Remuneration of these activities is based on actual expenses as
outlined in an annual budget agreed upon by both partners. SCM in Brussels
maintains a division responsible for the GECAMINES activities. During 1974
SGM expects to render the following services, estimated at US$6.5 million:

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
Existing Operations and Technical Facilities
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        Gecamines' production facilities are grouped in three geographical
areas--the Kolwezi area (Western group), the Likasi region (Central group),
and the Lubumbashi area (Southern group). The distances from Lubumbashi to
Likasi and Kolwezi are 125 km and 300 km, respectively.
2.        Gecamines also treats different types of ores--dolomitic oxide,
siliceous oxide, mixed, and sulphide ores. The usual sequence for production
of copper from oxide ores involves: mining of ore; concentrating the economic
minerals utilizing their physical characteristics; hydro-metallurgical treat-
ment of the concentrate by an acid leach to dissolve the copper and other
metals; electro-winning whereby the metals in solution are deposited selectively
by electrolysis on cathodes; and finally refining tbe cathodes to obtain rela-
tively pure metal. For sulphide ores, the sequence is: mining of the ore;
concentration of the economic minerals; smelting of the concentrate to obtain
copper anodes; refining of the anodes, usually by electrolysis, to obtain rela-
tively pure metal.
3.        The geographical separation and different treatment processes results
in a complex production flowsheet (see Annex 2-4, page 11). For the sake of
clarity, this description of Gecamines has been presented by geographical group
so that the production sequence can be followed through the various steps to
pure metal.
4.        Gecamines prepares yearly, five year, and ten year plans to ensure
sufficient feed to the various plants, and that the Company's objectives are
met. All the facilities operate at a high percentage of rated capacity. The
plants and equipment are well maintained. The older facilities have continu-
ously been mdified and up-dated. As a result, most of the plants yield good
metal recoveries.
5.        This description of Gecamines' operations is based on the mission's
visits to most of the facilities, and on data supplied by Gecamines.
B. WESTERN GROUP
6.        The ore deposits in the western group are of the stratiform type.
The general description of the geology given below for the Kamoto mine is
typical of the deposits in the area.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 2
7.        Most of the expansion in the company's production has been centered
in the west. It is also the location of the proposed expansion to 590,000 t.
of copper. 75% of Gecamines' ore is mined and concentrated within the Western
Group. Six open pit mines and one underground mine, one washing plant and
two concentrators, treat some 11,100,000 t of ore per annum.
1.   Mines
Kamoto Underground Mine
8.        The ore zone consists of two mineralized strata (each 12 meters
thick) separated by a barren layer (12 to 20 m thick), and is basin shaped.
The overall length is approximately 1,500 m. The strata dip north at 250 -
30° in the western section with the dip gradually increasing to 700 - 900 in
the eastern portion. Below 350 m, the ore zone becomes virtually flat.
9.        The upper part of the ore zone was mined by open pit methods, and
development for underground mining commenced in 1959. Five shafts service
the underground - No. 1 shaft is used for production, No. 2 for personnel
and material, No. 3 for development work below the 307m level, and Nos. 4
and 5 for ventilation.
10.       In the flatter western portion of the ore zone, sublevel caving has
been used. This method is being superseded by transversal mechanized cut and
fill. The eastern part is mined by longitudinal meehanized cut and fill.
The mine produced 2,010,000 tons of mixed ore in 1973. Output will be ex-
panded to 3,000,000 t by 1977.
11.       The mine utilizes large, modern underground equipment.  The operation,
designed and operated on a sound engineering basis, compares favorably with
similar mines in the world. The equipment and facilities are well maintained.
Open Pit Mining
12.       The open pit mining in the western group can be divided into three
areas - Kamoto, Musonoi, and Mutoshi. The open pit operations are quite
similar throughout the company and the equipment and methods show little
variation. The oxide ores are relatively soft and do not usually require
blasting. Following extraction of the ore to the economic depth, the pits
are backfilled with waste from nearby pits.
Kamoto
13.       Kamoto.  There are presently three active pits in this area, Kamoto
East, Kamoto North and Mupine. These mines produce approximately 4,500,000 t
annually. Conventional equipment - 6, 9, 15 cu yd shovels, 45 and 100 t
trucks and 9-7/8" drills, is used.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 3
14.       Musonoi  Lying immediately to the east of the Kamoto pits, these
two pits supply 950,000 t annually. The Musonoi and Kamoto pits are connected
to a central dispatching unit to optimize use of equipment. The dispatching
unit also records the tonnages extracted, and waste removed.
15.       Mutoshi.  W4hile this pit does supply some 500,000 tons per annum of
typical ore, the main production is 2,700,000 t of breccia ore grading 1.50%
copper. This breccia ore consists of chunks of malachite in a clay matrix.
The stripping ratio (over the next ten years) is 2 waste to 1 ore; consider-
ably lower than other Gecamines' pits. The waste is removed by 15 c.y.
shovels and 100 t trucks. The ore is extracted by draglines and loaded in
rail cars for delivery to the Mutoshi washing plant.
2.   Concentration Plants
16.       Mutoshi Washing Plant.  The breccia ore, after washing and screening,
is treated by gravity separators (jigs) to produce a copper concentrate of
the heavier particles. The jig tailings are screened, with the oversize treated
in a heavy media separation and the fines (-1 mm) shipped to the Kolwezi con-
centrator for retreatment.
17.       Kolwezi Concentrator.  Now treating oxyde and mixed ores in different
sections of the plant during different periods of the year, the concentrator
will be used exclusively for oxyde ores following construction of the new con-
centrator. The feed to the oxyde circuit comes from the Musonoi, Kamoto, and
Mupine pits, and the fines from the Mutoshi washing plant. The oxide ores,
following crushing and grinding, are treated by flotation using a mixture
of palm oil and fuel oil as a collector and frother. 4,600,000 t of ore are
treated annually in this concentrator. Starting in 1977, the concentrator
will treat 2,000,000 of lower grade ore previously stockpiled.
18.       Kamoto Concentrator.  The newest concentrator in the Gecamines group,
Kamoto treats 3,600,000 tons of ore per year. The first section was completed
in late 1968, and the other in mid-1972. Both sections treat mixed ores al-
though Section II has larger, more modern equipment and a slightly different
flowsheet. After crushing and grinding, the mixed ores are treated by dif-
ferential flotation. The sulphides are floated first by the addition of
reagents to collect the sulphides. Other reagents are then added to alter
the physical characteristics of the minerals and float the oxides. The sulphide
concentrates are re-treated to produce a copper rich-cobalt poor concentrate
and a cobalt rich concentrate. The cobalt rich concentrates are pumped to
the Liulu Hydrometallurgical plant for further processing. The copper rich
concentrates are shipped to the Lubumbashi smelter.
3.   Metallurgical Plants
Luilu Hydrometallurgical Plant
19.       Production was initiated in 1960 with a capacity of 100,000 tons of
copper per annum. Expansion and modifications resulted in a capacity of
175,000 t of copper and 10,000 t of cobalt in 1973.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 4
20.       The sulphide ores are oxidized in a fluo-solid roaster to produce
sulphates and oxides of copper. These concentrates, together with the
siliceous oxide concentrates are then treated in a sulphuric acid primary
leaching circuit to obtain the copper, cobalt and other metals in solution.
21.       Thickening and clarification separates the solution of dissolved
metals from the sands. The sands are washed and filtered to remove all the
copper in solution, and then are discarded. Part of the solution is treated
to adjust the pH which removes some of the iron.  The solution is also fed to
selenium removal units.
22.       The solution, containing 17 to 20 g/l of H2SO4 and 65 to 70 g/l of
copper, is fed to the Electro-winning circuit where the copper is deposited
on cathode starter sheets. The depleted solution containing 60-70 g/l of
H2SO4 and 28 to 34 g/l of copper is returned to the primary leaching circuit,
with some 5% of the solution bled off to a secondary leaching circuit.
23.       The cathode starter sheets are prepared in a special section of
the electrolysis circuit. A solution (also from the thickening and clari-
fication section but containing 150 g/l of H2SO4 an d 45 g/l of copper) is
electrolysed under controlled conditions to produce sheets with a satisfactory
structure and which can be removed without tearing.
24.       The secondary leaching circuit is used to treat dolomitic oxide
concentrates. The high acid consumption of the dolomites is utilized to
neutralize the excess acid in the solution. Otherwise the process is as out-
lined above for the primary circuit. The solution is treated by electrolysis
and the depleted solution containing 22-28 g/l of H2SO4 and 10-15 g/l of copper
is returned to the secondary leaching circuit.
25.       Some of the depleted solution from the secondary circuit is bled
off to form the feed to the cobalt circuit. Following treatment of the solution
to remove the balance of the copper, and other metals (iron, zinc, nickel,
etc.) by selective precipitation the solution is too weak for proper cobalt
electrolysis. The cobalt is, therefore, precipitated and re-dissolved. This
solution is then treated by electrolysis to recover the cobalt. This cobalt
(in the form of small plates) is then refined in vacuum furnaces to remove
entrained hydrogen and produce high quality cobalt metal.
4.   Kolwezi Zinc Plant (UZK)
26.       Formed in 1948 as a subsidiary of Belgian interests, the company
(known as Metalkat) commenced production in 1953 with a capacity of 48,000 t
of zinc metal. Expansion and modifications have resulted in a plant with
a capacity of 72,000 t. As of 1 January 1974, DMetalkat has been absorbed
into Gecamines as a wholly owned subsidiary.
27.       Prior to treatment in the Kolwezi Zinc Plant, the zinc concentrates
(from the Kipushi min'e in the Southern Group) are roasted at the UCS sulphuric
acid plant at Likasi. The roasting oxidizes the sulphide minerals and yields
sulphur dioxide gas for the production of sulphuric acid.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 5
28.       These roasted concentrates are then subjected to leaching at the
zinc plant to obtain the zinc in solution. Other metals (copper, cadmium,
arsenic, cobalt) in varying quantities are also dissolved. Following treat-
ment of the solution to selectively precinitate these metals, it is then
treated by electrolysis to deposit the zinc. This cathode zinc is melted
in induction furnaces and cast as zinc ingots. Some zinc powder is also
produced.
29.       The precipitates mentioned above are used to produce copper cement
(94% copper) and cadmium metal. The cadmium is produced in a special
electrolytic section, melted and casted as sticks.
C. CENTRAL GROUP
30.       The mines in the Central Group are located near the town of Likasi.
They presently produce some 1,500,000 t of ore per annum, which is treated
in the Kambove and Kakanda concentrators. In addition, the Kambove concen-
trator has been re-treating some 600,000 t of low grade ore stockpiled during
mining of the M'sesa and Kazibizi open pits.
31.       The ore deposits in the Central Group are also of the stratiform
type. The geology is similar to that described for the mines of the western
group.
1.   Mines
Kambove Underground Mine
32.       The upper portion of the ore zone was mined by open pit until 1965.
Production from underground commenced in 1963. Three shafts service the
underground -- No. 1 shaft is the production, No. 2 the personnel and materials,
No. 3, ventilation.
33        Since 1968, the sublevel caving method of mining has been used.
Although the method has permitted high and expanding levels of production,
it does have the disadvantage of a high percentage dilution.
34.       It is expected to increase production from approximately 800,000 t
to 1,400,000 t per year by 1975.
Open Pit Mining
35.       There are presently two active open pits in the Central Group -- the
Kakanda East and Kakanda North. Economically exploitable reserves by surface
mining are expected to be exhausted by 1977. The production will be replaced
by the expansion in output from Kambove mine and exploitation of previously
stock piled mixed ore of the Kazibizi open pit. Production has been approxi-
mately 800,000 t per 'year for the past few years.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 6
36.       The method of mining is similar to that used in the open pits in
the Western Group. 6, 9, 15 cu. yd. shovels, 100 t trucks, 9-7/8" drills, are
the main equipment items used.
2.   Concentrators
37.       Kambove.  Constructed in 1961 with a capacity of 860,000 tons per
year, the concentrator has been expanded to 1,400,000 tons per year. The
plant is thus reasonably up to date, and it has been well maintained. Mineral
dressing techniques are good -- yielding good mineral recoveries considering
the types of ore treated. The concentrator treats mixed ores, and oxide ores
during different periods of the year. The flowsheet is similar to that of the
Kolwezi concentrator. Kambove will be used exclusively for treatment of the
mixed ores from the Kambove mine after 1975.
38.       Kakanda.  Constructed in 1962 with a capacity of 300,000 t of ore,
the Kakanda concentrator has also undergone expansion to a capacity of
720,000 by 1965. The concentrator is comparable to the Kambove concentrator
in design and equipment. It is used to treat oxide ores using the palm oil
method. The concentrator is presently supplied from the Kakanda East and
Kakanda North open pits. After 1977, the concentrator will be modified to
treat mixed ores.
3.   MIetallurgical Plants
Shituru Hydrometallurgical Plant
39.       The Shituru plant, at Likasi, was constructed in 1929 at a capacity
of 35,000 t of copper per year. The plant was originally built to treat
oxide ores by acid leaching. Hlowever, by 1932, oxide concentrates were used
exclusively. Expansion and modification have resulted in a plant similar
to that at Luilu. Capacity is presently 135,000 t per year of copper and
6,000 t of cobalt.
40.       Although the plant is old, it has been exceptionally well maintained.
The Shituru plant operates at a high percentage availability. It is not as
efficient as the Luilu plant, and does not have the modern process control
used at Luilu. Recoveries are also showing a slight decline. However, all
considered, the operation of the Shituru plant is extremely good.
41.       As indicated above, the process is similar to that of the Luilu
plant. The technology, being less modern, does result in products of lower
quality. The difference in the copper is very slight. However, the cobalt
cathodes are 94% Co and must be fire-refined to remove some of the metallic
impurities and sulphur. The granules produced are shipped to Luilu for
further refining, or are sold.
42.       The Shituru plant also includes a copper refinery.  The cathode
copper from electro-winning (99.5% Cu) is refined in reverberatory furnaces
(99.95% Cu) and cast as wire-bar or ingot copper. One of the furnaces is
used to produce anodes for use in electro-winning.

D. SOUTHERN GROUP
43.       Site of some of first mining in Shaba province, the facilities in
the Southern Group are among the oldest in Gecamines. However, these
facilities are being modernized on a systematic basis. The existing facilities
are in excellent condition and yield good metallurgical recoveries. The
company's executive, administrative, and research facilities are also located
in Lubumbashi, center of the Southern Group.
1.   Kipushi Underground Mine
44.       The oldest producing mine in Gecamines, Kipushi commenced production
from underground in 1926. As outlined in the geology annex, it is also the
only vein type deposit being mined. Production is presently at 1,090,000 tons
of copper-zinc ore per year.
45.       The principal mining method, top slicing, is comparably labor in-
tensive, and difficult to modernize. One major improvement has been the
introduction of steel support and mats, eliminating the fire hazard of wood
which had plagued the operation.
46.       The satellite zones are mined by sublevel stoping.  These zones
are small and quite irregular, but the method is well adapted to the condi-
tions.
47.       As part of the first expansion plan (1969-74), a new shaft (#5)
was sunk to develop the deeper portion of the ore zone. This work is to
be completed by 1975. The mine will also be converted to mechanized cut and
fill, and output expanded to 1,400,000 tons of ore. This change should in-
crease percentage extraction and lower mining costs.
2.   Concentration Plants
Kipusiti
48.       Originally constructed in 1935 at a capacity of 250,000 t of ore
per year, the Kipushi concentrator used simple flotation followed by gravity
separation. At this stage, only copper was recuperated.
49.       After considerable research, a method of differential flotation
was developed to produce copper concentrates, zinc concentrates (and period-
ically), lead concentrate. The plant actually has two circuits -- one for
copper-zinc ores, and the other for zinc rich ores. Capacity is presently
1,100,000 tons of ore per year.
50.       The present bottleneck in the operation -- the crushing plant --
will be eliminated with the start-up of the new underground facilities.
Following crushing underground, the ore will be hoisted to the grinding
plant near the shaft and pumped to the present flotation circuit. The grind-
ing plant will be equipped with autogenous grinding mills. The plant capacity
will then be 1,400,000 tons of ore per year.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 8
3.   Metallurgical Plants
Lubumbashi Smelter
51.       Originally placed in operation in 1911 for the treatment of oxide
ores, the smelter has evolved over the years into a classic smelting operation.
Presently the bulk of the feed consists of copper concentrates from Kipushi
and copper rich concentrates from the Western Group.
52.       The concentrates are first roasted in a Dwight Lloyd roaster.  This
is followed by smelting with the addition of rich concentrates, silica,
converter slag, etc. in water jacket furnaces to produce a copper matte.
The matte is fed to a converter for production of blister copper (at 98% Cu).
The blister is cast into 150 kg ingots.
53.       Periodically, the plant is used to treat oxides to produce a "Black
copper" (94% Cu). During these periods, the "mud" and nodules from electro-
winning and slag from refining at Shituru are added to the circuit.  The
process - roasting, smelting -- is basically the same, although there is
no convertor operation. The additives are, of course, different.
54.       Improvements during the last expansion program increased the
capacity from 130,000 t of copper to 165,000 t. These included construction
of an oxygen plant to permit enrichment of the air used in the furnaces and
converters. A pelletizing unit also permitted addition of rich concentrates
directly to the converter.
55.       Although some of the equipment is quite old, it is expected that
further modifications during the next expansion program will result in a
modern plant.
E.   Research Facilities
1.   Mining Studies and Research
56.       The mining research facilities are located at Lubumbashi.  Applied
research in the fields of operations research and rock mechanics represent the
principal activities of the section.
57.       In operations research, the studies undertaken range from optimizing
the production schedule of the treatment plant in view of mining constraints;
thru underground design and scheduling; to equipment studies. Studies are
scheduled in relation to the possible overall benefit to the Company.
58.       Work in the rock mechanics section has been concerned mainly with
slope stability and design in the open pit mines. Laboratory and field studies
have also been of the mining methods used in the Kamoto underground mine.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 9
2.   Metallurgical Studies and Research
59.       The metallurgical research facilities are located at Likasi.  The
group is divided into six sections--mineral dressing, pyrometallurgical,
hydrometallurgical, operations research, engineering, and analytical labora-
tories.
60.       The mineral dressing section deals with the physical concentration
of the ore. This has covered, mainly, the use of reagents and pilot studies
for concentration of new ore deposits.
61.       The pyro-metallurgical section has been concerned with development
and testing of the flash smelting process for the expansion unit.
62.       The hydro-metallurgical section is currently working on pilot tests
for solvent extraction of the solutions from the leaching circuits. The aim
is to upgrade the solutions sufficiently to produce electro-grade copper in
the electro-winning circuits.
63.       All three sections have well equipped laboratories.  In addition to
the specific studies indicated above, they routinely study areas of the exist-
ing operations as required.
64.       The operations research section undertakes studies on optimization
of production, costing of new projects, treatment plant design, etc.
65.       The engineering section has worked on such studies as:  development
and testing of equipment; improvement of wear parts, etc. It also assists in
selection of standardized equipment, conveyor belts, for example.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
GEOLOGY AND ORE RESERVES
A.   Geolpgy
1.         Gecamines holds concession rights over an 18,000 km2 (300 km long
by 60 km wide) in southern Shaba province (see Map IBRD No. 11155).  Commonly
known as the Copper Concession, the rights cover all minerals which may occur.
The company also holds concession rights (known as the Tin Concession) to a
larger area to the north of the Copper Concession. However, little work has
been done on this concession.
2.         Descriptions of the geology can be found in the following reports:
1.   La Cuvette orientale du Haut Katanga, A. Timmerhans, Ann. Soc.
Geol. Bel. T LIV, pp. 71-87, 1930.
2.   La Tectonique des gites de cuivre du Katanga, M. Schulling,
Centenaire d'A. I. Lg. Congres 1947, Sect. Col. pp. 309-313, 1947.
3.   Geologie et Geographie du Katanga, M. Robert, Brussels, 1956.
4.   The Precambrian of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi, L. Cahen and
J. Lepersonne, The Precambrian, Vol. 3, p. 143, 1967.
5.   L'Extreme Occidentale de L'Arc Cuprifere Shabien-etude geologique,
A. Francois, Gecamines, 1973.
3.         There are two types of ore within the Copper Concession.  The most
important are the sedimentarv or stratiform deposits which make up the bulk
of the ore reserves. The other is a vein type deposit (found in the southern
part of the concession) of the copper-zinc ore. These deposits represent some
of the world's highest grade copper reserves.
4.         The stratiform ore occurs within two specific formations in the
Roan series of the sedimentary system known locally as Katangian. The upper
formation is a sandy shale containing some carbonates. The lower formation
is a bedded dolomitic sandstone. Separating the two formations is siliceous
dolomite some 13 to 22 meters in thickness. The ore formations average
approximately ten meters in thickness. While these formations within the
Roan series are not always mineralized, the major ore deposits do occur with-
in this series.
5.         The structural geology of the ore deposits is quite complex.  Three
different ages of tectonic activity have been identified. As a result, the
ore formations are heavily folded, and are often interrupted by faults. In
some areas, they are not present, having been eroded away or otherwise dis-
placed.



ANNEX 2-5
Page 2
6.        The most common copper mineral is Chalcocite (essentially CuS2).
The cobalt usually occurs as Carrolite (Co2CuS4). Accessory elements include
selenium, nickel, gold and silver.
7.        The sulphide mineralization has been altered by weathering in those
portions of the ore zones close to surface. This weathering varies consider-
ably in depth from one deposit to the other (80 metres to 450 metres). As a
result, the sulphide minerals have been altered to carbonates (malachite),
silicates (chryscolla, Katangite, Bisbecite) and phosphates (Pseudomalachite,
Libethenite).
8.        The alteration has also resulted in important supergenetic movements.
The ore formations may be completely leached out, whereby the mineralization
has disappeared or been concentrated in normally sterile formations. On the
other hand, econcomic concentrations of oxidized minerals may be derived from
low grade sulphide mineralization.
9.        There is only one known economic vein deposit within the Copper
Concession, the Kipushi, which is in the southern group.  It consists of
massive sulphides within the dolomites known locally as Kakontwe, along the
Kipushi fault. It has been classed as a metasomatic hydrothermal deposit.
Three distinct types of zones are mined-copper rich, zinc rich, and mixed
copper-zinc. The principal minerals are chalcopyrite, bornite, cadmiumiferous
sphalerite, galena, and pyrite. Accessory minerals&include Arsenopyrite,
Tennantite.
10.       With the stratiform type of ore deposit, geological mapping is of
the utmost importance in the discovery of new ore deposits. Gecamines'
program of mapping is proceeding in a systematic well planned fashion. The
whole of the concession area has been mapped on a 1:200,000 scale. In
addition, Gecamines has a well developed program of geological mapping on a
scale of 1:20,000. A significant portion of this program (approximately 50%)
has been completed.
11.       In areas identified as likely to be of economic importance, maps
at scales of 1:5,000 and/or 1:1,000 are prepared. Some diamond drilling may
also be undertaken to further evaluate the deposit. The deposit would then
be placed on the schedule for detailed evaluation. The timing of this
detailed evaluation depends on the company's needs and priorities. For example,
one aim is to supply the concentrators, smelters, etc. with ore from within
that group to minimize ore transport.
12.       The Company has also surveyed the copper concession with airborne
magnetic and radiometric surveys and has within the past few years, undertaken
an extensive program of geochemical surveys.
B.   Ore Reserves
13.       Measured ore reserves in the Copper Concession total 646 million
tons of 3.95% copper and 0.3% cobalt for the stratiform ore; and 10 million
tons of 4.9% copper and 11.8% zinc for the vein type deposit. The potential



ANNEX 2-5
Page 3
reserves, in both cases, are probably of the order of twice the measured
reserves. The company has sufficient measured reserves to last more than 40
years at the projected rate of mining.
14.       The ore reserves are conservatively estimated, with allowances for
dilution, sampling error, and cut-off grade based on experience.
15.       65% of the known reserves are located in the Western group of the
Concession. Approximately 75% of the presently known reserves are estimated
to be mineable by open pit methods.
16.       The reserve estimates have been verified and discussed with the
Company. Since they represent confidential information, no further details
are presented here.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
INFRASTRUCTURE
A.   Transport
1.        There are two types of transport to consider:  (i) Internal trans-
port of Gecamines materials at various stages of processing; and (ii) Transport
of exported products from Shaba province to coastal ports. In the first case,
Gecamines with KDL a state owned railway operating in Southern Zaire, are
responsible. In the second case, four alternate routes, each with multiple
carriers, are used to transport Gecamines' exports.
1.   Internal Transport
2.        The distances between the three groups (Western, Central, and
Southern) and transfer of material for further processing results in exten-
sive requirements for material movement.
3.        Gecamines has its own locomotives and cars for movement of ores,
concentrates, and other materials within each site. The movement of material
from site to site and group to group is provided by KDL.
4.        Gecamines owns ore cars of the bottom dump type, and fixed box
type. Some of these are quite old but have been well maintained. All loco-
motives owned by Gecamines are in a good state of repair. Normal maintenance
is performed at the maintenance facilities located in the Central and Uestern
group, on a regularly scheduled basis.
5.        With the increased use of pipelines for transport of concentrates,
and the good condition of the equipment and rail lines, no transport problems
should be encountered in the expansion of output. In effect, the movement
of materials in the expansion project creates little additional load on the
rail transport system. The bulk of the material will be moved by other
means -- pipeline, conveyor, etc.  The major additions are the 120,000 t of
copper exports, 75,000 tons of lignite, and 25,000 t of limestone.
2.   External Tragryt
6.        Four rail transportation routes (see IBRD 'tap #11156) are available
for export of Gecamines products. This number of routes offers more flexibi-
lity than is found in most mining projects.



ANiiLX 2-6
Page Z
7.        An assessment of each of the four routes indicates that difficulties
could be encountered on each of the lines. In addition, political decisions
in neighbouring countries could affect exports to an unknown extent on three
of the routes. The four routes ship products via Matadi, Dar-es-Salaam, Beira
and Lobito.
a)   Matadi (Voie Nationale)
8.        This all Zairian route is composed of the KDL rail line to Ilebo,
river barge on the Kasai and Zaire river from Ilebo to Kinshasa, and rail
line from Kinshasa to the port of Matadi. The river and rail link are operated
by ONATRA, a state owned organization. The total distance is 2,750 km and
requires 20 to 25 days transport time.
9.        Gecamines is required by the government to export 270,000 tons of
copper by this route. Ilowever, actual shipments have fallen short of this
due to constraints on the river portion of the route. In 1973, 240,000 tons
were actually shipped. ONATRA, in a Bank financed project, expects to increase
capacity on the river route, with 300,000 tons available for copper by 1977.
Supply of the casting plant to be constructed in Bas, Zaire near Kinshasa will
be via this route. The plant will have an initial capacity of 100,000 t in
1978, to be expanded to 200,000 t in the early 1980's.
10.       The major problems to be expected on this route involve the river
portion. Delays of transshipment are frequent, and some losses of cargo have
been experienced. However, the ONATRA project includes provision for impioved
handling facilities for copper products. Delays should be minimized as a
result.
b)   Dar-es-Salaam
11.       The four components of this route are the KDL rail line to Kabongo,
the CFL rail line to Kalemie, CFL barge across Lake Tanganika, and the East
African Railway line to Dar-es-Salaam. CFL is a Zaire state-owned railway.
Total distance is 2,715 km and transport time is 20 to 25 days.
12.       The government requires shipment of 100,000 tons of copper on this
route. Constraints in the port of Dar-es-Salaam limit shipments to approxi-
mately 80,000 tons of copper each year. The port of Dar-es-Salaam is extremely
overloaded due to Zambia's decision to close its border to Rhodesia. The
bulk of Zambia's imports and exports (including copper) flows through Dar-es-
Salaam. Until this port is expanded, shipments of Gecamines copper will not
exceed the present level.
c)   Beira
13.       This all rail route is 2,615 km long and transport time is 15 to
20 days.  Carriers are KDL to Sabania, Zambian Railways to Livingstone,
Rhodesian Railways to Umtali, and CFM in Mozambique to Beira. Gecamines
exports through Beira were 30,000 tons in 1973. While shipments could be



ANNEX 2-6
Page 3
much higher (of the order of 150,000 tons), Gecamines current policy is to
match shipments with imports of metallurgical coal from Wankie in Rhodesia.
d)   Lobito
14.       The most direct and shortest of routes available to Gecamines,
this route is 2,110 km long. Transport time is 10 to 12 days. Carriers are
KDL to Dilolo and Benguela railways in Angola to the port of Lobito. Gecamines
exported all of its cobalt (16,000 tons) and 120,00 tons of copper through
Lobito in 1973. Most of Gecamines' imports are handled through Lobito.
Presently Lobito absorbs the balance of Gecamines exports. More could be
handled, with the quantity depending on the level of Zambian copper exports
through Lobito.
15.       The declaration by Zambia in mid-1974 that all its copper exports
would be shipped through Lobito is an example of the effect of political deci-
sions. This declaration resulted from a decision by.the Tanzanian government
to increase very substantially the rail and port handling charges in Dar-es-Salaam
for Zambian copper. This particular problem will probably be solved following
negotiations between Tanzanian and Zambian authorities. However, it is an indi-
cation of the difficulty of assessing the transport situation for Gecamines.
16.       Political considerations excluded, sufficient capacity exists to
handle Gecamines increased production. Additional capacity on the Matadi
line, and spare capacity on the Beira and Lobito lines more than cover the
planned increase in production by Gecamines and other copper producers in
Zaire.
17.       The tariffs on all four routes are degressive.  The rates and incre-
mental decreases, outlined in Annex 6-1, vary with the route.
B.   Power Sup_ply
18.       The supply of electrical energy must be regarded as a critical
element both in the expansion module and for maintenance of present production.
The capacity of the hydroelectric plants in Shaba province was reached in 1973.
Through an exchange agreement with Zambia, Zaire is assured of sufficient power
for Shaba until early 1975. Zairian power totalling 420 GWh was supplied to
Zambia during the period 1967-72. This is to be returned to Zaire at the same
cost. It is expected that the return will be completed by early 1975. Con-
struction of the 1,800 km power line from Inga in Bas Zaire to Shaba is pres-
ently expected to be completed in late 1977. Therefore the period 1975 to
1977 is not covered by an assured supply. SNEL (Societe Nationale d'Electricite)
will sign a supply contract with Gecamines for t' is period, and could, by re-
allocation among its customers, meet Gecamines' rreeds.  Gecamines also ca.
redistribute available slpplies from power intensive zinc prodiuetion to copper
production, witlh only marginally lower cash generation.

19.       In addition to this projected demand, SMTF is expected to commence
production in 1978 at 125,000 tons of copper.  Electrical consumption is
projected at 495 GWh increasing to 625 GWh in 1980.
20.       At present, electrical power is supplied from four hydroelectric
installations owned by SNEL. Two of these, Mwandingusha and Koni are located
on the Lufira river and are fed by the Mwadingusha reservoir. The other
two, Nzilo and Seke, are located on the Lualaba river and fed by the Delcommue
reservoir. These two reservoirs are relatively small. The low rainfall during
the 1973-74 rainy season has caused some drawdown of the reservoirs. Any
future shortfall in precipitation could adversely affect electrical production,
particularly in 1976.
21.       Power is supplied to GECAMINES from these installations through 120
KV lines to substations located in each of GECAMINES groups of installations --
Western, Central, and Southern. Inter-ties exist between the three groups.
There is also a 220 KV line from the Seke dam to Zambia which is connected to
the Central and Southern groups.
22.       Present power consumption represents 3,870 KWh per ton of copper
with an average price of 0.0049 Z per KWh. Consumption for the expansion
module is estimated to be 285 GWh. While the price of power from Inga has
not been determined as yet, a price of 0.008 Z per KWh has been used for
the financial projections.
C.   Water Supply
23.       Water is currently supplied from streams, and pumping from the
mines. GECAMINES is responsible for locating and exploiting its water
supplies. To date, no difficulties have been experienced.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 5
24.       GECAMINES operates water treatment plants to provide treated water
for industrial use. Treatment involves filtration for washing operations,
softening and demineralization for the electrolytic circuit, steam boilers,
and acid plant as well as drinking water.
25.       Water consumption for the expansion module is estimated at 3,400 m3
per hour. This will be supplied from the Luilu river. Expansion of the
existing pumping station and installation of another water treatment plant
are required for the supply of water.
26.       Cost of supply and treatment is estimated at 0.01 Z per m3.
D.   Workshops
27.       In addition to workshops at each plant site, Gecamines also has two
large, well equipped maintenance facilities. The large "Atelier Central" is
located at Likasi in the Central group, while the other "Atelier Ouest" services
the Western group operations.
28.       The workshops at each plant site offer essential maintenance and
repair services -- electrical, mechanical and carpentry. The Central mainte-
nance facilities provides a vast range of fabrication and maintenance services.
These include: (a) pattern shop; (b) foundry; (c) mechanical workshop; (d}
engine rebuilding shop; (e) garage; (f) electrical'workshop; and (g) electronic
workshop.
29.       The "Atelier Central" is well organized and well equipped.  However
some of the workshops and equipment could be modernized. Since most of the
shops have spare capacity, this is not a constraint on the services offered.
A total of 1,000 employees work in the Central maintenance facilities.
30.       The Western maintenance facilities were established to reflect the
growing production of the Western Group. It is intended to complement the
services offered by the "Atelier Central". The main facilities are the Garage
for maintenance of mining equipment and a mechanical workshop for recondition-
ing parts for mining and metallurgical equipment. Other facilities include
an electrical workshop, a radio communication repair shop, and a shop for
repair of hydraulic sub-assemblies.
31.       The "Atelier Ouest" is well organized and well equipped.  The
installations are generally newer than those of the "Atelier Central". Some
600 employees work here. Incorporated in these facilities is a training
school for electrical and mechanical maintenance.
32.       GECAMINES has a preventive maintenance program which covers all its
mechanical and electrical equipment.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 6
E.   Telecomuunications
33.       GECAMINES operates its own telephone system within its three groups
of operations. In addition, it has direct Telex communications with Kinshasa.
34.       In 1971, the telephone system was modernized.  This included the
installation of micro-wave connections between the three groups.
35.       Investments totaling 450,000 Z are projected to expand the Western
group central and increase connections to Lubumbashi. The telex connections
will also be increased.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
MANPOWER
A.   Labor Situation
1.        During the 1967 to 1973 period GECAMINES' copper production grew
by 55% from 319,000 tons to 495,500 tons, whereas the labor force increased
by only 17.5%. The apparent productivity increase required an upgrading of
the existing and newly hired labor force. Table 1, of this Annex shows that
the number of unskilled workers decreased by 5.2% compared to about a 60%
increase of semi-skilled labor and a 340% increase of skilled workers.
2.        GECAMINES maintains a stable labor force.  Unexcused absenteeism is
low, ranging between 2.5 - 3.0%. In 1972, GECAMINES hired 3,067 workers, while
1,690 workers left the Company, mainly because of insufficient skill level
(32%), retirement or death (28%) and contract termination (15%). The job
creation of the past and coming expansion programs results in an annual net
increase in labor as shown below and in Table 2 of this Annex.

3.        Traditionally GECAMINES recruited and trained workers from Zaire,
Rwanda and other neighboring countries. These workers and their families
have been integrated into GECAMINES system of social services, and thus
have been offered a new stable environment. According to Zairian legislation
not more than 10% of workers are to be foreigners. GECAMINES has continuously
decreased its share of foreign workers in order to meet the legal target.

4.        All workers are members of the Zairian Labor Union (UNTZA) which
negotiates a labor contract every 2 years and periodocially reviews social
and educational arrangements as well as safety measures.
5.        Accident prevention has been a major part of GECAMINES' manpower
policy.  The Company's Safety Department pursues an active program to prevent
accidents at work by providing inspections and adequate design of work places,
good safety equipment and safety regulations coordinated with safety awareness
drives.
6.        Salartes of surface workers are at about the same level as wages in
the Kinshasa area.  However, only 35% of total labor cost accounts for cash
wages, but GECATINES workers benefit from special allowances and subsidies,
such as free housing, educational and health services.  CECMITNES costa data is
confidential, therefore no further details are Presented.  The cost data has
been reviewed withi the comnany (see nara. 9-11 below).
B.   Training and Education
7.        GECAMINES provides training of workers in the form of (i) introductory
and upgrading training on the job and (ii) instruction in primary, secondary
and technical schools. Training expenses account for about 6% of total labor
cost. Traditionally, GECAMINES has maintained excellent training programs
which are outstanding compared to the training efforts of other Zairian
organizations.
8.        On the job training including theoretical class-room instructions
ranges from 1-3 day courses to 3-6 month traineeships in several of GECAMINES
plants and mines. About one-third of the instructors are Zairian. The Com-
pany's training effort more than doubled since 1970 as indicated below:

ZAIRE: GECAJIINES EXPANSION PPOJECT
THE COPPER INDUSTRY IN ZAIRE
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.        The copper industry in Zaire operates since 1906 and is located
in Shaba at the southern end of the country in a belt 60 km wide and 300
km long. Zaire is the world's sixth largest producer of copper, after the
USA, USSR, Chile, Zambia, and Canada, accounting for about 8.07 of the
VTestern world mine production (Annex 3-2).
Copper mining in Shaba yields several by-products such as cobalt,
zinc, cadmium, germanium, silver and gold. Cobalt is the most valuable
hy-product with exports amounting to 13,200 tons in 1973 or about 58% of the
world's cobalt production.
2.        The Government of Zaire has given high nriority to the develop-
ment of the copper sector during the past 5 vears.  The authorities believe
that in the medium term an increase in mining would be the fastest most
reliable way to increase foreign exchange earnings and raise government
revenues.  Furthermore, investment in copper mining has been  particularly
sluggish in the immediate post-indenendence period, so that Zaire is now attempt-
in, to regain its earlier share in the international coDoer market. This nolicv
which should result in an increase of Zaire's mining and processing capacity
has been nursued on three different levels involving:
(i)  the expansion of GECA'TNES, the state-owned copper producing
comnany,
(ii)  the attraction of foreign private investment to set up new
mining companies in hitherto unexplored areas, and
(iii)  the construction of copper processing canacities in Zaire
which would increase the domestic value added and allow the
processing of 1007 of the country's coDper extraction in Zaire.
The latter targyet was announced by President Tfobutu in a
speech on November 30, 1973.
B.   COPPER MIINIHIG CO'fP;NIES
3.        For decades the Zairian copper industry was synonymous with sro-
duction by U'INIC, a..d later GECAMINES. After Independence the Government felt
that the absorptive capacity of one single company was insufficent to exploit the
country's vast and rich conper resources. Consequently, the Government of
Zaire has granted new exploration and mining rights to 2 comnanies --
SODIMIIZA (Societe de Develonnement Industriel et Mines du Zaire) and STF
(Societe "iniere de Tenke-Fungurume). SODIMIZA started production of
coDper concentrates in 1972. SMTF is exDected to come on stream in 1978.



ANNEX 3-1

1.   GECAMINES
4.        GECAMINES, the old established copper mining company, at present
produces about 460,000 tons of copper, 16,000 tons of cobalt and 78,000 tons
of zinc.  GECAMINES holds concession rights to 18,000 sq. km which covers
most of the copper arc in Shaba. Measured reserves are sufficient for over
40 years at the present projected mining rate but the potential is at least
twice the published reserves. The Company's history, operating facilities,
financial structure, and organization are discussed in Annexes 2-1 to 2-9.
5.        Following the nationalization of UMHK and the creation of GECAMN.4ES
the management of Gecamines initiated an expansion program designed to increase
copper production from 364,000 tons in 1969 to 600,000 tons by 1980. In its
first expansion (1970-74) the Company expanded copper production to 460,000
tons in 1974 and cobalt production to about 16,000 tons p.a. Investment costs
for this first expansion Plan reached Z 130 million which were financed by
internal cash generation and loans totalling US$32 million from the US Eximbank
and the European Investment Bank.  In order to permit GECA-INES to finance
the project primarily by its owm resources the Government granted the company
special tax concessions under the Investment Code. The concession stipulates
that until 1974 GECAIINES will be exempt from the payment of all taxes on
annual production of copper exceeding 360,000 tons and of cobalt exceeding
11,000 tons as well as miscellaneous import duties and taxes related to the
expansion. The project evaluated in this report represents the second 5-Year
Development Plan (1974-79) and should allow GECA1-rTNES to reach its production
target for this decade (for details see Annexes 4-1 to 4-3).
6.        At present, GECAMINES refines about 230,000 tons of copper or more
than 50% of its copper output in Zaire (Annex 2-4, Table 1). The remaining
production consisting of cathode, blister and crude copper is processed
in Belgium.  GECAIINES will directlv refine in Shaba the additional 120,000
tons output generated by the second 5-Year Develonment Plan (1974-79) and
can decrease its supply of unrefined copper to SCM - Mletallurgie Hoboken by
50,000 tons per annum.after 1980.  fSee Annex 3-4).
7.        GECAMINES' relations with SC;G have been newly defined bY several
agreements signed on April 10, 1974. Thev intend to diminish Zaire's de-
pendence on Sr' and Belgium by regulating (i) finally the compensation
payments for Union Miniere assets, (ii) the marketing of Zairian mineral
products by a Zairian-owned company in Zaire instead of SGM", and defining
(iii) the technical assistance provided by SCM for GECAMINES.  Details are
given in Annex 3-4, paras. 5-6.
8.        Following President Mlobutu's announcement on November 30, 1974,
former subsidiaries of Union Mtiniere were finally nationalized. As a
result, 6 companies representing 8% of GECAN1INES net fixed asset were in-
corporated in GECAMINES (for details see Annex 2-2). The annexation of
these 6 subsidiaries improves GECAMINES forward linkages by adding IJZK
(,Ietalkat), a zinc processing company as well as horizontal linkages, since
UCS (SOGECHIMf), C1L and La Fonciere provide intermediate goods, supplies
and services to GECXAJINES.

2.   SODIMIZA
9
SODIMIZA (Societe de Developpement Industriel et Mines du Zaire)
was established in April 1969 as a joint venture between the Government and
Japanese interests. The capital is owned 85% by CODIMICO, a consortium of
the Nippon Mining Company and other Japanese firms 1/, and the Government of
Zaire which holds 15% of the share capital.
10.       SODIMIZA holds concession rights to 36,790 sq. miles along the
Zambian border and south of the GECAMINFS concession near Kambove and Likasi.
After extensive exploration on the basis of GECAMINES' records and new aerial
and ground surveys, SODIMIZA developed in a first phase the Motoshi deposit
southeast of Lubumbashi. Ore reserves of Motoshi are estimated at 100 million
tons averaging 3.5% copper content. Production started in 1972 reaching 25,000
tons and will increase to its capacity of 50,000 tons in 1975. The facilities
in Mutoshi produce 30-36% copper concentrate which is exported to Japan for
smelting and refining.
11.       At present, SODIMIZA is exploring the Tshinsenda deposits near
the Zambian border. SODIMI7A has to decide within two years whether it
intends to exploit the deposit or otherwise the concession will revert
to the Government of Zaire. The opening of the Tshinsenda mine could yield
an additional 60,000 tons of copner per annum.
12.       The convention betwjeen the Nippon Mlining Company and the Government
of Zaire regulates the fiscal system, the marketing rights and processing
requirements as follows:
(a) The Government of Zaire can purchase within the first 5 years
50% of SODIMIZA's ownership;
(b)  Nippon Mining ComDany and SODIMIZA will spend nearly US$4
million in prospecting the concession area;
(c)  Nippon Mining Company has the right to buy the entire mine out-
put but has to install refining facilities in Zaire if production
reaches 60,OnO tons of copper content p.a. provided that the
Government guarantees an electricity supply of 254 GWH;
(d)  SODIIIZA is exemnt from all taxes for 5 years after Droduc-
tion start-up;hat it has to pav 25%' of the current export taxes
during the 6th to 10th years, 50% during the 11th and 15th
years, 757 during the 16th to 20th year.and 100%O thereafter.

13.       SODIM,.IZA's management consists almost entirely of Japanese expatri-
ates and more than 20% of the Company's workers are also Japanese; however,
under its convention with the Zairian Government SODIMIZA is required to hire
and train asmmany Zairian nationals as feasible.
3.   SMTF
14.       SMTF (Societe Miniere de Tenke-Fungurume), a production company
and its affiliate SIPZ (Societe Internationale des MTines du Zaire) dn ex-
ploration Firm, signed in September 1970 a convention with the Government of Zaire
granting mining and exploration rights for 35 years in the Tenke-Fungurume
area along the KDL railway line, north of the GECA14INES concession. SIMZ's
initial exploration concession consisted of 30,692 sq. km. More than two-
thirds have been returned to the Government of Zaire. The resulting final
area under SMTF-SIMZ concession will amount to about 5,000 sq. km. The
SIMZ concession for exploration will expire in five years but is renewable.
Ore reserves of 50 million tons have been proven in the Tenke-Fungurume area,
and an equal amount of reserves are inferred. The deposits are said to be
the richest unexploited ore reserves in Zaire averaging 6.2% copper and 0.4%
cobalt.
15.       SITF-SIMZ is a joint venture between the Government of Zaire (20%
of share capital) and a multi-national consortium (80%) consisting of the US
AMOCO Minerals Company (28%), Charter Consolidated Limited of London (28%),
Mitsui and Company (14%), Onnium Mines, a French Company (7%), and Leon
Templesman and Sons (3%). Charter Consolidated has management contracts for
the two companies -- SMTF and SIM7. Nevertheless, SMTF is required to employ
Zairian nationals on a priority basis.
16.       The Mdining Agreement between the Government of Zaire and SMTF
stipulates that:
(a) the Government of Zaire can purchase 20% of mine production
at a fair ex-plant price;
(b)a all mined ore will be refined in Zaire after a reasonable
period of concentrate production;
(c) a global tax exemption for 5 years after production start-
up followed by a 50% profit tax exemption for 20 years of
production.
17.       STTF is presently constructing the social and industrial infra-
structure at the plant site. Project management of the open pit operation
and metallurgical facilities have been contracted to Fluor Utah, a US
Company.  Although planning and construction activities are under uay, the
date of production start-up depends on the completion of the Inga-Shaba
line. SMTF will receive its entire power supply through the Inga-Shaba
liine which will be complete in late 1977.  S?TF expects to produce
80,000 tons of refined copper in 1978 and reach full capacity (125,000 tons)
in 1980.

4.   Production and Export Projection
18.       The expansion plans of the 3 copper mining companies described in
paras. 6-17 above indicate substantial increases in Zaire's copper output in
the next 6 years. Table 1 below summarizes the projected copper production
levels until 1980. Conper production equals copper export since domestic
consumption will remain negligible during the seventies.

Copper production will increase by nearly 340,000 tons,equivalent to an
annual growth rate of 7.6%. As indicated in Annex 3-2, the market analysis
assumes an annual increase of world copper demand during the seventies of
less than 4%. There is a possibility of a world oversupply in copper by
the end of this decade which would lead to price decreases.  Nevertheless,
,7aire should be able to export its output since (i) GECAMINES is well
established in the market; (ii) SODIIIZA has long-term contracts with its
Japanese sponsors and (iii) SMTF is pursuina an aggressive marketing stra-
tegy. Consequently, if the projected production levels materialize, Zaire's
export earnings will not rise parallel with the expansion, but increase only
by about 2-47 p.a. in real terms.
19.       The production projections can be considered realistic.  Neverthee-
less, slower growth is possible if the start-up of S1MTF will be delayed by 6-12
months due to the lack of power through the Inga-Shaba line. In addition,
SODIMIZA may decide to forfeit the exploitation of the Tshinsenda mine.
5.   Long-Term Prospects
20.       After the comnletion of the second 5-Year Develonment Plan (1974-79)
GECAHINES olans to implement a further investment program which would increase
the Company's copper production to 650,000 tons of refined copper by 1984.
This objective will involve the imDrovement of the existing facilities at
Lubumbashi, Luilu and Shituru at an estimated investment cost of Z 170 million
(in 1974 prices).



ANNEX 3-1
Page 6
21.       Future expansion and investment plans of SMTF depend on (i) the
difficulties the Company will encounter during the start-up period (1978-80)
and (ii) future copper and cobalt market prospects. Theoretically, SMTF
could expand its output to 250,000 tons of refined copper at an investment
of 9F 150 million (at 1974 prices).
22.       In addition to the expansion investments outlined above, the 3 copper
mining companies will have to invest a total of more than 9 50 million p.a.
(in 1974 prices) in mine development and replacement to maintain their produc-
tion capacity and productivity.
C.   STRUCTURE OF THE INDUSTRY
1.   Market Share and Comnetitive Position
23.       The production projections above indicate that GECAMIMES will
continue to dominate Zaire's copper industry with a market share of at
least 70%. Nevertheless, after SMTF and SODDflZA will be in full production
Zairian copper producers will compete against each other only to a limited
extenlt. However, copper export coordination is likely, since: (i) Zaire is
member of CIPEC (ii) the new marketing organization for GECAJ-fINES' mineral
products may in the long run market all of Zaire's copper export and (iii)
only GECAMINES and SITTF will compete in the same market segment, i.e.,
primarily in Europe, while SODIMIZA can rely on a captive market through
its long-term supply contracts with its Japanese sponsors.
2.   Integration
24.       Historically the Zairian copper industry has had a high degree of
vertical and horizontal integration. The major reason for this structure is
the location of the Zairian copper industrv in the center of Africa, and the
fact that for decades GECAMINES was the only copper producer. Horizontal
integration develoned and made GECAMINES a relatively self-sufficient producer
with extensive servicing facilities, supply networks, etc.  The existing
structure has forced SODIMIZA as well as SITF to also create their own support
industries.  No snin-off industry from GECAINTES' operation which could pro-
vide services and manpower developed in the nast.
25.       Regarding vertical integration, GWCAMINES and the other conner
producers will be equally concentrated. This development has been increased
by the recent addition of four of IJnion Miniere's ex-subsidiaries in GECAMI'TS.
Consequently, the conner industry included the mining of thie rwry materials
to the nroduction of intermediate, end and by-products. Before independence
forward linlcages, i.e. refining and casting of GECAJMNES' nroducts had been
the prerogative of S0G  and their subsidiaries in Belgium.  However, the in-
dustry is developing strong vertical integration patterned as detailed
in paras. 26 and 27 below.



ATNEX 3-1
Page 7
26.       Refining.  President Mobutu announced in his speech on November
30, 1973 that Zaire's total copper output should be refined domestically by
1980. The existing copper mining companies have been taking steps to reach
this target:
(a)  In 1973 GECAMINES refined about 230,000 tons of its copper
production domestically. The GECAMINES Expansion Project
and investment plans for 1979-84 include refining facilities
for the additional ore output and the present cathode and
blister production. However, Zaire guaranteed SGM until 1980
a supply of 150,000 tons of blister copper and decreasing by
not more than 50,000 tons p.a. thereafter (Annex 3-4, para. 3).
(b) SMTF's total copper output will be refined in Zaire after
a reasonable start-up period.
(c)  According to the 1969 Mining Agreement with the Government
of Zaire, SODITIZA is obliged to construct refining facilities
in Zaire for annual mine output in excess of 60,000 tons of
copper content.
Taking into account the agreements signed by SODIMIZA and GECA,NTES, at
least 90% of Zaire's copper production will be refined locally after 1980.
Zaire's present refining capacity is in line with that of the other CIPEC
countries.
27.       Casting of refined copper to wire bars, cakes, billets, rods, or
special formats represents a further step in copper processing. According to
the agreement dated April 10, 1974 between the Government of Zaire, SCM,
SON's subsidiary Metallurgie Eloboken, SGM will provide technical assistance
to construct and operate a copner casting plant at Maluku. The company
which is planned as a wholly Zairian-o'-med venture, would transform GECAYT\ES'
copper cathodes and produce (i) by 1978, 40,000 tons of cake and 60,000
tons of billets, and (ii) by 1979, an additional 100,000 tons of copDer
rod. Investment costs for the first phase of 100,000 tons of conper have
been estimated at F 40 million.  The plant is expected to create employment
for 380 people of whom not more than 40 would be expatriates.
D.   CONTRIBUTIO1 TO THE ECONOMY
1.   Domestic Value Added and Linkages
28.       No estimate is available of domestic value added in copner per se
though it is likelv that it represents some 80-90 percent of value added in
the mining sector as a whole. The national accounts put this latter amount
at about 9 112 million in constant 1970 Zaires, on average, during 1968-73,
which is on the order of only 13 percent of GDP at factor cost for the period.
However, these estimates, following standard national accounting practice



ANNEX 3-1
Page 8
with respect to indirect taxes, exclude export duties (though not the turn-
over tax), paid the Government, which on GECAMINES' output alone averaged
about g 70 million (in current prices) during 1968-73. Since the price of
copper is determined in international markets, and since the Government has
the options of taking its revenues in the form either of profits tax or --
as sole owner of the company -- in profits per se -- these revenues could be
considered part of the mining industry's contribution to GDP. This adjustment
alone would raise its share to around 20 percent of GDP at factor cost.
29.       The contribution of the copper industry to Zaire's domestic economy
would be substantially higher if it included value added attributable to
activities directly and indirectly linked to the copper industry. Concerning
the former, the most important directly related activities (apart mining and
processing facilities, value added of which is presumably already included in
"mining and minerals processing") are the economic and social services provided
by the industry and included in its cost of production. These consist mainly
of expenditures on housing, education, and health which offer services which
would otherwise be provided by the housing industry or the Government.
30.       In this connection, GECAMINES affords a high standard of social
facilities. The company maintains workers' settlements -- so-called "cites"
-- near its mines and plants which offer housing, primary schools and other
community services such as sports grounds, churches, administrative buildings,
market places and meeting halls. (See Annex 2-7) GECkMINES owned about
21,000 housing units of 2-4 rooms each at twelve sites. Another 2,330 houses
are planned as part of the 1974-79 expansion program. The Company also main-
tains 41 primary schools, 7 secondary schools, a technical secondary school
and 6 schools for basic home economics. Further, the Company provides medical
services free to all workers, emDloys a medical staff of 175 including 40
doctors, and operates hospitals and other facilities with nearly 1,800 beds.
Finally, GECAMINES is responsible for developing and operating its own water
supply and operates its own telephone system.
31.       To the extent that value added has been estimated independently in
sectors directly supplying but not integrated with the copper industry, it
also could be considered part of the copper sector's contribution to the
economy. The most obvious cases concern incomes generated in electricity
production and transnortation. With respect to electric power, the conper
industry now consumes about three quarters of the electricity produced in
the country (see Power Sector Survey). Assuming value added in electricity
and gas are proportional to production, this would add some Z 5-6 million to
the copper industry's annual contribution to domestic income. In connection
with transportation, GECAMINES alone shipped 240,000 tons via Matadi -- the
only all Zairian route -- in 1973. This represents 85 percent of the
annual tonnage shipned over that line.
32.       In connection with trends in value added and its relation to
investment and the labor force, the picture is complicated by the volatility
of copper prices. Nevertheless, over the period 1969-73, average gross



ANNEX 3-1
Page 9
fixed capital of Z 425 million in current prices, generated average annual
value added, in current prices, unadjusted, of Z 120-150 million, yielding
a gross capital output ratio of 3.5-2.8. The ICOR 1/ during the same period,
valuing additional copper output at the average price per ton for the five
years was 2,9.
2.   Employment, Wages and Salaries
33.       Although national accounting methodology may not fully account for
the contribution of the copper sector to the economy, it remains true that
the amount of capital invested in the industry is high in relation to direct
employment and wage incomes. Table 1, Annex 2-7 shows the evolution of
GECAMINES personnel from 1969-1973, which increased from 24,835 to 29,012,
a rise of 17 percent. During this same period copper production increased
by 28 percent, while gross fixed assets rose by about 20 percent. Gross
fixed capital per worker at the end of the period was about Z 15,000, and
new investment per job during the period was about Z 18,500.
34.       Traditionally, GECAMINES has recruited and trained workers from
Zaire, Rwanda and other neighboring countries. According to Zairian legis-
lation not more than 10 percent of workers are to be foreigners and GECAMINES
has continuously decreased its share of foreign workers to meet the legal
target. (See Annex 2-7, para. 3).
35.       In 1973, average remuneration to surface and underground labor was
Z 44 per month. This is increased to Z 77 per month when additions are made
for the cost of family allowances, communal services, retirement and other
charges. Average salaries and charges for expatriate staff are on the order
of Z 1,800 per month and for African staff on the order of Z 400. These rates
imply total labor and staff costs of about Z 60.5 million in 1973, though
remunerations per se were probably about Z 50 million. More than half of this
is accounted for by expatriate salaries and benefits.
3.   Balance of Payments Effects
36.       Table 2 illustrates the direct effects of GECAMINES' operations
on the balance of payments. Since costs and expenses are not allocated by
product, the analysis comprises not only copper but its co-products -- mainly
cobalt, and zinc as well.
37.       During 1969-73, the f.o.b. value 2/ of Zaire's exports of copper and
its co-products varied in he range of $446 to $823 million. Although the
volume of exports climbed by about 100,000 tons, the amplitude of the fluctua-
tions is the result largely of variations in the copper price, as can be
1/   ICOR = Incremental capital output ratio.
2/   Derived from GECAMINES sales revenues.  It includes the value of final
products c.i.f. Europe, less transport costs, and excludes processing
and refining expenses generated in Europe.

seen clearly by comparing 1972, when the average annual copper price on the
London Metal Exchange was at a low for the period of 48 cents per pound, with
1973, when it averaged 81 cents per pound. On the average for the five year
period, GECAMINES' exports were valued at US$538 million and accounted for
68 percent of the total value of merchandise exports and for 56 percent of
total current foreign exchange earnings.
38.       Net foreign exchange earnings were, of course, less though they
were still substantial. Thus, on average, GECAMINES paid the equivalent of
some US$100 million per year for imports of intermediate and capital goods,
US$22 million per year in expatriate salaries, and US$30 million per year
in financial changes and compensation payments. Average annual net foreign
exchange earnings were thus on the order of US$372 million, of which about
US$250 million per year equivalent was paid to the Government in taxes.
39.       Two observations are in order with respect to the net foreign
exchange earnings of GECAMINES. First, in the medium term, foreign exchange
expenditures are not compressible. Hence, when copper prices change,
fluctuations in net foreign exchange earnings are higher percentage-wise
than in gross revenues. This increases the vulnerability of the economy
to price changes. Second, about 15% of foreign exchange expenditure is
salary payments to expatriates. This confirms the view that over the long
term, there is room for savings through the training and placement of
Zairian in staff positions.
4.   Public Revenue Effect
40.       The system of taxation of copper and its co-products embraces
taxes and duties on exports, imports, wages and salaries, profits and mis-
cellaneous taxes and fees. Export taxes generate the largest part of the
public mining revenue and comprise four types: (i) the export duty per se,
which is levied as a flat rate on a set tax reference price, or "base value,"
(40 percent in the case of copper); (ii) a statistical tax, levied on the same
base (1% for copper); (iii) since 1969, a supplementary export surcharge
levied on base values in excess of predetermined minimum (at present, the
base value of electrolytic copper above which the surcharge is imposed is
Z 340 per ton; this value is different for other types of copper); and
(iv) a turnover tax levied on c.i.f. value (7 percent for both copper and
cobalt). Profits are taxed at 40 percent and wages and salaries at differ-
ential rates.
41.       In the context of the Investment Code and in order to stimulate an
expansion of mining, the Government has also passed conventions or ordonances
exempting earnings generated by new investment from various taxes. In the
case of GECAMINES revenues earned on output attributable to its expansion
programs have been exonerated from taxation for 5-year periods. Thus taxable
production for the period 1970-74 was fixed at 360,000 tons, i.e. the company's
capacity prior to the investment program, and is expected to be set at
460,000 tons from 1975-82. As noted above, SODIMIZA is exempt from all

taxes for five years following start-up, and thereafter benefits from a re-
duction in the tax burden through the 20th year. Similarly, SMTF will be
exonerated from taxes for five years, and subject only to 50% of profits tax
thereafter through the 20th year.
42.       The graph on page 15 of this Annex shows the relation between reve-
nues per ton from export duties (not including the turnover tax), the c.i.f.
copper price, the f.o.b. value and the "base value". Table 4 and p.16
explain the derivation. At base values of Z 340 per ton or less, the com-
bined rate of export and statistical tax is 41 percent. This corresponds to
f.o.b. values of Z 480 per ton or less and an effective tax rate of 29.08
percent. Between base values of Z 340-382, the export surcharge enters into
effect and increases by legally specified increments. For base values above,
Z 382 per ton, a marginal rate of 40 percent is applied. This leads to
effective export duty rates on the f.o.b. value of up to 50 percent, as the
copper price increases. Base values are set each month on the basis of world
market Prices prevailing three months earlier. This lag means that monthly
revenues are lower than they would be on the basis of current price quota-
tions, wqhen prices are rising, and higher than they would be on the basis
of current price quotations, when prices are falling.
43.       The average value of total taxes paid by GECAMIINES during 1969-73
was Z 107.4 million, contributing 45 percent of Zaire's total tax revenues.
In this period, they fell to a low of Z 93.4 million in 1971 and reached a
high of Z 173.7 in 1973 -- an increase of almost 86 percent -- in resnonse
mainly to copper price increases. The average burden on company sales f.o.b.
of all tax payments was 49 Percent. It is to be observed, however, that
this burden declined to less than 40 percent in 1973, principally because of
the exoneration from all taxes above an annual production of 360,000 tons of
copper and 11,000 tons of cobalt. Table 3 summarizes direct and indirect
taxes paid or generated by GECAMINES.

5.   Economic Effects of Dependence on Copper
44.       As described above, the copper industry is the largest single source
of Zaire's public revenues and foreign exchange. These benefits have not, of
course, been without their costs. Most obvious is the fact that the financial
situation of the economv is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in the
copper price. Less obvious but no less important is the impact of the industry
on domestic price and cost relations, which may no longer reflect the scarcity
value of productive factors and final goods and services to the economy. In
particular, the availability of government revenues and the relatively high
standard of living in the enclave economy are both factors contributing to
higher wages and prices in other sectors of the economy, leading to reductions
in the competitiveness of industrial and agricultural products in international
markets. While it might be hoped that incomes accruing to the administration
and the industry on which it depends would generate higher demand for and
increased supplies of local agricultural and processed goods, there is little
evidence that this has happened in Zaire. On the contrary, so far the level of
incomes appears to have served largely to increase imports of food and other
consumer goods.    -            - -

THE COPPER MARKET
1.        Copper is one of the most important commodities traded in the world.
The value of annual copper consumption exceeds that of all other metals with
the exception of steel, representing almost US$20 billion in 1973. Copper
can also be characterized by another feature, its price instability. Low
short-term elasticities of demand and supply generate huge and volatile
changes in prices when imbalances of supply and demand occur, and thus create
problems for the consumers and, very importantly, the copper exporting LDC's.
A. WORLD COPPER RESERVES
2.        Copper is found in association with other metals, such as nickel
and platinum in ultrabasic intrusives; zinc, and cadmium in volcanic-
sedimentary deposits; Molybdenum in hydrothermal deposits; and cobalt in
sedimentary deposits. All copper ores contain small quantities of gold and
silver. The copper content of the ore varies widely from an average of
0.3-2% for intrusive deposits, 0.5-3.0% for replacement deposits and 0.5-5%
for sedimentary deposits.
3.        Geographically, copper deposits are found all over the world; however,
four major copper areas can be distinguished:
1)   The African copper belt, with deposits of up to 6.5% copper
in Zambia and Zaire. These contain about 25% of the known
copper reserves in the Western world;
2)   Eastern Canada, accounting for about 57 of world copper
reserves with deposits containing 0.5-2.0% copper,
3)   The Western Hemisphere Mountain Chain including deposits
in Alaska, British Columbia, western USA, Mexico, Peru,
Bolivia and Chile which account for nearly 60% of copper
reserves in the world (ex-CPE); 1/ and
This belt continues around the Pacific with deposits on
4)   The East Asian Coast and island chain, particularly, the
Philippines, Australia, Bougainville, Mainland China, etc.
Smaller but still significant reserves totalling about 20% of world
reserves are found in U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, Poland, Finland, Scandinavia,
Turkey, Romania, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal, India and several other countries.

4.        Published reserves have increased over the past years (as illustrated
by the table below), while the average copper content of reserves have declined
from an average of 2.5% in 1966 to an estimated 1.1% in 1972.

/1   CPE - centrally planned economies.
The notable increase in published reserves is based on the discovery
of new deposits as well as the inclusions of already known copper deposits whose
exploitation became economically viable with more advanced mining and meta.. lur-
gical technology. Clearly, published proven reserves are generally conservatil..
estimates and there is no doubt that probable reserves represent several times
the recoverable copper recorded as proven reserves.  In the future, substantia:
additional reserves are likely to be discovered in the African, East-Asian,
East-European-Turkish copper belts, as well as in deep sea nodules. If mirie
production were to continue at the present rate of exploitation, (7 millioni
tons ner year) published proven reserves would be exhausted by the year 2014.
5.        Copper reserves have not only increased with time, but they vary
with copper price level, i.e., reserves depend on the financial return in
copper exploitation. According to the US Bureau of Mines, in 1974, World
copper reserves range from 304 million tons to 418 million tons for prices
of 69 cents/lb. to 102 cents/lb. respectively, as illustrated below.

B. COPPER SUPPLY AND DEMAND
A market flow chart of copper is given as Chart 2 at the end of
this Annex.
1.   World Copper Supply
6.        The world's copper supply comes from two main sources, either (i)
from primary or mine production of (ii) from secondary or scrap recovery
and is used in two different forms, i.e., either as (i) refined copper from
primary or old or new scrap; or as (ii) scrap for direct use. This inter-
relationship complicates past and projected copper supply statistics and can
be illustrated as follows:

New Scrap                 New Scrap
New scrap is generated by the fabrication process and recovered at
the manufacturers plant or refinery. Both old and new scrap are recycled as
refined copper or scrap for direct use by consumers. Most of the scrap
recovered as copper alloy is used directly whereas pure copper scrap is
refined a second time.
Primary or Copper Mine Production
7.        Table 1 on page 5 of this Annex presents the world mine production
of copper (19-O-73) and Table 2 on page 6 indicates the shares of major copper
producing countries. Copper mine production in the Western World increased
by an average of 3.7% p.a. during the sixties and by 4.3% p.a. during the
1970-73 period. The 5 major copper mining countries, accounting for about
70% of world output (ex CPE), are the USA, Canada, Chile, Zambia and Zaire.
Over the years Zaire has about maintained its share in the world market,
ranking 5th among copper mining countries. In 1973, 36% of the world's
primary copper production was mined in CIPEC-countries (for details on CIPEC
see paras 26-28) compared to 45.1% in 1959. The decreasing production share
results from the relative low growth rates of the Chilean and Zambian mines
(2.0% p.a. and 1.8%p.a.) during this period.

8.        Primary copper production is basically a function of available
productive capacity and demand for copper. In recent years actual primary
production often fell short of primary production capacity because of strikes
and other exogenous factors. Copper prices have some short-term influence on
production as copper producers try to increase output at existing mines during
high price periods. However, flexibility of output is not significant. Very
low copper prices influenced primary production in 1960-63: producers cut
down production to maintain a floor price of about 29 cents.
9.        Copper prices influence investment decisions and, therefore, have a
long--term impact on primary production. But in the last decade political fac-
tors were partly responsible for the timing of investment:  Chile, Peru, and
African countries had to change or clearly define their copper policies before
copper companies were ready to undertake expansion programs. High world copper
prices and feasible projects alone did not provide sufficient incentives. In
general, it takes between three and six years to open up a new copper mine or
to substantially increase capacity of an existing one.

Refined Copper Production
10.       World production of refined copper increased by an average of 4.1%
per year over the 1960-73 period and reached 6.6 million tons in 1973 (see
table 3, page 7). A comparison of the geographical location of the world's
mine production and refinery output (tables 1, .2 and 4) clearly shows that
traditionally refining facilities were located near to consumer markets, such
as Europe, North America and Japan. However, refining facilities in Africa
and South America are being expanded. For example copper mine production in
Africa multiplied by 2.4 from 1952-72 whereas production of refined copper
quadrupled during the same period. The biggest expansion of refinery capacity
occurred, however, in Japan where refined copper output has been increasing by
an average of 11% per annum during the sixties.

Scrap
11.       The supply of copper scrap is rather volatile and fluctuates with
the price of refined copper, recovery cost and the degree of scarcity of cer-
tain copper products on the market. As indicated in table 5 the production
of new and old scrap decreased by 10% from a high of 3.5 million tons in 1969
to 3.1 million tons in 1972. Scrap is primarily used directly by manufac-
turers, so that secondary refined copper amounted to only 24% of total scrap
production.

/1   Secondary refined copper and scrap for direct use.
In the long-run scrap will account on the average for not more than
40% of the world copper production. Scrap has been recovered primarily from
cables, transformers, motors etc. so that with growing substitution of copper
by aluminum the availability of scrap is likely to decline.. However on the
other hand improvements in scrap recovery technologies may make the production
of secondary copper more economical.
Copper Stocks
13.       Copper stocks play an important role as market indicators and
generally reflect respective price movements. At the London Metal Exchange
(LYE) warehouses stocks were of the order of 20,000 tons in mid-June 1974
compared to about 200,000 tons at the beginning of 1973. However, information
on total stocks held by producers, trade and users is difficult to obtain and
its analysis causes some problems. Stocks are also being held by some govern-
ments. The most important government stockpile used to be held in the U.S.
For many years the stockpile target stood at 750,000 short tons but actual
stocks of 250,000-350,000 short tons were held. Recently, a decision was
taken to sell all stockpiled copper. The sales program has now been completed,
without any market disruption as supply was very tight. Stockpile sales were
made according to bids received and selling prices were considerably higher
than the US producers' price.

Uses of Copper
14.       Copper's technical qualities, mainly its electric conductivity,
corrosion resistance, thermal conductivity, maleability, ductibility and



ANNEX 3-2
Page 11
easiness of join, make it one of the most important materials of modern
industry. The use of copper and its alloys is universal. They are prac-
tically synonymous with all things electrical and have myriad uses in elec-
trical equipment and supplies, construction, transportation communications,
appliances, utensils, jewelry and other applications.
The breakdown of copper consumption in different industrial sectors
is shown below. It does vary only slightly between countries and no marked
differences exist between consumption patterns in developed and developing
countries.

/1   1972 industrial survey.
/2   1967 figures.
The largest use of copper is in electrical equipment and supplies,
communications, including electronics, telephone and telegraph wire and cable.
The manufacture of electric motors, power generator sets, dynamotors, fans,
industrial controls, power distribution systems and electrical instruments
require large quantities of copper for the best electrical performance. While
aluminum is used for virtually all high-voltage overhead power transmission
lines, copper presently dominates in underground line and small wire markets,
since copper is corrosion resistant.
15.       The noncorrosive properties of copper and its alloys result in many
uses in building construction for roofing, plumbing, builders' hardware and
functional decorative applications. Copper finds also widespread application
in the production of many types of nonelectrical industrial machinery, such as
heat exchangers, turbines, oil baffles, check valves, plates, sheets, bars
and copper tubing. About 10% of the copper consumed in the world is used in
transportation including motor vehicles, railroads, and marine uses. This
results both from the trend toward greater convenience and comfort such as
power windows, seats, brakes, stearing and airconditioning, but also from the
more utilitarian uses in radiators, heaters, defrosters, oil lines, etc.
Substitution
16.       While the properties of copper are almost irreplaceable in some
applicatons it faces competition in other areas of consumption from aluminum,
plastics, steel, glass, and other materials. In many uses requiring conduction



ANNEX 3-2
Page 12
of heat or electrical energy, aluminum has displaced copper. There has been
an accelerated shift to the use of steel for brass in shell cases and printed
electrical circuits have come into the field as substitute of copper wire.
17.       Aluminum and stainless steels have also reduced the use of copper
in the building industry. Table 12 below shows the relative consumption in-
crease during the sixties in West Germany and Japan.

Technology has furthered substitution for copper by the introduction of the
numerous cladmetals, including copper clad which use proportionally less
copper per unit. Plastic tubing substitutes for some copper pipe in many
applications in building and the automotive industry.
18.       The reasons for substitution are not only periods of short supply
of copper resulting in high price levels but also sustained price fluctuations
which creates uncertainty among manufacturers. Reverse substitution is rela-
tively difficult. Substitution for an end-user involves extensive retooling
and planning so that reverse substitution is only likely to occur if there
are unforeseen problems with substitute materials.
19.       Substitution has not been clearly felt because copper consumption
has been growing in absolute terms. This has been mainly due to the over-
proportional growth of the electrical and transport sectors where copper has
an established position. As this dynamism is likely to continue, there should
be scope for both further substitution and steady growth of copper consumption.
The impact of higher energy cost on aluminum and plastic prices cannot yet be
assessed. On the one hand if copper prices increase less rapidly than prices
of its substitute materials, the substitution trend may halt or even reverse.
On the other hand new production processes, for aluminum, for example could
reduce costs substantially in the next 5-10 years, while no great technological
breakthrough is expected in the copper industry.

21.       Consumption of refined copper is heavily concentrated in the devel-
oped countries. In 1973, the USA, Canada, Western Europe and Japan accounted
for nearly 92% of western world consumption of refined copper. Growth of re-
fined copper consumption is closely correlated with growth of industrial pro-
duction 1/ and averaged 4.4% for the developed countries during the 1952-73
period. Although the long-term growth pattern has been steady during the
sixties and seventies regional growth rates varied substantially as indicated
below:

22.       Copper consumption increased substantially in developing countries
with the beginning of industrialization. In Brazil copper consumption grew
about 60% more rapidly than other economic indicators--a phenomenon which
had been observed in Japan during the sixties. Copper consumption in Japan
is likely to stabilize during the coming decade and to correlate more closely
with industrial production growth as in Europe and the USA. The portion of
Europe's refined copper consumption in the Western World which reached 50%
in 1958, appears to stabilize now at about 40%.
3.   International Trade
23.       Almost all international transactions of copper are made in primary
copper. Exports of scrap occurs relatively seldom, and are limited nearly ex-
clusively to US exports. International trade of copper as represented by net
1/   On average the copper growth rate has been equivalent to 80% of the
industrial production growth rate. However, copper growth rates may
exceed industrial growth in rapidly expanding economies.

exports 1/ includes shipments of concentrates, blister and refined metal. The
trade matrix given in Table 13 indicate the ranking of copper importing and
exporting countries. In 1970, the major importing countries were West Germany,
UK, Belgium, the USA and Japan, while Zambia, Chile and Zaire lead the copper
export countries.
24.       As illustrated by Table 14 below net export of copper concentrates,
blister and refined metal amounted to 3.58 million tons in 1973 compared to
2.74 million tons in 1969, or an increase of 7% per annum.

During the seventies the major increase of exports occurred in ores
and concentrates from developed countries, such as Canada and the USA and non-
CIPEC developing countries such as Papua-New Guinea and the Philippines. Net
exports of ore and concentrates grew at an average 24%.
25.       It is debatable if the trend of shipping concentrates will continue.
On the one hand, the copper consuming countries Japan, Europe, and the U.S.
have expanded their smelter and refining capacities over the past years and
are anxious to sign long-term delivery contracts for concentrates.  The cheaper
and more efficient handling and transport techniques have made it possible to
shift smrlting and refining of concentrates from the mine sites to the consumer
countries' ports. On the other hand, the copper exporting countries will try
to maximize export earnings and domestic value added and force the mining com-
panies to expand smelting and refining on site. In addition, strict pollution
control in developed countries particularly the USA and Canada may favor treat-
ment of the copper ore in developing countries, although smelters have been
able to operate competitively in Europe for many years under pollution regula-
tions that have just been adopted in the US.
CIPEC
26.       CIPEC (Conseil intergouvernemental des pays exportateurs de cuivre)
was formed in 1967 by Zambia, Chile, Zaire and Peru. In 1972, these four
countries accounted for 37.5% of the world's copper mine production, 20.6% of
refined copper production and 57% of copper exports, as detailed in Table 15
below:

27.       The objectives of this organization are the development of the copper
industry in these countries, the maximization and stabilization of copper export
earnings and the manufacture of copper products in CIPEC countries. In the
past CIPEC has not been very successful in achieving these goals.  There have
been recurrent statements by CIPEC member countries and expectations in the



ANNEX 3-2
Page 20
copper trade that CIPEC would try to "stabilize" the copper price or at least
introduce a floor price. It is argued that cooperation between CIPEC and major
integrated copper producers in industrialized countries could produce an OPEC-
type action with good chances for success. However, copper producing countries
are not in as strong a position as the OPEC countries: first; substitution of
copper by other metals would be a major reason for limited price increases;
second; the foreign exchange reserves of the CIPEC countries are relatively
low, so that the risks of taking sustained actions will be considerable. In
view of widely different interests between CIPEC members and copper companies
in the developed countries, the formation of a copper cartel or coordinated
oligopolistic action of copper producers is unlikely. The recent announcement
by CIPEC members of a 10% cut in shipments represented unified action on their
part for the first time. In view of the statistical surplus in supply, this
decision must be regarded as good business sense. Many U.S. and Canadian
producers have also announced production cutbacks and more producers are likely
to follow. The current statistical surplus is estimated at an annual rate of
400,000 tons. It seems likely that the cutbacks would preclude further declines
in prices, and also that the cycle time of low prices will be shortened.
28.       It is noteworthy in this context that production costs in CIPEC
countries show substantial differences. At the same time all CIPEC members
recently announced major expansion plans and some new projects are already
being implemented. Many of the new projects are being developed in cooperation
with copper companies based in developed countries. It does not appear that
there is any coordination of expansion plans. This seems to support the con-
clusion that CIPEC chances for drastic price action are rather dim.
4.   Supply/Demand Prospects
World Supply of Primary Copper
29.       A projection of world copper mine capacity is subject to a more
than usual uncertainty at this time. Based on estimates made by industry
sources and by Bank staff, world mine capacity in 1980 has been projected by
region and by country as presented in Table 16. "Low", "High" and "Most likely"
estimates are shown for major countries and regions for 1980. World mine capa-
city is projected to increase from 6.6 million tons at the beginning of 1974
to 8.1-9.6 million tons by 1980. No detailed projection by country or region
is possible for 1985.
30.       Latin American capacity depends on developments in Chile in the
coming 6 years; mine capacity could increase to 1.325 million tons or could
increase only moderately to 1.1 million tons by 1980. Chile presents the
largest uncertain factor on the supply side of the world copper market for the
next several years. Beyond 1980, possible developments in Panama present addi-
tional uncertainty due to the possible development of a large copper mine proj-
ect, the Cerro Colorado. However, for the present it seems unlikely that this
mine will be in operation by 1980. Other uncertainties in this region exist
in Peru and Mexico.

31.       Among the developed countries, significant expansions are possible
in the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa. However, recent
trends in Canada and Australia towards reorientation of their mineral invest-
ment policies could have serious dampening effects on the pace of investments
in copper mining capacity in these countries.
32.       One of the problems for a rapid expansion of the world copper mine
capacity is the availability of capital. Capital investment required to estab-
lish a capacity to produce refined copper is estimated at around US$4,000
(in 1974 constant terms) for each annual ton of capacity. 1/ Thus, if the
"high" estimate of projected capacity, i.e., 9.5 million tons per annum, is
to be realized by 1980, $12 billion (in 1974 constant terms) would be required
to build the additional 3.0 million-ton capacity needed.
33.       Table 17 indicates the implications of various possible magnitudes
of annual investment in the world copper industry for (i) additional capacity
to be created by 1980, (ii) total capacity available at the beginning of 1980
and (iii) mine production in 1980. Between the end of 1968 and the end of
1973, world mine capacity increased from 4.98 million tons to 6.61 million
tons, by 0.41 million tons per annum, or at 7.2% per annum.

1/   Sir Ronald L. Prain gave an estimate of about 3,000 dollars per ton of
refined copper in his speech given in 1971 ("The International Outlook
for Copper", American Metal Market Forum, London 1971). Allowing for the
inflation that has occurred since 1971 and for estimated extra costs
needed for pollution controls in smelting and refining, a rule-of-thumb
estimate of US$4,000 per ton of capacity has been arrived at. This may
be an overestimate to the extent that new capacity results from an ex-
pansion of already existing capacity.

Supply/Demand Balance
34.       At this point in time copper demand trojections are extremely
difficult. On the one hand, a continuing economic slow down in the developed
countries may limit copper consumption growth, while on the other hand, copper
may also benefit from the relatively more rapid increase in the prices of alu-
minium and petrochemicals. Although it will probably not regain markets pre-
viously lost to aluminum, copper's competitive Dosition vis-a-vis aluminum
and plastic have now improved as a result of sharp increases in petroleum
prices.
For the purpose of this report two hypotheses for future refined copper con-
sumptions will be analyzed:
a)   Hypothesis I assumes that while economic growth in developed
countries and non-oil-exporting developing countries might
somewhat slow down in the coming decade, industrialization in
oil-exporting countries would accelerate in the future and
therefore consumDtion of refined copoer will grow at 4.5% per
annum in line with the long-term growth trend of consumption
over the 1970-73 period;
b)   Hypothesis II assumes that world consumption of refined copper
will increase by 3.2% per annum until 1977 and 4.0% per annum,
thereafter in view of the present economic stagnation and
inflation. Hypothesis II represents the most likely demand
forecast.
35.       As presented in table 18, world refined copper consumption would
increase by 1980 to 9.2 million tons under hypothesis I and 8.8 million tons
under hypothesis II. In contrast, projected refined copper supply for the
Western World is estimated at 9.3 million tons in 1980. During the seventies
there is a slight possibility of an oversupply of refined copper ranging from
100,000 tons per year to 700,000 tons depending on the accuracy of projected
consumption growth rate. An additional reservation must be made: The supply/
demand balance assumes that over the coming 5 years the supply of secondary
refined copper will remain at about 15% of total refined copper production.
However, since the supply of secondary copper has been extremely price
elastic, it may well be that with falling prices during an oversupply situa-
tion the supply of secondary refined copper would drop, and thus exact a new
market equilibrium.
C. PRICES
1.   Pricing System
36.       Copper is priced in three main markets, the London Metal Exchange
(LME) the Commodity Exchange in New York (COMEX) and the producer controlled
markets.

LME
37.       The London Metal Exchange is the most important "pricing" market
for copper. Less than 10% of copper sales are actually delivered from LME
stocks, but the bulk of copper's international trade in refined copper is
undertaken directly by producers and consumers at prices prevailing at the
LME around the date of shipment. Metal dealers also quote LME prices for
their transactions. The LME operates on both cash and future contracts
which allows hedging operations against inventory losses and currency realign-
ments. During 1973 and 1974 there has been an increase in non-industry specu-
lations in copper to hedge against inflation and exchange rate changes.
38.       The LME is European biased since it reflects mainly the short term
supply-demand outlook in Europe, where its warehouses are located (UK, Germany,
Holland and Belgium). Due to its physical thinness and marginal character
speculation exaggerates ups and downs on a very short time basis, so that
daily up and downs of more than 5% are not uncommon.
39.       Usually, sales contracts for refined copper are signed on an annual
basis and specify twelve monthly quotas to be shipped by the seller. Prices
are related to the LME's settlement price (wirebars' moving seller cash prices)
on a cif basis. The typical buyer can price his quotas during a 2 month period
(covering the shipment date) the prices of any particular day and communicate
it to the seller not later than noon of the following day. Certain restric-
tions to this pricing mechanism do exist, e.g., not more than 25% of a
monthly quota can be priced in one day and not more than 50% in one week.
On the average the buyers can gain a fraction of a cent per pound by carefully
choosing the pricing days. Copper concentrates are bought on long-term con-
tracts which can be as long as 10-15 years, but will generally be at the order
of 3-5 years. Pricing is usually based on the monthly average of the LME cash
wirebar quotations/minus treatment costs.
COMEX
40.       The Commodity Exchange in New York is smaller and far less signifi-
cant than the LME, but trades cash and future contracts of up to 14 months.
Prices are influenced by the U.S. producer price. Due to arbitration, COMEX
quotes differ usually not more than a few cents/lb. from the LME price quotation.
Producer Prices
41.       The U.S., Canada and the COMECON  countries trade copper on the basis
of producer prices, a selling price fixed by the producers which is generally
kept unchanged for several months. Chile and Zambia quoted producer prices
until 1967 when the CIPEC countries decided to trade according to LME price
quotations. The following table compares producers and LME prices during the
1960-73 period.

42.       Producer price changes follow mainly operating cost increases.
In the past average producer prices have been lower than the LME quotations,
so that U.S. consumers rely on imports only to satisfy their marginal needs.
In general, consumers of producer markets do not switch to imports when the
LME price drops significantly, since refined copper is sold on one year con-
tracts and import tariffs may equalize price advantages.
2.   Past Copper Price Development
43.       Copper prices have not fallen appreciably below the 30 cent level
since the end of the Korean war, except briefly in 1957/58. Annual averages
of both U.S. Producer and London Metal Exchange (LME) prices fluctuated with
in a range of 29-32 cents per pound (33.5-37.0 cents per pound at 1968 prices)
form 1953/54 to 1964. They rose about 40 percent above this range (to over
40 cents per pound) in 1955/56, and fell about 15-20 percent below it in
1957/58 (to 25.8 cents per pound in the U.S. and to 24.7 cents per pound on
the IME).



ANNEX 3-2
Page 27
44.       During the 1953-63 period the copper trade generally believed that
major primary producers regarded 30 cents per pound in the U.S. (and a slightly
lower LME quotation) as a target price. In the early 1960's non-US producers
intervened directly in the LME to hold the price above 29 cents at a time when
excess capacity caused all major producers to cut production. In 1965, non-US
producers set a price of 29.5 cents independently of the LME.
45.       Since 1965 copper prices have risen far above the earlier "normal"
level. Even in the U.S. where Government pressure held the domestic copper
price to 36 cents until the end of 1966, it subsequently rose to 61 cents by
April, 1970. Outside the U.S. prices have risen much faster. Since the out-
set of 1965 the LME price has never been less than 45 cents. In March 1966,
when producer pricing was abandoned, LME spot price quotations reached 85 cents
per pound. This was followed by a decline and then another peak at 78 cents
in March, 1968 during the U.S. copper strike. Prices declined in the spring
and summer of 1968 after the strike was settled, but another rise started in
mid-1968, continued over 1969, and in 1970, reached monthly averages of 73 cents
in January; 75 cents in February; and 79 cents in March. The LME average price
for 1970 was 64 cents, only slightly below the 1969 average of 66 cents. How-
ever, prices had started a new decline in April 1970, falling to 47 cents in
December of that year. They remained at about this level throughout 1971,
averaging 49 cents for the year. Industrial production slowed down, copper
stocks increased, and only production difficulties in some producer countries
kept prices above the 45 cent average. This situation did not basically change
in 1972. Stocks continued to increase and the LME price averaged 49 cents for
the year. The dispute between Kennecott and Chile brought an additional element
of uncertainty to the world copper market which helped maintain price levels
despite the increase in stocks. Early in 1973 the problems in Chile, various
strikes at mines and refineries elsewhere and transport problems in Zambia
pushed copper prices upwards. The new monetary crisis leading to a devaluation
of the stocks and substantial increase in the free gold price added to the pres-
sure on copper prices. During January-March 1973 the LME price averaged 59 cents
and daily quotations went above 70 cents in March for the first time since 1970.
Other extraordinary events followed, including the largest number of "forces
majeure" in any year since 1945, the highest rate of international economic
growth in many years, and strong world inflation. All these factors played
a role in pushing LME prices to $1.20/lb. in early December. Price escalation
was encouraged by massive speculation in commodities which accompanied the
monetary and the oil crisis.
46.       The volatility of the world copper market since 1964-72 was due to
a number of factors, the most important of which were: a) uncertainties con-
nected with the 1964 presidential elections in Chile, and with Zambia becoming
independent in 1965; b) a U.S. maritime strike in 1965; c) miners' strikes in
Chile (1965/66), the U.S. (1967/68), and Canada (1969); d) saled from the U.S.
copper stockpile (1966); e) delayed implementation of copper expansion programs;
f) monetary crises leading to devaluations of sterling (1967), and of the
French franc (1968), as well as revaluation of German mark (1969), and new cur-
rency alignments at the end of 1971 and early in 1973; g) copper purchases by
Communist China and the USSR; h) the economic boom in industrial nations in



ANNEX 3-2
Page 28
1969, the general slump in economic activity in 1971/72, and the signs of a new
industrial boom appearing late in 1972; i) the substantial shortfall of Chile's
copper production from previously announced expansion targets; and production
of export problems elsewhere (Zambia, 1971 and 1973; Belgium and Canada, 1973);
and J) the impact of US pollution controls on refinery production (1972/73).
47.       Prices remained high during the first five months of 1974, averaging
about $120/lb. However, in real terms copper prices in 1973 were lower than
in 1969 and 1970. Even back in 1966 copper prices in real terms had been 33
percent higher than in 1973, and the recent price of $1.20/lb. is still slightly
below the record high of 1966 (see table 18). The recent extraordinary price
increase seemed to be influenced mainly by the following factors: first,
uncertainty about the impact of the oil crisis; second, the unknown size of
investment in copper as a hedge against devaluation; third, the increased
demand from China which has been a copper purchaser to a far greater extent
than ever before, though actual figures are not yet available; fourth the
uncertain outlook for a reduction of inflation rates in all industrialized
countries, and finally the possibility of a major strike in the US copper
industry after June 1974 when the 3 year labor contracts were up for renego-
tiation.
48.       Copper prices fell significantly after June 1974 to 56 cents/lb.
in December 1974. Several reasons related to demand decreases have been
quoted for this dramatic price drop; first, the US strike did not materialize
in the expected magnitude so that consumers are diminishing the level of their
stocks; second speculation in copper by non-industry sources has declined to
its normal level; third, the Japanese industry had built up its copper stock
during the first half of 1974 because of a rapid drop in copper consumption,
and finally industrial growth in the developing countries continues to be
slow during the second half of 1974.

3.   Price Projections
49.       Through 1980, production capacity outside the centrally planned
economies (CPE's) is expected to increase from 6.6 million t in 1974 to 8.1
- 9.6 million tons in 1980. If production facilities were to be operated at
93 percent of capacity -- a reasonable assumption in line with past experi-
ence -- the result will be supply surplus by 1980. This assumes: (a) no long
strikes, no political disturbances affecting copper production, etc. beyond
those which have continuously interferred with "normal" production over the
past 15 years; (b) average completion of the various expansion programs; (c)
an increase in net imports by the CPE's from about 100,000 t in recent years
to 200,000 t by 1980. Under these conditions, Zaire and the other copper
exporting countries are expected to encounter no difficulties in marketing
their expanding copper production. The major question is the prices this
production will command.
50.       Traditionally long-term price projections of copper have been based
on either (i) extrapolation of past price trends or (ii) the long-term cost/price
relationship at the equilibrium level. The following paragraphs discuss the
results of both methods.
Price Extrapolations
51.       Despite violent fluctuations copper prices have followed a long-term
upward trend in real terms; in 1973 terms they rose from an average level of
$0.435/lb during the 1929-38 decade to $0.650/lb during the 1949-58 decade and
to $0.740/lb over the 1959-68 decade. The 1969-1973 average was $0.808/lb.
Assuming continuation of the long-term post-war trend, real copper prices in
1973 terms would reach $0.885/lb in 1980 and $0.920/lb in 1985. With inflation
projected at an annual rate of 8.8 percent between 1973 and 1980 and at 6.0 per-
cent for 1980-85 copper prices in current terms would reach $1.60/lb in 1980
and $2.23/lb in 1985. Projections by trend extrapolation depend to a large
extent on the selection of the base period which can alter significantly the
results. For example, if price projections are based on an average price of
$0.74/lb 1/ (in 1973 terms) for the 1969-75 period instead of $0.808/lb during
1969-73, by 1980 copper prices in current terms would reach $1.33/lb instead
of $1.60/lb - a difference of nearly 20%.
Price/Cost Relationships
52.       Data on production costs are difficult to obtain.  One expert quoted
them as averaging $0.130/lb in 1952, $0.241/lb in 1965 and $0.32/lb in 1970,
an average annual nominal increase of 5.2 percent between 1952 and 1970, and
I/   On the basis of actual copper prices in January-October 1974 and short-
term projections for the coming 12 months, average prices of US$0.92/lb
in 1974 and US$0.73/lb in 1975 can be estimated (see paras. 57-58).

of 5.8 percent between 1965 and 1970. 1/ Industry sources in developed countries
state that since 1970 the rate of production cost increases has accelerated,
not only because of circumstances of exploitation but also because of special
developments with respect to pollution controls. The extra costs of pollution
controls for existing smelting and refining facilities vary widely depending on
processes used but rough estimates indicate that they fall within the range of
10-15 percent of present unit cost of production. However, cost of pollution
control influence production cost only in countries which have only recently
adopted strict standards, i.e., the USA, Japan, and Canada. Since invest-
ments in pollution control have been phased over a period of time and are
necessary for only some copper producing countries, it is likely that the
real cost increases due to pollution controls will be moderate.
53.       Based on an average unit cost of copper production of $0.32/lb in
1970 prices, cost increases of 2 percent per annum in real terms and an average
inflation rate of 8.8 percent per annum during the seventies, by 1980 copper
production cost will reach US$0.39/lb in 1970 prices and US$0.89/lb in current
prices. However, it must be noted that the above cost projection may over-
estimate actual cost. The unit production cost includes royalties, export and
other taxes, fixed cost items, etc. which may not increase at the same rate
as general world inflation.
54.       Statistically, the market price of copper has had a certain relation-
ship to the average price of competitive copper. 2/. The "Notman-Formula" 3/
put this relationship at 12:7; the formula, essentially, gives the price/cost
relationship needed to maintain equilibrium of supply and demand over the long
term. During the 1952-1970 period the average price of copper (LME, U.S. ex-
ports, U.S. Producers) was $0.38/lb while the average cost of mine production
(excluding royalty and export tax) was $0.21/lb. The "Notman Formula" would
give an average price of $0.36, fairly close to the actual figure. Applying
the formula to the above cost projection of $0.89/lb in current prices for 1980,
we obtain a 1980 copper price of $1.52/lb in current prices.

Market Forum, London, 1971. See also: R. Prain, Copper - New Thoughts
on an Old Theme, in: R. Prain, Selected Papers, Vol. IV, London, 1968.
2/   "Competitive copper" means non-Soviet production on excluding by-product
and co-product copper (i.e., copper produced in mines where other minerals
are predominant or equally import products), mercantilist copper where
decisions on mining depend mainly on criteria other than cost, and mines -
mainly small - with costs unknown. Competitive copper accounts for about
80 percent of total world (excluding CPE's) mine production.

Resources of the World; Washington, D.C., 1935.

55.       However, the result of the "Notman Formula" should be considered
with caution and three main reservations must be noted: First, as mentioned
in para. 54, the cost estimate used as basis for the application of the
"Notman Formula" may be overstated, since, inter alia, it includes cost compo-
nents which may increase at less than the average inflation rate (such as
interest, depreciation, royalties, taxes, etc.). Second, the "Notman Formula"
is a statistical relationship which was established during the past decades,
when the international price index increased by 1% - 2% per annum and copper
consumption and industrial production grew rapidly. However, inflation rates
projected at 8.8% per annum during the seventies may have a slowing-down
effect on industrial growth and copper consumption and thus generate a dif-
ferent price/cost relationship. Third, the "Notman Formula" represents an
empirical price/cost relationship in a copper market where major producers
have been private companies whose main objective was profit maximization.
After nationalization of major copper companies in Zaire, Zambia, Chile and
Peru representing nearly 40% of the world's copper mine production, these
state-owned companies may give priority or equal consideration to objectives
such as maximization of export earnings, production and employment. Such a
change of the basic objective may directly alter the empirical "Notman
Formula", i.e. producers may accept a lower price/cost relationship at the
supply/demand equilibrium level.
56.       Over the long term the LME and producer prices tend to reflect pro-
duction cost increases. It can be argued that this long-term trend is not a
smooth rising curve, but rather occurs in major steps. The base of each "step"
reflects a floor price which is only touched in times of serious oversupply
of refined metal. Industry sources 1/ define past floor prices of U.S. $0.10/lb
(1940-45), U.S. $0.20/lb (1953-63), U.S. $0.45/lb (1961-73) and project a floor
price of U.S. $0.70 cents/lb for the next few years.
57.       The above discussion indicates that long-term copper price forecasts
cannot be more than an intelligent guess. The following table summarizes the
range of alternative price projections:

58.       The short-term projection for 1975 ranges from U.S. $0.70/lb to
U.S. $0.80/lb. Such a drop in current copper prices reflects (i) the present
low copper price of U.S.$0.60/lb, (ii) the level and direction of refined metal
stocks and (iii) the projected economic slow down. Reportedly, users of copper
have accumulated large stocks out of fear for a possible long strike in the U.S.
copper industry by mid-1974 which did not materialize. Consequently, demand
for refined copper has been sluggish. The temporary demand suppressing effect
of the release of user stockpiles has been and will continue to be supplemented
by the effects of a worldwide recession. As industrial output in developed
countries is expected to grow at relative low rates in 1975/76 and as indus-
trialization in other regions will not move ahead rapidly enough to offset the
decline in industrialized countries, copper consumption is expected to grow at
a rate of less than 4% per annum in 1975 and 1976. At the same time additional
mine production capacity will become available in various areas and thus should
contribute to a general price decline.
59.       The "high" estimate of U.S. $1.46/lb in 1980 assumes a real price
increase of 2% per annum and an inflation rate of 8.8% per annum after 1975,
i.e., the projection assumes that copper consumption growth will continue at
4.0-4.5% per annum and no significant demand/supply disequilibrium will arise
during the seventies. The "low" projected copper price is based on the assump-
tion that declining copper consumption following a worldwide economic slow
down and a supply surplus from mine expansions which will come on stream before
1979 will create a supply/demand imbalance during the second half of the
seventies. Consequently, profit margins will diminish and medium term copper
prices may be not more than 3-5% above average unit production cost, e.g.,
the 1980 price estimate of U.S. $0.92/lb compares with the 1980 cost estimate
of U.S. $0.89/lb (see para. 54).

THE COBALT MART
1. *Cobalt is a silvery-gray metal which resembles nickel in appearance
and in many of its properties. More than 80% of the cobalt used is in some
form of metal and 15Z in cobalt oxides or other chemical compounds. Cobalt
metal is produced and marketed in briquets, granules, squares, broken
cathods, rondelles, fines and powders.
A.  WORLD COBALT RESERVES
2.        Cobalt is found in association with other metals, such as (i) nickel,
chromium and other elements in ultrabasic intrusives, (ii) silver in hydro-
thermal deposits, (iii) with copper in sedimentary deposits, and (iv) with
nickel in laterites formed by weathering of ultrabasic rocks. Normally
cobalt occurs with nickel in a ratio of 1 part cobalt to 20-40 parts of
nickel. The geology of cobalt closely parallels that of nickel in all
occurrences but that of copper.
3.       The principal known reserves of cobalt in the Western world as
compiled by the US Bureau of Mines in 1960 total 1.97 million tons and are  ;
listed below:

Total               4,360          1,978       100.0
Mining since 1960 has not depleted any listed reserves significantly. The
grade of reserves ranges from a few hundredths of a percent cobalt in
C    _ian nickel-copper-sulfide ores to 14% cobalt in nickel arsenide ores
in morocco.
4.        Table 1 does not include all the cobalt resources in lower grade
sulfide and laterite deposits as well as in marine deposits. The principal
lateric nickel deposits are in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Brazil,
Guatemala, Chile, Australia, New Caledonia, the Philippine Islands, and
Indonesia. The lateric nickel reserves in Cuba, which have been estimated
to contain 356 million tons of ore containing 1.3% nickel and 0.1% cobalt
are among the largest in the world. In addition, extensive deposits of
maiganese nodules on the ocean floor represent substantial reserves of
manganese, nickel, copper and cobalt.

B.   COBALT SUPPLY - PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
5.        Cobalt has been obtained from three sources:  scrap, land-based
mine production and sales from US Government stockpiles. In the near future,
additional cobalt supply should be available through the exploitation of
manganese nodules obtained from the sea-bed.
Scrap
6.        The production of cobalt from secondary sources is not as large
in proportion to the primary production as is common with many other metals.
Cobalt consumed in non-metallic uses such as pigments, driers, and catalysts
is not recoverable. Most cobalt scrap originates from high-temperature
alloys with smaller quantities generated from magnets.
7.        Data on scrap cobalt is only available in the US.  According to
this information cobalt secondary production accounts for not more than 3%
of total annual requirements, thus representing a minor determinant of
cobalt supply. However, the US exports a significant amount of cobalt
bearing material, mainly to Germany and Belgium, where it is recovered and
refined. These export figures presented in Table 2 below can be considered
a good approximation of the world's (ex CPE) 1/ cobalt scrap supply.

8.        Essentially all cobalt produced is a by-product of copper, nickel,
silver, iron, and zinc mining. Copper mining is the principal source of

cobalt at present, but undersea mining may replace it as these deposits
are exploited. In many instances, cobalt is recovered because it is an
impurity that must be separated from other metals.
9.        In 1973 primary production of cobalt reached 25.7 thousand tons,
which was slightly higher than the previous peak figure (1971) and exceeded
the 1972 output by 12.2%. Table 3 shows the increases of mine production

Cobalt mining is concentrated in six countries, with Zaire accounting for
nearly 60X of production. Additional small quantities of cobalt-bearing
ores or concentrates are mined in Australia, Austria, Bolivia, Burma,
Chile, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Norway, etc.
10,       In the majority of mining operations, cobalt is recovered as a
by-product so that the amount of cobalt recovered is largely a function of
the quantities of copper or nickel produced, cobalt production cannot
generally be varied independently.

11.       Much of the cobalt produced in the world is refined in European
or Canadian plants. GECAMINES refines 65% of its cobalt production locally
to electrolytic cobalt, but the remaining 35%--partially refined cobalt
granules--area treated by the SGM subsidiary Hoboken in Belgium. Hoboken
also refines cobalt alloys or concentrates from Morocco and Zambia, while
the refineries in West Germany, the UK, Norway and Finland treat raw material
imported from Canada, local mine production; and recover scrap.
Stocks
12.       Cobalt has long been considered a strategic and critical material
because it is a vital component of super-alloys and armor-piercing shells.
In the past, the US Government has built up a large inventory of cobalt and
made funds available for exploration of cobalt mineral deposits. US stock-
piles amounted to 28,300 tons as of December 31, 1971; however, the current
objective is to hold only 5,400 tons which implies surplus stock equivalent
to just under one year of current world requirements. No decision has yet
been made on the pace of disposing of the surplus. If sales are not spread
over a long period, they might significantly affect world prices. However,
legislative action in the Congress for authorizing disposal is encountering
delay due to some rethinking about the reliability of raw material supply
sources. Actual disposals from US Government stockpiles are presented in
Table 6 below:

13.       Although cobalt production increased steadily from 15,800 tons
in 1965 to 25,700 tons in 1973, annual production levels were subject to
considerable fluctuations. Table 7 indicates that generally a smaller
amount has been mined whenever notable quantities from stockpiles have
been sold. Traditionally, GECAMINES--as dominating producer--adjusted its
inventories to equal cobalt world demand and supply.
Deep Sea Mining
14.       The discovery of manganese nodules in the sea bed in enormous
quantities is likely to change the cobalt supply structure significantly
and relatively more than for other non-ferrous metals. For the proposed
sea-bed operations, although larger quantities of both manganese and nickel
would be extracted, the amount of by-product cobalt recovered would repre-
sent a far greater portion of current land-based production than would be
the case for any other metal. It is estimated, for example, that one
commercial deep-sea mining operation could add each year up to 30% to current
cobalt production, while comparable portions for manganese or nickel would
be less than 5%.
15.       During the past 5 years several companies 1/  have started to
explore the nodule resource. But none of these firms have chosen and tested
mine sites, mining equipment and processing plants, and theoretically would
not be ready to move rapidly to commercial production without an additional
lead time at least 7 years. Further the legal status of ocean sea mining is
still unresolved and continues to be under review by scheduled future UN
conferences on the Law of the Sea. At this point in time, projections of
future cobalt supply are speculative because of three major uncertainties,
i.e., (i) the metal output per ton of dry nodules, (ii) the size of marine
mining operations, and (iii) the entry dates of sea-bed mining enterprises
into commercial production.

16.       The first generation of nodule mines are believed to be able to
obtain about a 95 percent metallurgical recovery. Although manganese nodules
vary in metal content and quality, a typical dry nodule would probably in-
clude about 0.21 percent cobalt content per weight. Therefore, one million
tons of dry nodules would provide about 2,000 tons of cobalt metal. 1/
17.       Economies of scale are considered to be strong at the processing
stage requiring a size of plant between three and four million tons of dry
nodules. On the other hand, an optimum size of capacity for a mining rig
is estimated at between one and two million tons of dry nodules annually.
Most systems would, therefore, be geared to the processing of three to four
million tons annually from 2-3 mining rigs.
18.       The timing of entry into sea-bed mining operations will be influenced
by:
(i) the degree of readiness of the experimenting enterprises to
start commercial exploitation;
(ii) the solution to the deep-sea mining rights question; and
(iii) the extent of control over the pace of nodule mining imposed
by the International Sea-bed Authority. j/
Several UN studies have been carried out projecting total cobalt production
from the sea-bed to reach between 3,000 to 20,000 tons in 1980; however,
these express general consensus that commercial nodule exploitation will not
start during the next two years. Table 8 on page 9 gives a possible range
of cobalt supply from deep-sea mining, as estimated by the mission.
1/   There is some difference in opinion on the amount of cobalt metal recovered
from dry nodules. A UNCTAD study used data from a 1971 United Nations
publication (A/AC.138/36) thus putting the production of cobalt at 2,900
tons per one million tons of dry nodules. The UN latest study revised
the figure to 2,000 tons of cobalt. The latter estimate was based on a
combination of data from various recent sources-see Third Conference
on the Law of the Sea-op. cit. pp. 27-28. The lower figure seems to be
nearer the likely outcome.
2/   The regime is currently under negotiation.  The basic guidelines envisage
to control the rate of nodule mining as a function of nickel demand
increases.

SUPPlY _Prospects
19.       Future supply of cobalt will not only depend on deep-sea mining
ventures, but will also be determined by the current expansion plans of
land-based operations, particularly the extensive working of nickel laterite
deposits. Table 9 summarizes projected cobalt mine production capacity during
the 1975-1982 period. Assuming 95% utilization of the projected land-base
mine capacity, the following cobalt mine production can be forecasted.

The cobalt market structure is likely to change gradually during the 80s.  By
1985 the African producers, and in particular GECAMINES, will probably lose
their dominant market position, with deep-sea operations accounting for 16%
of projected cobalt mine production.
C.   COBALT DEMAND--PAST AND PROJECTED CONSUMPTION
Uses in Industry
20.       Cobalt is a relatively expensive and important alloying metal which
is used because of its heat resistance, magnetic and chemical properties in
a number of rapidly expanding advanced technology industries. Detailed data

21.       About 70% of cobalt consumption in the US is for metallic uses
while non-metallic uses, pigments and salts account for the remainder. High-
temperature alloys (superalloys) has been the most important end-use of cobalt
since the Second World War, accounting for appximately 20% of total consump-
tion in the US. The important properties of superalloys: their significant
strength at high temperatures, resistance to corrosion by oxidation, and
resistance to contamination by alkali and acid, have made them particularly
essential for jet engines, rotor blades and other parts which are subjected
to stress at high temperatures. There are basically four types of super-
alloys in general use: iron-base alloys with chromium and nickel, chromium-
nickel-cobalt-iron alloys, nickel-base alloys and cobalt-base alloys. Cobalt
and nickel superalloys have generally comparable properties and can therefore
substitute for one another to a great extent. However, there are special
properties attached to alloys of each group which would make them particularly
suitable for certain, but rather limited applications. It is believed that
the base for cobalt alloys could expand significantly at lower prices. In
the post-war period until the end of the 1950's, consumption of cobalt in
high-temperature alloys increased by about 6.6% annually but the rate decreased
between 1960 and 1971 to under 2%.
22.       The second important use of cobalt is in the permanent magnetic
field, currently accounting for about 17% of US consumption. Alnico permanent
magnets all contain cobalt. The principal use of these magnets, taking
between 75% and 80% of the Alnico market, is in loudspeakers installed in
televisions, radios and stereos. The remainder part is used in motors and
generators. An innovative variation has been introduced to combine cobalt
in powder form with other materials so even stronger magnets with good
stability at high temperatures could be obtained. However, ceramic magnets
have been increasingly cutting into the market for cobalt-base magnets.
The result is that the annual growth rate of the US market for cobalt magnets,



ANNEX 3-3
Page 12
which was about 6.5% between 1948 and 1960, has since then reversed its
direction showing instead a decline of about 1% annually. Even at a consid-
erable lower price, cobalt may not regain the market from ceramics.
23.       Cobalt services a number of other metallic uses, each of which
accounts for a small share of total consumption, although taken together they
are responsible for one-third of the end-uses. 1/ These include the use of
cobalt in various steel alloys beside superalloys (including three basic
categories: speed, maraging and tool steels), cemented carbides, and as
seals of metals to various non-metal materials. Cobalt use in steel alloys
commands the relatively highest tonnage of this group where its consumption
has been rising. Accounting for about one-third of cobalt used in steel
alloys, high speed steel is important as a cutting-tool material for machining
various metals at high speeds. Most of these high-speed steels contain
tungsten and molybdenum. Cobalt cannot directly substitute for either, but
indirectly a molybdenum high-speed steel with a cobalt addition can replace
a tungsten high-speed steel.
24.       It also enters into a number of other steel alloys:  maraging
steels and tool steels, of which the former are applied particularly in
the aerospace industry and production of missiles. In addition, cobalt
is almost indispensable in machine tools as the metal matrix that binds
various carbides together to form cutting tools. This latter market has
been notably growing. Consumption of all metallic uses grew at about 7%
annually since 1960, which is the highest growth rate for any type of cobalt
consumption in the US (although it declined from an average growth rate of
12% annually in the post-war period until 1960), Table 11.
25.       Non-metallic uses of cobalt enjoy a dynamic and potentially
rapidly growing market. Cobalt is a very powerful drier; it acts much
quicker than its substitutes in this field: Manganese and lead. It is
essential in paints, varnishes, printing inks and related materials.
Furthermore, as a catalyst for desulfurizing petroleum and coal, it is
expanding at a significant pace. Its future prospects in this field are
quite promising, particularly as low-sulfur crude petroleum is likely to
be relatively scarce given future demand, and as various government's
legislation on smoke control and air pollution takes effect. In the latter
field, the use of cobalt as a catalyst in the automobile exhaust system is
crucial.
26.       As a result of the 1969 nickel strike in Canada, cobalt was used
in electro-plating as a substitute for nickel for a period of time. It is,
however, unlikely that it becomes a permanent replacement for straight
nickel plating. The disadvantage of cobalt in this field is its inability

to resist corrosion as well as all-nickel alloys. Some foms of cobalt-
nickel alloys which could overcome such deficiency are being developed.
Cobalt Consumption Pattern
27.       Cobalt consumption is concentrated in highly developed countries.
As indicated in Tables 12 and 13, in 1972 the US accounted for 39.0 of the
world cobalt consumption, Japan for 14.0%, the UK for 11.5% and West Germany
for 9.5%.

Overall, cobalt consumption increased by 5.8% per-annum during the 1950-71
period.  In the USA, growth rates averaged only 3.4%; however, cobalt con-
sumption increased by 4.1% during the 1960-71 period due to the demand
stimulating effects of the Vietnam war and general economic prosperity.
Cobalt consumption is closely related to industrial production. Regression
analysis covering the 1952-71 period indicates that cobalt consumption grew
1.05 times as fast as industrial production, while it grew only 0.96 times
as fast during the 1960-72 period.
Projected Cobalt Consumption
28.       Future cobalt consumption will depend primarily on the pace of
industrial growth in advanced countries and the possibility that cobalt
would substitute for various non-ferrous metals at significantly lower
prices. Table 14 presents cobalt consumption projections until 1982 under
three different hypothesis of consumption and industrial production growth
rates.

Hypothesis I:        Annual growth of 4.5% until 1977 due to economic slow
down; 5.8% annual growth thereafter.
Hypothesis II:       5.5% growth per annum until 1980 as during 1960-72,   8%
per annum thereafter.
Hypothesis III:      5.8% growth per annum until 1980 in line with the 1952-72
cobalt consumption growth;   8% per annum thereafter.
Hypothesis IV:       6.5% growth per annum until 1980 as assumed by various
UN cobalt market studies;   8% per annum thereafter.
29.       In view of the slower industrial growth projected for the coming
years, it is reasonable to assume that average cobalt consumption will not
grow faster than during the past two decades. Hypotheses II and III,
therefore, represent the most likely estimates projecting cobalt consumption
of about 35,000 tons in 1980 and 39,000 in 1982.
D.   COBALT PRICES
Past Price Structure
30.       The structure of the cobalt market is highly oligopolistic as far
as primary production is concerned. In the past, sales agents acting for
GECAMINES fix a price which is invariably adopted by other producers. 1/
It appears as if GECAMINES determines the price level allowing for cobalt
production of other countries, sales of cobalt from the US Government stock-
pile and operating cost increases. Cobalt prices since 1950 are presented
in Table 15. The high price level in the early 1950's and a relatively

lower level in the early 1960's can be associated with greater and lesser
purchases, respectively, on the part of the US Government. Variations of
the US stockpile has been the major factor for changes in GECAMINES' price
level. However, in 1972 an exceptional upward adjustment of 8.5% has been
made to-account for the US$ devaluation.
31.       Compared to other non-ferrous metals, cobalt has not followed
the general increasing price trend of raw materials. Cobalt prices were
changed only 7 times during the past 15 years and became favorable compared
to the price of nickel--a competing metal.

MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS
1.        When GECAMINES was established as Zairian-owned state company in
1967, SGM (Societe Generale des Minerais) agreed to continue the commercializa-
tion of GECAMINES' products on a fee basis and to provide a system of export
financing. Marketing fees range between 0.8-1 .0% of sales prices depending on
sale volume for copper and between 2.9-4.2% for cobalt. In addition, SGM
charges an agency fee of 0.5%. SGM maintains its own sales agencies in major
consumer countries or has acquired participation in foreign sales organizations.
Refining
2.        Since GECAMINES' refining and transformation capacity is not yet
sufficient to produce refined quality metal products in Zaire, SGM continues
to treat on toll part of GECAMINES' copper and cobalt products in Belgium by
its subsidiary Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt - Electrolytic refinery Olen.
In 1972, GECAMINES shipped to Belgium for further processing (i) 210,500 tons
of blister copper or copper cathodes which is equivalent to 48.5% of total
sales, and (ii) 1,804 tons of cathode or white alloy cobalt equivalent to 14%
of cobalt sales. Table 1 gives a distribution of copper exports by country
and refining operation; all production of germanium, silver and gold results
from refining in Olen (Metallurgie Hoboken - Overpelt). The Olen refinery has
a capacity of 400,000 tons per year of refined copper covering a wide range
of specifications and is able to refine about 15,000 tons per year of cobalt.
Contracts
3.        Although the clientele of GECAMINES' products (trade mark UMKH) has
been relatively stable, SGM has no long-term contracts or even contracts of
more than one year. An exception is the sales arrangement between GECAMINES,
SGM and Metallurgie Hoboken - Overpelt, which was modified on April 10, 1974.
Accordingly, GECAMINES agreed to supply Metallurgie Hoboken - Overpelt with
80,000 tons of copper cathodes p.a. until 1978, 150,000 tons of blister copper
p.a. until 1980, and decreasing by not more than 50,000 tons of blister copper
p.a. thereafter.
4.        As a result of this agreement, GECAMINES expects to diminish its
dependence on the Belgian copper market (23% of total copper sales in 1973)
and strengthen its position in the Brazilian and West German markets (see
distribution of sales in Tables 2 and 3). All sales contracts concluded by
SGM for GECAMINES stipulate a two months' pricing period based on LME quotations.
Future Marketing Arrangement
5.        On April 10, 1974, the Government of Zaire and GECAMINES signed an
agreement which outlines the future marketing arrangements. The agreement
stipulates:



ANNEX 3-4
Page 2
(i) SGM will transfer its exclusive marketing responsibility
for GECAMINES' products to a wholly Zairian-owned company
for the cotmercialization of mineral products. This
company will operate as GECAMINES' agent.
(1i) The new marketing company (SOZACOM) will take headquarters
in Kinshasa. It will be established with SGM's technical
assistance and should take over all marketing activities by
March 31, 1976, or later if requested by SOZACOM.
(iii)  For its services, SGM receives marketing fees according to
the extent of its intervention and payments under a separate
contract regulating the technical assistance provided for the
conception, organization, recruitment and staff training of
SOZACOM.
(iv) For SGM's know-how, SGM will receive 400 million FB (US$10 million)
at the final transfer of the marketing responsibility to SOZACOM.
6.        SGM has been asked to present to the Government of Zaire an organiza-
tional, staffing and training plan for the newly created marketing organization,
SOZACOM (Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation des Minerais). SOZACOM has
been created on July 10, 1974 by decree No. 74-010, and Mr. Zola has been
appointed General Manager.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
Technical Description of the Expansion Project
A.   Introduction
1.        The Mashamba and Dikuluwe ore deposits are located in the Western
Group within Gecamines' Copper Concession. It is one of the larger known
deposits remaining within the Concession.
2.        The mining of the deposits, together with the concentration, smelt-
ing, and refining facilities will result in major adjustments in material
flows. The effect in these changes is shown in Annex 4-1, page 10. A significant
effect is the treatment of lower grade oxide ore stockpiled during the mining
of the older open pits.
B.   Geology and Ore Reserves
3.        The Dikuluwe and Mashamba deposits are typical of the stratiform
type found within Gecamines' concession. The two mineralized bands, each
approximately 12 m thick, are separated by a 20 m band of waste.
4.        Roughly the shape of a truncated basin, the Dikuluwe deposit dips
at 700 near surface. The dip gradually lessens to flatten out some 500
meters below surface.
5.        A section approximately 1,500 m long outcrops on surface.  As a
result, some 10 million tons are weathered and altered to oxides. The depth
of oxidation shows considerable variation along the length of the outcrop
but generally averages 100 meters.
6.        The Mashamba deposit, adjacent to the Dikuluwe, shows a more complex
geology. The general form is an anticline. It has also been subjected to
a greater degree of folding and faulting. Diamond drilling indicates that
there is significant interruption in the ore formation in the flat section
at depth. The outcrop on surface is considerably smaller than the Dikuluwfe
with less ore as oxides (approximately 6 million tons).
7.        Some 75,000 m of diamond drilling have been undertaken to evaluate
the deposits. In the portions near surface, the diamond drilling is on a
25 m pattern. This close spacing is utilized to determine the type and grade
of ore with a high degree of assurance.  It has been found necessary in
order to ensure effective mine planning of the type of ore fed to the
concentrator.  The deeper portions of the ore zone have been drilled on a
100 m pattern. Closer drilling for mine planning will be undertaken as
required.



ANNIEX 4-1
Page 2
8.        The deposits are well outlined geologically.  The background data
and knowledge of these deposits built un over the years by Gecamines permits
them to make an effective evaluation. The allowances in ore reserve calcul-
ation for dilution, sampling error, and cut-off grade are based on experience.
Review of this data by the mission indicates that the allowances are conserva-
tive. The cut-off grade is high. However the usually clear-cut demarcation
between ore and waste would preclude any but small additions to the ore reserves
if a lower figure were used.
9.        Total ore reserves for the Dikuluwe-Mashanba deposits are 171 million
tons grading 4.1% copper and 0.3% cobalt, sufficient for forty years mining.
While the deposit will probably all be mined by open pit methods, some 66
million tons, sufficient for 16 years at the projected rate of mining, is con-
tained in the presently defined pit limits.
C.   Main Production Facilities
1.   Mining
10.       The ore zones outcrop over a significant length on surface.  They
are therefore suitable for the open pit mining method chosen. The mining
operation will be similar to other open pits in the world.
11.       A small stream, the Luilu, and a tributary, the Kabulungu, join
together and flow over the Dikuluwe deposit. Two small earthfill dams and
4,000 m of diversion canal are being undertaken. The dars are approximately
300 m and 150 m long respectively.
12.       Other preparatory work includes pre-stripping of 8 million m3 of
waste from the two pits, construction of access roads, installation of
electrical distribution system and pit drainage system. One million tons
of tailings in an old storage basin must also be moved.
13.       Large scale equipment has been chosen for the mining operation.
15 cu. yd. electric shovels will be used with 100 t electric wheel trucks.
Gecamines has been standardizing on this size of equipment. In addition
to being proven in mining operations around the world, it is equipment with
which Gecamines has considerable experience.
14.       The pit slopes are generally at 40°.  However, the slopes do vary
according to rock type. In the footwall of the ore, 45o or steeper slopes
are normal whereas in the sandy shales encountered in one area, the slopes
may go as low as 16°. The study of pit slopes and slope stability represents
one of the more important activities of the mining research department.
15.       The mining sequence is established from the geological data of ore
type and grade. This data, divided into small blocks, is programmed for
Gecamines' computer, together with data on mining requirements and capabilities,
to determine the most economical sequence.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 3
16.       The Dikuluwe-Mashaiba open pits will supply four million tons of
ore per year by 1977. The Dikuluwe open pit will actually start producing
in 1975 at an annual rate of 750,000 tons of oxide ore.
17.       The ore would be crushed to -5" in semi-mobile 700 TPH jaw crushers
located at the exits of each pit. It will then be conveyed to stockpiles at
the new DIMA (the name comes from Dikuluvwe Mashamba) concentrator. The
conveyor from the Dikuluwe pit is 3,200 m long while the one from Mashamba
is 1,200 m long.
2.   DIMA Concentrator
18.       The DIMA concentrator will be located adjacent to the existing
Kamoto concentrator. The basic flowsheet and type of equipment will be
similar to that used at Kamoto IT. Two circuits -- one for oxide ores and
the other for mixed ores -- are projected for the concentrator.
19.       The ore conveyed from the primary crushers would be discharged
onto stockpiles of 13,000 t each for the mixed and oxide ores. This is
sufficient for 2.5 days operation of the concentrator.
20.       Each tyDe of ore, reclaimed from its stockpile, would be ground
in 32' x 14' autogenous grinding mills. Following classification the
oversize would be fed to 10.5' x 16' ball mills. Equipped with variable
speed motors, the ball mills can be adjusted to suit the hardness of the
ore. The output would be 85% -200 mesh (-0.07 mm) for the mixed ore and
75% -200 mesh for the oxides.
21.       Following grinding, the ores are treated in the flotation section.
The use of large (300 cil. ft.) flotation cells is proposed. In the oxide
circuit, a bulk rough concentrate is produced. This involves flotation of
a bulk concentrate by sulfidization, followed by conditioning and flotation
of another concentrate. These bulk concentrates are combined and cleaned
up by flotation to produce a final concentrate. The rejects from cleaner
flotation are returned to the bulk flotation circuit. The final concentrate
will grade approximately 24% copper. Recovery is expected to be 84 to 86%.
22.       The mixed circuit is somewvhat more complex but follows the same
principles. The hulk sulphide concentrate and oversize from the bulk dolomite
oxide concentrate are reground in a 10.5' x 16' ball mill. This is then
treated in a second bulk flotation circuit. The bulk sulphide concentrates
are combined and subjected to two cleaner flotation stages. The bulk dolomitic
concentrates are put through one cleaner stage. The final concentrates will
grade approximately 50% copper for the sulphides and 18% copper for the
dolomitic oxides. Total recovery should exceed 84%.
23.       The testing program by Gecamines Metallurgical Research Group
has been thorough and comprehensive. The various types of ores from the
two deposits have been tested in the company's laboratory. Composite samples



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
were also prepared and tested. Each of the various operating parameters --
grinding fineness, flotation, reagents were well examined. The tests indicate
that the proposed flowsheet is suited to the ore. The three types of con-
centrates produced will be pumped 10 km to the plant at Luilu.
3. Flash Smelter
24.       The sulphide concentrates, pumped to the Luilu site in three 10"
pipelines, will be thickened and filtered to lower the water content below
14%. They would then be conveyed to stockpiles.
25.       Reclaimed from the stockpile, the sulDhide concentrates are then
dried. Synthetic gas will be the fuel used in the drying furnace. The
dried concentrates, together with flux, synthetic gas, and oxygen enriched
air are fed into the top of the flash smelting furnace.
26.       The molten copper from the flash smelter will be transferred to
an anode furnace for reduction, and pouring as copper anodes.
27.       The slag (containing 6% copper and 6% cobalt) from the flash smelter
will be treated in an electric furnace to first produce blister copper. In
a second electric furnace, the slag is retreated with a flux (lime), other
slag waste, and a reducer to produce a copper-cobalt-iron alloy. This alloy
will be granulated and packed in containers for export.
28.       Another electric anode furnace, and casting wheel will be incor-
porated in this plant, and will melt the used copper anodes from the Liulu
hydrometallurgical plant and other plant scrap, and re-cast it as copper
anodes.
29.       The flash smelter proposed is based on the Outokumpu process.
Developed by Outokumpu oy for the treatment of copper sulphide concentrates,
the first smelter was commissioned in Finland in 1949. There are now over
20 smelters in operation or under construction. While most of these are
for use with copper concentrates, a few are treating nickel concentrates,
or other sulphide concentrates. Aside from the usual adjustments in early
operations, those smelters in operation are functioning well.
30.       The process is particularly well suited for Gecamines concentrates.
The high grade concentrates with few metallic impurities permit the direct
production of blister copper at 98+% copper. As a result, the process is
simplified and much cheaper. Heat is given off in the reaction, resulting
in lower fuel consumption. The flash smelter also yields a smelter gas con-
taining 14-18% sulphur dioxide. The use of the S02 to produce sulphuric acid
will enable Gecamines to become self-sufficient in its acid requirements.
The production of acid and electrostatic precipitation of dusts results in
a very clean gas discharge.
31.       Following preliminary testing by Gecamines Metallurgical laboratory,
Outokumpu was contacted for more extensive testing. Following initial work,
600 tons of concentrates were treated in Outokumpu's 25 ton per ton pilot



ANNEX 4-1
Page 5
plant. This covered the range of concentrate grades Gecamiens expects to
produce. The tests confirmed the feasibility of producing blister copper
directly.
32.       Gecamines has signed an engineering agreement with Outokumpo Oy for
design, engineering, and start-up for the flash smelter furnace and associated
equipment. Outokumpo has an excellent reputation for the quality of their
services.
4.   Electro-Refinery
33.       The copper anodes from the flash smelter will be refined electro-
lytically. The basic principles are similar to those in Gecaaine's existing
electrolytic circuits. The copper, from the anodes, is deposited on the
cathode as relatively pure metal. The impurities remain on the anode or
accumulate in the bottom of the electrolytic cell as "mud".
34.       Following a study of alternatives, the electro-refining process
was chosen. The blister copper, produced in Outokumpu's pilot plant, was
returned to Gecamines for semi-industrial scale tests. It was cast into
anodes and subjected to electrolysis in a special test section of the Shituru
hydrometallurgical plant. Although the anodes were of low physical quality,
high quality cathode copper was produced. The opeiating parameters were
also quite satisfactory. The plant results should be better than indicated
in the test.
D.   Modifications to Existing Metallurgical Plant
35.       Since introduction of the flash smelting unit for treatment of
sulphide ores will release capacity in the Luilu hydrometallurgical plant,
an increased quantity of oxide concentrates can be processed. Therefore
provision must be made to handle these oxide concentrates. At the same time,
some improvements in the existing circuit would increase capacity by 15,000
tons to 190,000 t.
36.       Oxide concentrates arrive at Luilu by pipeline from Kamoto (and
Dima when it is operational), and by rail from Kolwezi. The concentrates
from Kamoto and Dima, must be then dewatered by thickening and filtering.
The concentrates would be transferred directly to the head of the leaching
circuit after thickening or filtered and placed in a stockpile. Four storage
basins of 50 x 26 x 3 meters for the concentrates pumped from Xamoto and
Dima have also been provided for. Required equipment includes 5 - 18 m
diameter ihickeners, 1 - 22 m thickener, and 4 - 11.5' x 17' rotobelt filters,
3 - 100 m pulp tanks, and a 45,000 ton covered stockpile with a stacker and
reclaimer.
37.       The improvements in the leaching circuit are mainly in the washing
and clarification section. 3 new 22 m diameter thickners and 4 - 11.5' x 17'
rotobelt filters are required in this section. Some rationalization and
rearrangement of the existing equipment would also be undertaken.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
38.       To reduce losses in the waste filtration section, double filtration
would be iniroduced. This would require 4 - 11.5' x 17' rotobelt filters,
and a 200 m pulp tank. A third selenium column is also required.
39.       In the selective precipitation section, additional filter capacity
will be installed. This is in the denickellng, and dezincing section pri-
marily. Two 14' x 14' filters and two 60 m drum filters are necessary.
40.       Other changes to provide for the increase in capacity include an
additional thickener and filter for the denickeling section, and additions
to the preparation of lime.
E.  Ancillary Facilities
1.   Oxygen Plant
41.       To provide oxygen enriched air for the flash smelter and coal
gasification plant, a 350 ton per day oxygen plant is to be constructed at
Luilu. Oxygen will also be supplied to the existing fluo-solid roasters.
42.       While the design of the plant is to be supplied by the contractor,
it is expected that it will be similar to the plant in operation at the
Lubumbashi smelter. Key equipment, such as the oxygen compressors, will be
duplicated to ensure a continuous supply to the flesh smelter.
2.   Sulphuric Acid Plant
43.       To purify the gases from the flash smelter and provide sulphuric
acid for the hydrometallurgical plant, an acid plant will be installed to
treat the smelter gases. The traditional catalytic process will be used.
Acid production will be approximately 300 tons per day.
44.       The smelter gases containing 14-17% SO2, pass through a waste heat
boiler and an electrostatic precipitator at the smelter. Thereby 99% of
the dust will be removed and the temperature is lowered to 350'. The gases
will be further cleaned up and dried at the acid plant before the production
of sulphuric acid. Sulphur dioxide recovery is expected to be around 98%.
As a result, the smelter gases will contain few pollutants on discharge to
the atmosphere.
3.   Coal Gasification
45.       In order to evaluate alternate sources of energy for the flash
smelter and auxiliary facilities, Gecamines undertook a preliminary study of
five possibilities in early 1973. The results indicated that gasification
of the Luena lignite was competitive, and offered other advantages. The
changes in oil and other energy prices since the study have improved the
economics. It also underlined another advantage, in that fuel costs would
be free from outside events, and under Gecamines control.
46.       Following the preliminary study, a sample of Luena lignite was
sent to Lurgi in Germany. This testing confirmed the suitability of the
Luena coal for gasification.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 7
47.       The use of Luena lignite will require an expansion of the mine
from approximately 110,000 tons of coal per year to 200,000 tons. The washing
plant will be put on a two shift per day basis. The coal would be transported
290 km by rail to Luilu, and transferred to a stockpile. Reclaimed, the coal
will be crushed to - 30 mn and screened.  The - 5 mm fraction will be shipped
out for use elsewhere in Gecamineo.  The -30 + 5 mm portion will be conveyed
to the coal gasification unit.
48.       The coal gasification plant will be based on the Lurgi process.
This process is one of the more advanced of the existing technologies for
gasification.
49.       The unit will treat approximately 200 tons of coal per day, and
produce 8,800 Nm3 of gas per hour with a calorific value of 3,800 Kcal/Nm3.
4.   Limestone Qlarry and Kiln
50.       The use of lime as a flux in the flash smelter and for Ph control
in the hydrometallurgical plants will require an expansion in the Kakontwe
quarry and calcining plant. An increase of approximately 25,000 tons of lime
per year will be required.
51.       The Kakontwe quarry is located 6 km from Likasi in the Central
Group.  Presently 120,000 t of lime and 8,000 tons of calcium hydrate are
produced yearly. A third kiln will be added to achieve the required produc-
tion, in conjunction with increased quarry output.
F.   Administrative and Industrial Infrastructure
52.       Since the Western Group of mines presently accounts for 65% of
Gecamines' production, the basic infrastructure required for the expansion
unit already exists. In most cases, however, additions or modifications in
the existing facilities will be required. Transport, power supply and tele-
communications are covered in Annex 2-6, para. 2-22.
1.   Internal Transport
53.       The major items required are re-routing of some of the railroad
spurs and roads within the existing plant site at Luilu. The cost of this
work is estimated at Z 1.05 million.
2.   Water Supply
54.       Water for the expansion project will be pumped from the Luilu river.
Expansion of the existing pumping and a new water treatment plant will cost
Z 1.03 million. The water consumption is estimated at 3,400 m3 per hour.
55.       The water treatment plant will include sections for filtration (850
m3/hr), softening (550 n3/h), and demineralization (80 m3/h).



ANNEX 4-1
Page 8
3.   Electrical Distribution
56.       The main sub-station at Luilu will require reinforcement with the
installation of 8 km of 220 KV line from the Western Group HT centre to which
SNEL delivers power. The required 200/110 KV transformers will be moved
from the Seke dam. In addition new 110/15 KV transformers will be required
at Luilu, and at DIMA.
57.       Gecamines will be responsible for installation of the distribution
lines to each of the plants in the project.
58.       The total cost of the electrical installation is estimated at Z 2.98
million.
4.   Ratonto Aggregrate Quarry and Plant
59.       To provide aggregates for the concrete required in the project and
to meet future needs, Gecamines plans to 3double output of the aggregate quarry
and plant. Output is presently 12,000 m per month. Cost of the mining equip-
ment - trucks and 4" drills-is estimated at t 53,000.
60.       The plant, consisting of crushing, and wet screening equipment, pro-
duces four products: 50/25 mm for ballast; and 25/10 mm gravel, 10/2 mm gravel
and sand for concrete aggregate.  The estimated cost is t 1.58 million to double
output.
5.   Workshops
61.       The "Ateliers Quest" central workshops will be expanded to meet the
increased volume of maint nance. Total cost is estimated at Z 2.37 million.
Included are some 3,900 m of building and equipment - 2 large lathes, 1 radial
drill, etc.
62.       In addition, expansion of the Luilu workshop for the metallurguical
facilities is also planned. Total cost is estimated at t 0.92 million.
6.   Other
63.       Various other facilities, such as expansion of office space, com-
pressed air capacity, gasoline storage are also planned at Luilu. Estimated
cost is t 3.75 million.
G.   Ecology
64.       Within the Zairian context, the expansion project is satisfactory
from an ecological point of view. The deposit is located in rolling savannah
land which is sparsely populated and of low value agriculturally. The impact
of open pit mining is, of course, considerable, but the land area involved
is quite restricted. Waste from the open pit will be dumped in the area south
and east of the pit.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 9
65.       Two small streams, the Luilu and Kabulunga, join together and flow
over the deposit. Two small dams and a diversion canal, which should be com-
plete early in 1975, will direct the streams around the open pit. These struc-
tures are well designed and should pose no safety hazard.
66.       The concentrator rejects (tailings) will be pumped to a site south
east of the open pits. The earthfill retaining dam, to be constructed in three
phases with the first phase completed in mid 1974, has been designed on a sound
engineering basis. The contractor has been closely supervised, and soil tests
are undertaken regularly. No safety hazard should result from this dam. The
water overflow, based on samples from the adjacent Kamoto concentrator, is of
better quality than the intake water. The pH, being slightly alkali, precludes
dissolution of copper and other metals in high concentrations.
67.       Gases from the flash smelter will be treated in waste heat boilers
and electro-static precipitators before entering the sulphuric acid plant. As
a result, 98% of the sulphur dioxide and 99% of the dust particles will be re-
moved. It is expected that the gases will meet the standards set by the U.S.
EPA for 1975.
68.       Cooling water for the smelter furnaces will be circulated in a closed
circuit so that only make-up water and minor water usage, such as slag granula-
tion will be discharged from the plant.
69.       The bulk of the process fluids in the electro-refinery operate in
closed circuit with the existing hydro-metallurgical plant at Luilu. Therefore
waste discharges from the refinery are minimal.
H.   Social Infrastructure
70.       Investment in social infrastructure include i) housing, (ii) exten-
sion of existing community facilities in the Kolwezi area, i.e. 6 sport cen-
ters, 2 schools and 3 village centers (iii) extension of the Kolwezi hospital
and the rehabilitation of two squatter settlements. For a detailed enumera-
tion of the planned investments see Annex 5-1, para 9.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 10
71.       Most of the construction workers for the project are expected to
come from two squatter settlements adjacent to Luilu-Tshamudenda and Mwadi.
Adequate houses do exist in these settlements, but water supply and sanitary
conditions have been below standard. To improve the living conditions of its
potential workers, GECAMINES will - as part of the project - install 17 public
fountains and drainage ditches in Tshamudenda and 45 public fountains and
drainage ditches in Mwadi. The work will be executed by GECAMINES' construc-
tion department and will start in early 1975.
72.       The project includes the construction of 2,000 houses for the newly
hired workers of the expansion and 330 new staff houses to meet the future
requirement of the Western Group. The construction of 400 houses for workers
at Luilu and 330 houses for staff near Mutoshi is underway. Additional 1,600
worker houses including infrastructure and communal facilities will be built
before the end of 1977. Two locations for this new cite are being investi-
gated and a decision will be taken shortly.

Total                                         10,037
Local cost is estimated at X 590,000 or about 6% of total mining equipment
cost.  All major items will be supplied by U.S. firms and financed by the
company's funds. GECAMINES has already ordered all the major mining equip-
ment, so that the above costs represent actual 1973-74 prices. Items valued
at X 7.2 million had been delivered by mid-1974.
Civil Works (Foundations)
2.        Civil works cost for the new plants includes construction of the

bidding.
Plant Unit (Items 2-6, 9-12, 15)
3.        The new installations have been divided into plant units which
represent procurement packages. Following the Bank's procurement guidelines
tenders have been invited separately for each plant unit which includes engi-
neering and design; equipment supply and erection; building construction ex-
clusive of foundations; supervision and start-up. Although each contractor
will have full responsibility for the execution of his plant unit, GECAMINES
will provide some common services such as equipment, assistance in transport,
recruiting, housing and social services for the labor force and staff, and
maintain control and coordinating functions.

Housing construction wi;ll be planned and executed by GECAMINES' Architect
and Construction Department in coordination with local sub-contractors.
Construction of 330 staff and 400 workers houses for construction crews has
been started and should be completed by late 1974.
Pre-Operating, Engineering and Start-up Expenses (Item 19)
10.       The cost estimate includes
Cost Item                                  z 000
1.  Project Management                                3,675
2.  Detailed Drawings for Foundations                 1,542
3.  Studies supervised or executed by GECAMINES,
i.e. Modification of existing plants,
electricity extension, telecommunica-
tion, etc.                                     3,342
TOTAL                8,579
The project management cost estimate has been based on a projected staffing
need of 40 engineers and technicians in Zaire and 5 men in Europe for about
three and a half years. The category "studies supervised or executed by
GECAMINES" includes studies prepared by the GECAMINES Engineering Department
or sub-contracted to SGM or specialized firms.  During 1973-74 GECAMINES
incurred pre-operating, engineering and start-up expenses related to the
project estimated at 91.13 million.
Physical Contingencies
11.       Physical contingency allowances reflect GECAMINES' past experi-
ence with various project components. Consequently, no contingencies have
been added either for pre-operating expenses, mining equipment, or for other
already ordered items. The applied contingencies rate ranges from 5% to 20%
of equipment, erection and building cost totalling X12.25 million which is
equivalent to 7.9% of total capital cost.
Price Escalation
12.       Cost estimates for all plant items are based on either 1974 orders
for mining equipment, houses and miscellaneous equipment items, October 1974
bids or June 1974 quotations of interested suppliers for all plant units or
on GECAMINES updated estimate for all remaining equipment and construction
items. Price escalations of 1.2% per month in 1974, 15% p.a. in 1975, 12%
p.a. in 1976 and 10% per annum have been used and added to the capital cost
in line with the projected project implementation and disbursement schedule
(see Annexes 4-3 and 5-4). Price escalations average 20.2% of total capital
cost plus physical contingencies.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.        The financial projections are based on the expansion plan outlined
in Annex 4-1. Production start-up of the expansion facilities are scheduled
during late 1977. After the start-up of the concentrator in August the company
produces a saleable product, even if the flash smelter will take up production
only at the end of 1977. In order to adequately reflect the Company's future
cash position, all projections are given in nominal terms or current prices,
however, the rate of return calculations are based on projections in real terms.
2.        The total expansion production will be exported assuming the
following current prices:
Metal LME Prices             SGM Quotations
Year                    Copper                       Cobalt      _

1975            65,000         0.73          315,000        3.57
1976             67,600        0.76          342,700        3.88
1977             70,980        0.80          372,900        4.22
1978             74,555        0.84          405',700       4.60
1979            78,260         0.88          426,000        4.83
1980            82,160         0.92          447,300        5.04
1981            86,255         0.97          469,600        5.32
1982            90,610         1.02          493,000        5.60
1983            95,095         1.07          493,000        5.60
1984            99,840         1.12          493,000        5.60
1985           104,845         1.17          493,000        5.60
3.        Sales Revenues are given net of processing and marketing expenses
incurred by SGM and directly deducted from cif sales receipts. As shown in
Annexes 3-4, in the past processing and marketing expenses averaged 7.8%
and 23% of copper and cobalt gross sales respectively. Sales revenues as
given in GECAMINES income statement do not correspond to FOB sales receipts
since they still include transport cost, export financing charges etc. of
gross sales for copper and cobalt respectively.
4.        Operating Costs for the expansion project are confidential infor-
mation and are available in the Industrial Projects Department. All costs
have been projected in real terms, and then inflated by the following annual
rates:



ANNEX 6-1
Page 2

(% increase per annum)
Labor                         4        10       3         7           4
Materials, Supplies          12         8        7         7           5
External Supplies and
Services                   9         9        5         7           5
Transport                    10         8       5         5           5
These rates are based on prevailing local and related world inflation rates
and have been found to adequately cover expected increases in operating costs.
Future productivity increases have been taken into account in the projections
of quantifiable cost elements such as labor, fuel, chemical reagents, power,
etc. Major costs such as fuel and power are not subsidized and GECAMINES
imports nearly 70% of materials, supplies and spare parts which are charged
at world market prices.
5.         Labor Costs are based upon the following labor rates including
salaries, social charges, housing and home leave (for expatriates).
1974
Expatriate staff              Z2,100/mqnth
African staff                 Z  520/month
African labor                 Z   70/month
Expatriate staff is almost exclusively made up of engineers, economists and
administrators; after 1980 a greater increase in African staff is projected
corresponding to a decline in expatriate staff (See Annex 2-7, Table 2 for
details).
6.         Freight and Loading Costs - It is assumed that the "voie nationale"
route Shaba-Matadi will be used to capacity on a priority basis, followed by
the Dar-Es-Salaam railway (100,000 tons per annum) and the Lobito route for
the remaining export. The traffic forecast and the assumed rates are based
on the findings of a Bank appraisal mission which visited Zaire in April -
May 1974. The following 1974 rates were used for transport projections within
Zaire. It is assumed that the production from the expansion project will
benefit from the marginal rate of g 44.5/ton through Matadi.

7.        Fixed Assets - See Annex 5-1 for the expansion project.
8.        Working Capital Requirements - See Annex 5-2.
9.        Tax Regulation - As provided in the Zairian Investment Code, a
government decree dated June 1969, set out special 4 year tax exemptions
for GECAMINES to enable it to implement its 1970-1974 expansion program. The
Company was exempted for the 1970-74 period from all import duties and turn
over taxes on the imported capital goods and services to be used to increase
annual copper and cobalt production from 360,000 tons and 11,000 tons to
460,000 tons and 16,000 tons respectively. Furthermore, the Company was
exempted from the following taxes and duties to be levied on the incremental
copper and cobalt productions over 360,000 tons and 11,000 tons respectively:
a)   export duty of 40% for copper and 30% for cobalt on a "base
value" equivalent to (FOB value/1.41) for copper and (FOB
value/1.31) for cobalt;
b)   registration fee of 1% on the base value of mineral sales;
c)   turn-over tax (Contribution sur Chiffre d'Affaire-CCA) of 7%
for copper and cobalt levied on the net sales revenues;
d)   corporate profits tax (Contribution Professionnelle) of 40% of
profits before taxes, and



ANNEX 6-1
Page 4
e)   supplementary export tax (Droit de Sortie Complementaire - DSC)
indexed on a base value of 9 340/ton for copper equivalent to a
LEM price for copper of 9 500/ton or USi 45.3/lb; below
9 340/ton no DSC is paid. The method of calculating the supple-
mentary export tax is given in Annex 3-1, pages 13 - 16.
10.       According to the provisions of the investment code the Government
granted GECAMINES the following tax exemptions for the 1975-1982 period.
a)   export duties, turn over tax and profit tax on copper, cobalt
and their alloys in excess of an annual production of 460,000
tons of copper and 16,000 tons of cobalt
b)   import duties and turn over tax on imported capital goods
required for the expansion.
GECAMINES cannot use freely the savings accruing from the above tax exemptions,
but has to allocate it for either debt service payments related to the project,
or the financing of replacement or project investments.
11.       Following the continuing production cost increases, during the past
3 years GECAMINES has been discussing with the Government a modification of the
supplementary export tax. This tax had been originally introduced to distribute
immediately the benefits of higher than average copper prices between GECAMINES
and the Government. Agreement, in principle, has been reached to adopt one of
the two modifications as of January 1, 1975.
a)   increase of the base value of the supplementary export tax to
65,000 FB/ton of copper, or
b)   the substitution of the supplementary export by a bi-monthly
dividend according to the Company's operating results.
For the purpose of the financial projections the first alternative has been
chosen.
12.       Depreciation.  GECAMINES uses linear depreciation for all fixed
assets according to its technical life. These depreciation rates are sub-
stantially lower than the legally allowed rates. The following table gives
examples of GECAMINES depreciation practices:

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
EXPANSION PROJECT - FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
AND SENSITIVITY TESTS
Input Data
1.        The incremental, internal financial rate of return calculations
for the project are based on a financial cost/benefit stream in 1974 real
terms. This stream has been obtained by:
(a)  eliminating the general inflationary cmponent from the operating cost
streams (Annex 6-1, para 4) and calculating revenues based on copper and
cobalt prices in real terms (Annexes 3-2 and 3-3); and
(b) taking into account capital cost of 915.6 million which GECAMINES would
have to invest in the existing operations to maintain the present production
level if the expansion project were not implemented;
(c) assuming a scrap value of X35 million after 15 years, i.e., by end 1988
and based on GECAMINES' applicable depreciation.
All calculations are based on a 15 year period including 3-3/4 years for
construction.

ZAIRE: GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
Effects of Possible Short-Term Revenue Decline on GECAMINES Ability to
Help Finance the Project from Internal Cash Generation
As a member of CIPEC, Zaire has announced its intention of reducing
its shipments of copper by 10% effective December 1, 1974. While this measure
so far is in effect only through May 1975 (i.e. for six months) in view of the
present outlook of world economic conditions, it cannot be excluded that the
10% decrease in sales will be maintained for the whole of 1975. To evaluate
the effect of this possibility on GECAMINES, revisions were made in the pro-
jected income statements for 1975 and 1976 based on two different sets of
assumptions (Case I and II below):
Case I
GECAMINES sales are assumed to be reduced by 10% in 1975, while
maintaining production and the price of copper as assumed in the financial
projections,i.e. 424,800 tons of copper at a sales price of US$0.73 per pound.
The change in net income is US$2.1 million (i.e. a reduction from
US$10.4 million to US$8.3 million). Thus, prices would have to increase by
only about 1.0% at the reduced sales rate to restore GECAMINES' profits to
their formerly assumed level.
However, the company's cash flow would change more materially in
that the 47,000 tons of copper, which are produced but not sold, must be
financed and added to inventory. As a result, quick assets would be reduced
by US$44.2 million. Nevertheless, since GECAMINES had cash and accounts re-
ceivable of US$385 million in the end of 1974, which was about US$130 million
in excess of its operational needs, GECAMINES ability to provide its portion
of the project financing would not be seriously affected by a sales cut-back
of this magnitude. This 130 million dollars cash would comprise over 60% of
GECAMINES' remaining cash contribution of 216 million dollars (US$240 million
less the amount GECAMINES invested in project facilities during 1974, US$24
million).
Case II
In addition to a 10% cut-back in sales for 1975, an average price
of $0.68 per pount in 1975 and $0.71 per pound in 1976 are assumed. These
are $0.05 per pound, or 7% less than the prices used in the projections. It
is also assumed that production returns to normal in 1976. The result is
shcon in Table II. This probably represents the worst possible case for
GECAMINES.



ANNEX 6-6
Page 2
The change in net income over the two-year period is US$45.4 million
(i.e. from US$26.4 million to minus US$19 million). This combined with the
US$44.2 million necessary to finance the 10% of copper production unsold in
1975, would cause a reduction in the company's quick assets of US$89.6 million.
Nevertheless, GECAMINES has already financed during 1974 some US$24 million
in facilities for the expansion and had, at the end of the year, some US$130
million in cash in excess of its operational requirements. Thus, only some
US$86 million in additional cash generation is needed over the 1975-7 period
which should be available.
As a result, GECAMINES will still be able to meet its financing
needs for the project even under these adverse assumptions. If required,
however, GECAMINES could also resort to short-term debt to cover any possible
short fall during this period.

ANNEX 8-3
Page 1
ZAIRE:  GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
A. ASSUMPTIONS
1.        The economic cost/benefit stream has been derived from the finan-
cial projections and cost/benefit stream (Annexes 6-2, 6-4). All costs and
revenues are expressed in 1974 real terms to eliminate general inflationary
cost increases.  All calculations are based on a 15 year period including
3-3/4 years for construction.
2.        The following detailed assumptions have been made:
a) the base case has been calculated assuming no shadow pricing
of foreign exchange. However, to demonstrate the sensitivity of
the project to exchange rate changes, Chapter B gives also the
incremental economic rate of return assuming a shadow price rate
of 1.3.
b) Revenues. The financial and economic benefit streams are
equivalent, since GECAMINES will export the entire output of the
expansion project and all sales are valued at the world market
price (LME for copper, Belgian cobalt quotation).
c) Investment Cost. The project cost given in Annex 5-1 has
been reduced by price escalations totalling Z 33.9  million and
the 3% statistical tax on the fob value on imported goods esti-
mated at Z 1.83 million. GECAMINES will pay no other import
duties and taxes for the expansion project. A scrap value of
Z 35 million by end 1988 has been assumed and the alternative
investment cost of g 15.6 million has been taken into account
in the cost/benefit stream of the present operations (without
the project).
d) Personnel Cost. No shadow pricing of labor has been assumed
since the project requires primarily skilled local labor which
has to be trained by GECAMINES.
e) Indirect taxes estimated at about s 4.2 million per year
have been eliminated from the operating cost stream.
f) Other Operating Cost Items. Cost components such as fuel,
electricity and transport cost are not subsidized and conse-
quently no adjustments have been made to obtain their economic
Cost. Since GECAMINES imports nearly 90% of material, supplies
and spare parts excluding electricity, it can be assumed that
they are valued at world market prices.



ANNEX 8-3
Page 2
3.       The project includes major social investments and operating expenses
for communal services. These components constitute a benefit to the country
and should (i) either be taken into account in the economic benefit stream,
or at least (ii) be pliminated from the cost streams. For the purpose of
this report the capital and operating cost for social services related to
the project have been included for the basic economic return calculation,
since in the case of an enclave type project the direct benefits to the Company
may outweigh the indirect benefits to the Zairian economy. Nevertheless, as
part of the sensitivity analysis an economic rate of return has been calculated
(see Case 3) excluding the investment cost for social services (estimated at
3 35 million in real terms) and the operating cost for communal services
(estimated at 23% of labor cost).
