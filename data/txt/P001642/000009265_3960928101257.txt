Risks:                          The principal risk involved in the project is
the possibility that Government's financial
allocations for maintenance of infrastructure
facilities may be inadequate. Government's
commitment to the project, which helps to
implement key development policies, should
minimize this risk. For urban water supply,
a possible risk is that DWSF would not
generate sufficient revenues because the
Government may be unable to authorize
necessary tariff increases. However,
Government has recently (April 1, 1989) taken
steps to improve the financial standing of
DWSP through its tariff increases of 20Z, an
increase in line with financial targets
specified in the financial plan.

MALAWI
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR
A. Country Background
1.01     Malawi is a long, narrow, land-locked country situated in the
Great African Rift Valley, with a land area of about 94,300 km2 and a lake
area of 24,200 km2 (see IBRD Map No. 21225). A major escarpment runs the
length of the country, separating the Lake Malawi plain from the plateau to
the west; altitudes range from about 60 m above sea level in the Shire
Valley in the south to over 2,500 m in the northern plateau. Rainfall
averages between 750 mm and 1,600 mm, but is much heavier in the high
plateau areas of Mulanje, Zomba, Viphya, and Nyika (4% of land area).
1.02     Malawi is characterized by a limited resource base, poorly
developed social and physical infrastructure, and low per capita incomes.
Despite these limitations, from independence in 1964 to 1978, GDP increased
in real terms at the relatively rapid rate of 5.5% per annum, with much of
this growth a reflection of steady agricultural expansion. However,
beginning in the mid-1970s, Malawi's economic performance weakened as a
result of external shocks, delayed policy responses, and intensification of
structural imbalances. By the 1980s, growth of the economy had been
checked by (a) a rapid rise in import prices (particularly fuel, capital
goods and intermediate goods) and swings in export prices of Malawi's main
export commodities (tobacco, tea and sugar), resulting in a fall in the
country's terms of trade; and (b) droughts in 1980 and 1981 that caused a
decline in export volume and forced the normally food-surplus country to
import maize in large quantities. On the domestic front, Government
resorted to deficit spending, financed largely by external borrowing on
commercial terms. Inflationary pressures increased and the country's
balance of payments position deteriorated. GDP did not grow at all in 1980
and declined by 5% in 1981.
1.03     In 1981, Government introduced a structural adjustment program to
help restore macroeconomic stability and economic growth. This program was
supported by successive arrangements from the International Monetary Fund,
and three structural adjustment lending operations by the World Bank. A
price liberalization program was completed, key relative prices and
incentives were realigned, and measures to address structural problems were
implemented, including a major restructuring of the parastatal sector. The
adjustment package quickly yielded results, with real GDP growth of 4% per
annum from 1982 to 1985. However, by the mid 1980s, external events again
contributed to a further weakening in economic performance. These included
(a) the rising external transport costs due to the closure of the rail
lines between Malawi and the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala; and (b)
the influx of a large refugee population fleeing the insurgency in
Mozambique, now estimated to be about 750,000 or over 9% of the country's



-2-
population. From 1986 to 1987, the rate of inflation rose to 25Z and, with
imports compressed well below historical levels and inventories virtually
exhausted, real output fell by 0.2Z.
1.04     Despite the difficult environment, Government continued to
implement structural reforms during 1987 and 1988. Smallholder
agricultural marketing was substantially liberalized, agricultural producer
prices continued to be adjusted, and further actions were taken to improve
the performance of parastatals, in particular, the Agricultural Development
and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC). The Government also initiated a
program of tax reform, an important element of the structural adjustment
program presently underway. In 1988 external developments took a more
positive turn, as export receipts exceeded earlier projections due to an
increase in tobacco prices and higher capital flows due to quick
disbursement of adjustment financing. A 25Z rise in import level resulted
in strong output performance, and by year-end manufacturing capacity had
risen to 50-60Z from 30-40Z the previous year. This growth, combined with
modest recovery in agriculture due to better weather conditions, led to
growth in GDP of 3.6Z. However, inflation remained high, averaging 30Z
throughout the year.
1.05     The presence of the refugees continues to represent a significant
burden on Malawi's already strained resources, both in terms of budgetary
outlays and increased workload for existing institutions. While relief
agencies provide most of the funding for refugee programs, Malawi
Government continues to support these programs through activities such as
maintenance of boreholes in refugee areas, construction of access roads to
the camps, and payment of salaries of Government staff involved in the
supervision of relief activities. Additional costs arise from the
increased maintenance and rehabilitation requirements for infrastructure
that has deteriorated more quickly from intensive use, e.g., increased road
maintenance due to the heavy vehicle traffic of relief activities. There
is the further need to expand the infrastructure to compensate for services
and facilities previously available to the Malawian population but now
overburdened by the refugees. A recent Bank study of the Malawi Refugee
Public Expenditure Program estimated the total cost to Government of these
activities, after relief financing, to be US$14.5 million in FY 1988/89 and
US$10.0 million in FY 1989/90.
1.06     With a population of about 8.0 million, growing at an average rate
of 3.7Z per year and added to by Mozambican refugees, Malawi has one of
the highest population densities per km2 of agricultural land in Africa.
Since 90Z of the population lives in rural areas, and agriculture
contributes over 90X of Malawi's exports, rural development is a primary
economic and social objective. In addition to raising agricultural
productivity, rural development is seen as an effective vehicle for the
Government's policy of redistributing income in favor of the rural poor.
Such development has involved improvement of road access to markets, public
health facilities and other services for the rural population; it also has
included providing more convenient and better quality water supplies in
rural areas.

B. Institutional Framework
1.07     Responsibility for developing the three sectors -- roads, water
supply and public buildings -- rests in the Ministry of Works (MOW). MOW,
which is organized according to its three basic functions (Chart I), has
offices in each of the three regions which are directly responsible for
field operations for roads, water and other works. MOW also has a Plant
and Vehicle Hire Organization (PVHO) with workshops in all regions and in
most districts and a central workshop in Blantyre for major repairs. In
total there are some 100 professional staff, 400 sub-professional and
supervisory staff and 1,300 other salaried staff. MOW has in the past been
administered by senior expatriate staff, financed by ODA of UK. These are
gradually being replaced by Malawians.
1.08     Nationwide, about 97% of formal sector jobs have been localized.
The rate of localization of positions in MOW has been somewhat slower
particularly with regard to engineering positions. Of the 112 professional
level posts in MOW, 53% are presently filled by Malawians and 29Z remain
vacant. The accelerated localization has imposed an increasing burden on
management of many of MOW's functions. The project will therefore provide
support for integrated staff development, including substantial technical
assistance coupled with local and overseas training. Implementation of
this staff development component will also facilitate localization of MOW
staff. At negotiations, the Government presented a localization plan for
MOW. The plan sets targets for filling 27 positions, currently held by
expatriates, with Malawian staff according to the following time schedule:
2 positions in 1989/90, 4 in 1990/91, 2 in 1991/92, 7 in 1992193, 6 in
1993/94, 2 in 1995/96, and 4 in 1996/97. The Government agreed to take all
appropriate measures to implement the plan and meet these targets.
1.09     The Government has an active staff development program for
selecting, educating and training nationals for professional positions.
This program has not yet met the demand for qualified personnel, mainly
because of a scarcity of suitable candidates. The private sector offers
better salaries for experienced engineers and other technical personnel,
and thus MOW has difficulty competing with private firms. Training abroad
is provided with external assistance. The Polytechnic, part of the
University of Malawi, is developing its capacity in the technical fields
with the help of bilateral assistance. Good progress has been made in
training lower echelon personnel, such as supervisors, foremen, equipment
operators and mechanics in MOW's two training facilities in Zomba and
Lilongwe. Development of the latter facility was financed under the Fourth
Highway Project (Credit 1099-MAI, 1981, SDR 25.9 million), and Fifth
Highway Project (Credit 1423-MAI, 1983, SDR 12.4 million, IDA Special Fund
Credit SF-6-MAI, SDR 13.1 million, and Loan 2363-MAI, US$18.0 million).
However, it requires further expansion and increased focus on
technical/practical skills to accommodate the demand for training.
Provision is made in the project for the expansion of both the Lilongwe and
Zomba training centers.
1.10     Overall, MOW needs major strengthening to enable it to perform its
wide-ranging functions effectively. As a result of management weaknesses
and the underfunding of infrastructure maintenance during past years,
serious deterioration of assets has occurred and much rehabilitation is now
required, particularly for roads, boreholes and public buildings. In the



- 4 -
meantime, there is an urgent need to expand the water supply capacity in
three large and four smaller urban areas. However, the principal
unresolved issue relating to infrastructure development, maintenance and
administration is that of improving the management capabilities of MOW.
Under the proposed project, MOW will be reorganized and new management
systems introduced; the basis for this planned reorganization is an IDA-
funded consultants' study completed in January 1988 (para. 2.03).
C. Past and Planned Investments in Infrastructure
1.11     Government's overall priorities among sectors and subsectors are
reflected in the 5-year rolling public sector investment program.

Total investments in transport were relatively small in the 1982/83 and
1983/84 years, but increased steadily in all later years. Similarly,
transport investments as a percentage of total investments reached a low of
about 21Z in 1983/84, but continued to rise to 372 by 1987/88. Investments
in water supply declined steadily throughout the same period until 1987/88
when expenditures nearly doubled over the previous high. Investments in
public buildings decreased steadily in absolute and relative terms to less
than 1Z of total expenditures in 1987/88.

1.13     Planned investments in transport are large throughout the plan
period in relation to the other sub-sectors and as compared with actual
transport investments in recent years. Transport investments as a
percentage of total investments would remain around 31X - 33Z during
1989/90 and 1990/91, and then fall gradually to 27% by the end of the five-
year period. Road investments constitute a heavy proportion of the planned
transport investments, with the percentage rising through the period from
53% to 84Z. Two important factors in the large transport investments
during the period are the costly multimodal Northern Transport Corridor
Project (Credit 1879-MAI, 1988, SDR 11.1 million) already under
construction and the road rehabilitation and improvement works included in
this project.
1.14     Investments in both water supply and public buildings are expected
to increase steadily over the next five years. As a percentage of total
investments, water supply is shown as growing from 4% to 9% and public
buildings from less than 1X to 6% over the five-year period.
1.15     Whereas planning of both water supply and public buildings is the
responsibility of the respective departments within MOW, coordination of



-6-
transport investment plans is the responsibility of the Transport Planning
Unit (TPU) of the Economic Planning and Development Department (EPDD) of
the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC). TPU reviews proposals put
forth by MOW for roads and by the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MTC) for other modes. The transport planning and coordination capability
in TPU has been strengthened by technical assistance financed under the
Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects. The Credit agreement for the project
contains a covenant requiring the Government to consult with the
Association prior to undertaking any new investments in infrastructure.
D. The Highway Subsector
Composition of the Transport System
1.16     Malawi's transport system comprises about 12,850 km of roads, 678
km of railways, 4 lake harbors and a number of landing points served by the
Lake Service, and 4 commercial airports. The principal features of the
system are (i) a main road network of about 3,300 km, which is fairly well
developed south of Lilongwe but somewhat less developed in the northern
half of the country; (ii) the rail system, which lies entirely in the
southern half of the country; (iii) lake transport, which mainly serves the
north and compensates to some extent for the limited land transport links;
and (iv) air transport, which handles mainly passengers for whom time
savings are particularly important. The main outlets to the sea for
Malawi's external traffic were, prior to 1983, two railway lines through
Mozambique to the ports of Beira and Nacala on the Indian Ocean linked to
the internal rail system. As a result of bandit activity along these lines
in Mozambique in recent years, the traffic declined and ultimately ended
with most of the traffic diverted to much longer and costlier routes
through Zambia, Zimbabwe and the Republic of South Africa (RSA). A new
route for external traffic is being developed via road through northern
Malawi and connecting the TANZAM railway to the port of Dar es Salaam in
Tanzania under the Northern Transport Corridor Project.
1.17     The system, consisting of road, railways, lake and air traffic,
constitutes the top, most visible part of the total transport system.
Within the rural areas of a country such as Malawi, a less visible
transport system exists upon which the conventional road and motorized
vehicle network is superimposed. This system has much denser coverage and
extends to the doorstep of each rural household. Its capacity to meet the
substantial movement needs of the rural population is limited by the
infrastructure and means of transport that characterize it: footpaths and
tracks, low vehicle ownership, a predominance of pedestrians and a paucity
of transport services. This basic rural infrastructure, including non-
motorized vehicles and transport services, has received little attention in
the past, and there is a need to expand its capacity to improve the
mobility of Malawi's rural population (para. 1.22).
The Road Network
1.18     The network of classified roads totals about 10,050 km (Table 1.3)
of which some 2,200 km (about 22Z) are paved, 1,900 km are of engineered
gravel standard and the rest are earth roads. In addition, there are about
2,000 km of unclassified feeder and crop extraction roads constructed to



- 7 -
minimum standard under agricultural development projects and an
undetermined length of unclassified earth roads and tracks, including about
800 km within forestry plantations and reserves and another 80 km within
the national parks. Road density is about 141 km per 1,000 km2 or 1.9 km
per 1,000 inhabitants, which is above average for southern African
countries. A high proportion of the paved and otherwise improved roads is
located in the southern half of the country, reflecting the general pattern
of regional imbalance of development in the past.

1.19     The coverage of the network is adequate for the country's present
needs, but the road standards and maintenance conditions are not
satisfactory on much of the system. Although improvements have been made
on some roads, particularly upgrading them to paved standard, there still
are many low standard roads, resulting in high transport costs. Most paved
roads are in fair to good condition, while the majority of gravel and earth
roads are in fair to poor condition (Table 1.4). Overall, 60Z of the roads
are in fair condition, 25Z are in relatively poor condition, and nearly 15%
are in good to excellent condition.

1.20     From 1977 to 1987, the overall length of the road network remained
relatively constant. However, the length of paved roads during this period
rose by 26% from 1,749 km to 2,208 km. Construction of the north-south
spine road to paved standard has been a high priority for many years and
nearly the entire road is now built; the last segment from Karonga to the
Tanzania border will be completed under the Northern Transport Corridor
Project. Another long-term development has been the construction or
improvement of almost 5,400 km of district roads, of which about 2,000 km
have not yet been so designated, in nearly all districts. Having
constructed or substantially improved many main roads in recent years,
attention is now shifting from new construction to road rehabilitation and
improved maintenance of the existing network (para. 1.30).
Road Use
1.21     While good standards have been achieved in the maintenance of
district and even of unclassified roads, traffic volumes are low.
Transport services and the ownership of vehicles among the rural population
have not risen to take advantage of the opportunity offered by a network in
good condition. Comprehensive data on road traffic are not available, but
periodic automatic counts have been taken at a number of strategic points
on the road network. The data show that over a 9-year period, 1975-1984,
traffic increased 3Z in the Southern Region, 17Z in the Central Region and
21% in the Northern Region. Overall, these data indicate average growth of
less than 1% per year. Traffic volumes on main roads vary considerably
between the south, where traffic is mostly in the range of 200-600 vehicles
per day (vpd), and the north with far lower traffic levels, mostly in the
40-100 vpd range. Traffic on secondary and district roads averages about
30 vpd.
1.22     Data on motor vehicle registrations suggest that the number of
vehicles in use increased from about 38,700 vehicles in 1984 to 44,150 in
1985 but subsequently declined (Table 1.5). In 1986, the latest year for
which data are available, 40,311 vehicles were in use, a decrease of 9%
over the preceding year. Passenger cars apparently declined by 8X and
goods vehicles by 13% in the 1985-1986 period. Most of the goods vehicles
have less than 3-ton carrying capacity and a high proportion of the heavier
trucks have a relatively low average capacity of 7 tons.

1.23     The great majority of trucks are owned by various private firms
and public agencies for transport of their goods. Among transport
companies hiring out their vehicles, about 470 companies operate an
aggregate fleet of some 1,400 trucks of 3-ton capacity and over. More than
60Z of these trucks are owned by small operators and 34Z by 9 large
operators with over 30 vehicles each. The average size of the for-hire
fleet operated by small operators is 3 vehicles with an average capacity of
7 tons, compared to vehicles of 9-ton capacity on average operated by the
large companies.
1.24     Bus services are provided by the private firm United Transport
(Malawi) and a few small local operators. Services are concentrated in
urban areas and along the main roads, often with long distances between
scheduled stops. While large buses predominate, the numbers of mini-buses
for short distance scheduled and unscheduled stops are increasing. Public
passenger services along secondary and district roads are virtually non-
existent. A consultant study of bus transport needs in rural areas was
completed in 1985. On the basis of the study recommendations, a pilot
rural transport scheme is included in the project.
1.25     A significant proportion of rural transport also does not take
place on roads. Studies investigating rural transport in developing
countries from the demand side have shown that most rural transport takes
place away from the road network on tracks and footpaths in and around
villages. Ownership of wheeled vehicles is extremely limited and walking
and headloading predominate as means of transport. The amount of transport
that is taking place away from roads appears to be taking up so much
household time and energy that productive activities are seriously
constrained. A pilot project proposed by the International Labour Office
(ILO) aims to make household transport more efficient (para. 2.15). This
pilot project, although not included under the Infrastructure Project, was
reviewed at appraisal because of its potential significance for rural
transport planning investment and its complementarity to the rural
transport services scheme.
1.26     Regulation of road users is of various types.  Road transport
licenses are awarded by the Road Traffic Commissioner's Office of MTC and
are provided for specific routes. Freight rates are regulated by
specifying maximum rates per ton-mile, although in practice competition
among road transporters frequently leads to charges below the published
rates. Vehicle dimensions and weights are also regulated, the maximum
allowable axle load being nine tons, but enforcement has not been fully
effective. Under the Fifth Highway Project some mobile scales were
introduced and some of the existing weighing stations were upgraded. These
actions have had a favorable effect on compliance with regulations.
1.27     In keeping with its policy to give priority to use of existing
infrastructure and to develop competitive transport services, Government
has plans to relax the regulations that restrict entry into commercial
transport services. In particular, Government would lift its current ban
on private carriage of fare-paying passengers to permit the development of
a transport services industry in the rural areas. In an attempt to bring
more vehicles within the reach of large sections of the population,
Government is examining measures that would increase the availability of



- 10 -
non-motorized means of transport, such as bicycles, carts, etc., and lower
their cost. Specific policy changes being considered include an increase
in the foreign exchange allocation to non-motorized means of transport, a
lowering of the import duty and surtax thereon, and a removal of the import
license requirements on these items.
1.28     Road accidents have taken a heavy toll in terms of deaths,
injuries and property damage. The extent of the problem is indicated in
Table 1.6, which shows that 7,049 vehicles were involved in road accidents
in 1987 resulting in 2,736 injuries and 558 deaths. The incidence of such
accidents initially peaked in 1978-79, moderated somewhat thereafter, but
then began to rise once again in 1985, exceeding all previous levels in
1987. The problem remains very serious, and the Government is determined
to reduce the number and severity of the accidents. A National Road Safety
Council has been functioning since 1978 but requires strengthening to
increase its effectiveness. A road safety component of the project, based
partly on a study financed by the Southern Africa Transport and
Communications Commission (SATCC), will provide assistance in this field.

Sector Finances
1.29     Road users contribute to Government revenues through taxes and
duties on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts and through license
and registration fees. At the time of appraisal in October 1988, the pump
price of petroleum was MK 1.86 per liter (US$0.72/l equivalent) and of



- 11 -
diesel MK 1.61 per liter (US$0.62/l equivalent); equivalent import prices
were MK 0.95 (US$0.37) and MK 0.86 (US$0.33), respectively. Petroleum
product prices, including taxes, more than cover c.i.f. costs and internal
distribution costs. Customs duties and other taxes (surtax and levy) on
vehicles vary with the type and size of vehicle. Total revenue from road
users, as shown in Table 1.7, was MK 59.0 million in 1986(1987, and
represented approximately 12Z of total Government revenue (exclusive of
grants, reimbursements and appropriations-in-aid).

1.30     Government maintenance and administrative expenditures on highways
are financed under the recurrent budget; new construction is financed under
the development budget, which is largely funded by grants and credits from
bilateral and multilateral aid programs. Expenditures on construction rose
sharply in FY 1984/85 and especially in FY 1985/86, then fell to MK 32
million in FY 1986/87, and then rose again to MK 43 million in 1987/88
(Table 1.8). With road maintenance receiving increased attention in the
1980s, maintenance expenditures rose to MK 13 million from less than a
fourth of that level in the late 1970s. In 1986/87, capital,
administrative and maintenance expenditures on the road network, including
the cost of the Road Traffic Commissioner's Office, amounted to MK 41.7
million. Thus, road user revenues more than covered maintenance
expenditures and the capital costs of the network in that year.

Administration and Training
1.31     The Road Department of MOW is responsible for all classified roads
except that the district councils are responsible for the district roads.
From time to time, some unclassified roads administered by other agencies
are designated as classified roads and brought under MOW or district
council administration. Planning and overall supervision activities for
roads are handled by the headquarters staff at Lilongwe.
1.32     The Roads Department has 34 posts for professionals, 29 of which
have been localized. With respect to the regional organization, each of
the 24 district councils has a road foreman on its staff and most councils
have a core of road maintenance employees. The earlier phases of the
District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP), financed under
previous highway projects, have done much to develop an organizational
framework, provide training of key staff and furnish equipment and depot
facilities. The project will include further assistance of this type to
the three districts not yet covered by DRIMP. Recurrent and maintenance
expenditures have risen substantially in districts that have had their road
networks improved under DRIMP. Since the district councils' revenues are
very limited, the Government has supplemented the maintenance budgets.
Both the Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects have assisted the Government by
providing financing on a declining basis for the incremental portion of the
recurrent maintenance expenditures during the project period. This
assistance would continue under the project.



- 13 -
Planning
1.33     Although MOW is responsible for road planning, its capacity for
doing this work has been limited and, therefore, international consultants
have been used extensively to assist MOW. In recent years, the emphasis in
road planning activities has shifted from new road works to rehabilitation
and maintenance of roads. Nevertheless, planning of road improvements on
main and secondary roads remains an important function of MOW. Under the
Fifth Highway Project, on-the-job training of planning has been carried
out, thus strengthening the capabilities of the local staff. Further
efforts in this field are required and such assistance is included in the
project.
Engineering and Construction
1.34     The Design Branch within the Roads Department of MOW is staffed by
12 civil engineers and 25 technicians and surveyors. The Branch, which has
a laboratory for materials and soils testing, is primarily engaged in
design of structures; it also carries out preliminary investigations of
roads and some design of roads and bridges, but detailed engineering for
major road projects is done by consultants. The design standards adopted
by MOW (Annex 2) are appropriate for the country's topography and traffic
conditions. For selected routes of international importance, MOW is now
considering adoption of a higher standard recommended by the Southern
African Development and Coordination Conference (SADCC). Nearly all design
contracts for roads have been let to international consultants but the
Government would like to use local consultants to some extent. During the
project preparation phase, MOW assisted by consultants (financed under an
advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)) carried out a
preliminary study of the factors affecting the promotion of local
consultants (as well as local contractors, para. 1.36). Based upon the
study findings and conclusions, the originally proposed privatization study
was modified to an implementation-oriented local industry
promotion/technical assistance component, which will be financed under the
project.
1.35     Contractors for major road projects are employed by the Roads
Department following appropriate prequalification and tendering procedures;
contracts are generally let on a unit-price basis. The Roads Department
has also undertaken some minor force account road construction projects
with two road construction units and one bridge construction unit. The
Roads Department is planning to do more work by local contractors and will
reduce the force account work capacity to cover only emergency needs and
on-the-job training requirements for its own staff. MOW operates three
units for the improvement of district roads by labor-based methods under
DRIMP and performance has been good. The fourth and final phase of DRIMP
will be financed under the project.
1.36     The developing domestic construction industry is nearly fully
employed on buildings, small structures, estate and other minor roads, as
well as the resealing of short sections of main roads and of runways of
minor airfields. Domestic contractors lack the capacity for major road
works but are capable of carrying out some rehabilitation work on earth and
gravel roads. Construction supervision is carried out by the Roads



- 14 -
Department or by consulting engineers acting as its representatives.
Supervision is satisfactory, payment procedures are prompt and, in general,
the experience of MOW in dealing with contractors has been satisfactory.
MOW, however, is interested in developing the local construction industry
and utilizing local contractors to a greater extent without sacrificing
quality of work. Toward this end, as noted above (para. 1.34), a component
of the project is technical assistance to promote the local industry and to
determine ways and means by which this goal can be accomplished. The terms
of reference for the services are available in the project file. At
negotiations MOW agreed that, by June 1990, an action plan, on the basis of
the technical assistance team's work and recommendations, for promotion of
the local construction industry would be submitted.
Road Maintenance
1.37     In the early 1980s, it became apparent that the road network was
not being maintained adequately. For this reason a road maintenance study
was carried out by consultants, financed under the Fourth Highway Project,
to determine in detail the maintenance needs and establish a program for
corrective action over a 5-year period. Part of this program was carried
out under the Fifth Highway Project, and major additional rehabilitation,
resealing and regravelling works are included in the proposed project.
1.38     The level of funding of regular maintenance has increased
significantly in recent years (Table 1.8), but the quality of road
maintenance is still inadequate. Improved performance will need to be
achieved through greater efficiency in the use of available resources
rather than increased funding, given current fiscal constraints. It was
agreed at negotiations that the funding level for road maintenance
activities would be reviewed annually by the Government and the Association
prior to adoption of MOW's budget, and not later than three months before
the beginning of each fiscal year.
1.39     The regional offices of MOW are responsible for maintaining the
classified road system, with the exception of district roads (para. 1.38).
Maintenance operations are largely mechanized although extensive use is
made of labor for routine maintenance. The Roads Department rents
equipment from PVHO which is responsible for procuring and maintaining all
Government-owned equipment and vehicles; rental rates are based on the cost
of purchasing and maintaining the equipment. The availability and
utilization of equipment and vehicles are not satisfactory mainly because
of shortage of spare parts, insufficient equipment replacements and
inadequate workshop facilities. These deficiencies will be alleviated by
procurements included in the project.
1.40     District roads, built or improved through DRIMP under a series of
IDA-financed projects, may gradually be turned over to the district
councils as they develop the capability to maintain them. Recurrent
maintenance costs are covered by limited district council funds
supplemented by Government grants. The project will assist Government by
providing financing for this purpose on a declining basis (para. 2.09).

E. The Water Supply Subsector
Water Resources
1.41     Malawi has. substantial water resources.  As indicated (para.
1.01), about one quarter of the country is covered by lakes, with Lake
Malawi being, by far, the largest. Although available surface water is
ample in the lakes (Malawi, Chilwa and others), the Shire River system and
various minor rivers, water supplies are heavily dependent on rainfall
which has marked seasonality and wide variations in annual levels of
precipitation. Some surface water is stored in reservoirs of dams to
improve reliability as a source of supply and for conservation purposes.
The larger water supply dams are located near Blantyre and Lilongwe;
smaller dams have been built for Kasungu, Zomba, and other urban centers.
A new dam for Lilongwe is being built under the Second Lilongwe Water
Supply Project (Credit 1742-MAI, 1986, SDR 16.6 million) and others would
be built under the proposed project. Total storage capacity of all these
dams is, however, very small in relation to available water resources in
the country.
1.42     Groundwater is widely available from dug wells and boreholes in
three hydrological zones: plateau-highland, escarpment and the Rift Valley
alluvial plains. Over most of the plateau areas, the geological formation
is largely drained by 'dambos" (broad, grass-covered, swampy areas with no
defined channels). The highlands have little potential for groundwater
supplies because of steep slopes. A study of ground water resources in
Malawi, carried out in 1983, indicated that the available groundwater
resources have sufficient recharge to support the relatively low level of
usage needed to meet present and future medium-term domestic water
requirements of smaller settlements. Such resources will continue to serve
primarily rural domestic needs. A UNDP-financed National Water Resources
Master Plan found that, in 1985, the country had 5,100 boreholes and 3,100
dugwells but that at any particular time 30Z to 50X of them were
inoperative, mainly for want of maintenance. Consequently, the project
includes a component to rehabilitate a large number of inoperative
boreholes and to institute a maintenance management program.
Legislation and Institutions
1.43     The provision of piped water in Malawi is governed by the
Waterworks Act of 1926 which has been amended several times. Other
relevant legal instruments are the Blantyre Waterworks Act and the Lilongwe
Waterworks Proclamation of 1984, the main objectives of which are to
strengthen the mandate of the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards and
provide them with autonomy as financially self-supporting organizations.
Water supply in rural and urban areas (except Blantyre and Lilongwe) is the
responsibility of the Department of Water (DOW) of MOW. This department
plans and implements rural and urban water supply systems (except Blantyre
and Lilongwe) besides providing untreated but protected piped water to
rural areas wherever and whenever feasible. DOW operates more than 48
urban and institutional water supply systems in the country and has
constructed more than 55 gravity-fed piped water supply schemes.



- 16 -
1.44     The District Water Supply Fund (DWSF) is a Treasury Fund within
the Water Supply Branch of DOW. It is responsible for all urban water
supply systems in Malawi except for Blantyre and Lilongwe. Formed in 1977
to implement a water supply project funded by the African Development Fund
(AfDF), DWSF is required to be operated on a commercial basis and be self-
financing. It is not a separate legal entity and, therefore, cannot have
constitutional authority to negotiate loans on its own.
Urban Water Supply Systems
1.45     The one million urban population of Malawi, some 12Z of the
national total, is growing at the rate of approximately 6Z per year. About
77Z of the urban population has access to safe water. The Blantyre and
Lilongwe Water Boards serve about 460,000 people and piped water supply is
available to 48 smaller urban centers serving some 300,000 people.
1.46     About 15% of the urban population is connected to community waste
water systems, the remainder generally using septic tanks and pit latrines.
A Sanitation Feasibility Study was carried out for Lilongwe under the
Second Lilongwe Water Supply Project, and a low-cost sanitation
demonstration project was implemented for Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu, and
Zomba under the Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project (Credit 1272-MAI,
1982, US$4.0 million). In general, expansion of sewerage facilities has
not kept pace with urban development in Malawi. A review of possible
options and development of an appropriate strategy for the sanitation
sector is in progress.
Rural Water Supply
1.47     About 36% of the 7.1 million2  rural population has access to safe
water through piped gravity systems (1.3 million), boreholes and dug wells
(1.2 million), and the rest institutional or private sources. Water
collection is generally the responsibility of the female members of the
household. Transport demand surveys have shown that the transport
component of daily water collection in rural areas takes up more time and
load carrying effort than transport for any other purpose, including
harvesting and crop marketing. The potential for increasing productivity
through improvements in rural water supply is considerable. A Government
of Malawi (GOM) survey found that, in 1984, close to 50Z of households in
rural Malawi were at least 2 km away from a source of improved water.
Government aims to provide at least 27 liters of water per person per day
within a walking distance of 500 m.
1.48     Self-help schemes are making a significant contribution to the
improved water supplies in the rural areas. District development
committees initiate a variety of small scale projects, including gravity
systems, wells and hand pump schemes. While the communities rely on
Government for advice and training, the key to the success of such projects
has been the active contribution of the community, providing labor for
operations and maintenance. The project will include assistance for
expansion of such self-help schemes.
2/ Excludes about 750,000 Mozambican refugees.



- 17 -
Cost Recovery
1.49     Thus far, rural water supply schemes have provided water free of
charge to consumers who do, however, provide a contribution of labor
service. Government plans that this policy will remain unchanged in the
foreseeable future. For the urban population, the basic policy is,
appropriately, that water supply schemes should be self-supporting,
including recovery of capital costs.
1.50     DWSF controls the financial operations of urban water supply
schemes except in Blantyre and Lilongwe. Government financial assistance
to DWSF was withdrawn in 1983 and DWSF now must generate revenues through
its operations to cover its needs. Revenues to date have been barely
enough to meet DWSF operating expenditures, and thus existing assets are
likely to deteriorate without substantial investments in DWSF. Tariff
increases announced April 1, 1988, are expected to result in a positive net
balance for the fiscal year 1988/89 and to contribute to writing off the
accumulated net losses of DWSF. A detailed analysis of the operations of
DWSF is presented in Chapter III. Cost recovery for sewerage and
sanitation is limited to Blantyre and Lilongwe where nearly all costs are
covered by direct charges on households.
Manpower and Training
1.51     DOW management is headed by a Water Engineer-in-Chief supported by
three regional managers in Lilongwe, Kasungu, and Mzuzu and a subregional
manager in Zomba. DOW is divided into two main branches for water
resources and water supply in addition to various support services. There
are 365 established posts (regular, salaried labor), of which 325 are
filled and another 640 are non-established (occasional labor) posts.
Professional staff constituting about 10Z of the established posts include
a number of expatriates. DOW uses its own staff to plan and implement
water supply projects in the smaller towns and the rural areas but needs to
engage consultants at times to undertake more complex works in the larger
cities. MOW intends to reorganize DOW, as well as other entities of MOW,
and introduce a new management system for administration of water supply
functions. The project will assist in accomplishing these changes.
1.52     The manpower resources of DOW and the Blantyre and Lilongwe water
boards have been severely strained in recent years as the urban and rural
water supply systems have been expanded. Local manpower at the managerial
and technical levels has been supplemented by substantial support from
expatriate staff and consultants. To carry out plans for further growth in
water supply schemes, Government will require not only continued dependence
on expatriate staff and consultants but also a heavy commitment to training
of local staff. Under the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Supply Projects
(paras. 1.58 and 1.59), substantial progress has been made in training in
the two major urban centers. DOW, which has urgent training needs and also
must coordinate training in the overall water supply field, will be
provided training assistance under the project.

F. Public Buildings
Administration
1.53     The Buildings Department in MOW is responsible for the design,
construction and maintenance of government buildings country-wide. Within
the department are branches of structural and architectural design,
quantity surveying, and electrical and mechanical services. Through its
staff of professional and technical personnel, the department carries out
some building construction by direct labor and most building maintenance
work; it also oversees the work carried out by private consultants and
contractors for the Government.
Inventory of Buildings
1.54     The Buildings Department is responsible for maintaining a current
inventory of the hundreds of government buildings scattered throughout the
country. Unfortunately, the existing register is not adequate and a
national survey of government buildings, partly financed under a PPF
advance, is underway. This survey was begun in August 1987 in the Southern
Region and aims to provide current details on the characteristics and
condition of each facility. It will be the first physical inventory taken
since 1970. As a computerized system would facilitate the initial
recording, updating and retrieval of these data, the project includes a
component to develop a management system that would rely in part on a
computerized register maintained within the department.
Building Maintenance
1.55     Numerous schools, hospitals and other types of government
buildings have been built in Malawi in recent years, but the provision of
funds for their maintenance has generally been inadequate. As a result,
the condition of many buildings has deteriorated, in some cases to the
point where extensive rehabilitation is required. The planned introduction
of a modern maintenance management system is expected to provide a firmer
foundation than now exists for justifying annual requests for maintenance
budgets. Where major deterioration has occurred, substantial funds are
urgently required for building rehabilitation. The project includes a
component to assist in this effort.
G. Previous Bank Group Projects
Transport
1.56     The Bank Group has been involved in Malawi's transport sector
since 1966 (Annex 3) when Credit S-2-MAI was approved to help finance
detailed engineering of the Zomba-Lilongwe road. This was followed by the
First Highway Project (Credit 112-MAI, 1968, US$11.5 million). All of the
project's objectives were achieved (see Project Performance Audit Report
No. 946, December 15, 1975). A recommendation of the report, that the
Government rectify the past neglect of lower class roads, was addressed in
the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Highway Projects which included phases of the
successful DRIMP.

1.57     Gradual extensions of the Zomba-Lilongwe road were financed by a
series of Bank Group projects that effectively linked the three regions of
Malawi for the first time with a paved road. This series of projects
follows:

All of these projects (except the last one which is in an early stage of
implementation) were carried out satisfactorily and the resulting north-
south artery has contributed much to economic, social and political
integration of the country.
1.58     The Fourth Highway Project included a comprehensive study of
Malawi's road maintenance needs and initiated a substantial effort to
assist in redressing past neglect of such maintenance. The Fourth Highway
Project was carried out in a satisfactory manner. In the Fifth Highway
Project, this work became the major project component with particular
emphasis on resealing of paved roads, rehabilitation of both paved and
unpaved roads and procurement of maintenance equipment. A large technical
assistance component was used to improve data collection (traffic, costs,
road inventory, etc.) for network planning purposes. A detailed management
system for road maintenance was put in place and staff trained in its use.
The training needs for the Roads Department staff were studied, training
plans were prepared, and implementation is under way. The technical
assistance consultant also studied the organizational set-up of the Roads
Department, and recommended several improvements, many of which have been
implemented. The Fifth Highway Project is still under implementation and
is proceeding satisfactorily. However, many of the institutional
development aspects of that project would require continuing follow-up and
strengthening, which will be provided by this project.

1.59     The main objective of the Northern Transport Corridor Project is
to assist the Government in improving the corridor from Blantyre through
northern Malawi to Dar es Salaam, thus enabling the route to handle one-
third of Malawi's external traffic at reduced transport cost as compared
with alternative southern routes through Zambia, Zimbabwe and RSA.
Approved in February 1988, the project will be carried out over a period of
about four years. Project implementation is under way with some minor
delays.
Water Supply
1.60     The Bank Group has financed three water supply projects in Malawi
(Annex 3), the first of which was the Blantyre Water Supply Project (Credit
711-MAI, 1977, US$7.0 million) augmenting the supply of water to that city
and strengthening the Blantyre Water Board's management and technical
capabilities. The project's primary objectives were achieved and the
credit was closed in 1984 (Project Completion Report, June 1986).
Financial performance, however, has been below expectations and corrective
action is being taken.
1.61     The Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project (Credit 1272-MAI,
1982, SDR 3.6 million) was designed to assist the Government and the
Lilongwe Water Board in formulating a long-range water supply, sewerage and
sanitation program, prepare studies for water supply extension, strengthen
the Board through improvements in management and training and help
Government develop low-cost technologies for handling sewerage and
sanitation. This project proceeded satisfactorily and the credit was
closed in 1987. The follow-on project, the Second Lilongwe Water Supply
Project, is aimed principally at augmenting the water supply of Lilongwe
through the construction of a new dam/reservoir and to expand Lilongwe's
water supply system to cater for increased demand. Construction of the dam
has been completed and other aspects of the project are being carried out
satisfactorily.
Public Buildings
1.62     Certain components of projects financed by the Bank Group in
Malawi have been concerned with public buildings. The Lilongwe Training
Center, road maintenance depots and an extension of MOW Headquarters were
constructed under the Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects. In the education
sector, many schools have been constructed under a series of Bank Group
projects (including the Fifth Education Project, 1330-MAI, 1983, US$34.0
million). In those efforts it was assumed that regular maintenance of
newly-built structures would be carried out. Unfortunately, the
maintenance of public buildings has been inadequate leading to rapid
deterioration and a premature need for rehabilitation.



- 21 -
H. Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
1.63     The project will support the Bank's country assistance strategy by
(1) strengthening the institutions responsible for much of the country's
infrastructure representing large elements of the Government's development
and recurrent budgets; (2) protecting vital transportation routes in
agricultural production areas; and (3) contributing to increased
availability of potable water, health services and education services to
both rural and urban populations. It will build on previous Bank Group
involvement in a number of sectors, particularly transport and water
supply. IDA participation in the project would help ensure that certain
public works programs and related policy changes recommended by the Bank in
the recent past are implemented and that further improvements in strategy,
policy formulation and institution-building are pursued. It will also help
to mobilize and coordinate financing for the project that may not otherwise
have become available.
I. Other Donor Agencies' Past Involvement
1.64     The main cofinanciers for this project (para. 2.35), AfDF, EDF,
KfW, and ODA, have been regular supporters of the road sector and financed
road construction and rehabilitation works since the late 1960s - early
1970s. During the 1970s, USAID also financed some major road works.
Malawi has received more than MK 250 million from various donor agencies
for development of its road network over the last 20 years. The main
contributors to the water supply sector over the last about 10 years have
been AfDB, DANIDA, and USAID, with somewhat smaller contributions from KfW,
Canada, EEC/EDF, Japan, and UNICEF. The total contributions from the donors
amount to about MK 100 million since 1979. While IDA in the past has been
the largest financier of public buildings, particularly for education,
agriculture and health, other significant donor agencies have been USAID,
EEC/EDF, AfDF, and ODA. Expenditures of close to MK 100 million have been
financed by these agencies during the last 5 years. Many other agencies
have contributed on a more moderate scale to the development of the three
sectors over the last several years, financing not only civil works, but
also technical assistance and training.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
2.01     The main objectives of the project are to (i) strengthen the
capability of MOW to carry out effectively the construction and maintenance
of public facilities; (ii) restore the physical condition of selected main
and secondary roads, thus facilitating the movement of traffic and lowering
transport costs; (iii) expand the existing system of district roads thus
providing improved access for many additional rural people; (iv) expand
potable water supply for selected urban centers and rural areas; and (v)
rehabilitate high-priority hospitals, schools and other important public
buildings so that they contribute more efficiently and effectively to the
provision of public services and extend their useful lives.
B. Project Scope
2.02     The project will cover MOW's activities for management improvement
and training as well as maintenance, rehabilitation and construction works
in the roads, water supply, and public buildings subsectors over a four-
year period from fiscal year 1989/90 to 1992/93. Virtually all subprojects
to be implemented during this period have been included in the project.
Most of these subprojects will be completed during the project period, but
a few subprojects will extend beyond the period. However, only the
portions of these subprojects that are scheduled to be completed within the
four-year period have been included in the project. The project will thus
comprise:

C. Detailed Project Description
MOW Management Improvement
2.03     The 1987 management study noted above (para. 1.10), which
established that MOW management can and should be improved substantially,



- 24 -
included a plan for achieving that objective. Specifically, the study
recommends improved direction and management control, a better functioning
organization, development of human resources, and provision of adequate
financial and material resources to carry through planned programs. These
recommendations have been formulated bearing in mind their likely
implementability. The implementation strategy will be to carry out actions
and activities in accordance with assigned priorities; a steering committee
will oversee implementation progress. The time allocated for the
implementation is about 24 months. A major input of technical or
managerial assistance is necessary to carry out the changes in the MOW
organization as well as implement the detailed management systems required
for DOW and the Buildings Department. A detailed description of the
management improvement program is available in the project file. The
technical assistance is divided into six long-term positions amounting to a
total of 132 man-months, and also includes several short-term positions for
a total of 29 man-months. Consultancies would be required for studies in
the areas of fleet management systems, systems management, maintenance
operations and construction, financial management, and promotion of the
local construction and consulting industry. The studies above have been
allocated a total of 295 man-months. Overseas training integrated with the
technical assistance has been provided up to about 180 man-months. Details
of the technical assistance, studies, and training requirements are
presented in Annex 4.
Roads
(i) Rehabilitation and Strengthening of Paved Roads
2.04     The project will assist in financing the rehabilitation and
strengthening of about 270 km of paved roads over a 4-year period (Annex
5). The particular roads for which the work will begin in the first-year
program (201 km), and for which economic analysis and detailed engineering
have been completed, or are under way, are designated with an asterisk.
(ii) Rehabilitation of Earth and Gravel Roads
2.05     Some 300 km of earth and gravel roads will be rehabilitated to
gravel standards under this component (Annex 6). Only one road section (29
km), designated with an asterisk, has been selected for the first-year
program for which economic analysis and detailed engineering have been
completed.
(iii). Improvement of Roads to Bitumen Standard
2.06     Approximately 115 km of earth and gravel roads will be improved to
bitumen standard under the project (Annex 7). As indicated by an asterisk,
a 25-km road section is to be included in the first-year program and
preparation has been completed.
(iv) Resealing of Paved Roads
2.07     About 200 km of paved roads will be resealed under the project
(Annex 8). The road works will begin in the second year of the four-year
project period.



- 25 -
(v) DRIMP Extension
2.08     DRIMP, for which the first phase began in 1979 under the Second
Highway Project, cdntinued under subsequent projects (Phases II and III),
and will be extended in a fourth phase to the three remaining districts,
Mwanza, Blantyre and Chiradzulu, under the project. Some 350 km of
district roads will be built in these 3 districts. Selection of roads for
improvement, and planning of maintenance units, was carried out by
consultants. Depots and facilities to be provided and a list of roads to
be improved during the first year of the program have been agreed. The
work program for subsequent years will be agreed not later than three
months before the beginning of each fiscal year until completion of the
project component. The works will be carried out by the three improvement
units already established under earlier phases of DRIMP.
2.09     In addition to the foregoing DRIMP works to be undertaken in the
three named districts, the component will include spot improvements on
other DRIMP roads already improved in earlier phases. Moreover, about 500
km of existing tracks will be upgraded to district roads in areas of good
agricultural potential. The component will also cover, on a declining
basis, the incremental maintenance expenditures in districts where DRIMP
has been completed under the Fifth Highway Project and would be completed
under this project. It was agreed at negotiations that the appropriateness
of the maintenance allocations would be discussed annually, not later than
three months before the beginning of each fiscal year, by the Government
and the Association on the basis of MOW's updated estimates of funds
required by the district councils (para. 1.40).
(vi) Reconstruction of Bridges
2.10     The project includes reconstruction of 8 bridges (Annex 9) which
have deteriorated seriously and require restoration works. These bridges
have been subject to detailed technical and economic analysis and the
following 4 of them have been included in the first year program: Mwesia on
the Ml, Mtedza and Lingadzi on the Sll, and Kasungadzi on the S53.
(vii) Preparation and Installation of Road Signs
2.11     In 1988, the Government passed a supplement to the Road Traffic
Act introducing new road signs based on proposals promulgated by the
Southern African Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC). This
Act, together with a reclassification of the designated public roads in
Malawi, have created a need for new signs on many roads included in the
network. The inclusion of important regional collector roads as a tertiary
system and the renumbering of numerous secondary and main roads will make
necessary an extensive program of preparing and installing new signs. Some
11,000 signs will be fabricated and installed by the road maintenance
teams.



- 26 -
(viii) Procurement of Spare Parts and Equipment for PVHO
2.12     The capacity of PVHO to provide adequate equipment for road
maintenance activities of the Roads Department depends heavily on the
availability of plant and vehicles for this purpose, which in turn is
dependent upon the import of replacement equipment, spare parts and
workshop facilities and the training of skilled personnel. Plant and
vehicles included in the project, as shown in Annex 10, represent the major
procurement under this component. In addition, miscellaneous equipment
will be purchased, including various quantities of motorcycles, asphalt
heaters, wheelbarrows, air compressors, pedestrian rollers, concrete
mixers, portable generators, vibrators, water pumps and welding sets. Also
included in the equipment to be purchased are various items of machine shop
equipment intended to augment the capacity of the PVHO workshop in Blantyre
to reclaim spare parts, thus extending the life of those parts and reducing
import requirements. PVHO has prepared a report showing existing stocks of
equipment and spares, anticipated annual depletion of these stocks and
replacement requirements. Procurement specification documents are under
preparation.
(ix) Vehicles and Equipment for the Planning and Design Branches
2.13     The Planning and Design Branches of the Roads Department have a
limited capacity to perform the works required of them, in large part
because of equipment shortages in its materials laboratory and survey
sections. Accordingly, the project includes a list of equipment such as
vehicles, drilling rigs, laboratory equipment, survey equipment and so
forth. Detailed lists of these requirements have been prepared (Annex 11)
together with estimated costs.
(x) Construction of Road Maintenance Depots
2.14     This program is a continuation from the Fifth Highway Project.
There is still a lack of camps where qualified road supervisors and foremen
can be assigned. The basic requirements at each camp are office
accommodation, storage facilities for tools and fuels, housing for
supervisors and foremen, and fencing for security purposes. Detailed lists
of the requirements have been prepared (Annex 12).
(xi) Rural Transport Pilot Service
2.15     A recent study by GOPA, consultants (Federal Republic of Germany),
determined that bus and goods services were grossly inadequate in remote
rural areas of Malawi notwithstanding the existence of roads developed
under DRIMP and other programs. Taking account of the substantial demand
for transport services identified in the study, the Government seeks to
experiment in three areas with rural transport services designed to carry
passengers and small shipments of goods. A key ingredient of the service
is the selection of a vehicle of appropriate size and characteristics.
Another basic requirement is a suitable organizational arrangement to
assure the provision of attractive service and continuity of operations.
Ultimately, the rural transport service is expected to be based on the
concept of the private owner-operator with minimal or no governmental
support of operations. The requirements for the pilot scheme include
vehicles, spare parts, workshops and technical assistance, all of which are



- 27 -
detailed in Annex 13, which also gives a description of the rural transport
system and the complementary ILO Integrated Rural Transport Project.
(xii) Road Safety Program
2.16     Recognizing the high rate of road accidents in Malawi, a safety
program has been included in the project with the object of reducing the
number of road accidents. A study of the problem and the design of a
program to cope with the situation has been undertaken by SATCC. The
program will involve both equipment and technical assistance, details of
which are presented in Annex 14.
(xiii) Pavement Overlay Unit
2.17     MOW lacks the capacity to repair short stretches of asphalt roads
showing signs of pavement distress. The repair work would involve patching
and provision of bituminous overlays, be limited in scope, widely
scattered, and require specialized equipment, and would not be suitable for
contract work. MOW has, therefore, decided to establish its own pavement
overlay unit, with equipment and technical assistance to train MOW
operators. Financing of this unit is included under the project.
(xiv) Technical Assistance and Training for Roads
2.18     Longer term technical assistance would be provided under the
project to a total of 298 man-months. Five positions have been allocated
in the branches of planning, design, and construction, and to the rural
roads branch and the soils and materials branch. In addition, specialist
services would support the pavement overlay program, rural transport
services, PVHO and the road safety program. Shorter term consultancies are
required for an urban roads study, supervision of the DRIMP program,
specialist services for data processing, and supervision of road works, in
a total of 189 man-months. Details are presented in Annex 4.
2.19     Closely integrated with the technical assistance program the
project would provide an overseas training program in specialized areas for
which no training is available locally. These areas are road planning,
soils and materials testing, bridge design, construction management, and
road maintenance. In addition to 96 man-motths of overseas fellowships,
there is a minor allocation for short courses and seminars to be identified
during the implementation period. Local training of technician levels
would be provided at the Lilongwe and Zomba Training Centers (see para.
2.26).
Water Supply
(i) Urban Water Supply Systems
2.20     The urban water supply component (Annex 15) involves augmentation
of the source and treatment facilities in three of the nation's larger
towns, that is, Kasungu, Mzuzu and Zomba.1   In Kasungu, the existing dam
1/ Thirty-four other urban schemes estimated to cost about MK 42 million
and for which financing has been requested from AfDB, are not included in
the proposed Infrastructure Project.



- 28 -
is to be raised by about 4.5 meters (m) to increase storage and provide
sufficient water to meet the projected 1995 demand; expansion of the
existing treatment plant to cope with the increased water demand is
currently under way using mostly departmental labor. For Mzuzu, a new 20 m
high earth-filled dam is to be built on the Lunyanga stream together with
appropriate expansion of treatment and distribution facilities. In the
case of Zomba, a new 17 m high dam and associated expanded treatment plant
are to be developed. Detailed design has been completed.
2.21     In addition to the above three water supply systems, four other
urban systems, at Mponela, Mangochi, Ntcheu, and Karonga are included in
the project (Annex 15). These relatively small investments will not
involve dam construction but expansion or construction of intake systems,
treatment facilities, storage tanks, and distribution networks. Detailed
designs for the four schemes have been completed by DOW and are being
reviewed with the assistance of consultants. The first-year program for
urban water supply includes the Kasungu, Mangochi, and Ntcheu schemes.
(ii) Rehabilitation of Boreholes
2.22     About 2,500 boreholes in widely scattered locations will be
rehabilitated under this component. About 500 of these will be included in
the first-year program. DOW has determined the inputs required for the
borehole rehabilitation and has prepared detailed specifications and
bidding documents. An integral part of this program is the expansion of a
system of operation and maintenance of boreholes under the responsibility
of the local community, with support as needed from DOW.
(iii) Gravity Rural Water Supply Schemes
2.23     Thirteen gravity-fed piped rural water schemes will be constructed
under this component in various locations in the country to provide water
to an estimated 200,000 rural inhabitants. The schemes tap water from
perennial streams in protected catchments in the mountains and through a
system of pipelines and tanks supply it by gravity to the rural population
in the low-lying areas. Construction will be by self-help with the project
providing pipes, fittings, cement, and other materials of construction.
(iv) Technical Assistance and Training in Water Supply
2.24     At present, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the
United Kingdom (UK) is involved in technical assistance and training in
DOW. Under the project, consultancy services are to be provided (see Annex
4) for supervision of the urban water supply schemes and the borehole
rehabilitation works. In addition, technical assistance will be involved
in the expansion of the community-based schemes for operation and
maintenance of boreholes. In support of the borehole component, certain
equipment including four-wheel-drive vehicles will be provided.



- 29 -
Public Buildings
(i) Rehabilitation of Public Buildings
2.25     On the basis of the Buildings Department's existing registry or
inventory of public buildings, operational records and physical inspection,
the department has prepared a list of hospitals, schools and other
important public buildings that are in seriously deteriorated condition and
thus require rehabilitation on a priority basis. Three schemes, requiring
attention most urgently and to be included in the first-year program, are
the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre; the Lilongwe Girls
Secondary School, and the Mzuzu Secondary School. A list of all buildings
to be rehabilitated under the project is presented in Annex 16.
Consultants have been engaged to inspect these buildings and prepare
detailed specifications, bills of quantities and cost estimates for the
planned rehabilitation works. Work on the first year schemes has been
completed.
(ii) Lilongwe and Zomba Training Centers
2.26     In addition to overseas training to be provided to speed up the
implementation of the localization plan, training will also be provided at
craft levels mainly as in-service training. Currently, such training is
offered at the two MOW training centers located at Lilongwe and Zomba.
Although the Lilongwe Center was supported by the Fourth and Fifth Highway
Projects, there is still a need for expansion of both centers, which
initially would have to be supported by overseas training and technical
assistance. For this purpose the project provides for consultant services
to assist in course development and staff development planning for a total
of 48 man-months2 (Annex 4). As new courses must be developed in response
to ministerial demand, instructor training will be required overseas,
totalling about 105 man-months and in particular with respect to drawing,
building materials testing, road materials testing, surveying,
refrigeration, wiring and water testing.
2.27     Also as part of the staff development plan, intermediate officials
of MOW would upgrade their technical and scientific knowledge by studying
for an engineering diploma at the Polytechnic College of the University of
Malawi. Such study will be divided into appropriate segments in a
"sandwich-like" fashion and offered as part-time or full-time courses.
Initial funds for course preparation, materials development, lecturing, and
transportation will be provided under the project.
2.28     In order to implement training programs in the two training
centers, training equipment would be required in addition to some extension
of physical facilities. This will encompass the provision of three
classrooms including a draughting room, one laboratory, one store, and one
hostel at Lilongwe, while at Zomba certain existing physical facilities
will be converted to provide for a water testing laboratory and a plumbing
workshop.
2/ Included in the total of 132 man-months of technical assistance to MOW
(para. 2.03).



- 30 -
2.29     As skills demand calls for increased practical content in crafts
training programs, training equipment will be required. Specifically,
equipment will be provided for roads and building materials testing and for
the water laboratory, as well as for specialized workshops in
automechanics, electrical wiring, refrigeration, and plumbing. In
addition, the draughting room and the surveying shop will be appropriately
equipped and miscellaneous books, tapes, video films, office equipment,
etc. will be provided.
(iii) Technical Assistance and Training for Public Buildings Administration
2.30     Included in the project is the preparation of specifications,
bills of quantities, and cost estimates for building rehabilitation to be
accomplished during the three-year period following the initial year. The
component includes consultancy services (see Annex 4) for supervision of
building rehabilitation and improvements of the training centers (60 man-
months).
2.31     As noted above, the Buildings Department is also responsible for
inspection and control of government buildings. In this area, staff
development has not caught up with actual demand of skills and hence the
project provides for overseas fellowships for that purpose amounting to 144
man-months.
D. Project Costs
2.32     The total cost of the project, including contingency allowances,
is estimated at MK 431 million or US$158 million. Total cost includes (i)
physical contingencies of 10 of base cost on all items and (ii) price
contingencies amounting to about 15% of base cost plus physical
contingencies. The price escalation is based on the annual percentage
rates shown below:

For the purposes of the cost estimates,-it is assumed that divergence
between local and foreign cost escalation will be corrected by exchange
rate adjustments. The foreign exchange component is estimated at MK 294
million (US$108 million), or 68% of total project cost. Identifiable taxes
and duties are about MK 16.1 million (US$5.9 million) and the total project
cost net of taxes and duties is MK 414 million (US$152 million). Past
experience on specific investment operations in Malawi suggests that the
length of the implementation period will be six years and the price
contingencies have been calculated on this basis. The Government is,
however, planning to implement the project over a four-year period in
accordance with the target implementation schedule (para. 2.47), which
would reduce the cost by about 3X or from US$157.7 million to US$153.7
million. Cost details are provided in Table 2.1.

2.33     The base costs are estimated as of April 1989 and have been
derived as follows:
(i) Road Rehabilitation, Improvements, Resealing and
Pavement Overlay: The costs of civil works on roads and
bridges were based on quantities derived from detailed
engineering and on recent cost experience for similar
type works in the country carried out by contractors and
force account units.
(ii)  DRIMP: The costs of improvement works and subsequent
road maintenance are based on actual costs incurred for
these activities under the third phase of DRIMP.
(iii) Road Signs: Cost estimates were based on recent costs of
procurement for similar materials (mostly imported) and
cost experience in local fabrication and installation.
(iv)  Vehicles and Other Types of Equipment: Recent
procurement costs for similar types of equipment were
supplemented by quotations from potential suppliers.
(v) Maintenance Depots: The cost of depots is based on
actual costs of comparable structures in Malawi.
(vi) Rural Transport Pilot and Road Safety Program: The costs
of equipment requirements (vehicles and other types of
equipment) were estimated on the basis of similar recent
procurements to the extent possible, supplemented by
inquiries to potential suppliers.
(vii) Urban Water Supply Systems: Cost estimates are based on
quantities determined from detailed engineering design
of the facilities including the dams together with
prevailing unit rates for similar works in Malawi.
(viii) Rehabilitation of Boreholes: Actual borehole drilling
operations in Malawi during recent months provide an
adequate basis of cost experience for estimates of
rehabilitation costs.
(ix)  Rehabilitation of Buildings and Construction of Training
Center: Actual costs of similar types of civil works in
recent months provided the basis for the cost estimates
for these components.
(x) Technical Assistance and Training: Actual costs of
continuing technical assistance and training in various
fields constitute sufficient unit cost basis for the
cost estimates for these components.
E. Financing Plan
2.34     In view of the severe domestic resource constraints, the
Government contribution to the IDA-financed project components would be



- 33 -
limited to 5Z of the capital cost of these components (net of taxes and
duties). The overall Government contribution for the entire project would
be US$12.7 million, which includes US$5.9 million in taxes and duties. As
indicated in Table 2.2, the project requires external financing of about
US$145 million to cover the foreign exchange component of US$108 million
and a share of the local cost amounting to US$37 million. The external
financing will be provided through an IDA credit of US$28.8 million
equivalent and soft loans and grants from other donors. Of the IDA Credit,
an advance of US$1.5 million has been extended to the Government from the
Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The advance covered (i) site and soils
investigations on the sites for the water supply dams; (ii) detailed
engineering for the first-year program of the public buildings component
and initial phase of establishing a buildings inventory; (iii) detailed
engineering and preparation of tender documents for the roads
rehabilitation program, the resealing program, and bridge reconstruction;
(iv) review of engineering documents for four semi-urban water supply
systems and finalization of detailed engineering of three urban schemes
with dams; and (v) preliminary activities under the MOW Management
Improvement Program, including an MOW training needs assessment and
preparation of a localization plan for MOW staff (para. 1.08).

(August 1989):
-     AfDF appraised its road components in July 1989; AfDF has
also made commitments for two of the three dam projects;
-     DANIDA has expressed interest in the road signs since this
component is directly under SATCC auspices and initial
preparation work was financed by DANIDA;
-     EDF has already committed funds for the two road sections in
its component and has indicated interest in financing part
of the Dwangwa-Nkhata Bay road;
-     the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has
expressed interest in financing equipment and vehicles;
-     Federal Republic of Germany has made commitments for part of
the Dwangwa-Nkhata Bay road and the Pavement Overlay Unit,
and expressed interest in one of the dam projects;
-     ODA has committed funds for the Lilongwe-Salima road
rehabilitation;
-     UNCDF and UNDP have expressed interest in the items as shown
in Table 2.2;
-     USAID is committed to the gravity-fed water supply schemes
and has been approached for part of the MOW Technical
Assistance component.
2.36     A condition for negotiations of the IDA Credit was that the
Government had received firm commitments from donors for financing of
subprojects whose implementation is scheduled to begin in the first year,
that is, FY 1989/90 (Chart 2). At negotiations in April 1989, the
Government submitted satisfactory documentation to show compliance with
this condition. The following conditions would apply to the effectiveness
of the IDA Credit (anticipated not later than December 1989):
(i)   All donor agreements for subprojects to begin implementation
during FY 1989/90 have been signed;
(ii) The Government has received firm commitments from donors to
finance subprojects to begin implementation during 1990/91,
that is, the second year of the four-year project period.
These conditions would result in about 70X (or about US$110 million) of
project financing having been obtained by effectiveness. A mid-term review
by April 1990 has been built into the project to provide opportunity to
review financing availability and status of the balance of the program.
The Government would be required to have obtained the remaining funding by
that date.

F. Implementation and Procurement
2.37     MOW will be responsible for project execution except for the Rural
Transport Pilot Program and the Road Safety Program, which will be the
responsibility of MTC. These agencies are capable of carrying out the
indicated responsibilities. Rehabilitation of paved roads, costing some
US$35.9 million, will be executed under unit price contracts awarded after
competitive bidding in accordance with guidelines of AfDB, EDF, and ODA.
Similarly, road improvements to bitumen standard, costing about US$17.7
million, will also be executed under unit price contracts awarded after
competitive bidding in accordance with AfDB, EDF and KfW guidelines.
2.38     The rehabilitation of earth and gravel roads and reconstruction of
bridges, costing about US$11.3 million, represent mostly small size works
in scattered locations and thus would be suited to implementation by force
account. However, the Government seeks to create opportunities for
promotion of the local construction industry through provision of work to
the industry on a regular basis and will group about 80X of this work, some
US$9.0 million, into small packages (less than US$1.5 million each)
suitable for local contractors. The work will be tendered through local
competitive bidding (LCB) under Government procedures satisfactory to AfDB.
The remainder of the program will be carried out by force account.
2.39     Resealing of some 200 km of paved roads, at a total cost of about
US$6.1 million, will be carried out partly by an existing MOW force account
unit, in order to maintain a minimum capacity for resealing in MOW, and
partly by contractors, selected in accordance with AfDB guidelines.
2.40     Because of the small scope and scattered location of DRIMP works,
the depots and housing will be constructed by local contractors, following
LCB procedures, or if this proves unsuccessful then by force account. The
training of local staff in the three districts and improvement and
maintenance works under Phase IV, costing some US$5.7 million, will be done
by force account with consultants providing technical assistance in line
with experience under previous phases of DRIMP. Vehicles and equipment
(including hand tools), about US$1.6 million, for the improvement and
maintenance units will be purchased over a period of four years under LCB.
2.41     Construction of road maintenance depots, the rehabilitation of
public buildings and the expansion of the Lilongwe and Zomba training
centers, costing a total of US$8.6 million, will be in widely scattered
locations and with low value of works (on average US$300,000 equivalent) at
each location. The works will be implemented by contractors following LCB
procedures.
2.42     Road maintenance equipment and various other types of equipment
and materials including spare parts, amounting to about US$8.1 million,
will be procured in accordance with the guidelines of JICA.
2.43     Construction of the facilities for the urban water supply systems,
costing about US$25.3 million, will be executed under unit price contracts
awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines for procurement for about 7Z and after AfDB and KfW
guidelines for the remainder. Borehole rehabilitation packages of



- 37 -
appropriate size (not less than US$1.0 million each) will be assembled for
similar type unit price contracting arrangements, in accordance with UNCDF
directives, for about 52Z, and after ICB for the remainder.
2.44      Technical assistance, design of facilities, supervision of works
and special studies, costing a total of US$19.5 million, will be carried
out by consultants or experts hired on an individual basis, employed under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association, as agreed with the
Government at negotiations. For consultancies financed by the Association,
the selection will be in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency", April 1981.
2.45      The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 2.3:

2.46     All documentation for procurement of civil works under ICB and
financed by the Association will be subject to Association review prior to
issuance of tenders. The LCB bidding packages for civil works, estimated
to cost less than US$300,000 equivalent and which will use standard
documents satisfactory to the Association, and all other contract
documentation will not be routinely reviewed but MOW will maintain copies
of bid evaluations and final contracts which will be subject to spot review
by the Association supervision missions.
2.47     A target implementation schedule is presented in Chart 2, the
details of which were agreed with Government at negotiations. The schedule
shows an implementation period of four years, that is, the time slice
covered by the project. However, past experience indicates that a typical
implementation period for similar projects in the region is closer to six
years.
G. Disbursements
2.48     The Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a)   90Z of total expenditures for civil works for urban water
supply construction, rehabilitation of boreholes,
rehabilitation of public buildings, expansion of Lilongwe
and Zomba Training Centers, and road maintenance depots;
(b)   90Z of expenditures on civil works under the fourth phase of
DRIMP, including:
(i) district road improvements;
(ii) depots and housing;
(c)   for incremental maintenance expenditures on district roads:
for each district being brought into the maintenance
program, subsequent to completion of road improvements, 75%
of incremental costs during the first year of maintenance;
50Z during the second year of maintenance; and 25Z during
the third year of maintenance;
(d)   100Z of foreign expenditures and 90Z of local expenditures
for equipment, vehicles, spare parts, and training
equipment; and
(e)   10OZ of total expenditures for consultants' services.
2.49     All disbursements will be fully documented except for expenditures
under force account and for contracts, estimated to cost less than
US$300,000 equivalent, for civil works included in parts B, C, and D of
Table 2.1 which will be disbursed against certificates of work performed,
such certificates to be issued by the technical assistance or supervision
consultants. The documents supporting these statements of expenditures
will not be submitted to the Association for review but will be retained by
MOW for inspection by the Association during project supervision missions.
2.50     A schedule of estimated disbursements is presented in Table 2.4.
This schedule is in line with disbursements under comparable projects



- 39 -
previously implemented in Malawi and takes into account the PPF advance of
US$1.5 million, which will be disbursed at effectiveness. In order to
expedite disbursement of funds under the above categories of the Credit, a
special account with a deposit of US$2.0 million (an amount roughly
equivalent to four months estimated expenditures in terms of US dollars)
will be established and maintained for MOW in a commercial bank. The
special account will be replenished by the Association in accordance with
agreed procedures.

H. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
2.51     Project accounts will be maintained by the two executing agencies,
MOW and MTC, for their respective project components. In previous Bank
Group projects, accounts have been audited by the Auditor General; as this
arrangement has proven satisfactory, it will also be followed under this
project. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government will have
all project accounts, as well as the special account, the statement of
expenditures, and accounts of DWSF (para. 3.05), audited by the Auditor
General and the audited accounts, together with the Auditor's report,
submitted to the Association not later than six months after the end of the
fiscal year. For the ongoing infrastructure projects, the Government has
been submitting audit reports in a generally satisfactory fashion with only
a few delays. The Government also agreed during negotiations on progress
reporting requirements and the submission of a project completion report,
in a form satisfactory to the Association, not later than six months after
the closing date.
I. Environmental Impact
2.52     The road components of the project will have beneficial effects on
the environment in raising the level of comfort of vehicle occupants now
subjected to severe vehicle vibration, noise and dust on poor roads. Many
people walking on, or alongside, the roads are favorably affected by the
surfacing of roads which reduces the clouds of dust caused by vehicles
travelling on earth roads. Also, improved drainage alongside roads often
retards soil erosion, thus yielding benefits to adjacent land owners.
2.53     The water supply components will also have beneficial
environmental effects. In the urban areas included in the project, the
augmented water supply system capacities will help maintain the present
standard of water supply and thus the health conditions of the town
residents. In the rural areas, the rehabilitation of many boreholes will
not only enhance the supply of potable water for rural population, with
important health consequences, but also will in many cases reduce
significantly the distances that these people must walk to obtain water for
daily needs, thus freeing up valuable time for other productive pursuits.
2.54     Environmental assessments of the impacts of the three dams have
been completed. No problems were identified for two dam sites but a marsh
with unusual features was identified in the catchment area of the Zomba
dam. A supplementary study (to be financed under the Credit) of the
ecology of the Zomba marsh has been agreed with Government to ensure that
no unique features will be lost (para. 2.57) as a result of the project.
The Zomba dam is planned for implementation in the third year.
2.55     Kasungu Dam.  The existing dam on the Chitete River would be
raised by 4.5 m resulting in 0.44 km2 of land being inundated in addition
to the existing reservoir. The additional area to be flooded is mainly
swampland of no commercial or biological significance. There are no
settlements hence resettlement will not be necessary. Also, the land is
the property of the Government of Malawi and has been allocated for this
purpose, so compensation for the land will not be required. The sparse



- 41 -
vegetation of the new reservoir area makes the risk of extinction of
wildlife unlikely. As a reservoir already exists, no general change in
aquatic life is expected. The larger reservoir will enhance stability of
thermal stratification, improve the potential for fisheries and flood
control and reduce the risk of salination due to evaporation. The longer
detention time in the larger reservoir is expected to result in improved
reservoir water quality.
2.56     Mzuzu Dam.  The Mzuzu dam will be a 19.5 m earth fill dam
constructed on the Lunyangwa River, a tributary of the Mzuzu River, and
will have a reservoir with an area of 0.72 km2. The area to be inundated
is currently natural secondary subtropical forests and swampland (dambo) of
no commercial or biological interest. The catchment is owned by Government
and there is no present or expected future agricultural use of this area.
No human settlements will be inundated as a result of this dam.
Eutrophication and algal bloom which will be a hazard during the early
years when inundated vegetation is decaying under the water can be
minimized by removal of vegetation in the reservoir area prior to
inundation. The dam is unlikely to result in serious negative
environmental impacts and further environmental reconnaissance is
unnecessary.
2.57     Zomba Dam.  The Zomba dam will be a 15 m earth fill dam to be
constructed near the headwaters of the Mlunguzi River on the Zomba Plateau.
The Plateau is at the top of the Zomba Montain and supports a rich and
possibly unique vegetation (high marsh) and wildlife community. This marsh
is a rare biotope which is seldom found in Malawi. The dam will regulate
river flow (between the marsh at the headwaters and the present water
intake) to produce more reliable water supply for Zomba as well as benefit
the trout hatchery. The catchment area (2.3 km2) is almost entirely
covered by dense forest. The only settlements are forest service houses
and these will not be affected by the dam. Agriculture is not practiced in
the area; the marsh vegetation is poor in nutrients and there is little
danger of eutrophication following flooding. The main concern with the dam
is its impact on the high marsh. A detailed study of the ecology of the
marsh together with its functions for the watershed has been agreed with
Government to minimize the impact of the project on the marsh. The study
will be completed by September 30, 1990, and the Government agreed to
implement the study recommendations in agreement with the Association.
J. Riparian Matters
2.58     The Kasungu dam is to be built on the Chitete River and the Mzuzu
dam on the Lunyama River. Both rivers drain into Lake Malawi, an
international body of water, bordered by Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania.
The proposed Zomba dam will be on the Mlunguzi River which eventually
empties into Lake Chilwa bordered by Malawi and Mozambique. As the
proposed dams will be on relatively small tributaries of these
international water bodies, no potential international water right issues
are anticipated. The Government of Malawi, however, has formally notified
the concerned riparians of its plans for these bodies of water. Both
Mozambique and Tanzania have advised Malawi that they have no objection to
the proposed damming of the rivers in question.

III. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF DISTRICT WATER SUPPLY FUND
A. Past Operating Results
3.01     DWSF was created in 1978-79 to operate on a commercial and self-
financing basis. The fund served as the organizational and financial
entity responsible for implementing a project, financed by AfDF, to upgrade
and increase potable water supply facilities in certain areas including
small towns scattered about the country. At present DWSF operations cover
48 centers and serve over 300,000 people through communal water points and
house connections. According to the financial provisions of the AfDB
project, DWSF was expected to generate a reasonable return on its net fixed
assets, which it has not been able to accomplish so far. /
3.02     DWSF derives its revenues mainly through water charges from about
600 communal water points and about 11,000 house connections based on
metering. At present, approximately 156,000 people are served by communal
water points and 144,000 by house connections. An additional source of
income is the one-time fee for house connections.
3.03     The past financial performance of DWSF is shown in Table 3.1.
Despite the requirement that DWSF operate on a self-financing basis, it has
suffered a loss in every year since it began operations except FY 1982/83.
The causes of this adverse financial performance are mainly (i) increases
in operating costs exacerbated by devaluations of the kwacha; (ii) failure
to implement needed tariff increases on time despite sharp increases in
costs; (iii) the high cost of amortizing substantial debts; and (iv)

3.04     Separate accounts for the water supply system of individual towns,
such as Zomba, are not maintained at present. Thus, it is not possible to
ascertain the operating results of each particular system. Revenues from
the sale of water are available, and the data for the seven urban water
supply systems included in the project are shown in Table 3.2. The systems
vary substantially in size. The Zomba system is relatively large,
generating 51Z of total revenue, and the Mponela system is relatively
small, generating 3Z of the revenue.   Cash receipts are generally somewhat
lower than sales, indicating some problems of collection; however, both
sales and revenues rose in most of the seven systems between FY 1984/85 and
FY 1986/87.

3.05     DWSF's accounting system is operated on a commercial basis.
Annual accounts are prepared in a commercial format and audited by the
Auditor General. The audit reports through March 31, 1988, were reviewed
and are satisfactory. It was agreed during negotiations that DWSF will
continue to have its annual accounts independently audited and submit
audited accounts, together with the auditors' reports, to the Association
no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year (para. 2.51).
3.06     Present accounting practices and procedures are adequate for
recording transactions and preparing financial statements and annual
budgets for DWSF at its present level. However, the increase in size and
complexity that will result from the project investments will necessitate
more detailed accounts. It was agreed during negotiations that separate
accounting arrangements will be established by December 1990 for the three
urban schemes located in Zomba, Mzuzu, and Kasungu.



- 44 -
3.07     As of November 1988, there were 36 accounting staff in the Water
Department and the number of staff is adequate. Out of the 36 staff, there
were 21 in Headquarters (Lilongwe), 8 in the Southern Region, 4 in the
Central Region, and 3 in the Northern Region. The expected increased
accounting demands of the larger system resulting from the project will
require that more qualified accountants or certified accounting technicians
be hired for each region. In addition to handling the accounting work of
the three schemes, these accountants would supervise and train accounting
clerks in the regions.
B. Financial Position
3.08     The balance sheet data for DWSF over the fiscal years 1983/84 -
1987/88 are presented in Table 3.3. No major investments were made by DWSF
for several years, and while gross fixed assets increased marginally, net
fixed assets declined until 1987/88. Receivables (57Z of the outstanding
amount in 1986/87 and 1987/88 was owed by government agencies) and payables
have increased substantially in the past few years. DWSF's working capital
has shrunk and its year-end cash balance has been negative for the past two
fiscal years. Since much of the outstanding amounts is owed by government
agencies, during negotiations, Government agreed to ensure that all
outstanding (over 90 days) water bills are paid before March 31, 1990.
Servicing of a large Government loan (68Z of total long-term debt) has been
postponed indefinitely and the accumulated losses have led to a negative
equity position for DWSF.

C. Future Performance
3.09     The financial forecasts for fiscal years 1988/89 to 1995/96 and
the assumptions on which they are based are shown in Annexes 17 to 20.
During the project period the volume of water sold is expected to double
due to the project and other investments. This, coupled with the tariff
increases assumed (para. 3.20), would increase revenues by about 45Z from
the present levels. In the same period operating expenses would increase
by about 53Z. With significant cash balances in the years following
project completion, DWSF should be able to finance minor expansions from
its own resources and reduce its dependence on government allocations.
Agreement was reached with Government during negotiations that DWSF will
generate total revenues at a level sufficient to: (i) not later than the
end of fiscal year 1991/92 cover its expenses for operation and
maintenance, and depreciation or debt service requirements, whichever is
higher; (ii) not later than the end of fiscal year 1993/94 generate
positive net income after allowing for DWSF's expenses for operation and
maintenance, depreciation, interest, and other charges on debt and maintain
a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1.4.
3.10     To increase further DWSF's potential revenues, DWSF's connection
charge policy needs to be changed. At present, DWSF requires advance
payment of the actual connection cost of MK 250 plus 15Z overhead for all
new connections. As the connection charge is beyond many potential
domestic customers' ability to pay, the substitution of a monthly charge on
new connections could attract many new customers. There is a precedent for
this approach as the Blantyre Water Board allows the fee for new
connections to be paid in monthly installments. As a precaution, a down-
payment of 15-20Z could be charged with the rest in monthly installments.
Agreement was reached with Government during negotiations that DWSF will
substitute a monthly charge on new connections instead of the advance
payment currently required.
3.11     DWSF presently has a negative equity position and its debts are
larger than its assets largely due to the Government loan it has failed to
service in the past. Since DWSF has been using its income to finance
development projects without compensation from Government, it was agreed
with Government during negotiations that the DWSF debt will be converted to
a government contribution to the capital of DWSF.
3.12     DWSF's liquidity, which has been precarious for the past several
years, should also gradually improve with current ratios above 1.8 for the
years following project completion (Annex 20). It is important, however,
for DWSF to follow a consistent plan of action in order to prevent it from
falling into the serious financial difficulties of the past. Agreement was
reached with Government during negotiations that DWSF will not incur any
debt, other than that specified for the purposes of this project, unless a
reasonable forecast of its net cash generation before depreciation and
interest exceeds 1.5 times its debt service in any future years, including
debt service on the amount to be borrowed.
3.13     DWSF's present asset base is about MK 7 million.  At the end of
construction of this project, DWSF's assets are going to be over ten times
higher. Consequently, a revaluation of existing assets is deemed to be



- 47 -
unnecessary at this time. Agreement was reached with Government during
negotiations to revalue annually the assets of DWSF starting October 1,
1990 and every October thereafter.
D. Financing Plan
3.14     The financing plan for DWSF covers the fiscal years 1988189
through 1992/93, which is approximately the period of physical
implementation of the project. Table 3.4 presents the financing plan in
terms of both Malawi kwacha and US dollars, while Annex 19 gives a detailed
forecast of DWSF's sources and application of funds.

3.15     Based on present estimates, it is expected that DWSF's internal
cash generation during the period of project construction will be about 3%
of its overall funding requirements. This will be sufficient to cover debt
service and provide adequate increases in its working capital.
3.16     The costs of project construction, which represent 96% of DWSF's
requirements during this period, would be met from grants and contributions
(36X) and from borrowings (60%). KfW is expected to provide about 30% of
total funds on a grant basis, which, with the Government's contribution of



- 48 -
about 6% plus conversion of the existing debt to equity, will help overcome
DWSF's current negative equity situation.
3.17     It is assumed that the AfDF loan will be passed on to DWSF on the
same terms and conditions as the loan is made available to the Government
(for 50 years including a 10-year grace period and a service charge of
0.75Z). It was agreed during negotiations that IDA funds will be passed on
to DWSF for a period of 25 years including a 5-year grace period at an
interest rate of 5% on amounts disbursed and outstanding, and that the
Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.
E. Tariffs
3.18     DWSF's tariff structure is progressive, with the intention of
cross-subsidizing the poorer segments of consumers, and applies to all DWSF
schemes. While the tariffs have not been reviewed each year as they are
supposed to be, increases of about 50% in April 1988 and 20Z in April 1989
have resulted in the following tariff schedules:
April 1, 1988    April 1, 1989
Communal Water Points                MYK 0.23/m3     MK 0.23/m3
Domestic Water
(monthly consumption):
Consumption of 0 - 6m3          MK 2.00/m3      MYK 2.50/m3 flat charge
Consumption in excess of 6m3
up to and including 8m3       MK 0.30/m3      MK 0.36/m3
Consumption in excess of 8m3
up to and including 30m3      MK 0.65/m3      MK 0.78/m3
Consumption in excess of 30m3  MK 0.75/m3       MK 0.90/m3
3.19     Tariffs for water from communal water points were not changed
during the recent revision because of affordability concerns (para. 4.34).
Each communal water point is equipped with a meter and consumer groups have
been formed which, as a whole, are responsible for meeting the cost of
water passing through the meter.  The tariff of MK 0.23/mn  is charged to a
"Tap Committee".   The Tap Committee in turn raises revenues from members
of the consumer group through a flat rate, normally about MK 1.00 to MK
1.20 per family per month. The construction costs of communal water points
have to date been financed by the Government and a grant from UNCDF.
Government's policy is to provide water to those who cannot afford
individual connections through communal water points; 52% of the
population served by DWSF is served by communal water points.



- 49 -
3.20     It is estimated that in FY 1988/89 DWSF will collect an average
tariff of MK 0.741m3 for its domestic water sales (Annex 18). Based on
projections of water sales, DWSF would only require small increases in its
average tariff to meet its overall financial obligations for the next two
to three years. However, the tariff that would be required upon project
completion in FY 1992193 would be much higher. To avoid a large one-time
rise, the tariffs should be increased gradually for DWSF to maintain
financial viability. Therefore, agreement was reached with Government
during negotiations that the Borrower shall ensure that, in each year of
project implementation, DWSF generates total revenues at a level sufficient
to: (i) not later than the end of fiscal year 1991/92, cover DWSF's
expenses for operation and maintenance, and depreciation or debt service
requirements, whichever is higher; and (ii) not later than the end of
fiscal year 1993/94, generate positive net income after allowing for DWSF's
expenses for operation and maintenance, depreciation, interest, and other
charges on debt and maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.4.
Agreement was also reached that starting in FY 1989/90 the DWSF will submit
to the Association, four months from the beginning of each fiscal year, its
plan of action related to tariffs for the coming fiscal year as a result of
annually updated financial forecasts.
F. Financial Covenants
3.21     Based on the financial analysis of the water supply component of
this project, the following financial covenants have been agreed at
negotiations:
(a) DWSF will have its annual accounts independently audited and
submit to the Association the audited accounts, together with
the auditors' reports, no later than six months after the end
of the fiscal year;
(b) Separate accounting arrangements would be established by
December 1990 for the three urban water supply schemes in
Zomba, Mzuzu, and Kasungu;
(c)  The Government will ensure that all outstanding (over 90
days) water bills owed by government agencies will be paid by
March 31, 1990;
(d) DWSF will generate total revenues at a level sufficient to:
(i) not later than the end of fiscal year 1991/92 cover its
expenses for operation and maintenance, and depreciation or
debt service requirements, whichever is higher; (ii) not
later than the end of fiscal year 1993/94 generate positive
net income after allowing for DWSF's expenses for operation
and maintenance, depreciation, interest, and other charges on
debt and maintain a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities of not less than 1.4;
(e) DWSF will substitute a monthly charge on new connections (for
domestic consumption) instead of the advance payment
currently required;



- 50 -
(f)  The Government will convert its loan of MK 3,688,000 to DWSF
as a government contribution to the capital of DWSF;
(g) DWSF will not incur any debt, other than that specified for
this project, unless a reasonable forecast of its net cash
generation before depreciation and interest exceeds 1.5 times
its debt service in any future years, including debt service
on the amount to be borrowed;
(h) DWSF's assets will be maintained on a current value basis;
(i) IDA's funds will be passed on to DWSF for a period of 25
years including a 5-year grace period at an interest rate of
5Z on amounts disbursed and outstanding;
(j) Government will bear the foreign exchange risk;
(k) Starting in FY 1990/91, DWSF will submit to the Association,
four months prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, its
plan for tariffs for the coming fiscal year.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Evaluation of Project Components
General
4.01     The project is consistent with sectoral development objectives and
represents a continuation of developments achieved under previous IDA-
financed projects. The primary objective is to strengthen the management
capabilities of MOW. Thus a significant portion of the project focuses on
the management aspects, the benefits of which will be realized within the
context of the road, water and public building components. The severe
funding and expenditure constraints facing Government at present underscore
the importance of maintaining the infrastructure that exists and of
maximizing benefits through effective project identification, programming
and implementation. Accordingly, the focus is not only on the subprojects
themselves but also on the process required to plan and manage these assets
in a cost-effective manner.
4.02     The overall project is based on a listing of subprojects prepared
by MOW and subsequently pared down according to specific criteria and to
meet prescribed spending limits. In addition to the management improvement
component, there are subprojects in the areas of road rehabilitation and
improvement, road safety, rural transport, water resource development and
rehabilitation of public buildings. A preliminary evaluation indicates
that all of the subprojects are economically viable. This general finding
will be supplemented each year by detailed analyses of subprojects to be
initiated in the subsequent year. Consistent with this approach, only
those subprojects scheduled to begin in the first year have been evaluated
in detail.
Evaluation of Project Overall
4.03     The road rehabilitation and resealing components, a continuation
of work begun under the Fifth Highway Project, will improve road conditions
on major routes, thereby reducing transport costs, enhancing the
reliability of transport and preventing progressive road deterioration.
The extension of DRIMP to the three remaining districts and further spot
improvements in other districts will afford rural populations better access
to markets, supplies and public services. The improved transport to be
realized through various road components of the project, supplemented by
the pilot rural transport scheme, will help to stimulate the economic
development of the country, particularly in rural areas.
4.04     The urban water supply component will greatly expand the capacity
of seven urban water systems and enable them to accommodate a growing
demand for potable water. In addition to providing an adequate and
reliable supply of water, the project is directed toward strengthening the
operational and institutional capacity of DWSF and, in particular, to help
the larger systems become self-supporting. The rehabilitation of boreholes
and construction of additional gravity-fed schemes will improve the water
supplies of many rural people throughout Malawi, as well as assist in
meeting the needs of the Mozambican refugees. The time savings associated
with the improved rural water supply are likely to be significant; a recent



- 52 -
study by ILO estimates that rural households in Malawi spend more than
2,500 hours a year on transport, over a quarter of which is spent
collecting water, usually (as much as 70Z of the time) by women (Annex
13c).
4.05     The rehabilitation of selected public buildings will improve the
utility of those buildings in the short term and extend their useful lives.
In addition to renewal of specific buildings, the public building component
demonstrates the substantial savings that can be gained from timely
maintenance and rehabilitation. The potential exists to realize long-term
benefits from development of an ongoing maintenance program that would
obviate the need for premature major rehabilitation or replacement
investments.
4.06     Economic rates of return (ERR) have been calculated for each of
the subprojects scheduled to begin in the first year program. These ERRs
are summarized in Table 4.1.

4.07     All of the foregoing ERRs are satisfactory.  Comparable returns
are expected for similar subprojects in subsequent years. During
negotiations, it was agreed that: (i) the Association must approve each
subproject prior to its inclusion in the project in subsequent years; (ii)
all subprojects proposed for roads and public buildings must have an ERR of
at least 12Z; and (iii) the list of subprojects for the next year must be
submitted to the Association three months before the beginning of the
fiscal year.
4.08     No calculation of ERR has been made for other project components
representing approximately 20Z of the total cost of the project. These
smaller subprojects, which include a rural transport pilot scheme, road
maintenance depots, road safety program, rural gravity-fed piped water
schemes, training and technical assistance, complement the larger project
components and are well justified.

Road Maintenance
4.09     The road maintenance component comprises (i) paved road
rehabilitation; (ii) earth and gravel road rehabilitation; (iii) resealing
of paved roads; and (iv) bridge reconstruction. The principal benefits
from road maintenance will be savings in vehicle operating costs.
Additional benefits will be derived from the avoidance of both road
closures caused by poor road conditions and the premature rehabilitation of
poorly maintained roads. The benefits will accrue largely to road
transporters and farmers living in the areas of road influence. As the
road transport industry is relatively competitive and users of the main and
secondary roads are diverse, transport cost savings from this project
component should be realized by virtually all economic groups in the
country.
4.10     The economic justification of this component is based on an
assessment of economic costs and benefits with and without the project over
the estimated economic life of the renewed road or bridge facility. The
traffic forecasts used to estimate savings in vehicle operating costs were
derived from baseline counts, information on past trends, and growth rates
consistent with conservative forecasts that take into account such factors
as estimated future geographical distribution of population and employment,
and growth in GDP. The resultant average annual growth rates range from 3%
to 5Z, depending upon the type and location of individual subprojects. As
these subprojects involve rehabilitation of existing facilities, it was
assumed that they would neither divert traffic from other roads nor
generate significant new demand. The economic vehicle operating costs are
based on vehicle operating cost factors for Malawi and the differential in
vehicle operating costs for different road categories, road standards and
types of terrain (Annex 21). Subproject costs include physical
contingencies but are net of taxes and price contingencies.
4.11     The ERRs for individual road maintenance subprojects in the first
year program are shown in Annex 22 and range from 17% to 19% for
rehabilitation of paved, earth and gravel roads, and are more than 50% for
bridge reconstruction (Annex 23). The high rates of return for the latter
are the result of long distances that would have to be traversed if a
bridge were unusable or restrictive weight limitations were imposed and
enforced.
4.12     Selection of the particular roads included in the road maintenance
component was based on a systematic analysis of a large number of candidate
roads. MOW used the System for the Inventory and Analysis of Highway
Projects (SIAP), a network model in some ways similar to the Bank's Highway
Design and Maintenance model (HDM), to identify critical links in the road
network and evaluate each potential subproject's rate of return. ERR was a
key factor in the selection of particular roads; other considerations
included regional distribution and the practicality of organizing the work
on the roads in an efficient manner. A large number of bridges initially
identified in a road planning inventory were similarly screened and the
potentially most beneficial projects analyzed using the HDM model. As HDM
provides important detail and versatility, it was agreed during appraisal
that MOW will use HDM for all analyses of road projects in future years.



- 54 -
Road Improvement to Bitumen Standard
4.13     The improvement of earth and gravel roads to bitumen standard
constitutes new construction rather than maintenance and rehabilitation.
However, the analysis is similar to that for maintenance and
rehabilitation, as the improved road will replace a functioning road of
lower standard. As before, the principal benefits are savings in vehicle
operating costs with and without the project over the estimated 20-year
life of the new road. Additional benefits are reduced maintenance costs
and avoided premature rehabilitation. Only one such improvement is
included in the first year program, with an ERR of 16Z (Annex 22).
DRIMP
4.14     Phases I through III of the DRIMP program have demonstrated
significant benefits throughout Malawi. Phase IV will complete coverage of
all districts, extend the DRIMP network by about 850 km, and make spot
improvements where needed in the existing network. The principal benefits
are savings in vehicle operating costs in the transport of non-agricultural
goods and increases in agricultural production made possible by better
access to farms and markets. Improved access to agricultural extension
services and markets is expected to induce farmers to increase productivity
and expand somewhat the area under cultivation.
4.15     Based on past experience, significant project benefits also can be
expected in the context of institution-building within district councils.
In particular, capabilities for road maintenance will be developed through
the provision of training, equipment and depots under the project. Other
anticipated benefits are reduced spoilage of produce and improved access to
health, education and other social and administrative facilities for people
residing near the roads.
4.16     Most of the benefits from the reduction in transport costs will
accrue to the road transporters, since the Agricultural Development and
Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) pays them fixed rates for transport of goods
to and from rural market centers, and to the farmers living within the
roads' area of influence because of the competitive nature of the road
transport industry. The main beneficiaries of the increased agricultural
production and improved access to social services will be residents near
the roads.
4.17     Selection of the district roads to be improved in this phase was
based on socio-economic criteria, and all project roads have an estimated
ERR of at least 12Z. The economic analysis of DRIMP roads considers
benefits from vehicle operating cost savings plus incremental agricultural
production estimated on the basis of farm models representative of farms in
the proximity of the roads. Spot improvements in other districts will be
made where inspection indicates a need for such measures on roads of high
priority.
Urban Water Supply
4.18     The urban water supply component will provide essential water
supply to seven urban centers whose demand for water cannot be met from



- 55 -
existing facilities. This project would greatly expand the capacity of the
seven systems and thereby enable them to satisfy water supply needs for
these communities. The three towns requiring dam construction are
important commercial and governmental centers that will continue to play an
important national role in the years ahead. The four smaller towns in need
of less extensive improvements are important from a predominantly regional
perspective. All presently suffer from the lack of a reliable supply of
potable water.
4.19     The composition of the urban water supply component represents the
least cost solution among possible technical alternatives considered for
the seven towns. Although the project represents a significant increase in
scale, especially for those systems requiring the construction or raising
of dams, soil conditions and available ground water preclude further
expansion of existing sources of supply. Furthermore, the existing sources
of supply are unreliable and frequently inadequate, even during relatively
short periods of drought. The project will significantly reduce the risk
of source failure.
4.20     The existence of some excess capacity during the early years of
the project is unavoidable due to the lumpiness of the investment required,
especially in those systems requiring new dams. The extent of the problem
varies by town. In Mzuzu the building of the dam cannot be staged because
of topography and foundation conditions. Both the Kasungu and Zomba dams
are staged; the Kasungu subproject entails raising the existing dam to meet
increasing demand, and the Zomba subproject entails building the first
stage of a potentially multi-stage dam. All related investments in water
treatment and distribution facilities will be staged in accordance with the
demand.
4.21     The ERR of the seven systems is 6.1X, with aggregate benefits from
the subprojects calculated using incremental water sales at an average
tariff of MK 0.74 per m3, increasing to MK 0.81 per m3 in real terms as the
systems become operational (Annex 24).  The incremental water sales include
the additional demand met by the project facilities and the reduction in
the proportion of unaccounted for water that will occur as the new systems
are put in place and large obvious leaks are repaired.  Investment costs
include physical contingencies but are net of taxes and subsidies.  Use of
incremental water sales as a proxy for benefits clearly understates the
real economic return, as benefits that are not easily quantified are
excluded. Recent literature also indicates a correlation between improved
water supply and better health, with implications for enhanced
productivity, which is not captured in this estimate.
4.22     The average incremental cost estimates of water supplied under the
project range from MK 0.98 per m3 at a discount rate of 8% to MK 1.42 at a
discount rate of 12Z. The average tariff rate of MK 0.81, which meets the
basic financial requirements (para. 3.20), is below the average incremental
cost but was kept low in view of affordability concerns (para 4.34). The
magnitude of the average incremental cost is largely due to the lumpiness
of the investment in dams and the existence of excess capacity in the short
run. Once the dam is in place, the marginal cost of expanding the system
will be relatively low. Thus the average incremental cost of the project
will be higher than the long run marginal cost of providing water to these
communities.

Borehole Rehabilitation
4.23     The rehabilitation of 2,500 boreholes will improve the quality and
quantity of water available to rural households throughout Malawi. This
broadly based program supports Government's objective of providing a
minimum of 27 liters of water per person per day within a walking distance
of 500 meters or less. As an estimated 50Z of rural households are 2 km or
more away from an improved water source (para. 1.47), the project should
substantially reduce the time required for collection. The principal
benefits thus will be time savings, plus the additional water consumed as a
result of greater convenience. The benefits can be expected to accrue to
all members of the affected households, but especially to women, on whom
the burden of collecting water usually falls, consuming as much as a
quarter of their time every day.
4.24     In the estimation of benefits, the value of time saved reflects
the reduction in distance traveled and a conservative estimate of average
rural household income.l/ The latter is based on a recent sample of 250
households with children and includes marketed income, any off farm income,
and the value of non-marketed agricultural production; the average income
oft MK 75 per capita per year falls in the second lowest quartile of the
sample and is slightly below the average for female headed households. As
the shape of the demand curve is not known, it was assumed that households
value the time savings associated with the incremental water collection
about half as much as the basic supply. Households also contribute a small
amount, in the order of MK 2, to district councils for maintenance each
year.
4.25     Project costs include the initial cost of rehabilitation, annual
maintenance, and periodic renovation consisting primarily of pump
replacement every ten years. The annual maintenance costs reflect gradual
implementation of a program to transfer responsibility for operation and
maintenance of boreholes to the local community over a nine-year period.
Costs include physical contingencies but are net of taxes and subsidies.
Based on these benefits and costs, the ERR for the borehole rehabilitation
component is 20X (Annex 25).
Rehabilitation of Public Buildings
4.26     The deteriorated condition of a number of priority public
buildings has become so serious that the Government must either (i)
recognize that the effectiveness of the buildings in serving their public
purposes is seriously compromised and replacement of the buildings with new
structures will soon be required, or (ii) rehabilitate the existing
buildings to improve their efficiency and extend their useful lives. The
latter course will be taken under this project for 21 key building schemes,
with two schools and one hospital scheduled for rehabilitation in the first
year. The beneficiaries of the project will be the buildings' occupants
and the Government of Malawi, which owns the structures to be renewed.

for a Change", World Bank Discussion Paper No. 18, 1987.



- 57 -
4.27     The 21 sites were selected from a larger list of 60 building
schemes, and are the sites deemed by MOW to be most in need of
rehabilitation and repair. The final selection was based on the importance
of the services provided by the buildings, operating costs and site
inspections that identified the most essential items of work. Priority was
given to rehabilitation and repairs needed to prevent continuing and/or
imminent damage, and to cases where faults were deemed to be dangerous
and/or to constitute a health risk. In choosing the sites for the first
year of the project, preference was given to the social sectors, with some
consideration of geographical distribution as well.
4.28     Once the determination was made that the building's services are
required, the approach became one of least cost, e.g., whether the building
should be maintained at some minimal level and then rebuilt, or
rehabilitated and subsequently adequately maintained. The principal
benefits from rehabilitation thus are reconstruction costs avoided and
savings in annual maintenance costs. Other benefits, more difficult to
quantify, are the increased efficiency of the operations of the buildings'
users and occupants, and reduced injuries and health hazards. Based on
reconstruction costs avoided and savings in maintenance costs, the ERRs for
the individual buildings in the first year program range from 23Z to 30Z
(Annex 26).
Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
4.29     An assessment of the sensitivity of economic returns to variations
in the estimated costs and benefits indicates that none of the ERRs would
fall to unacceptable levels. In the case of roads, even the assumption of
a combined 15Z increase in construction costs and 15Z lower traffic
benefits (due to lower traffic growth or lower operating cost savings per
vehicle) fails to reduce individual ERRs of main and secondary roads below
12Z, and of DRIMP roads below 10%. Since experience in the region suggests
that delays are likely, alternative calculations were made under the
assumption that project implementation would require an additional year
(with 50% of expenditures in each year deferred until the following year).
The change in the overall ERR of the project, as well as that of individual
components, is small and does not affect the economic viability of the
project (Annex 27).
4.30     In addition to higher costs and-lower benefits, an added risk to
the road component is that the Government's financial resources for
maintenance of both national and district road networks may be inadequate.
To minimize this risk, it was agreed at negotiations that there would be
annual review of Government's allocation of funds for maintenance (para.
1.38). Nonetheless, even if priorities were set accordingly, Government's
ability to fund these needs will depend on the strength of the economy and
overall demands on Government resources. The economy expanded at an
average annual rate of 4.1% between 1982 and 1985, and grew by only 1.1% in
1986 and 1.4Z in 1987. However, GDP grew 3.62 in 1988 and is currently
projected to grow by about 4X in 1989 and 1990, 4.2% in 1991, 4.4% in 1992
and 4.5Z p.a. thereafter.2/
2/ "Malawi Government, "Economic Report, 1989".



- 58 -
4.31     The principal risks in the water supply component are:  (i) that
DWSF will not be able to generate sufficient revenue from incremental water
sales to cover maintenance, debt service, and needed additional
investments; and (ii) that Government may be unable to authorize necessary
tariff increases. However, Government recently (April 1989) increased
tariffs 202 to meet revenue generation targets, thereby showing its
commitment to sound fiscal management of DWSF. Future increases would be
guided by the condition requiring Government to implement tariffs that
provide sufficient revenue to meet expenses for operation and maintenance,
depreciation or debt service, whichever is higher, and adequate working
capital (para. 3.09). The additional risk that Government may be unable to
finance its share of the project in a timely manner due to budgetary
constraints is mitigated in part by the very large proportion of grant
financing of the project. Sensitivity analyses of the water supply
component indicate that an increase in capital costs of 1OZ without a
comparable increase in revenues would reduce the ERR to 5.5Z, and a delay
in project completion (with 50Z of expenditures in each year deferred to
the next and benefits delayed accordingly) would reduce the ERR to 5.8Z.
4.32     Reflecting the strong economic rationale for rehabilitation of
existing assets, sensitivity analyses of the borehole rehabilitation
component show the program to be economically justified under a range of
more restrictive assumptions. The assumption of a combined increase in
costs of 1OZ and reduction in benefits of 1OZ reduces the ERR to 16%. A
reduction in per capita income to MK 65 per year would yield an ERR of 15Z.
Alternatively, the ERR would be 18Z if either the pumps were to last 5
instead of 10 years, or if the decentralized maintenance program failed and
annual maintenance had to be handled centrally at a much higher cost, as
now.
4.33     The benefits of rehabilitating public buildings are sufficiently
large that even a 30% increase in costs would not reduce individual ERRs
below 20Z. The principal risk therefore is that Government will be unable
to finance its share of costs in a timely manner due to budgetary
constraints. This is unlikely to be a problem in the initial building
projects, as the level of investment required is fairly low. However,
Government may find it difficult to set aside sufficient funds for the on-
going building maintenance required to keep these and subsequently
rehabilitated buildings from again falling into disrepair.
B. Affordability of Water Supply
4.34     Although Government has adopted a policy that urban water supply
should be financially self-supporting, it is also concerned that the cost
of water, particularly to the low-income segment of the population, should
not be unduly burdensome. Under the current tariff for DWSF's urban
systems, the consumers from communal water points are charged MK 0.23 per
m3 of water consumed (para. 3.18). Approximately 60Z of the urban
households in Malawi have incomes below MK 130 per month and 80Z have
incomes below MK 260, for a household having an average of 8.5 persons.
Based on an average daily consumption of 30 liters per capita, a household
of 9 persons would consume about 8m3 of water in a month, for which it
would pay about MK 2.00. This represents about 1.5Z of monthly household
income, which is considered affordable.

(p) DWSF will generate total revenues at a level sufficient to:
(i) not later than the end of fiscal year 1991/92 cover its
expenses for operation and maintenance, and depreciation or
debt service requirements, whichever is higher; (ii) not
later than the end of fiscal year 1993/94 generate positive

5Z on amounts disbursed and outstanding, and that the
Government will bear the foreign exchange risk (para. 3.17);



- 61 -
(v)  Government will grant DWSF each year, from FY 1991/92 through
FY 1992/93, tariff increases that will provide for: (i)
expenses for operation and maintenance (excluding
depreciation); (ii) depreciation or debt service, whichever
is higher; and (iii) a minimum current ratio of 1.4;
(w) starting in FY 1990/91, DWSF will submit to the Association,

plan for tariffs for the coming fiscal year (para. 3.20); and
(x) specific Association approval will be required before any
subproject can be included in the project in subsequent
years, all subprojects for roads and buildings must have an
ERR of at least 12Z, and the list of subprojects for the next
year must be submitted to the Association three months before
the beginning of the fiscal year (para. 4.07).

during FY 1989/90 have been signed; and
(b)  the Government has received firm commitments from donors to
finance subprojects to begin implementation during FY
1990/91.
5.03     The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 22.3 million
(US$28.8 million equivalent), on standard terms, with 40 years maturity, to
the Government of Malawi.

MALAWI
Infrastructure Project
Technical Assistance, Studies, and Training Requirements
1.       The project will provide a substantial amount of technical
assistance to certain governmental entities, particularly MOW, which
require consultancy services for project preparation, supervision of
implementation, training and other needs. The purpose of this annex is to
summarize the various technical assistance components in the project and
the types of consultant specialists required. A table summarizing all
technical assistance, training, and specialist services required is shown
on page 6 of this annex. The detailed description of the services is given
below.
Preparation Work
2.       The necessary detailed project preparation for a substantial part
of the four-year program has been completed. Detailed preparations for the
remaining project activities have been completed for the first year but for
the three subsequent years, they will not have been completed at the time
of Board presentation as is acceptable under applicable sector lending
procedures. The project will include financing of detailed
design/preparation of tender documents of the second, third, and fourth
year program of the borehole rehabilitation and public building
rehabilitation works. Consultants of appropriate background will be
engaged by MOW to undertake in a timely manner all of this design and other
technical work.
Supervision of Construction and Other Project Implementation
3.       Consultants will be required to undertake the supervision of
construction of all road and bridge works (110 man-months), DRIMP (24 man-
months), urban water supply system expansion (including an ecology study of
the Zomba dam site) (110 man-months), borehole rehabilitation (50 man-
months), and public building rehabilitation (60 man-months). Also,
consultants will be needed to monitor the rural transport pilot service (48
man-months) and to evaluate bids received during procurement of equipment
for PVHO (24 man-months).
Manpower Development and Training Services
4.       Nationwide, about 97Z of formal sector jobs have now been
localized, although expatriate participation is most frequent in senior
management positions. MOW, being a specialized technical ministry, is an
example of somewhat slower progress in localization of engineering and
related positions. As an example the Roads Department, with an
establishment of 35 professional positions, employs at present 6
expatriates in such positions.



- 69 -
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 6
5.       The Government policy is to localize these positions as soon as
possible and is therefore embarking on a staff development plan that
includes training and technical assistance.  The plan has been developed in
such a fashion that the technical assistance would gradually be phased out
during the project period. Expatriate incumbents would be replaced by
already identified ministry officials, who would undergo appropriate
training overseas in the interim, in accordance with the localization plan
for MOW staff agreed at negotiations.
6.       The Management Improvement Program for MOW would comprise the
following:
(i) Technical Assistance
- MOW Executive Technical Assistance/Project Management
1. Program Planning and Evaluation Advisor (24 man-
months)
2. Staff Development Advisor (24 man-months)

1. Financial Management Advisor (24 man-months)
- Management Information Systems/Studies (241 man-months)
1. Water Facilities Maintenance and Operations (20 man-
months)
2. Buildings Maintenance and Operations (24 man-months)
3. Roads Maintenance and Operations (6 man-months)
4. Plant and Vehicle Hire Organization (20 man-months)
5. Roads, Water, & Buildings Construction (56 man-months)
6. Accounting and Financial Management (115 man-months)
- Local Construction and Consulting Industry Promotion
(72 man-months)
1. Construction/Consulting Engineer (24 man-months)
2. Quantity surveyor (24 man-months)
3. Accountant/Financial Advisor (24 man-months)
- Data Processing/Training (77 man-months)
1. Data Processing Advisor (24 man-months)
2. Management Development Officer (6 man-months)
3. Training Specialist (24 man-months)
4. Instructional Materials Specialist (12 man-months)
5. Librarian (3 man-months)
6. Industrial Engineer/Systems Specialist (6 man-months)
7. Hydrologist (2 man-months)
(ii) Training
Conferences, study tours, in-country and overseas training
related to management improvement.



- 70 -
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 6
7.       For the Roads Department and other road and road transport related
activities, consultants services would be required as follows:
(i)   Technical Assistance
For the Roads Department 191 man-months of technical
assistance would be provided as follows:
1. Chief Civil Engineer (Roads Planning Branch) (12 man-
months).
2. Chief Civil Engineer (Design Branch)
(24 man-months).
3. Chief Civil Engineer (Construction Branch) (12 man-
months).
4. Principal Civil Engineer (Rural Roads Branch) (24 man-
months).
5. Assistant Chief Civil Engineer (Soils and Materials
Branch) (24 man-months).
6. Pavement Overlay Program, 2 posts (40 man-months).
7. Short-term consultancies of a total of 55 man-months
divided into urban roads (40 man-months) and specialist
consultancy, i.e., computer programming (15 man-months).
Rural Transport Services
2 posts for program administration and supervision (1x12 and
1x36 man-months = 48 man-months).
Road Safety Program
90 man-months of consultant services to implement study
recommendations for improvement of road safety.
PVHO
Engineering Manager (24 man-months)
(ii) Overseas Training
As an integral part of the staff development plan, 96 man-
months of overseas training would be provided as follows:
1. Road Planning - 1x2 man-months.
2. Soils and Materials Testing - 3x12 man-months.
3. Bridge and Structural Design - 2x12 man-months.
4. Construction - 1x12 man-months.
5. Road Maintenance 1x12 man-months.

ANNEX 4
Page 4 of 6
9.       In order to carry out the proposed operation and maintenance of
boreholes and handpump component, the Department of Water would require the
following:
(i)   Technical Assistance
Project Manager (24 man-months)

(iii) Equipment
2 four-wheel drive vehicles
2 motorcycles
Office equipment, components
Typewriters, copiers, etc.
10.      Training Centers.  Within MOW a long tradition of good quality,
well-monitored, and adquately financed training has contributed to a rather
high degree of localization of positions. Under the Fourth and Fifth
Highway Projects provisions were made to establish a training center for
mainly in-service training for lower level ministerial staff. This effort
will continue under the Infrastructure Project and a further strengthening
of the Lilongwe and Zomba centers would emphasize the practical aspects of
technical training by providing physical facilities, laboratory and
workshop equipment, and overseas training for instructors in the areas of
road materials and building materials testing, surveying, specialized
technical drawing, electrical wiring and refrigeration. In addition,
supporting facilities will be provided for office and reproduction
equipment, learning aids and hostel accommodation for trainees.
11.      For successful implementation of the proposed training component
for lower level of training, the Government has agreed to take immediate
action as follows:
(i)   identification of suitable candidates for instructor
training (diploma level in engineering) to fill established
or new posts, and
(ii) preparation of equipment lists for proposed laboratories,
workshops, the draughting room and the surveying shop.
12.      Plans for expansion of the training centers at Lilongwe and Zomba
in terms of construction are available with the exception of modification
of some existing facilities. The expansion of the training centers would
comprise the following:

Rural Transport System
A. Introduction
1.       To date, rural transport investment appraisal in developing
countries has not been geared towards meeting the transport needs of the
rural population. Indeed, very little information existed on the transport
demand of rural households. Recent investigations undertaken by the
International Labour Office in collaboration with consultants IT Transport
(UK) in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Philippines have focussed on quantifying
this demand. These studies have used the household -the productive unit-
as the basis for appraising rural transport demand, following the practice
in transport planning in urban areas and industrialized countries. The
results show that the nature of rural transport is different from what
could be inferred from the road emphasis of previous transport investments.
2.       Activities which are not conventionally defined as productive are
the primary reasons for movement in the rural areas: transport for
harvesting and marketing of crops is almost insignificant in comparison to
transport for water and fuel collection. Considerable loads are moved
around within the rural areas - survey households recorded between 100 and
210 ton-kilometres a year - and huge distances covered. Most of this is
"invisible" transport, taking place on the footpaths and tracks in and
around villages, away from the recognized road network. The vehicles in
this part of the transport system are load-carrying pedestrians.
3.       Pending investment, this part of the network has remained
rudimentary. Consequently, transport is at present consuming large amounts
of households time and energy. In Malawi, the stagnating volume of output
from the smallholder sector and the persisting low volumes of visible
traffic on the good, well-maintained secondary and district roads are cause
for the Government's concern. Given the low ownership of vehicles of any
kind and the virtual non-existence of transport services inside the rural
areas, rural households have no option but to resort to the most time-
consuming and labour-intensive means of transport: walking and headloading.
There is thus good reason to believe that the first stage in the transport
network, constituted by household transport, is where the bottleneck lies.
The Government therefore seeks to expand the scope of rural transport
planning and investment to include transport services and household
transport.
B. Rural Transport Pilot Service
4.       Taking account of the substantial demand for transport services
identified in a recent study by GOPA, consultants (Federal Republic of
Germany), the Government seeks to experiment in three areas with rural
transport services designed to carry passengers and small shipments of
goods. A detailed description of the scheme is given in Annex 13b.

C. Pilot Integrated Rural Transport Project
5.       The Government also wishes to experiment with directing investment
to improving the efficiency of household transport. This pilot project
(Annex 13c) will assess for the first time the transport demand of rural
households living in the vicinity of selected rural market centres. The
travel and transport patterns obtained will be used as a basis for planning
interventions that will reduce the time and energy rural households
currently have to spend on transport. The project will significantly
increase the availability and affordability of non-motorized wheeled
vehicles in the project areas. Ultimately, it aims to establish a rural
transport planning process in the project districts which can then be
replicated in other districts. The premise of this integrated approach to
rural transport planning is that all the components of the transport
system, vehicle ownership, transport services as well as infrastructure
require investment if there is to be adequate provision for the movement
needs of rural communities.

Infrastructure Project
Rural Motorized Transport Pilot Scheme
A. Introduction
1.       Large numbers of people living in remote rural areas of Malawi
lack adequate transport services. United Transport (Malawi) (UT(M))
provides some rural bus services but many routes with low demand are not
served at all while the service levels on other routes are infrequent.
Matola (illegal) passenger and freight services are available at times in
some places but service is often unreliable, uncomfortable for passengers
and dangerous.
2.       The development of small-scale rural transport has been inhibited
by several factors, including the high acquisition cost of vehicles and the
limited financial resources of potential owner-operators. High operating
costs on rural roads is also an unavoidable problem. Although UT(M) and
matola services have limitations, as noted above, their fares and rates
tend to be low in rural areas because of cross-subsidization and therefore,
a new independent owner-operator faces severe price competition. No
Government subsidies are available for any road transport service in
Malawi.
3.       A study of road passenger transport in Malawi was undertaken in
1986 by GOPA, consultants (Federal Republic of Germany). One of the
principal subjects investigated in the study was transport in rural areas
which were found to be seriously in short supply. In the study, the
consultants presented a proposal for a rural motorized transport pilot
scheme and this scheme is incorporated as a component of the project.
B. Objectives
4.       The main objective of the pilot scheme is to establish a highly
flexible, motorized small-scale trucking system, localized in selected
rural centers to serve surrounding catchment areas. If this initial
development proves successful, the program may subsequently be expanded.
C. Scope of the Operation
5.       Geographically, the pilot program will include all of the three
regions of Malawi and will establish operations in a particular rural area
in each region. Within each of these areas the operations will be based in
a rural center with service to be provided over a catchment area of about
40 km radius. Both passenger and small-scale cargo services will be
operated over a period of two years.

ANNEX 13b
Page 2 of 3
D. Main Activities
Selection of Pilot Areas
6.       The three pilot areas, Phalombe, Dedza, and Chitipa, have been
selected on the basis of the following criteria:
(i)   sufficient demand for service based on sizeable population
in the area;
(ii)  suitability of the area for motorized transport,
particularly a minimum network of local and feeder roads;
(iii) possible complementary linkage of services with UT(M)
services;
(iv)  agricultural potential of the area; and
(v)   possible coordination with a rural growth center scheme.
Selection of Vehicles
7.       Taking into account the nature of the market for services, the
vehicles used by UT(M) and matola operators and other considerations, GOPA
consultants have recommended that the small Bedford model TJ 340 (Jl) would
be the best vehicle available for the purpose.
Possible Routing and Frequency of Services
8.       There are numerous possibilities with regard to routing,
scheduling, number of services, complementary services with UT(M) and joint
operations. Selection of these operating features will be made primarily
on the basis of the following criteria:
(i)   five vehicles stationed in or around each of the 3 rural
centers;
(ii)  daily kilometers per vehicle not less than about 150 km but
varying somewhat with terrain;
(iii) maximum distance limited by the possibility of daily return
to center;
(iv)  linkage with UT(M)'s established services at several points
of various lines; and
(v)   avoidance of service on routes where UT(M) has basic
services, except during rainy season when UT(M) may reduce
service pilot operations.

ANNEX 13b
Page 3 of 3
Organizational Set-up
9.       One of the basic requirements of the pilot scheme is that the
vehicle owner should be the operator and that the vehicle must be stationed
in a rural center. Unless the owner-operator is individually responsible
the pilot scheme will probably fail.
10.      Notwithstanding this individual responsibility, there is much to
be gained from some kind of association among the owner-operators. For
each area, there will be need to assign one locally-based transport expert
as head of the association for on-site organization, routing, training,
monitoring and control as well as one locally-based mechanic for workshop
operations. Also, close cooperation with UT(M) in the pilot areas would be
necessary to avoid unwise competition and to optimize routing and
scheduling.
11.      The head of the association would also handle daily cash
management, at least initially.  Vehicle financing would be provided by the
Leasing and Finance Company of Malawi on the basis of a foreign-aided
revolving fund with repayments arranged over the estimated life of the
vehicle. An expatriate advisor would monitor the entire operation.
Cost Estimates
12.      For the three centers the cost has been estimated as follows:
MK '000
-     Vehicles (15 units)                                       780
-     Spare parts                                               145
-     Workshops                                                  88
-     Technical assistance (12 man-months over 3 years)         300
-     Project supervision                                       250
Total                                                  1,563

MALAWI
Infrastructure Project
Pilot Integrated Rural Transport Project
A. Introduction
1.       The transport system which the 7 million Malawians living in the
rural areas will be most familiar with is very limited in the range, speed,
and carrying capacity of its means of transport. The infrastructure
consists of a myriad of footpaths and tracks which link rural households to
the places where their daily activities are carried out and link villages
to each other and to economic and social facilities. Between 70 and 80Z of
rural transport is undertaken on this tinvisible" network. A combination
of low purchasing power and high prices ensures that few households have
access even to non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles and oxcarts. The
most frequently encountered means of transport is thus the human being.
Efficient transport services are run in and out of the rural areas by the
passenger service United Transport (Malawi) Ltd, but no services exist as
yet to meet the rural population's need to move themselves and their many
small loads (25 kg - 2 tons) over a typical range of 2 to 40 kilometers.
2.       This transport system nonetheless permits the movement of
significant numbers of people and volumes of freight comparable to those
moved on the conventional network, at however considerable cost to the
rural economy. Figures are not as yet available for Malawi, but, based on
indications from rural household transport demand surveys carried out in
other sub-Saharan countries*, rural households in Malawi are undertaking at
least 5,000,000 identifiable trips a day on the rural transport network.
The same surveys suggested that in the course of these trips, Malawian
rural households are moving in the region of 150 million ton-kilometers a
year, almost all of which will be headloaded over the first few kilometers.
The largest proportion of this freight will be made up of water, fuelwood
and harvested crops. Rural households in the aforementioned surveys
recorded total transport time budgets between 2500 and 4800 hours a year.
Eighty percent of the freight and 70 percent of the time spent is accounted
for by women. Transport,-rhus, adds to the competing demands made on their
time and energy by their other productive and reproductive
responsibilities.
3.       The human and economic cost of this inefficient transport system
is high. The time rural households are spending on transport is as
inordinate as it is unproductive. It restricts the availability of labour
for expanding, modernizing or diversifying production: only 1OZ of maize
land in Malawi is planted with high yielding varieties (in Kenya 60Z). It
absorbs unacceptable amounts of rural women's time, correlating with one of

Village Survey. Barwell and Malmberg-Calvo, ILO, 1987.

the highest incidences of infant mortality and morbidity in Sub-Saharan
Africa and with the extremely poor health status of women in rural Malawi.
The non-existence of rural transport services makes the delivery of
agricultural inputs unreliable. In many ways, transport is a severe
constraint on growth in the rural economy, borne out by the stagnation
observed in output from the smallholder sector in recent years (Economic
Report 1988).
B. Objectives
4.       The immediate objective of the project is therefore, to reduce the
time and effort households in the vicinity of selected rural centres are
spending on transport. At the end of the project the capacity will have
been created at district level to plan and implement interventions for this
purpose.
C. Scope
5.       Initially, rural market centres in 1 district in each of the three
regions will be selected. The post of District Transport Officer will be
created in each project district by the Ministry for Local Government. The
target beneficiaries of the project will be the smallholder farmers (men
and women) living within the radius of influence of the rural market
centres selected. Special consideration will be given to the target sub-
groups consisting of small-scale entrepreneurs, female-headed households
and the virtually landless (presently engaged in casual porterage). The
project activities will last three years, but the District Transport
Officer will be semi-autonomous after 2 years.
D. Main Activities
Household Transport Demand
6.       The project will permit for the first time an evaluation of the
total transport demand of households in rural Malawi. Household travel and
transport patterns will be established in a baseline survey. Following the
start of project interventions, their evolution will be monitored
continuously.  The link between increases in the capacity of the rural
transport system and agricultural productivity wifl be investigated. A
study of options for improving the provision of transport services will
also be carried out.
Increasing the Availability of Non-motorized Wheeled Vehicles
7.       The project aims to significantly increase vehicle ownership in
the project areas.  The project will make available both familiar and new
types of non-motorized vehicles: bicycles, donkeys, hand-carts, etc., and
associated load-carrying devices. The vehicles will be sold to the target
population on a hire purchase basis. The target group will form credit
groups for this purpose, as is currently done for agricultural inputs.
Different terms will apply to the different target sub-groups, and
particular attention will be paid to putting vehicles in women's hands.
Under this component, training in the manufacture, repair and maintenance
will be organized for local artisans.



- 9o -
ANNEX 13c
Page 3 of 3
Upgrading of Tracks and Trails
8.       Improvements in basic infrastructure will be necessary to permit
the widespread and efficient use of the vehicles to be introduced. The
project will establish a methodology for identifying the most important
tracks and footpaths in the project area and for undertaking community up-
grading and maintenance.
Definition of Non-transport Interventions
9.       Interventions that lie outside the scope of transport planning can
have considerable impact on transport demand. Improved water supply,
better crop storage facilities, more efficient stoves or village woodlots,
for example, can all reduce the demand for transport. From household
transport patterns and monitoring of traffic at different social and
economic facilities, it will be possible to define such interventions and
contribute to their planning.
Institution Building
10.      The District Council (Ministry of Local Government) and the
District Development Committee (Office of the President and Cabinet)
undertake development activities at district level. The Ministry of
Transport has only regional representation: no one is responsible for
organizing transport at the district level. The Ministry of Local
Government will, therefore, create the post of District Transport Officer
within the District Council. The District Transport Officer, answerable to
the Senior Engineer in the Ministry, will be responsible for planning and
implementing rural transport investments, and for providing inputs to the
broader planning process at district level. The Senior Engineer and
District Transport Officers will receive training and 2 years technical
assistance. Towards the end of the project, rural transport planning will
be an established process and periodic consultancy inputs will be provided
to assist with extending the planning process to other districts.
Selection of Project Areas
11.      The project areas will be selected so that they are representative
of different types of terrain and agricultural activity encountered in
Malawi. At least one (but not all) project district will include a Rural
Growth Centre; one will include a pilot Rural Transport Services Scheme.
The project districts will be chosen from a shortlist of districts having
manifested strong interest in the project's objectives.

Road Safety Program
A. Introduction
Road Accidents
1.       During 1986, road accidents in Malawi accounted for 537 deaths,
640 serious injuries and 1,931 lesser injuries. With approximately 30,000
registered motor vehicles, there were approximately 200 persons killed per
10,000 motor vehicles which is one of the highest accident levels in the
world. Moreover, Malawi has the highest road accident rate among the
countries in the Southern African region. Clearly, there is an urgent need
to develop an effective road safety program.
Major Problems
2.       Among the problems being experienced in Malawi with regard to road
safety are the following:
(i)    the Road Safety Board (RSB) (advisory body) lacks adequate
staff;
(ii)   the RSB is not sufficiently engaged in strategic planning
and coordination;
(iii)  the Road Safety Council (acting as secretariat to RSB)
lacks sufficient training and equipment;
(iv)   regional road safety committees are needed;
(v)    accident records are not computerized which limits analysis
and dissemination of data;
(vi)   traffic education is not yet compulsory in the schools and
is poorly adapted to children;
(vii)  road safety information is not disseminated to the general
public effectively;
(viii) lack of statistics related to accidents and lack of
training and equipment severely limit police enforcement of
traffic laws;
(ix)   vehicle inspection is inadequate, in part because of lack
of equipment;
(x)    weighbridges are not used effectively;
(xi)   few driving schools are in operation and the courses
offered are too expensive for the general public;



- 92 -
ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 5
(xii)  the road system itself constitutes a certain safety problem
and many of the danger spots have not been precisely
located; and
(xiii) shortages of ambulances and the lack of communications
equipment makes it extremely difficult to rescue accident
victims.
B. Objectives
3.       The main objective of the program is to improve the organization,
staff capabilities and equipment for undertaking road safety work thereby
reducing the deaths, injuries and property damage caused by road accidents.
C. Scope of the Program
4.       The program will be concerned with road safety throughout Malawi
and extend over a period of five years. It is divided into three phases,
the duration of the first being one year and of the others two years each.
The phased program is as follows:
Phase 1 - Reorganization of RSB and introduction of the Road
Safety Agency (formerly Road Safety Council).
- Preparation and introduction of amendments to present
legislation.
- Initiation of Road Safety Project with expatriate staff.
Phase 2 - Implementation of legislation and road safety measures.
- Training of road safety staff and other key personnel.
Phase 3 - Follow-Up activities and current road safety work.
- Evaluation of road safety measures.
- Proposal of follow-up activities.
- Gradual withdrawal of expatriate staff.
D. Main Activities
5.       The main activities of the road safety program will be as follows:
Planning and Programming
The main tasks of RSB would be to compile current information about the
road safety situation in Malawi, to develop strategies and to make short
and long term plans for the national road safety work, to analyse the road
safety activities within the different government bodies. The Board would
normally meet three or four times a year, and all preparations would be
made by the Road Safety Agency.



- 93 -
ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 5
In addition to the current planning activities, the Road Safety Agency
would develop a handbook on road safety work.
Accident Analysis and Research
One of the key tasks during phase 1 will be to develop new procedures for
accident recording, transfer of accident data and data analysis. A system
for the region has been presented in the report "Accident Recording Systems
in Southern Africa", (Vaaje 1987); the proposals will have to be adapted
for use in Malawi. Training programs and computer facilities will be
developed. Computer facilities may be used jointly for accident data,
vehicle register and driving license register.
Initial black spot analysis will be based on existing police data on
accidents until a new system for future black spot analysis based on the
revised comprehensive accident recording system has been developed.
Information and Education
This activity would be carried out with the cooperation of the Ministry of
Education. An important step would be to introduce road safety into the
curriculum of primary schools, and of the teacher training colleges.
Training materials would be adapted to local conditions and to the learning
capacity of children in different age groups.
The regional Road Safety Secretariats will be mainly concerned with the
dissemination of information, and the regional Road Safety Officers would
be trained for that work. The cooperation between Road Safety Officers and
local police will be emphasized.
Driver Training
Improvements of driver training will be undertaken. Draft legislation for
such a training system has been prepared by SATCC. It may be recommended
that driver training courses become compulsory. Recommendations will also
be developed concerning possible introduction of requirements as to
'vehicle construction' and "life saving first aid' for the candidates.
Driver instructors and driver examiners will receive formal training and
the first aid courses will be coordinated with the Ministry of Health, the
Red Cross and the World Health Organization.
Law Enforcement
Amendments to present legislation are required, in particular to deal with
the problems of drunk driving, excessive speed, and control procedures and
sanctions related to such violations. Equipment and training will be made
available to the traffic police. Concerning drunk driving, a pilot study
would be carried out in Lilongwe and Blantyre in cooperation with the
Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe; for this study, blood testing
equipment will be procured. The Road Traffic Act is presently being
revised and the work is based on a draft proposal prepared by SATCC.

ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 5
Vehicle Testing and Control
Considerable time will be devoted to establishing a comprehensive testing
and control system with the proposed 7 vehicle testing stations. See the
report 'Motor Vehicle Testing in Southern Africa" (Filseth 1987). However,
in the short term, the vehicle testing stations in Blantyre and Lilongwe
would be properly equipped.
Legislation and manpower would be provided to permit the Road Traffic
Commissioner to operate an independent Vehicle Testing Group for vehicle
control on the road. Manpower training is also to be implemented.
Updated registers for vehicle registration and driving license registration
and new administrative routines for this work will be developed. Access to
computer facilities would be sought for this purpose, independently or in
combination with the accident analysis unit within the Road Safety Agency.
Road Infrastructure and Environment
Black spot improvement which has proved to be a highly cost-effective
measure for accident prevention would start as soon as the first analysis
of existing accident data has been carried out. Analysis will be
undertaken of accidents in the major towns and for parts of the road
network which are known to be dangerous. In the future this activity would
be one of the normal tasks of the Roads Department within MOW. Road
construction and road maintenance would also take into account the accident
situation on different parts of the road network. Manuals on road traffic
planning with respect to accident prevention would be developed both for
urban and rural areas.
Control of Overloading
Overloading of vehicles, a problem in all countries in the region, in
particular on the mountainous parts of the road network, will be analyzed.
Heavy overloading is often associated with poor braking systems, and this
problem will receive special attention. Proposed legislation for a control
system has been prepared by SATCC and the feasibility of such legislation
for Malawi will be reviewed.
E. Manpower Requirements
6.       Short-term consultants will be engaged to assist the Road Safety
Agency, the Road Traffic Commissioner, and the Traffic Police. One full-
time expert will assist the Executive Road Safety Officer in coordinating
the safety work. The requirements have been estimated as follows:

Mlunguzi river on Zomba Plateau, where there is a small reservoir providing
some storage for the dry season. To provide sufficient water for the
period to 1995 a new dam will be required on the Mlunguzi river as follows:

Meets water requirements to year 2005.
B. Waterworks
Mzuzu
4.       The existing water intake will be replaced by a new one at the
planned reservoir. The raw water pumping facilities will be replaced by
gravity supply to waterworks and the low-lift pumping stage to the
treatment plant will be replaced by gravity supply from the new Lunyangwa
dam.
Kasungu
5.       Raising the Chitete dam will require the relocation of the
waterworks approximately 100 m downstream and the provision of a new raw
water intake. The existing raw water pumping will no longer be required
because of the increased height of the dam, and therefore, raw water
pumping will be replaced by gravity supply.
Zomba
6.       The Mlunguzi river intake will be abandoned as the water supply
system will be supplied directly by the existing pipeline/penstock having
its intake at the Mlunguzi reservoir. The existing gravity supply to
waterworks (no raw water pumping) will be maintained.
C. Distribution Systems
Mzuzu
7.       The existing main pumping station consists of two plants, one in
the Old Works and the other in the New Works. To meet future water demand,
the discharge capacities of the main pumping station need to be raised by
increasing the capacity of the existing plant and installing an additional
plant.
Kasungu
8.       The construction of new waterworks in Kasungu will require the
building of a new main pumping station.  The two existing booster pumping
stations would remain in use.

Zomba
9.       Future distribution of treated water in Zomba will continue to be
by gravity.
Mponela
10.      Existing source of supply is ground water from four boreholes.
Average daily production is 385 m  meeting about 60Z of estimated average
demand. The water is chlorinated prior to distribution by gravity. The
reticulation has a total of about 10,800 m of PVC and galvanized iron pipes
ranging in size from 25mm to 100mm in addition to 3,550 m of PVC
transmission mains. Three pressed steel ground level tanks with a combined
capacity of 217 m3 provide storage which covers over 12 hours of average
supply. The 1987 population of 5600 is expected to increase to 8380 by
1995, about 80X of whom would have access to water service compared with
the 60X served presently.
11.      The facilities under the project would include: (i) 5 additional
boreholes increasing average daily production to 900 m3 which is expected
to meet 80X of the projected 1995 average demand; (ii) a 150 m3 reinforced
concrete ground level tank to replace the existing 79 m3 and 38 m3 pressed
steel tanks; and (iii) about 4,250 m of distribution pipes together with
1,500 m of transmission main. Except for chlorination, there would be no
treatment. The estimated cost of these facilities in mid 1988 prices is MK
1,200,000.
Mangochi
12.      The 1987 population of Mangochi was 15,330, 7500 or 49% of whom
were served by the public water supply system. The projected 1995
population is 20,185 and it is intended that service be extended to about
80 .
13.      The source of raw water is the Shire River.  Production in 1987
averaged 860 m3/d and average consumption was 690 m3/d. Production in 1995
is projected to be 2,765 m3/d with consumption at 2,300 m3Id.
14.      Treatment consists of pressure filtration and chlorination.  The
raw water is pumped to the treatment plant where it is filtered through the
two pressure filters each with capacity of 18.1 m3/hr. The filtered water
is chlorinated and distributed by gravity. Two elevated, pressed steel
tanks, 205 m3 in total capacity, provide storage for the system. Under the
project, a new intake structure will be provided together with two new
pressure filters with a combined capacity of 115.2 m3/hr to replace the
existing filters; the chlorination system will be refurbished and about
5,350 m of transmission and distribution pipes ranging in diameter from 100
mm to 200 mm laid in addition to two ground level reinforced concrete
blockwork tanks, capacity 398 m3 each, and one 95 m3 pressed steel elevated
tank which together provide about 12 hours of storage. The estimated cost
of these facilities under the project is MK 1.1 million in mid 1988.

Ntcheu
15.      Ntcheu is a district and main market center situated about 160 km
southeast of Lilongwe. The 1987 population of 5800 is projected to reach
9430 by 1995. About 3200 persons or 55Z of the population had access to
public water in 1987. By 1995, the fraction receiving public water service
is expected to be 80Z. Water production in 1987 was 225 m3/d on average
and consumption was estimated to be 210 m3/d.
16.      Raw water is obtained from the Mpamadzi and Mariko streams and
supplemented with water from a borehole equipped with a diesel driven pump.
A 100 mm pipeline transports the raw water by gravity to a 114 m3 ground
level concrete tank some 3 km away. The water is chlorinated at the tank
and distributed by gravity. The distribution system contains about 3,640 m
of asbestos cement and galvanized iron pipes in diameters of 50 mm and 75
mm. The system also has other ground level tanks -- a 150 m3 concrete and
two 22.5 mi corrugated iron tanks.
17.      To meet projected future water demands and to ensure the safe
quality of the water produced, an additional intake on the Ndeka River
together with facilities for the treatment of the raw water will be
provided under the project. The treatment facilities would include
receiving well, aerator, mixing basin, flocculator, two horizontal flow
sedimentation units each 2.6 x 9.5 m in area; two rapid gravity filtration
units each 4x4 m2 in area and injection chlorinators. The treated water,
total output 40 m3/hr, would be distributed by gravity. A total of 2,470 m
of 100 mm PVC and 450 m of ductile iron pipe, 100 mm in diameter would be
added to the distribution system together with 5,000 m of PVC and 200 m of
ductile iron main both of 200 mm diameter for raw water. No additional
storage facilities will be provided under the project. The estimated cost
of the facilities to be provided under the project in mid 1988 prices is
MK 1.72 million.
Karonga
18.      The 1987 census put the population of Karonga at 19,630.  It is
projected to reach 27,280 by 1995. Only about 40X of the population had
access to public water supplies in 1987. By 1995, and as a result of the
proposed project, the population served with public water is expected to
increase to 80X.
19.      The source of raw water for Karonga is the North Rukuru River.
The raw water is pumped to the treatment plant where it is clarified by
sedimentation through a vertical flow clarifier (6.4x6.4m) and by
filtration through rapid gravity sand filters (2 units each 3x3 m2 in area)
and chlorinated prior to storage in a 268 m3 ground level tank and two
elevated pressed steel tanks of 145 m3 and 95 m3. The treated water is
transmitted by gravity by a 150 mm diameter PVC pipe, 2,300 long to the
distribution system which comprises 15,380 m of PVC pipe ranging in
diameter from 40 mm to 150 mm and galvanized iron pipes from 2 inch to 4
inch diameter.

ANNEX 15
Page 5 of 5
20.      Facilities to be provided under the project will double the
capacity of the existing plant and will include:
- a new intake well 2.8 m diameter by 8 m deep together with 4
submersible pumps each capable of pumping 100 ms/h;
- a 200 mm diameter PVC raw water pumping main, 2,400 m in
length;
- 6.4 m x 6.4 m vertical flow sedimentation basin capable of
producing 70 m3/h;
- 2 rapid gravity sand filter each 3x3 m2 in area and rated at 45
m3/h/unit;
- 11,700 m of PVC distribution pipes varying in diameter from 90
mm to 250 mm;
- a 268 m3 ground level brickwork tank.
The estimated cost of these additions in mid 1988 prices is MK 1.2 million.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
A. General
1.       The following rates of inflation were assumed in the financial
projections for DWSF.
Year        Local        Foreign
%            z
1988/89       15.0          5.3
1989/90       10.0          5.3
1990/91         7.5         4.1
1991/92        5.0          4.1
1992/93 and
beyond       5.0 p.a.    4.1 p.a.
B. Income Statement
2.       The forecasts assume that the tariff for standpost water would
increase by only half the local inflation rate because of Government's
requirements to provide water to this group at a minimum cost. Other
income agency fees, reconnection fees, meter testing fees, etc., have been
adjusted for local inflation and based on past experience. The tariff for
retail water has been set to meet the financial covenant, i. e., revenues
each year should be sufficient to meet all operating costs, depreciation or
debt service, whichever is higher, and working capital increases.
3.       Connection charges are assumed to grow by the local inflation
rate. Revenues from connections have been calculated as the product of the
connection charge and the number of connections projected to be installed
each year.
4.       Salaries and wages are based on current staffing levels of 1,005
adjusted for growth in production and inflation. Administration costs have
been assumed as a proportion of salaries. Fuel and chemical costs have
been projected on the basis of increased water production and adjusted for
inflation. Maintenance has been assumed as a proportion of gross fixed
assets but since most of DWSF assets would be brand-new, this proportion
has been reduced for the years immediately after construction is completed.
Depreciation has been calculated at only 3Z of gross fixed assets due to
the newness of most of the assets and since a substantial part of the new
investments are in dams.

Annex 17
Page 2 of 2
C. Balance Sheet and Sources and Application of Funds
5.       Accounts receivable presently stand at about 4.7 months of
revenues. These have been projected to be gradually reduced to about 3
months revenues. Inventories have been projected at about 40Z of
maintenance costs.
6.       Accounts payable presently stand at about half of total operating
expenditures. This has been projected to be gradually reduced to about a
third of operating expenditures.
7.       It is assumed that the Government loan has been converted to
equity, and that the existing AfDF loan will be carried at the same value
as it appears in DWSF accounts. Since Government will not allow the
revaluation of loans to reflect the devaluation of the kwacha, the
projection is based on the historical figure.
