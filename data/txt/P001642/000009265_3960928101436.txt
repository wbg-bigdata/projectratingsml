MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO MALAWI
FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Malawi in the amount of SDR 22.3 million (US$28.8
million equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance an infrastructure
project.  TLe project would be cofinanced by AfDF, DANIDA, EDF, JICA, KfW,
GTZ, ODA, UNCDF, UNDP, and USAID, with amounts as indicated on the
preceding page.
2.       Background.  Throughout the 19809, Malawi has experienced
significant economic difficulties caused by external shocks and internal
factors, among these the closure of traditional transport routes and influx
of large numbers of refugees. The difficult economic situation has placed
considerable pressure on the public sector, with resultant growth in the
public deficit. These developments have been accompanied by a serious
deterioration of infrastructure, an outcome of management weaknesses and
underfunding of infrastructure maintenance. This decline has forced
productive enterprises to absorb higher costs, in turn lowering
productivity and export potential. Government's Development Policies
explicitly recognize the problem of providing the infrastructure necessary
for economic development, while at the same time restoring fiscal
discipline in line with its continuing program of structural adjustment.
Accordingly, the sector policy fncuses on improving efficiency and
sustainability, the latter through sound fiscal policies, increasing
allocations to maintenance and recurrent expenditures and minimizing new
investment.
3.       The Bank Group has assisted with implementation of the sector
policy through its ongoing association with the Roads Department of the
Ministry of Works (MOW). Previous projects in the road sector financed
improvements in the road network, in particular the main north-south road
that contributed to the integration of the country. More recent projects
shifted the Bank's focus to rehabilitation and maintenance through
introduction of a maintenance management system and technical assitance to
the Roads Department. Although progress haf been made, ongoing problems
with maintenance and scarce resources mandate further improvement in the
efficiency and decision-making of that depariment. In the water subsector,
the Bank Group has worked successfully with the Lilongwe and Blantyre Water
Boards to establish sound fiscal management and cost recovery. The project
would extend these improvements to the District Water Supply Fund (DWSF)
and thereby to the management of water systems in seven smaller urban areas
that presently operate at a deficit. In the rural areas a large proportion
of ' ireholes are not operating efficiently, and Government's policy is to
rehaoilitate these boreholes and introduce a self-help scheme for



-2-
maintenance. The Bank Group has not previously assisted in the maintenance
of public buildings, but t7ae deteriorated state of these buildings shows a
pressing need for improved maintenance and management. As management
problems pervade all subsectors, the project would implement the
recommendations of a recent IDA-financed comprehensive management study for
further improvements in MOW's direction and management control,
organizational structure, development of human resources, and provision of
adequate financial and material resources to carry through planned
programs. Other issues requiring resolution are the slow pace of
localization of key MOW positions and the need to stimulate development of
the local construction industry. Further, to reinforce the emphasis on
maintenance, the project would require annual review of MOW budgets prior
to their adoption. With major investments planned for DWSF, a set of
financial covenants also would be needed to ensure sound fiscal management
of DWSF.
4.       Several cofinanciers for this project, AfDF, EDF, KfW, and ODA,
have been regular supporters of the road sector since the late 1960s -
early 1970s. During the 1970s, USAID also financed some major road works.
In addition to IDA, contributors to the water supply sector over the last
about 10 years have been AfDB, DANIDA, USAID, KfW, Canada, EECIEDF, Japan,
and UNICEF. Finance for public buildings, particularly for education,
agriculture and health, has been provided by USAID, EEC/EDF, AfDF, and ODA,
as well as IDA. Many other agencies have contributed on a more moderate
scale to the development of the three sectors over the last several years,
financing not only civil works, but also technical assistance and training.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of IDA's country and sector assistance strategy. IDA's participation in
the project would help to ensure that public works programs and related
policy changes recommended by the Association in the recent past are
implemented and that further improvements in strategy, policy formulation
and institution-building are pursued.
6.       Project Obiectives.  The main objectives of the project are to
(i) strengthen the capability of MOW to carry out effective maintenance of
public facilities; (ii) restore the physical condition of selected main and
secondary roads, to facilitate the movement of traffic and lower transport
costs; (iii) expand the existing system of district roads, to provide
improved access for many additional rural people; (iv) expand the potable
water supply for selected urbat centers and rural areas; and (v)
rehabilitate high-priority hospitals, schools and other important public
buildings so that they contribute more efficiently and effectively to the
provision of public services.
7.       Project Description.  The project under consideration would cover
MOW's activities for management improvement and training as well as
maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction works over a four-year period



-3-
from fiscal year 1989/90 through 1992/93. The project would thus consist
of four main components: (i) MOW management improvement program (US$9.4
million); (ii) roads component (US$99.5 million); (iii) water supply
component (US$39.8 million); and (iv) public buildings (US$9.0 million).
The above costs include an advance from the Project Preparation Facility of
US$1.5 million, which will also be financed under the project. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Sch:Aule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and the categories of disbursement are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in N4Iawi are given in Schedules C and D.
respectively. A map, IBRD No. 21225, is also attached.
8.       Riparian Matters.  The project includes construction of two new
dams and raising of an existing dam by about 4.5 m. Two of the rivers to
be dammed drain into Lake Malawi, an international body of water, bordered
by Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania, and the third into Lake Chilwa,
bordered by Malawi and Mozambique. Both Mozambique and Tanzania have
advised Malawi that they have no objection to the proposed damming of the
rivers in question.
9.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the following main
agreements were reached with the Government: (i) MOW will implement the
agreed upon MOW localization plan; (ii) the Government shall consult with
the Association on any new investment to be made in the infrastructure
sector in each year of project implementation; (iii) the Association will
review annually the adequacy of MOW's maintenance programs and budget
allocations prior to the adoption of the annual budgets; (iv) MOW will by
June 1990 prepare an action program for development of the local
construction industry; (v) MOW will by December 1990 establish separate
accounting arrangements for the water supply schemes of Zomba, Mzuzu, and
Kasungu; and (vi) the Government will ensure that, in each year of project
implementation, DWSF generates total revenues at a level sufficient to: (a)
not later than the end of FY 1991192 cover DWSF's expenses for operation
and maintenance, and depreciation or debt service requirements, whichever
is higher; (b) not later than the end of FY 1993/94 generate positive net
income after allowing for DWSF's expenses for operation and maintenance,
depreciation, interest, and other charges on debt; and (c) maintain a
current ratio of not less than 1.4. The Government agreed that the
following would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit: (i) all donor
agreements for subprojects to begin implementation during FY 1989/90 have
been signed; and (ii) the Government has received firm commitments from
donors to finance subprojects to begin implementation during FY 1990/91.
10.      Benefits.  Extensive benefits are expected from the strengthened
management capabilities of MOW. The road rehabilitation, upgrading and
resealing components will improve road conditions, and thereby reduce
transport costs, enhance the reliability of transport and prevent
progressive road deterioration. The extension and improvement of DRDIMP
roads will afford rural populations better access to markets, supplies and



-4-
public services.   The improved rural transport scheme will help to
stimulate economic development in the rural areas. The urban water supply
component will expand the capacity of seven town systems to meet the
rapidly growing demand, as well as strengthen the institutional capacity of
DWSF and facilitate cost recovery for the larger systems. The
rehabilitation of boreholes and construction of gravity-fed schemes w.11
increase the water supply in rural areas and will also assist in meeting
the needs of the refugees. The rehabilitation of public buildings will
improve their utility, reduce maintenance costs and avoid the high cost of
premature reconstruction. The road maintenance and improvement component
is expected to have an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 172, bridge
reconstruction an ERR of at least 502, DRIMP road expansion and
improvements an ERR of not less than 122, urban water supply an ERR of 62,
borehole rehabilitation an  ERR of 20?, and public buildings an ERR of 292.
11.      Risks.  A principal risk is the possibility that the Government's
financial allocations for maintenarie of infrastructure facilities may be
inadequate. The Government's commitment to this project, which helps to
implement key development policies, should minimize this risk. For urban
water supply, a possible risk is that DWSF will not be able to generate
sufficient revenues due to the Government's inability to authorize
necessary tariff increases. However, the Government has recently (April 1,
1989) taken steps to improve the financial standing of DWSF through its
tariff increase of 20Z, an increase in line with financial targets
specified in the financial plan.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
