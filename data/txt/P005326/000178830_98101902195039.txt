INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF LEBANON
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Lebanon for the equivalent of $33.0 million to help
finance construction of the Tabarja-Tripoli expressway together with main-
tenance facilities, feasibility studies and detailed engineering of other
high priority highways, and a highway organization and maintenance study.
The loan would have a term of 25 years, including four years of grace, with
interest at 7.25% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A "Memorandum on Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Lebanon" (EME-26a) has been distributed to the Executive Directors in
September 1970. An economic mission visited Lebanon in October 1972 and
is currently preparing its report. Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.        Lebanon's economic system is essentially an open, free-trade system,
in which the private sector plays the major role and government policy aims
primarily at ensuring fiscal and monetary stability. In the Middle East
setting, this and the absolute freedom of exchange and capital transfer have
particularly helped in making the country the most important financial and
entrepot centre in the region, attracting substantial foreign capital, and
creating opportunities for various financial and trade services. This role
has been supported by the country's attraction as a tourist centre, the
relatively high level of education and the general atmosphere of religious
and political freedom, safeguarded by constitutional rule and a Parliamentary
system of government. The Government has sought to encourage private enterprise
in agriculture and industry by policies that aim at stabilizing prices of
agricultural products and that provide incentives to promote private invest-
ment in industry.
4.        The services sector includes banking, real estate, tourism, educa-
tional and health services, transport, commerce and transit trade, and accounts
at present for almost two-thirds of gross domestic product. Commerce alone
contributes 31% of GDP. The banking system developed rapidly in the 1950's
and up to 1966 under a systen of virtually complete freedom. However, severe
competition for deposits among banks, over-extension of investments, and low
liquidity led to a banking crisis toward the end of 1966 and was followed by
the introduction of banking controls. A rapid growth in commercial bank
deposits since then, together with a lag in the extension of domestic credits
has created excess liquidity.



- 2 -
5.        The other major sectors are agriculture, industry and construction.
The contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined from 12% in 1964 to 8%
in 1971 in spite of improved production technologies, due to constraints on
growth imposed by the limited area of arable land and by the incomplete
harnessing of rivers. Fruits and vegetables are major crops and are exported,
mainly to neighboring countries. Industry accounts for about 16% of GDP,
and is primarily concentrated in such light industries as food processing,
textiles, and construction materials. In recent years, industrial production
increased about 8% annually, and exports rose by about 30% annually. Con-
struction accounts for about 5% of GDP. It grew rapidly with investment,
partially foreign, in office buildings, housing, and hotels.
6.        In the decade ending in 1966, the Lebanese economy grew at over 6%
annually in real terms. However, between 1967-70 a slowdown was brought about
by the banking crisis and the 1967 war in the M-liddle East. As a result, real
growth in GDP averaged about 3% per year. The formation of a coalition Gov-
ernment in November 1969 ended an eight months' period of political crisis,
and together with the partial abatement of tensions in the region and higher
oil income in the Middle East, restored confidence and encouraged capital
inflows, mainly from Arab oil-producing countries and from Lebanese emigrants.
An economic recovery took p:Lace in 1971, particularly in tourism, industry
and construction.   GDP, in real terms, grew over 7% in 1971 and appears to
have maintained this rate in 1972. Following a decline in investment between
1965 and 1968 (from 22% to '17% of GNP), the investment rate increased to 19%
of GNP in both 1970 and 1971. The private sector accounted for about 80% of
the total. National savings which accounted for 13% of GNP in 1965 rose to
14.5% of GNP in 1971.
7.        The public sector in Lebanon has a somewhat limited role, and its
relative importance has not increased in recent years. In the three years
1969-1971 total expenditures of government (including annexed and autonomous
budgets) were equal to 20% of the GDP, while capital expenditures were about
3% of GDP. The Central Government's revenues have risen by about 6% per year
from 1966 to 1970. However,, while Central Government's current expenditures
increased substantially, its capital outlays decreased slightly. Defense
expenditures represent about: 3% of GDP and expenditures on education, health
and social affairs amount to about 4%. The Governrment's consolidated current
budget has consistently shown a surplus which averaged about L.L. 100 million
a year, covering about two-1:hirds of its capital expenditure.
S.         Lebanon's balance of payments is characterized by high imports and
a large trade deficit. This deficit, however, is more than offset by a sur-
plus on services, particularly receipts from tourism and transportation, net
investment income and royalties from oil transit rights, a large but volatile
inflow of short-term capital, and relatively small inflows of long-term capital
and remittances from Lebanese working abroad.    As a result, Lebanon's balance
of payments has been almost always in surplus and this is reflected in the
growth of foreign exchange reserves and net foreign assets of the commercial
banks. Net foreign assets grew by 26% in 1970, 33% in 1971 and 25% in 1972
when they reached L.L. 4 billion (US$1.4 billion), equivalent to twenty
months of imports.



- 3 -
9.        Development planning in Lebanon has concerned itself with an indi-
cative investment program for the public sector. It was initiated with the
1958 plan, which was only partially implemented and was followed by the 1964
plan, which was interrupted by the 1967 war. In 1972 the Government adopted
a six-year plan (1972-77) which includes a public sector investment program
of L.L. 1,740 million, accompanied by indications of the direction and size
of private investment, estimated at L.L. 5,460 million. The main aims of the
Plan are: to maintain the country's 7% real annual growth rate, to improve
further the distribution of income and education, to maintain a high rate of
employment, to encourage the balanced development of the different regions of
the country, and to diversify the econo.ny so as to reduce its heavy dependence
on trade and services by modernizing agriculture and encouraging industrializa-
tion. Of the total public investment 21% has been allocated to transport and
communications, 20% to health and other social services, 15% to agriculture
and irrigation, 14% to education, and 10% to electricity and power.
10.       The public development expenditures envisaged by the plan average
L.L. 290 million (US$97 million) a year, while past annual investments have
usually been under L.L. 200 million, showing a slight decline from L.L. 185
million (US$62 million) in 1969 to L.L. 175 million (US$58 million) in 1971.
Administrative efficiency and coordination have been some of the constraints
to an accelerated rate of development expenditures in the past and would have
to be considerably improved in the future to prepare projects and implement
the higher level of public investment. Nevertheless, given the dyna.mism and
size of the private sector, and assuming no serious outbreak of hostilities
in the region, the achievement of the Plan's growth target could be feasible.
Public investmenits are to be financed mainly from surpluses in the budget
of the Central Government and the autonomous agencies. The Plan also envisages
a moderate level of medium and long-term public borrcwing, both local and
foreign.
11.       A high rate of population growth -   about 2.5% per year -- and of
internal migration have created urban congestion, particularly in Beirut.
As a result, the urtan infrastructure such as the water supply and sewerage
systems and roads, particularly in Beirut, have been overstrained, and
attention is needed if such strain is not to affect tourism and business
services, as well as living conditions. This is to be met by The Plan's
objective of a balanced sectoral and regional development which requires an
acceleration in the development of infrastructure and social services, parti-
cularly in transportation, education and utilities.
12.       Total external uebt outstanding at the end of 1971 was US$73 mil-
lion of which about US$10 iiillion was undisbursed.  Debt service payments
were estimated at US$10.1 million in 1971, equal to 1.6% of exports of goods
and net non-factor services. This is a reflection of conservative policies
of the Government regarding foreign borrowing and also past difficulties of
obtaining abroad needed long-term funds for use in its infrastructure program.
The debt service is low, and the country's debt-servicing record is good.
Lebanon is creditworthy for borrowing substantial amounts on conventional
terms.



- 4 -
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LEBANON
13.       The Bank has so far made two loans to Lebanon totalling US$33.6
million equivalent for power development and education. $$21.1 million was
outstanding on February 28, 1973. The education loan for $6.6 million was
signed on January 24, 1973, but it has not yet been declared effective.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as
of February 28, 1973, and notes on the execution of the on-going education
project.
14.       Since independence in 1946, the Government has consistently pur-
sued a conservative financial policy and, until recently, was reluctant to
incur foreign debt. Consequently, public investment was kept within the
limits set by budget considerations. The drop in the annual current budget
surplus in recent years entailed a decline in investment in the public sec-
tor. The delay in the present highways project which the Bank has been con-
sidering since 1963/69 was one of the consequences of these factors. However,
with the restoration recently of a healthy economic climate and internal po-
litical stability, particularly after the 1972 elections, the Government is
giving more attention to public sector investment, to be financed partly from
domestic sources which are IIow more readily available from internal borrowing
and budget surpluses, and partly from long-term foreign borrowing, including
Bank loans. Lebanon is also a lender to the Bank and in mid-January 33 com-
mercial banks operating in Lebanon subscribed to a private placement of
Lebanese Pounds 75 million (US$24.9 million) of 6-7/8% Bonds due in 1978.
15.       With this change in circumstances, the main focus of the Bank's
activity in Lebanon would be to participate in projects that serve to improve
income distribution and reduce disparities between the urban and rural popula-
tion, and in much needed infrastructure and social services investments. Most
of these are included in the Six Year Plan and are essential for the growth
of private investments in the productive sectors. The Bank would provide
long-term funds, now in particularly short supply. We would encourage the
Government to make much needed long-ternm infrastructure investments, and we
would also support their efforts to improve institutional arrangements for
mobilizing long-term local lunds needed to achieve the Plan's public invest-
ment targets. Through its involvement in projects in social services and
infrastructure sectors -- such as highways -- the Bank would also contribute
to improving the present techniques used for project preparation, evaluation
and implementation, thereby enhancing the capacity of the administrative
machinery to handle more efficiently the comparatively larger volume of public
investments contained in the 1972-77 Plan.
16.       The Bank has no other loan planned in FY73.   The South Beqa'a Ir-
rigation Project is under consideration for FY74; it consists of a 23,000
hectare sprinkler irrigation scheme in an advanced agricultural area in the
Upper Litani Valley in Central Lebanon. It would irrigate a greater area
than exists at present, ensure a more certain water supply (based in part
on a dam financed by the Bank under the 1955 Litani power project - Loan LE-129)
and malce possible an increase in cropping intensities.



- 5 -
17.       Given the predominant role of the private sector in the Lebanese
economy, and in the absence of sufficient local sources of long-term capital,
considerable interest has been shown in IFC financing in recent years. During
1971 IFC received proposals for a number of projects and approved its first two
investments in the country. IFC's $0.93 million loan to Filitex SAL was ap-
proved in April 1971 to finance a $2.4 million cotton spinning mill; in June
1971, IFG approved a loan of $1.2 million to the Lebanese Ceramic Industries
Co. SAL for a $2.2 million project to modernize and expand the company's wall
tiles manufacturing facilities.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN LEBANON
18.       The major part of Lebanon's population and economic activity is
located along the coast in and around the capital, Beirut, which is also the
site of the biggest harbor in the country and its only civilian airport. Most
transport along the coast, as well as the important transit traffic originates
in or is destined for Beirut. The main domestic transport arteries are the
north-south corridor along the coast and the east-west corridor between Beirut
and the Syrian border which also serves transport to and from Syria, Jordan and
Iraq. Both corridors are served by road and rail. The small size of the coun-
try leaves no scope for internal air transport, there are no navigable rivers,
and coastal shipping is negligible.
19.       Lebanon has two main ports, Beirut and Tripoli, of which the former
is by far the more important. Total freight traffic at Beirut, exclusive of
oil, increased by 5.8% per annum during the last decade and amounted to three
million tons in 1970. About 30% of this total represents transit traffic
which has increased markedly since the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967.
Beirut also has Lebanon's only civil airport which is one of the most important
in the Ifiddle East. Two important oil pipelines terminate in Lebanon, one at
Tripoli from Iraq, and the other near Saida from Saudi Arabia.
20.       The railway network is small (413 km), divided in three separate
systems using two different gauges, in poor condition and has declined
steadily in importance. Since the railway operates with a large deficit,
the Government has initiated studies to determine the nature of the problem
and whether operations can be made more viable. Assurances were received
that the Government will keep us informed on the progress of the railway
studies. They have asked the Bank to review the studies' conclusions and
recommendations, once they are completed.
21.       Planning in the transport sector is carried out by the various
agencies responsible for the different modes.   Until recently, investment
decisions were made on an ad hoc basis. During the last five years, however,
a number of highway projects have been subject to technical and economic
feasibility studies in consultation with the Bank; and a study to determine
the future development of the port of Beirut is about to begin. In the past,
there was little coordination between agencies concerned with planning of



- 6 -
investments in transport infrastructure and with- urban development. The
Government is paying increasing attention to the need for adequate planning
and coordination as traffic volumes and urbanization increase rapidly, and
large investments are required in transport infrastructure.
22.       Highways are the main mode of transport.   The length of the highway
network is about 7,100 kin, of which about 5,800 km are paved. About 2,000 km
are classified as international and primary roads, and the remainder as
secondary and local. The north-south coastal highway and the east-west
Beirut-Syrian border highway with its northern branch through the Beqa'a
Valley are the trunk roads of the highway network. More than 80% of the
highway network consists of two-lane bituminous paved roads, many of them
developed from tracks with only a few engineered improvements. They are
usually narrow and winding, with steep grades in the mountainous areas where
landslides, rockfalls and snow in the winter frequently interrupt traffic.
Along the coast, roads are subject to periodic flooding and poor drainage.
Wayside encumbrances and poor signalling further limit the capacity of some
important road sections. Reconstruction to higher standards of part of the
primary road system is required, but most of the remaining highway network
could be substantially improved through better maintenance and relatively
minor betterment works.
23.       Between 1961 and 1971 the vehicle fleet increased at an average
annual growth rate of 9.5%. The number of passenger cars has increased most
rapidly, and now represents 89% of the total fleet. Trucks account for 10%
and buses for 1% of the vehicle fleet. Gasoline consumption has increased
at a rate of 11.6% annually from 1961 to 1971, in line with the growth of
private cars and taxis over this period.
24.       Responsibility for construction and maintenance of highways is
shared by the Directorate General of Highways and Buildings (DGHB) and the
Conseil Executif des Grands Projets (CEGP). The DGHB is one of the General
Directorates of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), whereas
CEGP is a semi-autonomous agency under the supervision of the Minister of
Public Works and Transport. The CEGP is concerned with administration and
control of major construction projects which are assigned to it by the
Council of Ministers. It was created as a specialized agency for particularly
large projects which could --- by operating outside the civil service structure
-- employ qualified professional personnel at competitive salaries. It has
a staff of about 20 engineers and employs consultants for most design and
supervision work. Projects under its responsibility have been properly
executed.
25.       Except for the major projects assigned to the CEGP, responsibility
for planning, design and maintenance of highways is entrusted to the DGHB.
The DGHB is divided into two directorates, one for buildings and one for
highways. The Directorate of Highways (Dli) has divisions for highway planning
and programming, engineering, construction, maintenance, highway safety and
a highway laboratory. Low salaries and lack of opportunity to participate
in the important works reserved for the CEGP prejudice the recruitment and



- 7 -
retention of capable professionals in the DH, which has therefore been unable
to carry out its duties efficiently. This problem will be reviewed by
consultants under the proposed highway organization and maintenance study
(see paragraph 34 below).
26.       The Government's Development Plan (1972-77) envisages a total in-
vestment of LL 350 million in the transport sector, or about 20% of total
proposed public investments over the plan period. Of this total, LL 250
million have been earmarked for improving the most congested parts of the
highway network.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       In 1967, the Government of Lebanon asked the Bank to participate
in the financing of a highway project. The project was appraised in 1968
but was not carried beyond that stage because the Government could not, under
the circumstances then prevailing, provide the necessary local funds. In
early 1972 the Government informed the Bank that this problem had been over-
come and a project preparation mission visited the country in July 1972. The
project was appraised in September and negotiations were held in Washington
in March 1973. The Lebanese delegation was headed by lIr. Fouad Naffah,
IMinister of Finance.
28.       The main purpose of the proposed project, which would be the first
lending by the Bank Group in the transportation sector in Lebanon, is: to
increase the capacity of the most congested sections of the existing coastal
highway; to carry out economic and technical studies of high priority high-
way projects which could be suitable for future Bank financing; and to carry
out studies to identify necessary institutional improvements in the transport
sector. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III together with
a map showing the location of the project. A report entitled "Appraisal of
a Highway Project - Lebanon" (63a-LE), dated I-larch 29, 1973, is being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
29.       The project consists of:
(a) construction of a four-lane divided expressway
between Tabarja and Tripoli (about 57.5 km),
including supervision by consultants;
(b)  construction of a highway maintenance center in
Batroun and the purchase of maintenance equipment
for the center;
(c) a feasibility study of the Beirut Bypass Highway
(about 18 km) and detailed engineering of priority
sections;



- 8 -
(d)  detailed engineering of the Beirut-Syrain Border
Highway (about 60 km); and
(e)  studies of highway organization and maintenance,
including the preparation of a highway improvement
and maintenance program.
30.       The total project cost (excluding $13.3 million for right-of-way
acquisition) is estimated al: $64.2 million equivalent. The proposed loan
will finance the foreign exchange component of $33.0 million, and the
rermainder will be provided by the Government.
31.       The proposed Tabarja-Tripoli expressway will be the first phase
in the construction of a modlern highway network serving the densely popu-
lated coastal plain and providing improved connection with Syria and other
Middle East countries. The proposed expressway will link Tripoli, the
second largest city and an important industrial center, with the four-lane
divided highway that already exists between Beirut and Tabarja (16 km).
The existing highway from Tabarja to Tripoli now carries over 10,000 vehicles
per day. It has a single two-lanle paved carriageway and is poorly aligned
and narrow. It crosses the railway 15 times, passes through many towns and
villages and is heavily congested. After the expressway is opened and
through traffic diverted to it, the existing road will be maintained for
local traffic.
32.       Primarily to ensure adequate maintenance of the expressway, a main-
tenance center will be established in Batroun, ,midway between Tabarja and
Tripoli. Consultants have previously prepared preliminary plans for the
center and the loan would provide for its construction as well as for pro-
curement of the necessary maintenance equipment. These plans will be re-
viewed by the consultants of the highway maintenance and organization study
in order to ensure that they are consistent with their recommendations.
33.       The planned construction during the next decade of three main high-
ways reaching Beirut fronL the north (Tabarja-Tripoli), from the south (Khalde-
Tyr) and from the east (Beirut-Syrian Border) rmakes it necessary to undertake
now a study of a highway to bypass the city, including its connections with
the urban street system. The loan provides for the financing of a feasibility
study of the Beirut Bypass as well as for detailed engineering of the priority
sections that will be deterrnined by the feasibility study.
34.       The Beirut-Syrian Border highway is part of the international high-
way between Beirut and Damascus, the main artery for international traffic
to neighboring middle-eastern countries, which has gained added importance
since the closure of the Suez Canal. The road also serves densely populated
areas and suwmmer resorts as well as Lebanon's main agricultural area (the
Beqa'a plain), and constitutes an important factor for the economic and
social development of Lebanon. A feasibility study of the highway showed
that its early improvement would be highily justified. The proposed loan
provides for the financing of detailed engineering to be carried out by
consultants. The reconstruction of the Syrian section of this international
highway is expected to start in 1973 with financing being provided by an IDA
Credit (298-SYR of April 1972).



- 9 -
35.       The Highway Organization and Maintenance Study to be carried out
by consultants would include:
(a) preparation of a five-year highway maintenance and
improvement program, based on a detailed road in-
ventory;
(b) review of the organization and operation of the DH
and recommended improvements thereof; and
(c) determination of the need for maintenance and workshop
equipmenit purchases and for workshop construction
necessary for carrying out the proposed highway main-
tenance and improvement program.
The study would be carried out in two stages, each lasting about one year.
The principal objectives of the second stage will be to assist in the imple-
mentation of the highway maintenance program developed under the first stage.
36.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of two Govern-
ment authorities: (a) The CEGP for the Tabarja-Tripoli expressway, the
maintenance center, the procurement of maintenance equipment, and the pre-
investment studies of the Beirut-Syrian Border Highway and the Beirut Bypass;
and (b) The Ministry of Public Works and Transport for the highway organiza-
tion and maintenance study.
37.       The consulting services under the project will be provided by
qualified and experienced consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
38.       Works on the Tabarja-Jbeil section of the Tabarja-Tripoli express-
way began in November 1972, while those on the remaining project sections
are expected to start in the first quarter of 1974. Construction is expected
to be completed by late 1976. Bids for maintenance equipment will be invited
in early 1975 and procurement is expected to be completed early in 1976. All
studies under the project are expected to start in 1973 and to be completed
by late 1976.
39.       Due to the urgency of starting construction, international bidding
for the Tabarja-Jbeil section was invited in April 1972, and proposals were
received in June 1972. The CEGP awarded construction contracts totalling
$9.5 million equivalent to the lowest bidders which were from Germany and
Greece. These were reviewed within the Bank and found compatible with Bank
requirements. The Government has asked the Bank for retroactive financing
of expenditures incurred after November 1, 1972 on the construction of the
Tabarja-Jbeil section including consulting services. An amount of US$800,000
has been included in the project for this purpose.
40.       For the remaining sections of the expressway, the CEGP will award
unit price contracts on the basis of international competitive bidding fol-
lowing the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement". The size of these contracts
is expected to attract experienced firus. The Government intends to retain



- 10 -
duly qualified local consultants for construction supervision. The mainte-
nance equipment will also be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Gtuidelines.    For the purpose of bid
evaluation domestic bids for maintenance equipment would be accorded a margin
of preference by adding 15% of c.i.f. costs or the actual customs duties,
whiclhever is lower, to foreign bids. Lebanon has a preferential tariff agree-
ment with the League of Arab States, but no procurement under the proposed
loan is expected to be made from the participating countries.
41.         Disbursements will be made on the basis of 50% of the cost of con-
struction contracts, 100% of the CIF cost of maintenance equipment and the
actual foreign exchange cost of consulting services.     The estimated schedule
of disbursements is shown in Annex III.
42.         The project reinforces the road infrastructure necessary for the
service activities that are the main-stay of the Lebanese economy and account
for almost two-thirds of GCDP. Because it is located in the most densely
populated areas of the country, the project will directly benefit a signi-
ficant portion of the population. The expressway was selected, from various
alternatives, as the most appropriate transport mode. The economic return
on this investment, including time-savings for non-leisure travel, is cal-
culated at 21%, and the first year economic return at 13%, indicating that
construction is economically well justified and appropriately timed. If
time savings were excluded from the benefits and assuming an increase in
construction costs of 15% and a decrease in benefits of 25%, the economic
return would still be 11%. Benefits from decongestion of local traffic,
increase in safety and comfort, and reduction in maintenance cost of parallel
roads, have not been included in these figures. The pre-investment and main-
tenance studies are justified since they will contribute to increased effi-
ciency in highway administration, as well as assist the Government in the
necessary improvements, expansion and maintenance of its highway network.
