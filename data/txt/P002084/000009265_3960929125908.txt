MEMMO M   AND RECO1fENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF TIE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
To TE FEDER AL REPLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A NATIONAL WATER REBAIILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recoomendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Government of Nigeria (ION) for US$256 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan for 20 years, including a five-
year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, would
help finance a National Water Rehabilitation Project. The Project would be
co-financed by the Government of Japan for US$4.5 million equivalent.
2.        Background.  With a population of around 117 million, Nigeria is
the most populous country in Africa. The form of goverment is a
federation comprising 21 states plus the Federal Capital Territory (ICT) of
Abuja. Under the Constitution, provislon of potable water supply is the
responsibility of the state governments. Within the states, responsibility
for providing potable water in urban and seml-urban areas is usually
assigned to a water board or corporation. Over the last ten years, the
states have made substantial investments in water supply infrastructure.
However, the absence of a maintenance culture coupled with economic
constraints has led to severe deterioration of even relatively new systems.
Fewer than 10 percent of the urban water supply systems are reported to be
capable of operating at their design capacities. Because of the poor
service provided, cost recovery is limited. State governments have on
average provided 40 to 50 percent of the state water agencies" (SWAs')
operating caeh flows through recurrent subventions. A study which was
carried out in 1987 on behalf of the Federal Department of Water Resources
to assess the scope of the need for rehabilitation of urban water supply
works nationwide, concluded that the total cost of rehabilitating all
existing urban and semi-urban systems, together with appropriate technical
assistance in financial management and manpower development, would amount
to about US$814 million (at end 1987 prices).
S.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Rehabilitation of existing
assets supports the Investment strategy of the Government's Structural
Adjustment Program.  However, mplementing a rehabilitation progrm In the
water supply sector will be meaningless unless the improvements realized
can be sustained. This will require institutional changes to strengthen
the SWAs' capability to operate and maintain their systems efficiently and
to generate adequate revenues. The experience gained by the Bank in the
water supply sector over the last ten years, both in carrying out sector
work and in supervising the Implementation of investment operations gives
the Bank a comparative advantage in assisting in the development and
execution of a broadly based sector operation focussing on critical
Institutional Issues and the most urgent rehabilitation requirements.
Lessons learned, particularly regarding the needs to insure reliable
counterpart funding, deflie clearly technical assistance needs and provide
for unaccounted for water reduction programs, have been taken Into account
in the Project.



- 2 -
4.        Proiect Objectives.  The National Water Rehabilitation Project
(NWRP) will provide a source of financing for water supply rehabilitation
sub-projects in individual states. The objective of each sub-project will
be to improve the level of water supply service in selected urban and semi-
urban areas by meeting the highest priority rehabilitation needs and to
begin to address the major institutional weaknesses of the state water
agencies in order to improve their capability to efficiently operate and
maintain water supply systems.
5.        Project Descri2tion.  NWRP will provide a source of credit to
finance the highest priority rehabilitation needs of SWAs. Each of the 21
states and the FCT are eligible to apply for a loan of up to US$10 million
equivalent for this purpose.  NWRP sub-loans .o the states will be on the
same terms as the IBRD loan. The physical component of each sub-project
will focus on rehabilitating existing facilities by repair or replacement
of civil works, plant and equipment to re.tore the output of water supply
systems to their design capacities. Neither expansion of existing systems
nor construction of new systems will be eligible for financing under the
Project. In addition to the physical rehabilitation components, in order
to sustain the physical improvements realized under the program, each state
sub-project will comprise a leakage detection and repair program and
institutional strengthening and operational support components to improve
operation and maintenance, financial management, staffing and stores
management of the participating SWAs. The total cost of the Project is
estimated at US$306.7 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$212.5 million (69Z of total cost). A project cost summary and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Project procurement arrangements
and IBRD disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the 21 states and
the Federal Capital Territory eligible for participation in the Project,
and Staff Appraisal Report No. 8954-UNI dated April 25, 1991 are attached.
6.        Actions Agreed.  Agreements have been reached with the
Government to: (a) approve loans for sub-projects only in accordance with
an agreed list of eligible investments and only to states which meet the
agreed conditions for participating in the Project, including inter alia -
action plans and programs of annual tariff increases to allow the SWAs to
meet all cash operating costs from revenues within a five-year period; (b)
employ a Project Management Consultant (PMC) acceptable to the Bank
throughout the period of implementation of the Project; (c) by December 31,
1991 inform states participating in the Project of the criteria that will
apply in determining eligibility for the use of any unallocated loan funds;
(d) conduct a mid-term review of project implementation by December 31,
1993; (e) finalize processing of all NWRP sub-loans by June 30, 1994; and
(f) on-lend NW P funds to participating states on the same terms as the
IBRD loan, with the states bearing the foreign exchange risk. In addition,
conditions of loan effectiveness includes (a) assignment of counterpart
staff to the PMC; (b) execution of at least two consultants' contracts to
provide engineering assistance to the states; and (c) signing of at least
two sub-loan agreements. Conditions of disbursement for the project states
will include (a) a sub-loan agreement must be entered into on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) for the rehabilitation of



-3-
water supply systems, a contract must be entered into that adequately
provides for a leakage detection and repair program.
7.        Environmental Aspects.  No significant detrimental environmental
impact is anticipated by the moderate increases in quantities of wastewater
discharged. This does not imply that the need for safe disposal of
wastewater is in any way diminished. Acceptable sanitation systems would
improve health conditions and warrant high priority in competition with
other urban infrastructure needs. Environmental assessments and
inspections of those dams and reservoirs associated with water supply
systems to be rehabilitated under the Project will be carried out.
Horeover, the Federal Ministry of Water Resources (-FPMR) and SWAs will
formulate and implement dam and reservoir maintenance programs, acceptable
to the Bank.
S.        Benefits.  Unreliable water supply is a critical constraint to
economic development in cities and large towns in Nigeria and impairs the
efficient operation of marketing, industrial, comercial and administrative
activities. Much of the population is forced either to devote an excessive
amount of time or to pay very high prices to private vendors to obtain
water to meet their basic needs.. By financing urgently required
rehabilitation of water supply facilities. NVRP will provide an improved
supply of water in a large number of urban and seal-urban areas. thereby
improving the quality of life for their inhabitants. Institutional
strengthening will enable the SWAs -.o sustain the higher level of water
supply service achieved after rehabilitating the system, and, perhaps even
more importantly, it will also reduce the SWAs' dependence on state
governmmets for recurrent operating subvention.
9.        Risks. Project risks relate primarily to the ability of NMll to
manage an operation of this size and to the state governmats' ability and
comitment to provide adequate counterpart funds to support their sub-
projects and to comply with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The role
and responsibilities of the PMC have been carefully defined to minimise the
risks associated with project management and procurement. Furthermore,
participating states will authorize counterpart funds to be deducted from
the Federation Account.
10.       Recomeandatlon. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
