FOREST IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project which would finance a portion of
the Government of Finland's long-term forest improvement program prepared by
the Finnish Forest Financing Committee (MERA). Government attaches high
priority to forest improvement works in view of the importance of the wood-
working industry for the country and reliance on home-grown wood. At present
the annual harvest from all forests is some 50 million Mn3 (equal to the
National Allowable Drain), but in addition some 2 million m3 is imported
from the USSR. The MERA program will, by raising the level of the allowable
drain, reduce reliance on imports of roundwood and permit a moderate expansion
of woodworking industries in the late 1970s.
ii.       This would be the first Bank loan to the agricultural sector and
would finance forest improvement operations in farmer-anLd company-owned
forests in South Finland and part of North Finland during the period 1973 to
1975. The improvement operations would comprise seeding and planting,
seedling stand improvement, drainage, fertilization and road construction,
and would involve some 60,000 farmers of the 330,000 in the project area
owning 10 million ha of forest (with average forest holclings of 30 ha) and
26 companies owning 1.2 million ha. Assistance in carrying out forest im-
provement works would be provided to farmers in the form of loans and grants
and to companies by loans at full commercial rates. Technical services and
guidance would be available through Government's Forestry Boards and Forest
Management Associations.
iii.      A Forest Improvement Committee advisory to the Minister of Agri-
culture and Forestry would be established in the Ministry; the Ministry's
Department of Forestry would be strengthened by the addiLtion of economic
staff to service the Committee and to enable it to proviLde guidance during
project execution. This economic unit would also monitor project progress.
The project would be administered by the National Forestry Board through the
Central and District Boards. Apart from strengthening of existing organi-
zations and creation of the Forestry Improvement Advisory Committee, no new
institutions would be established.
iv.       Total project cost is US$122 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$21.7 million equivalent; the Bank loan would be
US$20 million to the Government of Finland. The project would be financed by
Government 55%; farmers 20%; IBRD 16%; and companies 9%; Government's component
would be 67% loan, 33% grant.
v.        Civil works undertakings including roads (8,400 km - US$15.9 million),
drainage (0.5 million ha - US$25.6 million) and the purchase and distribution
of fertilizer (US$13 million) would be bulked into as large contracts as
possible. Procurement of contracts exceeding US$100,000 would be subject to



international competitive bidding; smaller contracts would be subject to
Government tender procedures which are satisfactory. Contractors would
purchase their vehicles, plant and equipment through local commercial
channels. Direct labor operations would be organized and supervised by
Forestry Boards.
vi.       The project would produce an additional 31 million m3 of roundwood
over a 20-year period. The rate of return to the economy has been calculated
to be 33%, assuming labor employed in the project area is shadow-rated at 80%
of cost in view of unemployment in the project area, and the wood cost at
millgate is Fmk 70/m3.
vii.      Projections of international markets and prices over the next
decade for wood-based products indicate stable price trends and a growing
market, which would assure Finland of her present share of export markets.
The trade agreement negotiated with EEC is not expected to affect her market
prospects significantly.
viii.     Small farmers investing in a package of improvement works can
expect a financial rate of return of 11% provided incentives in the form of
grants and a subsidized interest rate are available. With loans only on
commercial terms, the return to small farmers is negative. Without these
incentives, small farmers are unlikely to undertake programs of forest
improvement. A further argument for subsidies is on social grounds. Forest
improvement works are labor-intensive and provide additional work opportunities,
which enable Government to implement its policy of income redistribution.
ix.       Subject to appropriate assurances, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$20 million for a term of 15 years, including a grace period
of four years. The borrower would be the Government of Finland.

FOREST IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Finland has requested a Bank loan to help
finance a three-year portion (1973-75) of its forest improvement program to
increase available supplies of wood for Finland's wood-using industries. The
project would include improvement works during 1973-75 on some 1 million ha
of farmer- and company-owned forests, together with construction of 8,400
km of roads.
1.02      This would be the first Bank loan to Finland for agriculture or
forestry. Previous loans, dating from 1950, have been granted for industry
and for highway construction. The most recent -- the Third Highway Loan
(723-FI) -- was signed on February 17, 1971 for US$13 million, while indus-
trial loans were signed in January 1969 (582-FI) and October 1970 (708-FI)
for US$22 million and US$20 million, respectively. All previous projects
were completed or are operating satisfactorily. The quality of the work is
excellent.
1.03      This report is based on a Government submission prepared by a
committee consisting of representatives of Government departments and
other organizations associated with forestry and forest industries. The
project area, originally all of Finland, was reduced during project prep-
aration to exclude the northernmost part of the countrY. The appraisal
mLission consisted of Messrs. R.J. Dewar and C.L. Ljungman (IBRD) and L.
Svoboda (Consultant). Mr. K. Takeuchi (IBRD) prepared the marketing annex.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Finland is situated between latitude 600 and 70° north and has an
area of 337,000 km2; it lies on the Baltic Sea, bordered by the USSR in the
east, Norway in the north, and Sweden in the west. About 71% of the country
is forest and a further 10%, lakes and rivers (Map 1096).
2.02      The population, estimated at 4.7 million in 1970, is growing at
0.4% a year and the density is 14 per km2. GNP per capita in 1970 was
US$2,388. Between 1966 and 1970, the real GNP increasedl by 4.9% and in
1970 by 7.9%. The major sectors of the economy are public administration
and services, manufacturing, distribution and communications, and forestry
and agriculture; in 1970, they contributed, respectively, 35%, 29%, 22%,
and 14% of GNP at factor cost. The contribution from forestry was 7%.
Wood-based products comprise over half of Finland's exports, with engineering
machinery, equipment, and metal products next in importance at 24%.



- 2 -
2.03      Of the 2.2 million national labor force, 22% are employed in agri-
culture and forestry. There has been a decline in the share of rural employ-
ment in recent years of roughly 1% per year and full-time forestry labor is
expected to drop from the present level of sorr.e 80,000 man-years to 50,000
by 1980.  In 1970, the rate of unemployment over the whole couatry was 1.9%
of the labor force, with regional rates lowest in the south, 0.9%, and
highest in Lapland, 4.6%.
B. Forest Resources
2.04      Finland has a land area of 31 million ha, of which 19 million
ha (61%) are productive forests. In the north where the daily temperatures
ranges between -30°C and +20°C (averaging 0.4°C), tree growth is extremely
slow and gives way to tundra; in the south, growth rates equal those recorded
for most of northern Europe. The lakes in the east and center, and the major
rivers, flowing west to the Gulf of Bothnia and south to the Gulf of Finland,
are used extensively in the transport of wood.
2.05      There are three economic tree species:  Pinus sylvestris (Scots
pine), comprising 44% of the forest area; Picea abies (Norway spruce), 37%;
and Betula verrucosa (birch) and other hardwoods, 19%.  Pine and spruce
have always been in demand for pulping and sawtimber, but until recently
birch was considered mainly a firewood tree. It is now, however, in demand
for plywood and pulp (used in mixture with conifers). Rotation length (the
time required to produce a tree suitable for final harvesting) for the three
species varies from 75 years in the south to 200 years in the north. Data
on the forests have been collected from a series of inventories, the most
comprehensive being those published between 1955/60, 1960/63, and 1965/70,
2.06      Ownership of forests is divided between the state, 25%; forest
industrial companies, 7%; farmers, 65%; and communes and parishes 1/, the
balance.  The state forests are mainly in the north and thus least productive.
Timber production is derived from privately-owned forests, 78%; from the
state, 13%; from industrial companies, 6%; and from communes and parish-owned
forests, the remainder. The total standing wood volume (including bark) is
estimated at 1,500 million m3, or about 75 m3/ha.  Excluding the northern
and least productive forests (not included in the project), the standing
volume is 85 m3/ha. Of the total forest area, 13% comprises mature or
over-mature forest stands.
2.07      Since Finland's forests are exploited to the maximum permissible,
in terms of sustained yield and good silvicultural inanagement, increased
production can be achieved only by increasing the area of forests and/or
their productivity. Both aspects are covered by this project.

C. Forest Industries
2.08      In 1971 wood-based products manufactured in Finland accounted for
55% of exports. Of these, 30% were sawn timber and wood products, valued at
Fik 1,630 million (US$397 million), and 69% were paper products and pulp,
with a value of Fmk 3,790 million (US$924 million). Finland's share of
world export markets was 9% for coniferous sawn timber, 14% for plywood, 14%
for wood pulp, and 15% for paper and paper board.
2.09      Altogether in 1971 there were 566 sawmills and other mills manufac-
turing some 8.6 million m3 of wood products, with 62 pulp mills producing
some 6.2 million tons of pulp and 45 paper and board mills completing the
manufacturing process and producing 4.7 million tons of paper and board.  In
1971, world demand for forest products slackened and prices declined. The
present slow-down in activity, however, is expected to end within 12 months,
but, ia the meantime, industrial production is about 80% of capacity. Over
the longer term, the short supply of domestic roundwood has led to an agree-
ment between the wood-using industries and the Central Bank to restrict the
expansion of these industries, but with the projected increase in supplies
of roundwood from Finland's forests, it will be possible to ease this ban.
Further details are included in Annex 1.
D. Forest Organizations and Other Institutions
2.10      The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is directly responsible
for the administration of state forests and controls operations in farmer-
and company-owned forests through a number of forestry boards -- one national,
two central, and 19 district, each with elected and nominated members with
knowledge of forestry or associated industries. The National Forestry
Board (NFB) is answerable to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for
work in all forests. The 19 District Forestry Boards (DFB), and the Forestry
Department of Aland, responsible for the regulation of forest operations in
their districts (see Map 1096), operate under the supervision of the Central
Forestry Boards (CFB) located in Uelsinki. The largest CFB, TAPIO, looks after
the Finnish-speaking districts, while the smallest, Skogskultur, is responsible
for the two Swedish-speaking districts. Forest MIanagement Associations (FMA)
(338) provide forest owners with assistance in planning, work leadership and
other technical matters under the guidance of CFBs and DFBs.
2.11      The principal forest research organization is the Finnish Forest
Research Institute (FRI); administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry the Institute is responsible for determining the National Allowable
Drain (NAD) (for details see Chapter III). Other research organizations
include the National Research Council (Agriculture and Forestry), one of the
research councils of the Academy of Science; the Foundation for Forest Tree
Breeding, which promotes research into forest genetics; the State Institute
for Technical Research; the Finnish Pulp and Paper Institute; and the Forest
Work Study Section of the Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries.



-4-
The latter two are concerned with work in wood technology and wood processing
techniques. Higher education and research in forestry is undertaken by the
Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry at the University of lielsinki.
2.12      The woodworking industry is represented by the Central Association
of Finnish Forest Industries, while farmers owning forests are members of an
economic and political association - the Central Union of Agricultural Producers.
2.13      Provincial Boards, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior,
act as general treasury and accounts authorities, collecting income and
receiving payments on behalf of Government and managing loans under the
forest improvement program. In channelling Government funds for forest
improvement works, NFB uses the giro service of the Post Office Bank.
Repayments of these loans, which are collected by Provincial Boards, are
channelled through this bank to the Treasury.
2.14      Further details on organizations and institutions associated with
forestry and the forest improvement program are given in Annex 2 and the
Charts.
E. Legislation Governing Forestry
2.15      Three laws govern forest improvement operations and the work of
the Forestry Boards (Annex 3, para 6). The Private Forest Law of September
1967 regulates harvesting operations in private forests and prov-des for
reforestation after harvesting and good silvicultural management. The
Forestry Board Law of September 1967 prescribes the responsibility of the
Central and District Boards in relation to their promotional and super-
visory functions in farmer- and company-owned forests as w211 as the
responsibilities of these Boards to NFB. The Forest Improvement Law of
September 1967 provides the financial and administrative basis of Gevernment
aid for private forest improvement work.
F. The Forest Improvement Program
2.16      Finland has been aware for over 100 years of the need to protect,
maintain, and improve the productivity of her forests. The CFBs were formed
in 1907 to promote private forestry and, with the promulgation of the first
forest improvement law (1928), the country's 19 DFBs were established. Post-
war expansion of the woodworking industry increased the demand for roundwood
and, as only limited supplies were available for purchase at economic prices
from neighboring countries (mainly USSR), it was necessary to intensify the
improvement program. In 1964, MERA (Finnish Forest Financing Committee) was
formed on private initiative and presented its plans for improvement works
in state-, company-, and farmer-owned forests. The first plan was put into
effect in 1965 and funds were raised by the sale of Forest Development Bonds.
Under existing arrangements, budget-assisted grants and loans are available



-5-
only to farmers, while works in both state and company forests are self-financed.
The program was revised in 1966 (MERA II) and covered the period 1967-70; the
current program 1970-75 (MERA III) was prepared in 1969. In addition to the
MERA program, farmers are encouraged to afforest surplus and marginal agricul-
tural land.
2.17      Between 1967 and 1971, there was a steady annual increase of about
10% in investment in forest improvement works. The operations included in
MERA comprise: seeding (sowing after land preparation) and planting, seedling
stand improvement, forest fertilization, drainage, and forest road construc-
tion (Annex 3, para 5). FRI has calculated the benefits derived from these
operations.
2.18      During the period 1967-71, the total cost of the MERA II and III
programs, which include routine silvicultural operations in addition to forest
improvement operations, was Fmk 585 million (US$142.7 million), of which
Government contributed, as loans and grants, Fmk 300 million (US$73 million)
(51%); the balance was financed by forest owners. Average annual expenditure
of Fmk 98 million (US$24 million) during the first two years increased to
Fmk 130 million (US$31.7 million) during the subsequent three years. The
annual physical program now averages:
140,000 ha     -    seeding and planting;
290,000 ha     -    drainage;
180,000 ha     -    fertilization (from 500 ha in 1960); and
2,700 km     -    roads.
By December 31, 1971, the total area of peatland drained was 4.1 million ha,
and 1.7 million ha of forests was artificially planted or seeded.
G. Loans, Grants and Past Record of Repayments by Forest Owners
2.19      A private forest owner is eligible for a grant or loan, or both, in
accordance with the provisions of the Forest Improvement Law (para 2.15).
The type of assistance is determined by considering the type of improvement
operation, the locality of his farm and the farmer's gross income. The slower
the rate of tree growth, and the lower the income, the higher the grant and
the more favorable the conditions of the loan. This system of grants and
subsidized loans has been in operation for many years, is necessary to provide
incentives for small farmers to improve their forests (see para 7.06) and
serves to increase employment opportunities in rural areas and to help redis-
tribute incomes (see para 8.09). At the end of 1971, there were loans total-
ing Fmk 67 million (US$16 million) outstanding under the MERA program and
Fmk 137,000 (US$33,000) 0.2%, was in arrears for payments of principal and
interest. Of this amount, only Fmk 15,000 (US$3,660) (from 125 loans) had
been overdue for more than one year. This record is highly satisfactory and



- 6 -
is due largely to the collection methods employed by the Provincial Boards,
which follow procedures identical to those applied in the collection of the
Government tax. (See also Annex 3, para 10.)
III. FOREST MANAGEMENT
A. Sustained Yield and the National Allowable Drain
3.01      The concept of Sustained Yield and the National Allowable Drain
(NAD) embody principles which are nowadays generally recognized in most
countries in the scientific management of a national forest resource.
MIanagement on the basis of sustained yield involves the regulation of
timber harvesting to ensure in perpetuity, an equal, or increasing (but
never diminishing) supply. This principle has been accepted for as long
as forests have been scientifically managed. :AD is the maximum amount of
timber which may be harvested from a national forest resource on the basis
of sustained yield. If the resource consists of plantations established
by a program of equal annual planting, the NAD would be zero until the first
planting reached maturity when it would comprise the volume of timber har-
vested from this first planting plus any intermediate yields from thinnings.
The NAD under these circumstances would equal the annual gross increment
(annual growth of wood) from national forests. Where the national forest
resource included an excess of mature wood, as in Finland, the NAD with
progressive forest management involving forest improvement operations, could
exceed the annual gross increment. This is made possible by harvesting some
of the surplus mature wood in anticipation of future growth resulting from
the improvement operations. However, if the principles of sustained yield
are to be observed the improvement operations must continue. This system of
forest management and method of calculating NAD is recognized in forestry
circles in Scandinavia and North America and is accepted bv the Finnish
Government. The concept is discussed further in Annex 4.
3.02      In Finland, bv adopting this system the benefits from the forest
improvement programs are obtained in advance. The FRI is responsible for
determining the NAD which is calculated from data collected from national
forest inventories. The following factors are taken into account: the annual
gross increment, currently 48 million m3; forest site classes; the area of
forest stands; species and age distribution; volume of growing stock in the
different classes and estimates of normal mortality. Special studies are used
to determine the effects of improvement operations, particularly of drainage
and fertilization, on forest growth. The FRI has also determined the optimum
rotation length for different species in different localities (para 2.05).
Currently the NAD is 50 million m3 under bark kAnnex 5, para 6). The excess
of NAD over annual gross increment results from the anticipation of growth
from improvement operations and the high proportion of older and mature forests.
If MERA operations are continued at the present level, the NAD by 1980 would
be some 55 million m3 (58 million m3 in 1990 and 64 million m3 in the year
2000).



- 7 -
3.03      The NAD is apportioned by the FRI among the 19 DFBs which are
responsible for the control of timber harvesting.
B. Management of Farmer-Owned Forests
3.04      Ownership of Finland's forests is divided among the state,
industrial companies and farmers (para 2.06). Of these, only the state-
and company-owned forests are normally managed commercially. The forests
owned by farmers (330,000 in all with average holdings of about 30 ha) in
view of their small size, unlike the state and company forests, do not con-
tain representative age classes nor is it normal for individuals to manage
their forests on the basis of sustained yield. They are considered by their
owners as an investment for the future and a source of finance to meet special
items of expenditure such as the purchase of a farm tractor, or a marriage.
Collectively, however, the total wood harvested equals the NAD and the prin-
ciples of sustained yield are observed. Permits to harvest are obtained by
forest owners from the DFBs. These are granted in accordance with the prin-
ciples of sustained yield within the District only when mature timber is
available. After harvesting it is obligatory for the owner to reforest the
area felled and maintain the new plantations. Through this arrangement all
harvesting is controlled and the national forest resource is maintained in
accordance with the principles of sound forest management.
3.05      Improvement operations in privately-owned forests are vital to
the IMERA program. In view of the size of company forests and the scale of
their forest operations it is financially sound for themn to make this
investment and they participate fully in the programs. On the other hand,
the farmer-owner without an inducement would not take part. The Government
therefore provides inducements in the form of grants and subsidized interest
rates.
IV. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Location, Transport, and Communications
4.01      The project area includes all forests belonging to farmers or
companies in South Finland and the two southerly DFBs in North Finland;
DFBs 1 to 17 and the Forestry Department of Aland operate in the project
area. See Map 1096.
4.02      The principal transport methods include highways, railways, water-
ways, and air transport. There are 72,000 km of roads, 5,720 km of railways,
and the air transport system connects all of the main centers. Because of
the low population density (para 2.02), with few and scattered urban centers,
this has resulted in a network of long transport lines carrying low transport



-8-
volumes. In addition, transport is aggravated by severe winter conditions
resulting in high operating costs. In the summer, the lakes and main rivers
provide an economic method of transport for timber; some 40,000 km of
transport channels flow north-south between the lakes.
B. Climate and Soils
4.03      The average precipitation in the project area varies between 650 mm
on the southern coast to 430 mm in the north (some 30 to 40% snow). The
yearly average daily air temperatures range from 0.4°C in Lapland to +5.70C
on the southern coast. In the central part of the country, the daily air
temperature is usually above 0°C between April and October. Climatically,
Finland is between maritime and continental, with long severe winters and
short summers (from 2 to 2-1/2 months), with June daylight in the south some
19 hours and in the north 24 hours.
4.04      Finnish soils are typical of the Scandinavian peninsula, with
granite and archaean rock and post-glacial deposits of marine origin. The
soils are largely morainic, with silts and clays predominating la arable
areas. In the center and north of the country there are extensive areas
of peatland.
C. Population
4.05      Some 2.4 million people reside in rural areas.  Population density
is about 11 persons per km2 and is greatest in South Finland -- 26 per km2
- while in the north it drops to 4.2 per km2. The majority of these people
are associated with agriculture or forestry.
D. Company and Private Forests
4.06      Most of Finland's privately-owned forests (about 10 million ha)
are owned by farmers, an increasing number of whom find permanent employment
in urban areas but continue to maintain their forests, using the management
services (for planning and execution of silviculture operations) provided
by District Boards or FMAs. The 1969 agricultural census recorded 330,000
farmer owners within the project area with average forest holdings of 30 ha.
About 1.2 million ha of forests are owned by 26 forest industry companies,
16 of which have estates of more than 10,000 ha (for further details, see
Annex 5). There has been a substantial reduction (some 33%) in state and
company forests since the end of World War II due in part to the ceding of
forests in the east to the USSR but primarily to the program of resettlement
of displaced persons (also from the east).

V. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
5.01      The project forms part of the Government's on-going MERA III
forest improvement program (para 2.18) and would include specific improvement
works in some 60,000 farmer-owned and 26 company-owned forests. The
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry would have overall responsibility for
the project; provision for additional staff to assist with implementation
would be made. The project area would include DFBs 1-17 consisting of South
Finland and the two most southerly districts in North Finland. The project
period would cover calendar years 1973 to 1975.
B. Detailed Features
Forest Improvement Works
5.02      The forest improvement works would comprise:
(a)  seeding and planting of 136,000 ha (123.000 ha private,
13,000 ha company-owned) to regenerate poorly stocked
stands; in South Finland, DFBs 1 to 15 (refor,estation
of stands after harvesting does not form part of the
project since this operation is an obligation of the
forest owner under the Private Forest Law);
(b)  seedling stand improvement of 315,000 ha (250,000 ha
private, 65,000 ha company-owned); in South Finland only,
DFBs 1 to 15; this involves silvicultural improvement
operations, including thinning in drained peatland areas;
(c)  fertilization of 709,000 ha (618,000 ha private, 91,000 ha
company-owned) forests on mineral soil and peatland areas;
throughout the project area, DFBs 1 to 17; twiD types of
fertilization are involved: the first, fertilization of
seedling stands, sometimes described as basic fertilization,
and the second, fertilization of mature stands shortly before
harvesting, sometimes described as intermediate fertilization;
only one application would be made to any one area during the
project period.
(d)  drainage of 551,000 ha peatland (483,000 ha private, 68,000 ha
company-owned); throughout the project area; IDFBs 1 to 17; and
(e)  construction of 8,400 km (6,950 km private, 1,450 ha company-
owned) access and extraction roads; throughouit the project
area, DFBs 1 to 17.
For phasing, see Annex 7, Table 2.

Ecology
5.03      There would be no ill effects from any of the improvement operations
proposed. In implementing the project due consideration would be given to
environmental aspects. No persistent insecticides or weedicides would be
used and it has been shown that the effects of properly planr.ed and executed
drainage programs would not harmfully affect water supplies.
Technical Data Related to Forest Improvement Works
5.04      Drainage and road construction operations are undertaken primariiy
with machines, but seeding and planting and forest fertilizacion are usually
done manually, although mechanization is increasing (para 5.05). Fertilizer
applications on peatland are 500 kg/ha of PK mixture for both seedling and
mature stands, while on mineral soils, nitrogen and saltpeter are used for
an application of 300 kg per ha and 500 kg per ha, respectively. Drainage
and road specifications are included in the Forest Improvement Law. Dependent
on gradient, yield class, and depth of peat, forest drains have an average
density of about 217 m length per ha, with a minimum gradient of 1 in 1,000.
The categories of forest roads are main, truck, light, and tractor; main
roads are surfaced, open all season to traffic, and have two lanes. Other
roads are single lane and seasonal. Further details are in Annex 6, para-
graphs 2 and 3.
Forest Improvement Contractors
5.05      Forest drainage and forest road construction are carried out by con-
tract work. Specialized machines and equipment have been deve'loped in Finlanc
for drainage operations and include ditch ploughs, excavators, rotary diggerbX
and tractor diggers; standard equipment is used for road-making. Where large-
scale fertilization is carried out, contracts are let for mechanical spreading
(including aerial spreading). Afforestation and the tending of young seedlings
are labor-intensive with little or no opportunity for mechanization and are
normally undertaken by employed labor (sometimes including farmer owners) and
supervised by the District Boards.
5.06      In 1971, some 590 contractors were engaged in drainage, road
construction, seeding and planting, and fertilization operatIons. The aver-
age seeding and planting and fertilization contract was only Fmk 1,500 (US$370),
while road construction and drainage averaged Fmk 25,000 (US$6,100) and Fmk
10,000 (US$2,440), respectively. Of the contractors themselves, only one
operated throughout Finland; 50 worked in more than one province; and the
remainder (539) were small, having only one or two machines.
C. Loans and Grants for Forest Improvement Works
5.07      Loans and grants to farmers would continue to be provided under
present terms and conditions (para 6.10). Regulations would be prepared
under thie project to govern the award of loans on conmercial terms to
companies for forest improvement works. Publication of such regulations
would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan. See also paragraph 2.19
and Annex 6, paragraphs 4 - 6.

D. Cost Estimates and Foreign Exchange Component
5.08      Total project costs are estimated at Fink 500 million (US$122 million),
of which about Fmk 89 million (US$21.7 million) (18%) would be foreign exchange.
Tae labor component is estimatee at 61%o  Estimates are based on cost statistics
from past forest improvement programs in Finland and no physical contingency
has been applied because of the well established procedures and cost records
of previous programs and the credit nature of the project. A cumulative price
contingency of 5% annually has been included. Project costs are detailed in
Annex 7 and summarized below.

E. Financing, Procurement, and Disbursement
Financing
5.09      The proposed loan would provide 16% of project costs amounting to
US$20 million (92% of foreign exchange costs). Farmers would finance, in



- 12 -
cash, their contribution of US$24.3 million and companies, US$10.3 million,
which amounts to 25% and 77% of the cost of their respective operations. The
remainder of the project funds (US$67.3 million) would be vrovided by Govezm.-
ment. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the procact funds
would be allocated on the basis of annual budgets to the Itinistry of Agri-
culture.  The Ministry of Agriculture would reallocate funds received for
CFBs, DFBs, and FIDs through its giro account in the Post Office Bank.  Farmer
contributions would be paid into the same account. For onlending rates, see
paragraph 6.10. Summarized project financing (including contingencies) would
be:

Procurement
5.10      Civil works undertakings, comprising roads (US$15.9 million) and
drainage (US$25.6 million), and the purchase and distribution of fertilizers
would be bulked into as large orders as practicable. However, in view of
the extent of the project area and the scattered nature of the work, a sub-
stantial number of contracts would probably be insufficient in value to attract
international competitive bids (although no preference would be given to local
contractors); all contracts of US$100,000 or more would be subject to inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Smaller
contracts would be subject to Government tender procedures which are satis-
factory. Equipment used by contractors would be purchased through normal
commercial channels; main manufacturers of suitable equipment (foreign and
local) are represented throughout Finland and are adequately competitive.
Imports are duty free. Other operations (including planting and seeding and
tending) would be carried out by direct labor, organized and supenrised by
District Boards in the case of private owners and by professional and technical
staffs in the case of company forests. For contracts of US$25,000 or more but
less than US$100,000 standard documents and procedures for bidding would be
used; Bank's approval would be sought only if it was proposed to award the
contract other than to the lowest bidder. Appropriate assurances were ob-
tained during negotiations that these procedures would be followed.



- 13 -
Disbursement
5.11      IBRD would disburse 28% of Government expenditure on forest im-
provement operations in farmer-owned forests. This represents 92% of the
foreign exchange component of the project costs. Disbursements would be
made against certified expenditure on civil works contracts, including con-
tracts for road construction and drainage on farmer-owned land, the purchase
and delivery of fertilizers and their application, seeding and planting and
seedling stand improvement. (A disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 8.)
5.12      If the project is operating satisfactorily and should surplus funds
remain at the closing date, they may be used for the continuing development
of the program.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
6.01      The strategy and planning of forest improvement works is set out
in the national forestry improvement program (MERA III). Responsibility for
implementation rests with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and its
Department of Forestry. A Forest Improvement Advisory Committee would advise
the Minister on all matters concerned with improvement operations. Functions
of this committee, the Ministry, Department of Forestry, the Forestry Boards,
and other Government offices concerned with forest improvement works are
described below (see also Annexes 2 and 3 and Charts 6901 and 6902). Pro-
fessional and technical staff employed by the CFBs and DFBs include 238 pro-
fessional foresters, 451 technical foresters, and some 520 foremen, with
supporting clerical staff.
B. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
Forest Improvement Advisory Committee
6.02      Present arrangements do not provide adequate coordination among
associated organizations in determining national policy, economic planning,
and implementing forest improvement programs. A committee, advisory to the
Minister of Agriculture and Forestry on all matters concerned with forest
improvement works, would therefore be established; membership would include
senior representatives from the Bank of Finland, the Ministries of Finance
and Agriculture and Forestry, and the Forest Research Institute and an
independent banker or financier. The chairman would be nominated by the
Minister. The committee would be serviced by the Department of Forestry.
The establishment of the committee would be a condition of effectiveness of
the loan.



- 14 -
Department of Forestry
6.03      The Department of Forestry would prepare the national forest
improvement program, be responsible for economic matters connected with it,
give guidance to NFB (which would be responsible for the project) and CFBs,
and provide a secretariat for the Forest Improvement Advisory Committee. Its
existing staff is inadequate to deal effectively with these matters and would
be augmented by the appointment of a senior economist, an economist, and
supporting clerical staff. The Department would also monitor project achieve-
ments (para 6.18). The appointment of the senior economist would be a
condition of effectiveness of the loan.
C. Forestry Boards and Associated Organizations
National Forestry Board
6.04      NFB would be responsible for the project and the Forest Improvement
Office of NFB would deal with improvement works in company and private
forests. Its existing staff is inadequate to provide the services required
and would be augmented by a financial analyst with supporting clerical staff.
The appointment of the financial analyst would be a condition of effectiveness
of the loan.
Central Forestry Boards
6.05      The two CFBs (para 2.10) would control operations of the District
Boards. Personnel of CFBs and DFBs would be strengthened by the engagement,
on a permanent basis, of 20 additional professional foresters, 39 technical
foresters, 15 foremen, and 23 clerical officers. Assurances that this
additional staff would be recruited were obtained during negotiations.
District Forestry Boards and Forest Improvement Districts
6.06      Each DFB and FID is directed by a chief forester who would be
supported by technical staff. DFBs would be primarily responsible for im-
provement works in forests on mineral soils (in addition to their regulatory
functions) and FIDs for improvement works in peatland forest areas. FIDs
would operate as the field organizations of CFBs with no regulatory responsi-
bilities.
Forest Management Associations
6.07      The ENAs (338), funded by forest owners, would provide technical
advice and services to farmers.



- 15 -
D. Operational Arrangements
Loans and Grants
6.08      The handling of forest improvement works in private forests would
follow the procedure laid down in the Forest Improvement Law, which deals
with technical, administrative, and legal matters. The law specifies the
level of loans and grants available to forest owners in relationship to
the type of operation, the locality of the forest and gross earnings.
Responsibility for the use of public funds for forest irnprovement works
lies with NFB, which can delegate authority within specific limits to CFBs,
DFBs and FIDs.  Approval for grants in excess of Fmk 1,500 (US$365) and for
all loans for forest improvement works would be subject to NFB approval.
Within NFB, loans of less than Fmk 50,000 (US$12,200) would be approved by
the head of the Private Forestry Department; for loans in excess of this
amount approval would be required from an executive comaittee comprising the
Director General and three of his directors. In the case of company forests,
regulations governing loans would be controlled by Government and would follow
in principle the provisions of the Forest Improvement Law.  The regulations
would provide for the size and conditions of loans, for civil works, manual
operations and the application of fertilizers. Their introduction would be
a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
6.09      Based on past experience, the anticipated proportions of loans, grants
and farmers' own contributions for the five forest improvement operations are:
Percentages; of Cost
Farmer
Loan  Grant   Contribution
Seeding and Planting                           25     40          35

==             =
See also Annex 6, paragraphs 4 - 6.
6.10      Loans to farmers would be on the same conditions as at present and
would have various interest rates, repayment and grace periods: for
seeding and planting, seedling stand improvement, fertilization and
drainage, a repayment period of 23 years and a grace period of between
one and seven years dependent on the operation, farmer's income and
forest location; road construction, 12 years and two years' grace; for
fertilization before harvesting, six years repayment and one year grace;
and interest rates on loans for fertilization prior to harvesting, 5%;



- 16 -
all other operations, 3%. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
changes in these arrangements would be made only after consuiltation with thLe
Bank. Loans to companies would have a commercial 1/ interest rate with no
grace period. Repayment periods for the operations would be: seedinrg and
planting, seedling stand improvement, drainage and fertilization of seedling
stands, 15 years; fertilization prior to harvesting, six years; and road
building, 10 years. Companies would not be eligible for grants.
6.11      Loan repayments would be channeled by the Provincial Boards through
the Post Office Bank directly to the Treasury. The Provincial Boards would
maintain a register of all loans falling within their jurisdiction, and would
undertake annual collection of interest and process repayments. NFB would
establish summary records for all loans, and an assurance to this effect
was obtained during negotiations.
Planning
6.12      At the field level, chief foresters of DFBs and FIDs would draw
up technical plans and cost estimates and assist owners in preparing their
applications for Government assistance. In this they would be assisted
by technical staff of rMAs. The preparation of proposals for major works,
including large drainage schemes and the construction of forest roads, may
involve both FIDs and DFBs and a large number of farmer owners. For companies,
the technical plans would be prepared by their own professional and technical
forest staff in consultation with the chief foresters of the DFBs.
6.13      On completion of the preparatory work, agreement would be reached
at a meeting between the chief forester and owner(s) on technical and
organizational features of the operation, the cost and arrangements for
financing. The application would then be submitted to NFB in standard form
consisting of a description of the project, a financing plan detailing Govern-
ment grants and loans and the owner's commitment to repay the loan. In group
projects, power of attorney would be issued granting one of the owners author-
ity to act for his associates. In each case the applicant would authorize the
issue of a mortgage on his forest as security against any loan granted. In
addition, he would give a written undertaking to maintain the forest where
the improvement operation took place, in accordance with sound silvicultural
practices. In approving projects, NFB is primarily concerned with technical
features and legal aspects; in particular it must be satisfied that: plans
are technically and economically sound, existing regulations (which govern
both technical and economic matters) are observed, the work qualifies for
Government assistance, and the owner has a clear title to his forest.
1/   Estimated to be between 8% to 8-1/2%/per annum in May 1972.



- 17 -
Execution of Improvement Work
6.14      On approval by NFB, the DFBs and FIDs would be responsible for
implementation including, in the case of farmer-owned forest, the organization
of a work force to undertake manual operations and the award of contracts
including those for mechanized operations and the supply of fertilizers
(para 5.05). The work force would be employed under contractual arrangements
and could include the farmer himself. In the case of company forests, DFBs
would supervise implementation. Contracts would be awarded wherever possible
for work on a number of contiguous farms. During the construction period the
,DFBs would submit regular monthly reports to CFBs, which, in turn, would
summarize them for NFB. Field inspections would be conducted at regular
intervals by CFB and NFB staff that proper silvicultural practices are ob-
served. An assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
Legal Arrangements
6.15      On completion of the work program in farmer-owned forests, a meeting
attended by the owner and the chief forester would be called; the cost of the
operation would then be determined and the amount of Government aid involved
calculated. The minutes of this meeting would form the conclusive legal
document for the execution of the mortgage and the entry of the loan in the
loan register. The mortgage would be entered by the District Judge on the
estate of the borrower and the loan details would be submitted to the appro-
priate Provincial Board.
Accounts and Audit
6.16      NFB in its financial transactions would use the facilities of the
Post Office Bank, and funds to meet the cost of improvement works would be
transferred in advance through the bank's giro account to the appropriate
DFB and FID. These agencies would make progress payments to contractors
based on relevant documentation. Accounts and records would be kept in
field offices and monthly statements would be submitted to the CFB and NFB.
The forest owner's contribution would be paid in advance in a secured account
or covered by temporary Government advances repayable immediately on completion
of the work.
6.17      NFB accounts would be audited by Government's Audit Department.
CFB accounts would be audited by independent auditors nominated by NFB and
subject to Bank approval.  Audited accounts for NFB, CFBs and DFBs would be
submitted to the Bank within four months of the year encl, together with the
auditor's report. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
E. Monitoring
6.18      The senior economist in the Department of Forestry in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Forestry would be responsible for morLitoring project pro-
gress. He would seek the cooperation of CFBs in making surveys of farmer

performance and would submit annual reports to the Forest Imprevement Advisory
Committee and to the Bank at the end of each project year. Assurances to this
effect were obtained during negotiaticns.
VII.  PRODUCTION, MARKETS, GOVERNMENT REVENUES AKD FARMER BENEFITS
A. Yields and Production
7.01      Research studies undertaken by the Finnish Forest Research Insti-
tute have determined the following levels of increased production or cost
reduction:
(i) Seeding and planting. In poorly stocked stands the rate of
growth with artificial seeding and planting was found
to be significantly greater than with natural regeneration
and varies between 0.5 and 3 m3/ha/year. In the project
area the resulting increase in growth would be
2 m3/ha/year.
(ii) Peatland drainage and seedling stand improvement. These
operations are closely related and, combined, increase growth
by 1.3 m3/ha/year for at least 20 years. Drains must be
kept in good order and stands maintained to sustain this
growth.
(iii) Fertilization. Each application on forests on mineral
soils would give increased growth for seven years of
1 m3/ha/year. On peatland the benefits last for 20 years
due to the slow breakdown of chemicals and the activation
of micro-fauna; the yield increase would be 1.6 m3/ha/year.
7.02      The increased yields from the project over a period of 20 years
would be 31 million m3 (Annex 6, paras 7-9).
B.  Markets and Prices
7.03      By 1980, production in Finland of sawn tinber and wood based panel
products is expected to be about 10.5 million m3 and of pulp, paper and board
products 9.2 million tons -- an annual increase of 2.7% between 1970 and 1980.
World demand outlook for forest products as a whole is bright and projections
for industrial wood until 1975 are expected to grow annually at 2.7% and
during tine period 1975/85 at 3%; in Europe, consumption during the last five
years exceeded production and this trend is likely to continue 1/. Future
increased production from Finland's industry would therefore continue to find
1/   Source:  ECE/FAO Timber Committee.



- 19 -
ready markets in Europe. Real prices for processed forest products are
expected to decline slightly during the next decade, due to improved technical
efficiency in harvesting, transport and processing methods. Roundwood prices
would remain stable. It is not anticipated that the outcome of the trade
negotiations with the EEC would affect market prospects significantly (see
also Annex 9).
7.04      Stumpage prices (currently averaging Fmk 32/m3 (US$7.8)) are
negotiated between the industry and farmers, represented respectively by the
Central Association of Finland's Forest Industries and the Central Union of
Agricultural Producers. The actual sales are arranged between companies and
farmers; under the conditions of the Private Forest Law approval to harvest
must be obtained from the DFB. Harvesting is either undertaken by the farmer,
who may transport to roadside, or is bought by industry as standing timber.
Transport by road and water is usually by contract or done by the company
itself. The price paid to farmers would include stumpage, harvesting costs
and any transport involved.
C. Farmer Benefits
7.05      The management of farmer-owned forests is discussed in paragraphs
3.04 and 3.05. Farm forests are of uneven age, are not representative of
all age classes and, because of this and their small size, are not normally
managed commercially. Farmers tend to use them as a "bank" and to harvest
timber when capital is required. It is therefore difficult to quantify
benefits accruing to farmers as a result of the project and to arrive, with
any degree of accuracy, at a rate of return on their investment. However,
if certain theoretical assumptions are made an indicative financial rate
of return can be calculated.
7.06      In the economic evaluation (Chapter VIII) the increasing NAD re-
sulting from the project is realized as an annual benefit and is calculated
in respect of all forests in Finland. However, records of past improvement
operations indicate that only 60,000 farmers, owning 30% of farmer-owned
forests, are likely to participate during the project period. The average
farmer's share of the increased annual allowable drain in his forest resulting
from the improvement operations he has carried out would thus be an estimated
30% of the increased yield. The balance would be harvested in other forests
of Finland as part of the NAD (Annex 4). The financial rate of return to
the farmer would be:
-    with a grant of 24% of the cost of the improvement
works, 11%; and
-    without a grant, a negative rate of return (-2%).
To get small farmer participation the incentive of grants and subsidized
interest rates is therefore necessary and justified. The main reason for
the low financial rate of return (as compared to the economic rate of return



- 20 -
of 33%) is the fact that the average farmer could only harvest annually an
estimated 30% of the increase in yield resulting from his improvement oper-
ations (see also Annex 10).
VIII.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Benefits
8.01      Production from Finnish forest industries is restricted by the limit
on supplies of domestic roundwood, and in recent years industry has had to
import to enable plants to operate near capacity. Available imports (at
competitive prices) are likely to diminish during the next 10 to 15 years
and to meet part of industry's future requirements the forest improvement
works were intensified by the introduction of the Government-sponsored HERA
program. The alternatives available to Government would have been either to
permit overcutting, contrary to acceptable standards of sound forest manage-
ment, or to restrict the level of activities of wood using industries.
Government decided to introduce the intensified forest improvement program
with its inherent benefits to the economy, the wood-using industries and
small and large forest owners.
8.02      The economic justification of the project depends on the principal
that with the project, as a result of its forest improvement works, the NAD
would immediately be greater than without the project. It is the quantity
of mature forest in Finland that allows the additional NAD to be harvested
immediately (Chapter III). These arguments have been accepted by forest
economists in Scandinavia and North America. They were submitted by the
Government in its economic justification of the investment in forest improve-
ment works and are acceptable to the Bank.
8.03      The increase in NAD as a result of the project has been taken to
equal the additional growth derived annually from the forest improvement
operations. Calculations made by FRI indicate that this harvesting program
is conservative and if all future growth resulting from the project were
anticipated, the allowable drain would be greater; this is due to available
areas of over-mature forest in the project area. This additional drain has
been taken as the project benefit and is given below:

Year                            1000 m3 under bark
1                                    330
2                                  1,150
3-7 annually                         2,120
8                                  2,030
9                                  1,760
10-20 annually                         1,400
See also Annex 6, paras 7-9.
8.05      Increased production has been valued at the international price of
wood delivered millgate, conservatively estimated to be Fmk 70/m3 (US$17.1/m3).
In addition, there would be cost savings from the road construction program of
Fmk 2,770/km (US$676/km) of road for a period of three years after construction
when the roads are used for the harvesting of roundwood (see Annex 6).
B. Economic Rate of Return and SensitivitZ
8.06      The rate of return calculations are based on cost estimates shown
in Annex 6. They include: the incremental administrative costs for the
main project organizations; the cost of labor employed in the project area
shadow-rated at 80% of cost (in view of unemployment in rural areas); costs
of maintenance of the improvement operations; and harvesting costs (see
Annex 11).
8.07      The rate of return to the economy of Finland show that the project
is particularly sensitive to wood prices. The rate of return based on the
international wood price of Fmk 70/m3 (US$17.07/m3) delivered mill gate over
a 20-year project life would be 33% (see table attached to Annex 11). With
the wood price reduced by Fmk 5/m3 (US$1.21/m3) to Fmk 65/m3 (US$15.85/m3)
the rate of return would be 27%.
C. Social Effects
8.08      Government is concerned at tihe extent of unemployment in rural areas
which is not fully represented in the national statistics (0.9% in South
Finland rising to 4.6% in the north). These figures do not reflect the part-
time nature of agricultural and forestry work, nor do they take full account
of the migration of labor to industrial centers within Finland and Sweden.
Forest improvement works with a high labor component (61% in the project)
are ideally suited to increase job opportunities in the rural areas by



- 22 -
affording year-long paid employment. (In agriculture, with the long winter,
work is seasonal for the farmer and his paid labor.) The MERA programs have
been used by Government to relieve unemployment and also to implement its
policy of income redistribution.
8.09      In 1967 the average annual income in Finland was US$1,665 and the
average wage-earner's salary US$1,390. The average income in the agricultural
sector was US$990 (71% of the average wage-earners salary) and the farm wage-
earner's income was US$660   . The Forest Improvement Project aas been usec
as a means of carrying out Government's income redistribution policy.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a) Government would provide project funds by way of an annual budget
allocation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (paIa 5.09);
(b) procurement would follow procedures as outlined in para 5.10;
(c) additional permanent forestry staff would be recruited "or the
CFBs and DFBs (para 6.05);
(d) the auditing of NFB, CFB and DFB accounts would be according
to procedures described in para 6.17; and
(e) the senior economist in the Department of Forests of the
Ministry of Agriculture would monitor progress of the project
(para 6.18).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(a) the regulations governing the award of loans to companies
had been published (paras 5.07 and 6.08);
(b)  the advisory committee to tile Minister of Agriculture and
Forestry had been established (para 6.02);
(c) the senior economist had been appointed to the Department
of Forestry of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests
(para 6.03); and
(d) a financial analyst to maintain the project accounts and
records had been appointed to the Forest Improvement Office
of NFB (para 6.04).
9.03      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$20 million for 15
years including a four-year grace period.

FOREST IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Forest Industries and Roundwood Requirements
1.        In 1971 wood based products in Finland accounted for about US$1,320
million (Fmk 5,413 million) or 55% of the country's total exports (Table 1;
export quantities by categories are shown in Table 2). In 1969 Finland's
approximate share of the world's export market was 9% for coniferous savm
timber, 14% for plywood, 14% for wood pulp and 15% for paper and paperboard
(Table 3). The production figures for wood based industries are shown in
Table 4. The pulp and paper industry now absorbs most of the roundwood pre-
viously exported as pitprops while hardwoods, mainly birch and previously
considered of little industrial use, are used in plywood and pulp manufacture,
the latter in mixture with coniferous roundwood. Total roundwood consumption
by industries is illustrated in Figure 6963.
2.        Projections for this decade for both forest inidustrial production
and roundwood requirements are given in Table 5. By 1980 roundwood from
North Finland which includes Lapland (not part of the project area), is
expected to decline while supplies for industrial use from the project area,
which includes South Finland, should increase by some 12 million mJ (from
32 million m3 to 44 million m3). The additional roundwood derives from
increased forest growth resulting from Government's forest improvement
program, greater use of other fuels for domestic purposes releasing firewood
for industrial use, and the more extensive use of wood waste (sawmill waste,
branchwood and tree roots). Imports of roundwood, at present some 2.4
million m3/year, mainly from the USSR, are expected to decline during the
period as the USSR develops its own industries.

/1   See Itap 1097.
/2   Production includes exports only.
4.        1970/71 saw a slackening in demand for forest products and in
consequence the rise in prices came to a halt. The present recession is
expected to end within the next 12 months but in the meantime industrial
production is about 80% of capacity. In the longer term, the shortage of
roundwood (the national allowable drain from Finland's forests is currently
slightly in excess of annual growth Annex 5 page 3) has led to an agreement
between the wood-using industries and the Central Bank, that tor tne presenit,
there will be no further investment in expansion of these industries. Ilow-
ever, with increased local supplies of roundwood it should be possible to
ease this ban shortly.
5.        Roundwood consumption by industries and its source is shown in
Figures 6963 and 6965. Projections in Table 5 indicate a steady increase in
production, ensuring Finland an equivalent market share in the future.

FINLAND
FOREST IMPROVEIENT PROJECT
Institutions Associated with the Forest Improvement Program
A. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
1.        The M-finistry of Agriculture and Forestry is located in Helsinki
and includes departments responsible for agriculture, veterinary services,
fishing and hunting, and forestry.  The Forestry Department is headed by
a professional forester and has a small planning unit. Administration is
the responsibility of a national bureau with two central boards (one Finnish-
and the other Swedish-speaking) and 19 district boards (see Organization
Charts 6901 and 6902). Details of the structure of boards and the associated
Research Institute are given below:
(a) National Forestry Board (NFB). This national bureau, with
its headquarters in Helsinki, is headed by a director general
in charge of operations and consists of two snajor departments,
one for state forestry (not part of the project) and one for
private forestry, each headed by a director; the Private
Forestry Department has divisions responsible for private
forestry and education and training, with sections handling
accounts and statistics. The Forestry Education and
Training Division is concerned with questions relating to
state and private forestry schools. There are seven
forestry colleges, one foreman school, six forest labor
schools, 1 forest machinery school and one school for forest
owners. The forestry colleges are institutes for the
training of forest technicians and include an institute for
forest economics. Forest improvement works are the
responsibility of the Chief of the Forest Improvement Office
within the Private Forestry Division; this office deals with
all matters concerning the forest improvement program, both
at the planning and operational levels.
(b) The Central Forestry Boards (CFB). There are two CFBs -
TAPIO and Skogskultur; the former operates in Finnish-
speaking parts of Finland (altogether 17 districts), the
latter, a much smaller organization, in two forest districts
where Swedish is spoken. The CFBs are the main executive
agencies responsible for forestry. Each CFB is headed by
a board of nine members and operates under the control of a
director, subject to the supervision of the N'FB. Of the nine



ANNEX 2
Page 2
board members, four are appointed by the Minister of Agricul-
ture and Forestry (two each from the forest industry
and the workers' trade unions) and four represent forest
owners; the ninth is the director of the CFB. From their
Helsinki head offices, the two CFBs extend their activities
through field offices to District Forestry Boards (DFB) and
Forest Improvement Districts (FID). Each DFB and FID has
a small staff of foresters, forest technicians and clerical
personnel headed by a chief forester. The two CFBs maintain,
at present, a total staff of 822 including 78 graduate
foresters, 135 forest technicians, 109 administrative and
clerical personnel and 500 foremen and work leaders. Based
on the five-year IERA III plan, the CFBs prepare yearly
detailed work programs with estimated costs and financial
plans which include estimates of forest owners' contributions
and Government financial aid.
(c)  The District Forestry Boards (DFB).  There are 19 DFBs (17 in
Finnish- and two in Swedish-speaking areas) which operate under
the direction of a chief forester subject to supervision from
the Central Boards. Each DFB has seven members acting in a
consultative capacity: two appointed by the NF (one each
from the forest industry and the workers' trade unions);
four members nominated by the Forest Management Association
(see below) representing private forest owners; and one
supplementary member also appointed by NFB. DFB staffing varies
with requirements of each district and includes three or more
foresters with technical and clerical staff. At present, there
are 140 foresters, 277 forest technicians and 130 clerical and
other staff. DFB's are primarily concerned with regulatory
functions including the granting of authority to forest owners
(both farmers and companies) to fell mature timber and to
ensure that, in accordance with the Private Forest Law, owners
replant after felling and observe good silvicultural practices.
The DFBs' concern with the forest improvement program is limited
to work on mineral soil areas and in company forests.
(d) Forest Improvement Districts (FI1)). These Districts (17),
with only a few exceptions, follow the boundaries of DFBs with
their own technical staff and offices. They operate in-
dependently from the DFBs and have their own technical staff.
They are directly responsible to the Central Boards and are
the principal agency for the execution of forest improvement
programs under the Forest Improvement Law. They prepare the
final contract documents and are ultimately responsible for
implementation of the improvement works. The division of
responsibility between FIDs and DFBs is largely historical
and it is likely that the two organizations will be amalgamat-
ed in the future.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(e)  Forest Management Associations (FMA).  The Associations (338)
operate under the Forest Management Association Law under the
guidance and supervision of the Central and District Forestry
Boards. Their main responsibility is to provide forest
owners with assistance in planning, work leadership and other
technical matters. In accordance with the Forest Improvement
Law, the DFBs can, on their own responsibility, delegate the
planning and implementation of forest improvement work to FMAs.
Each forest owner whose forest has a minimum annual yield of
20 m3 is obliged by law to contribute towards the cost of
his FNIA, each of which has a technical staff of between one
and four.
2.        Within the framework of this organizational pattern extending from
the Private Forestry Division of the National Forestry Board to the Forest
Management Associations, roughly 1,300 staff are employed, of whom 240 are
graduate foresters and the rest are forest technicians or the equivalent.
TAPIO is responsible for the educational program for staff working in private
forests (currently 52 graduate foresters, 177 forest technicians, 360
foremen and 73 office personnel). Training courses are conducted at all
staff levels. In 1970-71, training comprised courses for foremen (basic
forestry and drainage), technicians (drainage and road construction) and
graduates (peatland and classification).
(f)  The Finnish Forest Research Institute.  The Institute was
founded in 1917 and is responsible for research in the field
of forestry; it is also responsible for determining the
National Allowable Drain (NAD). It is subordinate to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and has departments of:
soil science; peatland forestry; silviculture; forest pathology;
forest inventory and yield; forest technology; forest economics;
forest zoology; mathematics; and forest genetics. Besides
the research departments, there are offices responsible for
administration, experimental forests (71,000 ha), nature
conservation, regional forest experimental stations (four) and
an experimental nursery.  The staff consists of the director,
13 professors, six senior research specialists, 65 other
researchers and about 200 supporting personnel. The annual
budget of the Institute is Fmk 11 million (US$2.7 million).
Research results are published in the series of the Institute.
B. Other Government Departments
3.        Other departments of Government include:
(a) Provincial Boards charged with the management of loans
granted under the forest improvement program. The Boards
are provincial administrative authorities, subordinate to
the Ministry of Interior, covering various regional matters



ANNEX 2
Page 4
falling within the competence of several ministries. They
act as general treasury and accounts authorities collecting
income and receiving payments for Government. In this
capacity they have been charged with administration of the
NFB loan portfolio. They maintain a register of all loans
falling within their jurisdiction based on detailed lists
furnished by the NFB, and undertake annual collection of
interest and principal repayments of outstanding loans.
(b) The Post Office Bank. In the channelling of Government funds
for forest improvement works under the program, the NFB uses
the banking services of the Post Office Bank. Within a svstem
of giro accounts, transfers of funds are made by the NFB _o
field offices. Similarly, loan repayments collected by the
Provincial Boards are credited to the Treasury's giro account.
C. Other Forest Research and Education Facilities
4.        These include:
(a) The National Research Council for Agriculture and Forestry.
This is one of the National Research Councils of the Academy
of Science in Finland. The Council employs researchers
up to Ph.D. level, and allocates grants for equipment,
travel expenses, employment of assistants and personnel
allowances. At the beginning of 1972, the Council employed
14 forestry researchers, and allocated Fmk 250,000 (US$61,000)
in grants.
(b) The Foundation for Forest Tree Breeding promotes research in
forest genetics and supplies information and publications
relating to this field. The Foundation studies, tests and
produces genetically improved seedlings, and develops
nursery methods and seed-orchard practices.
(c) The State Institute for Technical Research and the Finnish
Pulp and Paper Research Institute. These institutes undertake
most of the research in wood technology and wood-processing
techniques.
D. Associations Representing Forest Industries and Farmers
5.        Two associations represent the companies and farmers:
(a) The Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries. The
Association has a Forestry Department dealing with forest
policy, the coordination of forest improvement work and the



ANNEX 2
Page 5
compilation of statistics from company-owned forests. A work
study section, supported by more than 50 forest industry
companies, improves harvesting methods and tests machinery
and forest improvement equipment; research results are published.
(b)  The Central Union of Agricultural Producers (MTK).  The MTK
is an economic and political association representing Finnish-
speaking farmers. No preference is given to size (25% of
farms are smaller than 5 ha), type of production or farm
location; MTK is independent and the power of decision belongs
to members. Total membership was about 408,000 in 1969.
A corresponding union, SLC, exists for Swedish-speaking
agricultural producers and has a total membership of 22,000.
HITK represents its members in negotiations with Government,
over forest laws and matters of policy; and the wood processing
industry, over timber prices.
E. The Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry of the University of Helsinki
6.        The University of Helsinki is responsible for higher education and
carries out research. Its faculty includes the following departments: silvi-
culture; forest mensuration and inventory; social economics of forestry;
logging and utilization of forest products; peatland forestry; business economics
of forestry; forest-products marketing; farm forestry; agricultural and
forest zoology; and plant biology and plant pathology. The staff of the
faculty includes 12 professors, 3 assistant professors and 15 lecturers.
tUost of the results of the research carried out in the faculty appear in
the series "Acta Forestalia Fennica", "Silva Fennica" a,nd articles published
by the Finnish Society of Forestry. Students in the faculty study for the
degrees of Bachelor of Forestry, Master of Agriculture and Forestry,
Licentiate of Forestry and Doctor of Forestry. The forestry examination for
the Bachelor's degree provides the qualifications required for practical
forestry. Studies for the forestry exanination last 4-5 years, and consists
of theoretical studies and practical training. The total number of
Bachelors of Forestry working in the profession is currently about 1,700.
F. Institutional Changes under the Forest Improvement Project
Forest Improvement Advisory Committee to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
7.        The administration of the forest improvement program is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry through the
NFB and its Central and District Boards. There is need for greater national
coordination of effort and to provide this a committee, advisory to the



A2REX 2
Page 6
Minister of Agriculture and Forests, would be established under the project.
Mlembership would include:
a senior representative from the Bank of Finland;
senior representatives from the Ministries of Finance
and Agriculture and Forestry;
an independent banker or financier; and
a senior forestry specialist from the Forest Research
Institute or the University of Helsinki.
The chairman would be nominated by the Minister. The committee would advise
the Minister on all matters of national policy, economic planning and
implementation of the forest improvement program. It would be serviced by the
Forestry Department in the Ministry, which would be strengthened for this
purpose (para 9).
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Forestry Boards
8.        The existing multi-institutional system serving the forest
improvement program is the product of a historical process of continued
cooperation between the Government forestry service and semi-autonomous
organizations representing private forest owners, and recently, the wood-
working industry and labor. Under the general control of the NFB, the
CFBs and District Boards administer the program. There is some overlap of
responsibility between the DFBs and FIDs, but this does ensure that the
regulatory functions of the former are separated from improvement operations,
mainly the responsibility of FID. In general, the operating procedure
corresponds to the requirements of this multiple operation. As noted, there
is need for more integration of some of the institutional activities, but
of greater concern is the lack in feedback of information, particularly
financial, on all operations. At present NFB receives little information
on the activities of the Provincial Board in the administration of its loan
portfolio.
9.        Under the project the Ministry, the NFB and the CFBs would be
strengthened as follows:
(1)  The Department of Forestry of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry.  A senior forest economist would be appeinted with
supporting staff including one economist and one clerical
officer. The department would provide the secretariat for
the Forestry Improvement Advisory Committee (para 7) and would
be responsible for the economic assessment of the national
forest improvement program. It would also monitor the project's
achievements.

(2) The NFB. A financial analyst would be appointed to join the
Private Forestry Office and would be supported by clerical
staff. He would be responsible for maintainaing a summary
record of the loan portfolio of the forest i-mprovement project,
and more specifically of the project.
(3)  The CFBs.  To administer the enlarged program additional
staff would be appointed to TAPIO, Skogskultur and the
District Boards consisting of: 20 professional foresters;
39 technical foresters; 15 foremen; and 23 clerical officers.

FOREST IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
NERA: Finland's Forest Improvement Program
Background
1.        Finland's wood exports are vital to the country's economy, emphasiz-
ing the need to protect, improve and maintain the productivity of its forests.
To this end, the National Forestry Board (NFB) was established in 1859 with
prime responsibility for state forests. In 1907 the two Central Forestry
Boards (CFBs), Finnish-speaking TAPIO and its Swedish-speaking counterpart,
Skogskultur, were formed to promote private forestry; in 1917. upon the inde-
pendence of Finland the NFB became a responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry; and in 1928 the first of a series of Forest
Improvement Laws was promulgated which created the country's 19 District
Forestry Boards (DFBs).
2.        These laws charged the NFB and CFBs with pow(ers to grant loans
and subsidies for improvement works in private forests and entrusted the
District Boards with supervisory responsibilities. An amendment to the
law established the NFB as the principal forest author:Lty and the scope of
its activities was broadened to include responsibility for both state and
private forests. At the same time the CFBs' powers of supervision over DFBs
were extended.
3.        The post-war expansion of the Finnish forest industry greatly
increased the demand for industrial roundwood. This was supplied from
domestic forests supplemented by small imports, mainly from the USSR. As
the possibility of substantially increasing imports of roundwood was
unrealistic, it was appreciated that additional supplies could only be
obtained through an increase in national forest growth.
4.        In 1964 a committee, formed originally on private initiative,
presented to Government a plan for financing forest improvement works. The
working group, MERA, represented all parties with interests in Finnish
forestry. Financial provision was made in the 1965 budget to begin implemen-
tation of the plan (MERA I), and initial funds were ra:Lsed by the sale of
forest development bonds. The program was revised in 1966, and MERA II
prepared covering the period 1967/70. MERA I and II formed the basis of
Government's forest improvement program. An assessmenit of results indicated
that if Government were to achieve its objective to supply the wood-using
industry's expanding requirements, it would be necessairy to extend the
program to all forests in Finland. The NERA III plan c-overed the period
1970/75 and included provision for forest improvement works in State, private
and company owned forests. Annual provision is made in the national budget.
Between 1967 and 1971 there has been an annual increase in investment of about
10% in forest improvement works.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        The following operations are included in the 1-IIhRA program:
-    artificial regeneration, including seeding and afforestation
of treeless and arable land areas, reforestation of
understocked forests and planting of drained peatland;
-    seedling stand improvemenc (silvicultural operatiGns in
poorly stocked stands);
-    forest fertilization, including the basic application of
fertilizers in connection with the establishment of new
stands, and final fertilization in mature stands before
regeneration and final felling;
drainage, mainly of peatland; and
forest road construction (for access and prior to exploitation).
Legislation Governing the Forest Improvement Program
6.        Three laws apply:
(i)  The Private Forest Law of September 15, 1967, provides for
sound management of private forests and regulates harvesting
operations. It stipulates sanctions for violations, and
makes provision for assistance with forest regeneration works;
DFBs carry out supervisory and law enforcement functions under
this law.
(ii)  The Forestry Board Lawq of September 15, 1967, provides that
promotional and supervisory functions in regard to private
forests shall be entrusted to the CFBs (TAPIO and Skogskultur)
and the DFBs; it further stipulates that the boards shall be
subject to the control and direction of the NFB. The law
includes provision for representation on the boards, their
powers, administration and financing channels.
(iii) The Forest Improvement Law of September 15, 1967, provides
the financial and administrative basis for Government aid for
private forestry improvement works. It stipulates that
"adequate appropriations for forest improvement activity
shall be provided in the State's annual budget." It also
specifies: the improvement works covered by the law; the
category of aid to be provided from public funds whether
grants or loans for each of the improvement operations; and
the proportion of Government aid to be allocated to the
different DFBs (favoring those located in the north).



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Financing of MERA
7.        The estimates included in NERA III assume that Government and
forest industry companies will finance all improvement works to be carried
out on their own land. The funds required for improvement works in privately
owned forests are provided in part by the owner himself, supplemented by
loans and grants made available through the national budget. The level of
this assistance is determined by the location of the forest (the further
north the greater the assistance) and the category of improvement works.
The scale of assistance available is shown in Annex 6, paragraph 6.
Progress of MERA in Physical and Financial Terms
8.        Details of the improvement works carried out between 1950 and
1971 are in Tables 1-6. The annual program now averages:
-    140,000 ha seeding and planting;
-    290,000 ha of drainage;
-    180,000 ha of fertilization (from 500 ha in 1960); and
-      2,700 km of roads.
9.        The total cost of the HERA II and III programs and arrangements
for financing in the 1967-71 period are summarized below:

Yearly Average             98.4             129.6              117.1
The cost of the program during the five-year period amounted to Fmk 586
million (US$14.3 million), an increase in average annual expenditure from
Fmk 98 million (US$23.9 million) in the first two years to Fmk 130 million
(US$31.7 million) in the subsequent three years. Of the total cost of
the program, Fmk 300 million (US$73.2 million) (51%) was provided from the
Government budget. A comparison of actual and planned expenditure 1967-71
is given below:

/1   Preliminary figures.
Past Record of Loan Repayment by Forest Owners
10.       At December 31, 1971 there were loans totalling Fmk 66.87 million
(US$16.3 million) outstanding under the program, of which Fmk 137,300
(US$33,500) (0.2%) was in arrears for payments of principal and interest.
Of this amount, Fuk 15,300 (US$3,700) (from 125 loans) had been overdue for
more than one year, representing 10.5% of the total number and 11% of the
total amount of loans in arrears. This is a very satisfactory performance
on the part of the borrowers and is due to the collection methods employed
by the Provincial Boards which are identical with those applied in the collec-
tion of Government tax.

FOREST IMPROVENENT PROJECT
National Allowable Drain
1.        Scandinavian forests have for a long time been treated by
policy makers and foresters as a national asset that ha; to be maintained
on a perpetual basis. From an economic standpoint it m:Lght be argued
that it would be better to realize that asset by harvesiting the forests
without replanting and investing in other sectors of the economy. The main
argument against this is the comparative advantage of forestry in Finland
which is due to: poor alternative land use; good infrastructure for trans-
port within the country; and closeness and good transport facilities to the
European market.  Also, from an ecological and environmental standpoint it
would be unacceptable to clearfell a great proportion of the Finnish
forests without reforestation. It is principally for these reasons that
Finland has a sizable forest industry with well developed techniques and a
substantial share of the world market. Government intends to continue its
present policy, to keep its share of the world market and thus increase
industrial output (Annex 1).
2.        To be able to meet the future demand for roundwood from the
wood-working industries, the country as a whole has to plan the exploitation
of its wood resource. For this purpose the Forest Research Institute (FRI)
calculates the National Allowable Drain (NAD) in order to establish how
much wood can be harvested annually on the basis of sustained yield. In
calculating the level of NAD the FRI must establish the volume and growth
function for every locality, age class and tree species (obtained from the
national inventory). Assuming a certain silvicultural system, the volume
which is ready for cutting every year in the future carn be calculated.
3.        When there is an over-representation of older age classes (as is
the case in Finland) the volume ready for cutting is greater in the inmediate
future than in later years. In order to even out this difference and to
have a constant flow of wood from the forest, some of the mature wood is
used as a "bank" to be harvested in coming years when the quantity of
maturing wood is smaller. To illustrate the concept of NAD without the
project, the following three cases can be given; all are based on a hypo-
thetical area of 90 ha of which 80 ha is productive forest and 10 ha peatland.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(a) In case 1, the area of 80 ha is newly planted. 1/
There is no mature forest available and the
allowable drain is zero.
(b) In case 2, the forest has a "normal age distribution"
(1 ha of every age class). The allowable drain from
this forest would be 1/80th of the area, i.e., 1 ha
producing, say, 250 m3.
(c) In case 3, the forest of 80 ha is mature, i.e.,
80 years old. The allowable drain however, would also
be 1/80th of the area. The rest of the forest has to
be reserved for future years if the forest is to be
treated on a sustained yield basis.
4.        If the concept of sustained yield is to be observed strictly,
any increase in production from the forests, resulting from forest
improvement works, should also be spread equally over the years, and not
harvested immediately 2/. It might be possible however, to harvest a
larger proportion of the increased production in the near future without
violating the concept of long-term sustained yield, if the forest improve-
ment program continued at the same level 3/. If the more rigid sustained
yield concept is followed, and an immediate increase in allowable drain
is desired, early investment in forest improvement works would have to be
substantially higher than would be the case with a continuing forest
improvement program. A continuing program of investment would help to
delay costs and/or hasten benefits.
5.        To illustrate the concept of an immediate increase in the
allowable drain, the three cases mentioned above can be considered under
project conditions. The forest improvement investment would have a different
impact on each case. If I ha of peatland was drained and seeded this
would give an increase in annual production which could be harvested
after 80 years.
(a) In case 1 (with a young forest), the allowable drain
would remain zero.
(b) In case 2 (with "normal" age distribution), the benefit
of the increased production would come after 80 years,
1/   This example assumes the forest to be ready for clearfelling after 80
years when the area felled would be reforested in accordance with the
Private Forest Law.
2/   This would mean that the NAD would remain at a constant level in the
future if no further measures to increase production were taken.
3/   This would, however, mean a lower NAD in the future if no further
production-increasing measures were taken.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
and the annual allowable drain would be at the same
level as without the project except for year 80 when
it would double.
(c) In case 3 (with mature forests), the allowable drain
would increase in the first year by the total addition-
al quantity of wood anticipated to result from the
improvement operation (say 250 m3); this could be
harvested in the mature forest. The rationale behind
this is that the additional wood resulting from the
forest improvement which would mature in year 80 would
replace the wood harvested (250 m3) and scheduled for
felling in that year.
6.        As Finland has an over-representation of mature forests, it is
possible to harvest now from these forests a quantity of wood equal to
part of the yield anticipated from forest improvement works and expected
to mature at a later date. Calculations by the FRI have defined the propor-
tion of the total increased yield resulting from the project which can be
harvested in mature forests outside the improved areas, while at the same
time maintaining sustained yields. The remainder of the total increased
yield would be obtained from harvesting of actual improved areas. This
would normally take place seven years after fertilization of forests on
mineral soils; 20 years after fertilization of peatland forest; inter-
inttently following drainage of forests of different maturity; and 80 years
after seeding and planting.

FOREST bIPROVEMENT PROJECT
The Forest Resource and Ownership
The Forest Resource
1.        Finland has the advantage of having three major economic species:
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), covering 44% of the total forest area; Norway
spruce (Picea abies) 37%; and mixed hardwoods, mainly birch (Betula verrucosa),
19%. Birch has been seriously neglected and until recently was considered
mainly a firewood species, but with the expanding demand for birch plywood
and the use of this species in mixture with conifers for pulp manufacture
it is being favored increasingly during improvement operations. The spruce
forests, used for the manufacture of sulphite pulp, are the most vigorous of
Finland's forests and are mainly in the south on better sites where the
mean annual increment (growth) is estimated at 3.7 m3/ha. 1/  With improved
management of fully stocked stands it is estimated that the mean annual
increment of these spruce forests could be increased substantially. Scots
pine produces the most popular sawn timber and is used for sulphate pulp.
It is found throughout Finland and is the principal species used in the
afforestation program.
2.        Rotation length (the time it takes from planting to produce mature
timber) varies from about 75 years in the south to over 200 years in the
north near the limit of tree vegetation. These northern forests have been
overcut in recent years and exploitation is now reduced; they have not been
included in the project area. The most comprehensive information on Finnish
forests was obtained from the inventory carried out in 1951 (the third
inventory) and published between 1955 and 1960. Subsequent inventories were
carried out in 1960-63 (the fourth) and 1965-70 (the fifth).
Forest Areas and Ownership
3.        Forest land is increasing as a result of swamp reclamation works
and the afforestation of surplus and marginal agriculturatl land (Table 1).
1/   m3 solid measure excluding bark is used throughout the report except
where otherwise indicated.

5.        Table 3 provides details of forest ownership.  During the last
50 years forest land owned by the state has decreased by 33%, mostly since
World War II due to resettlement of the agricultural population from areas
ceded to USSR. 65% of Finland's forest area is now farmer-owned, 25%
State-owned, and the balance divided between company forests (7%) and
communes and parishes (3%). The average farm forest is 32 ha (in the project
area 30 ha) and the median holding 20 ha.  State forests are mainly in
the north and thus least productive; 78% of timber production is derived
from privately-owned forests, 13% from State forests, 6% from company-owned
forests, and the balance of 3% from forests owned by communes and parishes.
Calculation of the National Allowable Drain, 1970
6.        The mean annual increment of Finland's forests, as calculated
from the fifth inventory, is about 2.5 m /ha under bark, giving 47.6 million
m3/year 1/ of which 42.2 million m3 derives from forest iLn the project area
(Table 4). The annual allowable drain in 1970 (i.e. maxiLmum drain providing
a sustained annual yield in perpetuity) was 49.8 million m3 (in the project
area 44.2 million m (Table 5)). The allowable drain thus exceeds the gross
increment by 2.3 million m3. These calculations, made by the Finnish
Forest Research Institute, are based on data collected during the five
inventories and take account of increment, species, the age structure of
the forest and silvicultural treatment, including forest improvement works
now in progress. Details by species in 1970 for the who:Le country and the
project area are given below:

Details of the allowable drain by Forestry Board Districits are in Table
5.  An increase in the allowable drain can be achieved by raising the
intensity of forest improvement works. The project will finance part
of this program; if the NERA program continues at the present level, the
future levels of drain will be 55 million m3 in 1980, 58 million m3 in
1990, and 64 million m3 by the year 2000.
1/   Theoretically, annual growth could be increased by the use of seed of
higher yielding provenances, better stocking of timber stands, and a
more even distribution of age classes.

FOREST IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Technical Data: Forest Improvement Activities in the! Project Area
Seeding, Planting and Fertilization
1.        Seeding and planting and forest fertilization are mainly manual but
mechanization is increasing. Artificial regeneration consists of about 18%
seeding, involving pine only, the amount of seeds used per hectare being 0.4
kg. The main operation, however, is planting where seedlings used per hectare
are: pine - 2,200, spruce - 2,000 and birch - 1,600. The proportion of
species planted and seeded in the project area in 1970 was pine 56%, spruce
41% and others 3%. Fertilizer applications recommended are:
(a) for young peatland stands 500 kg/ha of PK mixture; and
(b) for mineral soils near harvesting age, urea 300 kg/ha
(N=46%) and saltpeter 500-600 kg/ha (N=26%).
Drainage and Road Construction
2.        Forest drainage and road construction are undertaken primarily with
machines. Technical standards for drainage and forest road building are laid
down in the Forest Improvement Law. Depending on the gradient, yield class
and depth of the peat layer of the area to be drained, forest ditches are
dug from 30 to 50 m apart and with a density of about 270 m/ha. The mean
depth of an ordinary forest ditch, other than a main drain, is 0.75 m and
the mean volume is 0.70 m3/m length. A concave shape for the ditch is used
on the basis of recommendations from the Forest Research Institute (FRI). In
ditching, the aim is a minimum gradient of 1 in 1,000 and, in the case of
covered ditches, which are still largely experimental, two to three times
more. In addition to forest ditches on open peat, shallow ditches or
furrows 2-6 m apart are dug to encourage drainage.  Outlets for forest
drainage include lakes, rivers, streams, drains alongside roads, agricul-
tural drains and main drains made specially for forest: drainage. The mean
volume of a main drain is 1.3 m3/m; main drains comprise 7% of all drains
constructed.
3.        Forest roads are in three categories:  main forest roads, forest
truck roads, light forest and tractor roads; the technical details are:

Loans and Grants Available
4.        Within the provision of the Forest Improvement Law the NFB and
CFBs may grant Government financial support to forest owners to meet the
cost in whole or in part of planning and construction of approved forest
improvement works. Assistance to the companies is not covered by the Law
but credit facilities would be available as part of the project.
5.        The loans to companies would have a rate of interest  equivalent
to a commercial bank loan 1/ with no grace period. The repayment
periods for the various operations would be for road building - 10 years;
for fertilization before harvesting - 6 years; and planting, seeding,
seedling stand improvement, drainage and fertilization of seedling stands -
15 years. Companies would not be eligible for grants.
6.        Under the Forest Improvement Law a farmer can receive loans or
grants or a combination of the two, in various proportions dependent on his
financial status, the type of operation and the location of his farm. In
determining his financial status, account is taken of the size of the forest,
its growth potential and the farmer's income from all sources; as regards
the forest location, there are five zones (of which three lie within the
project): Zone 1 (in the south) comprising DFBs 1-9; Zone II, DFBs 10-14;
and Zone III, DFBs 15-17 (see Map 1096). The basic rules used in determining
loans and grants are:
1/   Estimated in May 1972 as between 8% and 8-1/2% per annum.

Yields and Cost Savings from Forest Improvement Operations
7.        The project benefits derived from four of the five forest improve-
ment operations take the form of an increase in yield. The fifth, road
construction, results in savings in transport costs during timber exploita-
tion. Studies undertaken by the FRI have determined the following levels
of increased yield and from a study of the data seem reasonable.
(a) Seeding and Planting. The increase in yields over the
country vary between 0.5 and 3 m3/ha/year dependent on
site quality, locality and species. As no seeding and
planting operations are included in northern Finland
(Districts 16-19), the areas of slowest growth, the
average increase in yield from this operation has been
calculated to be 2 ma/ha/year.
(b)  Peatland Drainage and Seedling Stand Improvement.  These
two improvement operations combine to give an average
annual increase in yield of 1.3 m3/ha/year for 20 years
provided drains are maintained.
(c) Fertilization. This operation falls into two categories:
(i)  on mineral soils when the benefits of fertilization
last for about seven years, the average increase in
yield has been calculated as 1 m3/ha/year (research
results show a variation between 1 m3 and 2 m3/ha/year);
where fertilization of mineral soil stands is carried out
as a pre-harvesting operation, the increase has been
shown to be between 30 and 35% of the stand increment; and



ANNEX 6
Page 5
(ii)  on peatlands the benefits derived from fertilization
last for over 20 years due to a slower breakdown of
chemicals and the activation of the microfauna in
peat; the yield increase has been taken as 1.6 m3/ha/year
(the variation by site and locality is from l-2 m /ha/year).
8.        Derived from the four operations (drainage and stand improvement
of peatland being combined), the increased yields resulting from the
project are:

A total of 31 million m3 during Years 1 to 20.
9.        The benefits from road construction are derived from savings in
transport costs. The total length of forest roads financed by the project
would be 8,405 km. The average transport distance from tree to road is
250 m; on this basis 100 ha would be served by each km of road. It has
been assumed after an examination of FRI data that (a) harvesting would
take place annually during the second, third and fourth years after building
the road; (b) of the area served, 35% would have no fellings, 25% would be
thinned and 40% would be clearfelled; and (c) the drain over three years
from thinning would be 10 m3/ha and from clearfelling 150 m3/ha.

10.       The area served by one km of road would comprise!
45 ha with no felling                    -

Fmk 2,770/km/year for three years of road constructed.

Project Costs
Administrative Costs
1.        Administrative costs involving the CFBs, DFBs and FIDs are based
on present experience (under the ongoing forest improvement program);
altogether 55% of the activities of the Boards are concerned with the
project. (The remaining 45% is related to other activities such as harvesting
control, reforestation of forest land and afforestation of arable land, all
activities outside the project.) The administrative costs incurred by
farmers, companies, Provincial Boards and the Post Office Bank in connection
with the project which are small, have been excluded.
2.        Provision has been made for additional staff required for the
efficient management of the project:
(a) Department of Forestry (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) and NFB
1 senior economist;
1 financial analyst;
1 economist; and
2 clerical officers.
(b) CFBs and District Boards
20 professional foresters;
39 technical foresters;
15 foremen; and
23 office personnel.
Staff employed under the project are shown in Table 1, together with a cost
summary which includes salaries and all administrative expenses.

3.        Details of physical forest improvement works are given in Table 2;
unit costs have been taken from the ongoing improvement program and are in
Table 3. All are at 1972 price levels and include a price contingency of 5%
to take account of probable cost increases. No physical contingencies have
been included in view of the reliable cost data available from past programs
and the credit nature of the project. Costs are broken down to labor,
materials and machine costs with the foreign exchange component.

FOREST IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Long-Term Market Outlook for Forest Products in hurope
1.        World demand outlook for forest products as a whole is excellent.
According to FAO, world requirements of industrial wood are expected to
grow at 2.7%/year between 1962 and 1975 and 3%/year during 1975-1985. 1/
2.        A majority of Finland's forest product exports are destined for
other European countries. Table 1 shows the projected consumption, domestic
supply and net imports of industrial wood in Europe (incLuding Eastern
Europe but excluding USSR), based on the latest long-term projections of
the FAO Timber Committee. The table also shows the estiimated actuals for
1970 along with the original projections. Between 1965 and 1970, supply in
Europe increased more rapidly than anticipated. In the same period, however,
consumption increased even more rapidly, with the result that actual net
imports in 1970 were about 8 million m3 wood raw material equivalent (WRME)
(or 20%) ahead of the original projection. It is safe to assume that the
potential gap between consumption and domestic supply -- i.e., the potential
net imports -- around 1975 and after will be well ahead of what was originally
projected. From the viewpoint of overall forest product marketing in Europe,
Finland's planned output of various processed forest products in the period
up to 1980 should be easily absorbed by the European market.
3.        Major categories of processed forest products that concern the
project are: (a) sawnwood (especially softwood), (b) wood-based panel
products, and (c) wood pulp of various types. Following is a brief summary
of the long-term demand and price outlook for each of these products.
4.        Consumption of sawnwood in Europe has been growing slowly.  Sawn
softwood consumption increased at 2.0%/year in 1960-1970 (Table 2). It is
expected to grow at an even slower rate of 0.7% in 1970-1980. Prices,
however, are not expected to decline. Prices of sawn softwood in current
U.S. dollar terms have been rising steadily since the mid-1950's. For
example, wholesale prices of red wood (pine) and white wood (spruce) in
Sweden, the leading exporter in Europe ahead of Finland, have been rising
at 1.7-2.0%/year in current U.S. dollar terms (Table 3), or at about the
same rate as the U.S. general wholesale price index (which increased at
1.8%/year in 1957-1970). The prices are expected to move in a similar
manner in the future.

5.        Consumption of wood-based panels in Europe has been rising
rapidly -- e.g., at 11.5%/year in 1960-1970. During the 1970-19S0 docade,
it is expected to grow at a much slower but still respectable rate of about
4.1-5.3% 1/, which implies an income elasticity of around unity.  Although
prices of wood-based panels are expected to continue to declire %radually
up to 1980 due to expected advancement of technology in this field, prices
of logs will tend to rise, or at worst hold at the average level of tiie
1960's.
6.        World consumption of paper products (hence wood pulp) has been
rising rapidly for the last two decades (e.g., at 5.9%/year in 1951-1969;
and is expected to grow at 5.3%/year in the 1968-1985 period.  Consu.aption
of paper, paperboard and dissolving pulp in Europe will grow at 5.5%/year
(Table 2) in the 1970-1980 decade. Average export prices of various
types of wood pulp in Sweden, a leading exporter of pulp and paper, have
been fluctuating around a stable trend in current dollar terms; however,
in constant dollar terms, these prices have been declining (Table 4). This
declining trend in prices has been due to the secular improvement in
pulp-making technology. Roundwood prices in constant dollar terms have
not been declining in the last 15 years or so. Pulpwood prices in constant
dollar terms are not expected to decline over the 1972-1980 period.
1/   An FAO study, "A Reappraisal of the Outlook for the Future 1968 to
1980", presented at the Third Session of the FAO Committee on Wood-
Based Panel Products (December 1970), projected Europe's consumption
to grow at 5.3%/year in the 1970-1980 period.

FOREST DIPROVEMENT PROJECT
Financial Implications for Farmers
Introduction
1.        In the economic evaluation of the project (Annex 12) the increase
in the allowable annual drain (estimated to be equal to the increased annual
production) resulting from the project is realized as an annual benefit.
The concept of the allowable drain as it applies to the national forest
resource and to individually owned forests is discussed in Annex 4. Farmer-
owned forests are of uneven age, are not representative of all age classes
and because of their small size are not normally managed commercially. They
tend to be used as a "bank" and timber is harvested when capital is required.
It is therefore difficult to quantify benefits accruing to farmers and to
arrive with any degree of accuracy, at a rate of return on their investment.
However if certain theoretical assumption are made some indication of the
return on their investments can be calculated.
2.        If all forest owners participated in the forest improvement project
and each carried out improvement works in proportion to the size of his
forest, the average farmer could harvest annually the increased production
resulting from his forest improvement works. However, records of past im-
provement operations indicate that some 60,000 farmers (of a total of 330,000
farmers) owning 30% of the farmer-owned forests would participate in the
project. Under these circumstances the average farmer's share of the in-
creased annual allowable drain would be an estimated 30% of the total in-
creased yield in his forest resulting from the improvement: operations he
has carried out. The balance would be harvested in other forests in Finland
as part of the National Allowable Drain.
Financial Rate of Return
3.        In calculating the rate of return it has been assumed that farmers
have invested in a "package" of improvement works (includ:Lng each of the
project improvement operations). For a typical farmer participating in the
project (with 50 ha of forest), the total investment 1/ in improvement works
during the project period would be:

/1   Comprising drainage on 8.0 ha and seedling stand improvement on 4.0 ha
of the drained area; increased yield for the 8.0 ha is 1.3 m3/year.
Road construction would result in a cost reduction of wood transport during
harvesting of existing stands of Fmk 2,770/km of road over three years or,
in this case, 0.1 x Fmk 2,770 - Fmk 270/year; it is assumed that this cost
reduction would result in a correspondingly higher price of wood at stump.
5.        The total increased yield in the farmer's forest is shown above.
The allowable drain, however, would be:
-    for years 1 to 7, 7.9 m3/year (30% of yield from seeding and
planting, drainage and fertilization);
-    for years 8 to 20, 5.8 m3/year (30% of yield from seeding and
planting, drainage and peatland fertilization); and
-    for years 21 to 30, 4.3 m3/year (30% of yield from seeding
and planting and drainage).
Roundwood would be sold at the net stumpage price of Fmk 32/m3 (US$7.8/m3)

rate of return to the farmer would be 11%. Without a grant the rate of
return would be negative.

(b) Contingencies. None are included. The project costs do not
include physical contingencies and price increases would
apply equally to costs and benefits and would cancel out.
(c) Labor. Without the project, labor would not be fully
employed. The labor cost (61% of project cost) has been
shadow-rated to 80% of the cost of labor employed.
(d) Maintenance costs. These are based on past records and
include gapping (replanting of failed areas) three years
after planting; tending of seeded stands, 6 and 12 years
after seeding; maintenance of drains, after 9 years; and
road maintenance, 9 years after construction.
(e)  Harvesting and Transport to Mill.    dLs anoaournt to Fmk
33/m' (US$8/MOW) under bark.
(f) Additional annual drain resulting from the project. Increased
growth would be obtained in all forests given forest improve-
ment treatment. The actual growth by operations is shown in
Annex 6 and comprises, dependent on the operation, both
immature wood and wood ready for harvesting. (Seeding and
planting would not result in wood suitable for harvesting
until year 20 when thinnings would be due, while stands
treated with fertilizer could be harvested from year 8 onwards.)
However, by harvesting equivalent quantities of wood from
mature stands, the additional growth from the project could
be harvested annually (see also Annex 4 where th4 concept of
National Allowable Drain is discussed). The additional
wood produced annually as a result of the project is shown
below. This increase in production has been taken as the

project benefit and is valued at the international price
for roundwood delivered millgate, conservatively estimated
to be Fmk 70/m3 (US$17.07) 1/.  The price level is assumed
to be stable over the period.

The Forest Research Institute (FRI), in determining the NAD, takes account
of all factors associated with the national forest resource (including
species and age distribution, volume of growing stock, growth rates through-
out the country as well as the extent and type of improvement operations).
The increase calculated by FRI in NAD resulting from the project would be
considerably hiigher than the benefits assumed above, mainly because future
growth is taken into account and areas of mature forest are available for
immediate harvesting. (The principle of sustained yield is, however,
strictly observed.)
(g)  Cost savings from roads.  This is assumed to be Fmk 2,770/km
of road/year for three years.
Economic Rate of Return
2.        With these assumptions the economic rate of return over a 20-year
period would be 33%.  If wood prices were reduced by Fmk 5/m3 to Fmk 65/m3,
the rate of return would be 27%.
