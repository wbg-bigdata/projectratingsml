MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DLVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR THE
MAIIARASIITRA EMERGENCY EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit of SDR 177
million (US$246 million equivalent) to the Government of India (GOI) is submitted for
approval. It would support the Government of Maharashtra's (GOM) rehabilitatio. program for
the victims of the earthquake at Killari, September 30, 1993. The proposed Credit would be on
standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years, including a grace period of ten years. The
proceeds of the Credit would be passed on by the GOI to the GOM in accordance with its
standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states. The GOI will bear the foreign
exchange risk.
2.    Background. Maharashtra is the third largest state both in terms of land area (308,000
square kilometers) and population (78.7 million). It is the country's most heavily industrialized
state with the highest percentage (35.7 percent) of state revenues coming from the industrial
sector and a relatively low percentage coming from the agricultural sector (21.3 percent). The
region where the earthquake occurred is agricultural with primary crops of mustard, sunflower
oil, grapes and sugar cane.
3.    On Thursday September 30, 1993, at 3:56 am, an earthquake of a magnitude 6.4 on the
Richter scale shook the southeastern region of the State of Maharashtra. The epicenter was
located at Killari in the Latur district, about 500 kilometers east of Bombay. Major damage
occurred in villages within 20 kilometers of the epicenter. In the three worst-affected districts -
Latur, Osmanabad and Solapur - 67 villages were severely damaged, and an estimated 8,0)
people were killed and 16,000 injured. The homes of approximately 52,600 families were
destroyed and another 180,000 were damaged.
4.    There was limited damage to other infrastructure. However, the water supply was
disrupted (the water table is said to have fallen in some areas and to have risen in others),
electricity and telecommunication systems have sustained some minor damage, and some schools
and public buildings collapsed or suffered damage.
5.    The deaths were caused mainly by the collapse of traditional village houses that were of
an extremely heavy construction. Typically, the walls were 2-3 feet thick and made of small
stone boulders (about 1 foot in diameter) and bonded with dirt and clay. The stones were
irregular in shape and therefore had relatively little binding and bearing capacity. The roofs
were constructed with heavy wooden beams and a light framing covered with about 12-18 inches
of dirt. During the quake, the walls shattered and the heavy roofs collapsed, crushing the
sleeping residents.
6.    Government Response. The combined response of the GOI and GOM to the disaster
was rapid and effective. The GOM has also been commendably quick in making plans for
reconstruction and it has managed to retain much of the momentum established by the relief
operations. In addition to drawing up a program for IDA assistance, they have persuaded a



- 2 -
number of commercial organizations, non-governrnental organizations (NGOs) and other donors
to sponsor the reconstruction of a rumber of the smaller villages, totaling over 5,000 houses.
Several of these organizations have made a quick start on constructing their designated villages.
7.     IDA Response. The day after the earthquake, the Association offered to assist the
Govermnent of India with reconstruction in the region affected by the earthquake. The offer of
assistance was accepted by the GOI, and on October 5, a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) that established the framework for this Credit was signed.  Simultaneously, an
agreement was signed for a Project Preparation Facility (PPF).'
8.     A reconnaissance mission from the India Department spent two days in the disaster area
10 days after the earthquake. This was followed by the pre-appraisal mission that visited India
November 1-24, 1993, and the appraisal mission January 3-28, 1994. All three missions visited
the earthquake affected districts. Negotiations for the Credit were held in Washington March 2-
9, 1994.
9.     Country Assistance Strategy. The Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) for India
is designed to support the govern.ment's reform agenda through policy dialogue, based on
intensive economic and sector work, and a lending program heavily weighted towards policy-
based operations.  Bank support is targeted to have a strong impact on poverty, one of India's
most pressing problems.  Infrastructure investments are aimed at expanding capacity and
improving efficiency in both urban and rural areas. In addition the Bank is prepared to assist the
country in financing reconstruction and rehabilitation works following natural disasters. The
most recent CAS discussion for India was held on December 17, 1992. The CAS was presented
in the President's Report on a Sector Adjustment Credit for the Social Safety Net Sector
Adjustment dated November 30, 1992.2
10.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank has extensive international experience in
emergency reconstruction projects in many countries. In particular, several have been prepared
in response to natural disasters in India, including the recent and successful Andhra Pradesh
Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project.3 If the lessons learned can be effectively applied in
this situation the Bank's involvement will have an important impact on how the reconstruction
efforts are managed by the GOM. The community base and housing focus of this loan
complements and supports the poverty objectives of the Bank's lending for India.
11.   Project Objective'. The objectives of the project are:
(a)    to assist with rehabilitation and reconstruction in the earthquake-affected area
(restoration of assets and basic services);
(b)    to increase the earthquake resistance of buildings and infrastructure through the
development of improved standards for design and construction; and
PiF of US$1.5 million was offered. About US$250,000 out of the PPF is expected to be used by Credit
effectiveness.
2   A list of past and current Bank projects is included as Schedule D.

- 3 -
(c)   to develop the ability of the GOM  to respond more effectively to natural
disasters, including earthquakes.
12.   Program  Description.   The GOM  has developed a detailed rehabilitation and
reconstruction program. It includes:
(a)    a housing component comprising the following:
(i)   the reconstruction ard rehabilitation on new relocation sites of about 49
villages that were totally destroyed - about 23,000 houses and associated
infrastructure and civic amenities;
(ii)   the reconstruction on existing sites of about 30,000 houses that were
destroyed or substantially damaged and the repair of about 180,000
partially damaged houses; and
(iii)  the construction of 500 model houses and a pilot strengthening program
for about 5,000 vulnerable houses.
(b)   the  repair,  reconstruction  and  strengthening  of public  buildings  and
infrastructure (including schools, health centers, social service facilities, roads,
bridges, irrigation facilities, public buildings, and historical monuments), and
the improvement of transit shelters, including flooring, drainage and sanitation;
(c)    social rehabilitation with a particular emphasis on the needs of women and
children;
(d)    economic rehabilitation (for the replacement of business losses);
(e)    community rehabilitation (the cost of works and materials to re-establish
essential services); and
(f)    a program of technical assistance for the design, supervision and monitoring of
project components, other consultancy services and equipment, including the
development of a disaster management program for the State of Maharashtra,
and a seismic monitoring and research program for the GOI.
13.   Rehabilitation Policy and Community Participation.  To provide a sound and
equitable basis for the implementation of the program, the GOM has prepared a Rehabilitation
Policy statement that has been agreed to by the Association.  The policy establishes the
entitlements for each village, household and individual for all programs, including rel'abilitation
of housing, infrastructure, and community, social and economic activities. A baseiine survey
has already been undertaken in the 49 villages proposed for relocation under the program as well
as in 18 other villages where there was a high degree of damage. Given that the project does not
involve tribal communities, hence OD 4.20 does not apply. OD 4.30 applies where land is



-4 -
acquired for the resettlement villages. A rehabilitation action plan acceptable to IDA has been
prepared by the GOM.
14.   The program would be planned and implemented with the active participation of the
affected communities, and the involvement of local NGOs wherever possible. Agreement has
been reacbed on procedures to ensure adequate participation by the beneficiaries in all the
villages, including publication of the policy and a clear explanation of who will benefit from it,
and what their entitlements will be. Agreement has also been reached on appeals procedures
ensuring that all complaints are promptly and fairly redressed. The first level of appeal will be
to the District Collector and the second to the Secretary and Special Commissioner (Earthquake
Relief and Rehabilitation) (SCER).
15.   In the relocation villages, the houses and the gaotAan layouts would be designed with the
active participation of the different social groups. The views of each identifiable group would
be sought before reaching an agreement at village meeings. Every effort would be made to
ensure that the resulting village and house designs reflect the needs and rural lifestyle of the
people ir. the affected districts.
16.   All families in the relocation villages would be provided with a plot of land and a core
house of at least 250 square feet (internal floor area). Those with larger land holdings would be
entitled to a larger house of either 400 or 750 square feet. For these larger houses, the
incremental cost of the additional floor area above 250 square feet would be treated as a loan to
the beneficiary and would be funded by the GOM. The Credit would finance only the core
houses and 250-square feet of the larger houses.
17.   The sites for 40 of the relocation villages have already been transferred by the
landowners to the Government. However, so as to ensure that no individual's standard of living
is adversely affected, a time-bound rehabilitation action plan has been developed to the
satisfaction of the Association, so as to ensure that all appropriate rehabilitation measures are
being taken. The action plan lists the individuals affected, describes the level of benefits
available to them, lists other GOM and GOI programs available to mitigate any adverse impact
of land acquisition, and provides grievance procedures, an estimate of the budget, and the details
of the organization that will implement the plan.
18.   House Construction. Given the relatively large size of these contracts, construction of
the relocated villages would be by contractors, who will be encouraged to use local skilled and
unskilled labor. Model houses would be built to demonstrate earthquake-resistant construction
techniques and to facilitate the participatory process. Additionally, GOM would prepare an
environmental statement for each relocation village.
19.   The reconstruction and repair of the houses in-situ would be largely through a
community-based construction process, controlled by the owners.  The owners would be
supported by technical personnel and the construction would be carried out by small contractors
or village masons, stone cutters, carpenters and other village-based artisans, and assisted by non-
skilled workers. The Program Management Unit (PMIJ) would develop guidelines for screening
and maintaining a list of approved contractors and artisans, who will receive training in
seismically-resistant construction techniques.



- 5 -
20.   Before the houses are reconstructed or repaired on their existing sites, the extent of the
damage to each house would be appraised by PMU staff assisted by qualified experts to
determine the type and cost of reconstruction or repair.  The GOM  would provide grant
assistance to repair these houses to the extent of the cost of repair, not exceeding the estimated
cost of a 250-square foot core house (currently estimated at Rs. 54,000 (US$1,730)).
Alternatively, owners could be provided with building materials through project-operated or
private material depots. Funds would be made available through a village fund if the villagers
so desire. The GOM has agreed to prepare a detailed action plan for the reconstruction and
repair of houses in existing villages prior to the start of consrcution works for this component.
21.   Ernvironmental Impact. This is a Category B project. It would raise the quality of the
environment in the new villages above the standards to be found in the older villages in the
region. The more generous provision of standpipes for drinking water and the twin-pit latrines
in every dwelling unit would make a major contribution to the health and welfare of the local
population. However, no project that involves the relocation of such a large number of people is
expected to have only positive environmental impacts. To examine the potential environmental
effects of each new village, the GOM has agreed to provide the Association with an
environmental statement for each relocation village and to demonstrate how any adverse impacts
would be mitigated. The issues to be addressed would include surface water drainage, water
supply, sanitation, any reduction in the land available for agriculture and changes in the
economic status of the farming population.
22.   Social Issues. The local population was shocked by the earthquake and continues to be
disturbed by the aftershocks. Throughout the region most people appear to have lost confidence
in their old villages and want to move to earthquake-resistant houses in a new location. In many
villages people are still living in temporary shelters because they are afraid of their old houses.
Village relocation under this project is voluntary.
23.   To minimize any negative impacts of the resettlement program the GOM has prepared
and is in the process of publishing a full rehabilitation policy and has made arrangements for
implementation plans to be discussed in each village. Appropriate appeals procedures have also
been built in. The agreed planning process is community-based so as to ensure, as far as
possible, that the designs of the new houses and villages are acceptable to the people who would
live in them. Additionally, a rehabilitation action plan has been prepared to the satisfaction of
the Association, to mitigate the effects of land acquisition for relocation villages.
24.   The program also begins to address the problems caused by the loss of confidence of the
local people in their old houses and in the traditional building materials. The project includes
the construction of model houses and a pilot program for the strengthening of the traditional
houses.  It also includes a confidence-building program  as a part of the component for
developing a disaster management system.
25.   Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost including contingencies is US$328
million (including taxes and duties of US$15 million), with an estimated foreign exchange
component of US$33 million (10 percent). The project would be financed with an IDA Credit
of US$246 million, a GOM contribution of US$40 million, and US$41 million from other
donors, which includes cofinancing of 10 million Pounds Sterling from the British governmrent,
agreed in principle. Separate parallel financing of US$0.6 million from the Asian Development



-6 -
Bank (ADB) has also been agreed in principle. The GOI would contribute US$1 million to the
earthquake monitoring and research component. A summary of program costs and a financing
plan are presented in Schedule A.4
26.   When the MOU was signed on October 5, 1993, retroactive financing was offered for
eligible expenditures made during the period between the date of the disaster and loan signature.
The GOM proposes to use this financing, up to a maximum. of SDR 10 million (about US$14
million equivalent), to cover the cost of works and materials procured after the disaster and used
for community rehabilitation.
27.   Implementation. The project would be implemented over a three-year period with a
Credit closing date of June 30, 1997. A list of key dates is provided in Schedule C.
28.   The project would be implemented by a Program Management Unit (PMU), headed by
the SCER who would also be the nominated Project Director (PD). The PD has been delegated
full administrative and financial powers to facilitate speedy implementation and will be assisted
by a team of management consultants and other technical experts to ensure that outputs are
delivered timely and as planned. The PD will also be supported by a Chief Engineer and other
technical staff recruited to the PMU from government departments.  The PMU will use
consultant services extensively for preparation and supervision of works. Independent quality
assurance and technical audit arrangements would be put in place. The PMU will dissolve upon
completion of the program.
29.   The PMU will be overseen by the Central Implementation Group (CIG) under the
chairmanship of the Chief Secietary.  Policy directives will be provided by a Cabinet
subcommittee headed by the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. The Association has reviewed the
program management plan and found it satisfactory.
30.   Procuirement and Disbursement. Procurement of works, goods and services would be
in accordance with IDA guidelines using documentation satisfactory to the Association. Due to
the small size and the wide spatial distribution of civil works contracts, these would be executed
through local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) acceptable to the Association. The majority
of the in-situ house reconstruction and repair work would be community based and carried out
thr3ugh small local contractors and NGOs. Small works and those of an emergency nature
would be done through force account or rates contracts. Contracts for equipment, materials and
vehicles costing US$200,000 or more would be procured under ICB procedures. Smaller
contracts for works and equipment could be procured using local procedures acceptable to the
Association. Local shopping would be used for the purchase of livestock and selected equipment
costing than less than US$500 and US$50,000 respectively, up to a total of US$4 million. All
consultants would be contracted in accordance with the IDA guidelines. Amounts and methods
of procurement, amounts of disbursement by category and the disbursement schedule are
provided in Schedule B.
31.   The IDA Credit of US$246 million would finance 75 percent of the housing and other
civil works; 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 100 percent of local ex-factory expenditures
4   An additional USS4 million will be provided by the Second Maharashtra Power Project (Loan 3498-IN).



for materials and equipment under ICB procurement, and 80 percent of local expenditures for
other materials and equipment procured locally; 100 percent of technical assistance and traininv;
and 75 percent of recurrent expenditures for selected social programs and incremental costs for
the PMU.
32.   A Special Account would be established in US dollars in the Reserve Bank of India with
an initial deposit of US$20 million from which project expenditures would be reimbursed.
Throughout the life of the project, the GOI would advance to the GOM about three months
worth of anticipated expenditures. After each advance, the GOM would in turn promptly
advance these funds to the agencies implementing each component of the project.
33.    Benefits. The project would bring immediate and sustained economic and social benefits
to the region affected by the earthquake. Over 200,000 families or about one million persons
would benefit from the program. It would build on the ielief measures already started by the
GOI and the GOM and would benefit from the continued momentum of the rehabilitation
program. It would rebuild the housing destroyed by the disaster, give an important boost to the
local economy, and provide employment opportunities to the local residents. Additionally, the
project would give economic and social support to disadvantaged sections of the community,
particularly women and children. Long-term benefits would be derived from the strengthening
of infrastructure and housing in the region and from the development of a disaster management
program, and seismic monitoring and research.
34.    Risks and Lessons Learned from Bank Fxperience. The Andhra Pradesh Cycione
Emergency Reconstruction Project demonstrated the importance of focusing early in the project
cycle on procurement procedures and contract documentation.5  It also demonstrated the
importance of establishing a strong project management team with a high degree of delegated
authority. For housing reconstruction projects, the Mexico Earthquake Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction Project emphasized the importance of involving the beneficiaries in the plann :g
and implementation of the reconstruction process as well as the need to establish a strong
implementation agency.6 In addition, a more general review of the Bank's emergency housing
projects suggests that land acquisition problems, inappropriate or complicated housing designs,
and problems with material availability are also potential constraints to the success of a project.7
35.   When preparing this project each of the potential constraints has been addressed. A
strong program management structure has been established with community participation built in
as an integral part of the planning and implementation processes. Other factors such as land,
materials availability and the design of the villages and houses have also been of mutual concern
for IDA and the GOM. However, despite these efforts, substantial risks remain. These may be
grouped in four categories - project preparation, technical, management and implementation.
(a)    Project Preparation Risk. Almost by definition, no emergency project is likely
to be as well prepared as a regular Bank project. Because of the short time
S   Report No P5363-IN of September 18, 1990 (Credit 2179-IN, Loan 3260-IN).

available much greater emphasis must be given during preparation and ay)proval
phase to establishing appropriate design and implementation proces-es. To
minimize preparation risks in this project, a procurement plan and a program
management plan have been prepared and agreed on, including the appointment
of consultants to assist with project prepa ;Aion and implementation. In addition,
contract documentation has been prepared and approved for a large proportion of
the infrastructure rehabilitation component and for five of the relocation villages.
(b)    Technical Risk. Rebuilding in a proven earthquake zone can never be risk free.
Although the expert advice available within India on seismic engineering issues
is of a high quality, it has been agreed that the GOI and the GOM would engage
the services of international experts to complement local expertise.
(c)    Management Risk. A major risk is that the GOM  will fail to manage the
program effectively or implement it in a timely fashion. The GOM has already
demonstrated a high level of commitment to the program, and has taken steps to
establish and staff the PMU.
(d)   Implementation Risks. The community base of this project is both a strength
and a weakness. It should ensure community ownership of the project and that
all house and village construction financed by the project is acceptable to the
people.  However, the very large in-situ house reconstruction and repair
component will be very difficult to manage, given the need for owners to take
responsibility for the repair of their own houses, even if they are provided with
material and appropriate technical support. A detailed implementation plan will
be agreed for this component prior to construction works beginning for this
component.
36.   Supervision. This project will require intensive IDA supervision, especially during the
first year of implementation. Th,e budgeted staff inputs are 12 weeks in FY94, 30 weeks in
FY95, 20 weeks in FY96, 15 weeks in FY97 and 7 weeks in FY98. The designated Task
Manager is resident in the World Bank New Delhi office.
37.   Actions Agreed. The following have been agreed by IDA and the GOM:
(a)    a rehabilitation policy statement - this is being published to provide a framewoik
for the earthquake rehabilitation program;
(b)    a program management plan including staffing, consultant inputs and powers
delegated to the PMU;
(c)    a procurement plan, procurement procedures, and procedures for the preparation
of the environmental statements;
(d)    design and supervision of construction of all housing work - the GOM  has
agreed that this will be to the standards satisfactory to the Association;



-9 -
(e)   relocation villages - (i) the size of the program; (ii) the process for community
participation; (iii) the procedures for the design and supervision of all housing
work; (iv) the GOM would prepare a computerized database including the
building damage and the baseline social data: (v) the GOM would prepare and
publish lists of beneficiaries in each village; and (vi) the GOM would prepare
and publish a comprehensive rehabilitation program for each village.  The
Association has also reviewed the designs and contract documentation for the
first five relocation villages and found them satisfactory. The GOM has agreed
that construction, contract drawings and documentation of all other relocation
villages will be of a similar standard;
(f)    a rehabilitation action plan to mitigate any adverse effects of the land acquisition
for the relocation villages - this plan was prepared to the satisfaction of the
Association, and the GOM has agreed to implement it in a timely manner for
each relocation village;
(g)   the villages to be rehabilitated in-situ - the GOM has agreed that construction
work in these villages will not begin before they provide the Association with a
detailed implementation plan for this sub-component; additionally, the following
were agreed: (i) the limits of the program; (ii) that the GOM will prepare a
computerized database for each village, including the damage survey and the
proposed social survey data; (iii) that the GOM will prepare and publish a
rehabilitation program for each village; (iv) that the GOM will prepare and
publish the lists of beneficiaries in each village; (v) in terms of the repair of the
damaged houses, it was agreed that the works will begin only after the
appointment of seismic engineering experts, the social surveys for about 100
villages have been undertaken, detailed surveys including damage assessment
have been carried out with design solutions and cost estimates, properly trained
technicians (including engineering supervisory staff, and village-based masons,
carpenters and other artisans) have been deployed;

MAHARAsHTRA EMERGENCY EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
1.    Maharashtra is the third largest state in India both in land area (308,000 square
kilometers) and population (78.7 million). It is India's most heavily industrialized state with the
highest percentage of state revenues coming from the industrial sector (35.7 percent) and a
relatively low percentage coming from the agricultural sector (21.3 percent). The region where
the earthquake occurred is agricultural with primary crops of mustard, sunflower oil, grapes and
sugar cane.
A. BACKGROUND
The Earthquake
2.    On Thursday September 30, 1993 at 3.56 am, an earthquake of 6.4 on the Richter
magnitude scale, shook the southeastern region of the State of Maharashtra. The epicenter was
near the village of Killari located in the Latur district, about 500 km east of Bombay. The
earthquake was followed by three aftershocks, and since then, dozens of tremors have been felt
in the region.
3.    The earthquake severely affected 67 villages in Latur and Osmanabad districts where
about 8,000 people were killed and 16,000 injured. Considerable damage also occurred in the
neighboring districts, particularly in Solapur. In total, about 230,000 houses were either
destroyed or damaged, and more than 52,000 families were left without houses in 13 districts of
the Marathwada region. In sum, about 52,000 houses need to be rebuilt and about 180,000
require repair.
4.    The deaths were mainly caused by the collapse of old traditional village houses which
were of an extremely heavy construction. Typically, the walls were 2-3 ft. thick and made of
small stone boulders (about 1 ft. in diameter) and bonded with dirt and clay. The stones were
irregular in shape and therefore had relatively little binding and bearing capacity. The roofs
were constructed with heavy wooden beams and a light framing covered with about 12 to 18
inches of dirt. During the earthquake, the walls shattered and the heavy roofs collapsed,
crushing the sleeping residents.
5.    Apart from extensive damage to public buildings, especially school buildings, there was
generally moderate damage to other infrastructure. However, water supply was disrupted (in
some areas water table is said to have fallen and in other areas it has risen), electricity and tele-
communication systems have suffered some damage.



-2-
Seismicity of the Region
6.    The northern portion of the Indian sub-continent is subject to many earthquakes and the
causes of this seismicity are well understood. The Himalayas form a belt of veiy high seismic
activity, where two continental plates collide. To the south of this mountain range, in the
alluvial region, earthquakes are considered to be caused by fractures in major faults. However,
the causes of earthquakes in the relatively stable crust of the Indian Peninsular Shield are less
clearly understood. Some faults that in the past had bken associated with seismic events were
well demarcated, while the presence of others could only be inferred. Although smaller tremors
have been registered in this region, available records show relatively long periods of no
earthquake activity, alternat'.ig with short periods of greater earthquake activity.
7.     On September 13, 1967, an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 on the Richter scale, occurred
near the Koyna Dam  in the State of Maharashtra.  Fewer than 200 people died in this
earthquake, but it caused widespread damage to local villages. The scientists of the Central
Building Research Institute (CBRI) of Roorkee have suggested that prior to the filling of the
Koyna Dam reservoir (which began in 1962), no earthquakes of appreciable intensity had been
experienced in this area. After the filling started, mild tremors began to increase both in
frequency and intensity, and the correlation between high water levels in the reservoir and the
seismic activity in the region is now well established.
8.    The Killari earthquake, of September 30, 1993, is the largest earthquake to have been
recorded in this general area, and one of the most devastating earthquakes of its kind. For a
year and a half prior to this date, the region had been experiencing more pronounced seismic
activity. In this early stage of analysis, when seismological information from the aftershocks is
still being gathered, only preliminary geological data are available.  No evidence of pre-
earthquake faulting was found, nor the evidence of prehistoric deformation in the morphology.
Neither geology nor historical seismicity offer clues to this earthquake.
Government Response
9.       The combined response of the GOI and the GOM  to the disaster was rapid and
effective. By all accounts, the emergency response and relief operations were handled in an
exemplary way. Within a week some observers were declaring the relief phase over. The GOM
has also been commendably fast at initiating plans for reconstruction and they have managed to
retain much of the momentum established by the relief operations. Even before finalizing the
rehabilitation program, it had persuaded commercial organizations, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and other donors to sponsor the reconstruction in 20 of the smaller
villages, totaling over 5,000 houses. Several of these organizations have made an early start on
the construction of their designated villages.
10.   The GOI established an Advisory Group to assist the GOM with the development of the
rehabilitation program. This group's terms of reference were for it to address and advise upon
selected issues, including earthquake-resistant house designs, the layout of the villages and
community participation.  The group was chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Urban
Development. It had a membership of 17, including earthquake experts, engineers, architects, a
social scientist and representatives of NGOs. The Advisory Group's report was finalized
between the Association's pre-appraisal and appraisal missions. It served to clarify a number of
related issues which arose at pre-appraisal.

IIDA Response
11.   The day after the earthquake, the Association offered to assist the Government of India
with the reconstruction in the region affected by ti - earthquake.  An ad hoc Advisory
Committee was established on October 1 to advise the Director of the India Department upon the
preparation and implementation of the proposed emergency project. The offer of assistance was
accepted by the GOI and, on October 5, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed
that established the framework for this Credit. Simultaneously, an agreement was signed for a
Project Preparation Facility (PPF).
12.    A reconnaissance mission from the India Department spent two days in the disaster area
10 days after the earthquake. This was followed by the pre-appraisal mission which visited
India November 1-24, 1993, and the appraisal mission January 3-28, 1994. All three missions
visited the earthquake affected districts. Negotiations for the Credit were held in Washington
between March 2-9, 1994.
13.   The pre-appraisal mission discussed the possibility that existing Bank and IDA projects
could be used to finance rehabilitation. With a single exception, it was agreed that the
rehabilitation program would be most appropriately handled through this Credit.'
B. THE FRAMEWORK FOR REHABILITATION
14.   This section of the Technical Annex describes three essential building blocks for the
GOM's rehabilitation program: (a) an understanding of the traditional lifestyle of the local
people, and in particular, how the form of existing buildings and villages in the Marathwada
region matches these requirements; (b) the GOM's rehabilitation policy; (c) the decision of the
GOM to implement the program with the active participation of the affected communities.
Existing Houses and Villages
15.   The villages in this region are generally located in river valleys where watel availability
is ensured and the agricultural land is fertile. Their sizes vary considerably from more than
10,000 residents to only a few hundred. Irrespective of their size, the villages are by and large
old and have an almost medieval urban form. The gaothans (built up village areas) are compact
and densely built. The abutting stone masonry walls of houses delineate narrow and winding
streets. House walls facing the streets have very few openings, and the houses are oriented
inward.
16.   The typical design of traditional iiouses in the Marathwada villages reflects the centuries
of agricultural lifestyle of the local residents. In addition to offering excellent thermal insulation
and protection from the elements, the houses have a hierarchical composition of open, semi-open
and closed spaces that complement the villagers' way of life-storing agricultural implements and
grain, keeping cattle, and performing a number of post-harvest chores. The houses are fairly
large, measuring on average about 800 square feet.
1      It has been agreed that the Second Maharashtra Power Project would be used to provide US$4 million for
the construction and repair of power facilities. Report Nos. MOP P5061, SAR 7713 (Loan 3498-IN).



- 4 -
17.   In most houses of this region, the following fundamental spaces can be distinguished: a
central courtyard, surrounded by high boundary walls, often used for keeping animals and other
agricultural activities; a semi-open space (which in the poorer households is used for cooking
and washing, and in the middle-income households for storage, receiving visitors and sometimes
sheltering cattle) and a set of inner rooms for sleeping and storage, which tend to be more
numerous in affluent households. Additionally, the larger houses and compounds have an
entrance zone, called a baithak, which is used to receive visitors.
18.   The primary building material for wall construction is the locally available stone and a
typical village house is made of stone and mud mortar. Such stone masonry can be several feet
thick, consisting of two faces of partially dressed stone with the space between filled with
rubble, earth and clay. Most walls have no appropriate courses, nor through or header stones.
Consequently, the walls are not well tied together at the corners, nor functionally connected with
the roof. Timber is traditionally expensive and is used sparsely, and only for the most necessary
parts of the house--roofs, doors, windows, and the courtyard colonnades.
19.   Almost half of all the roofs in the two districts consist of heavy earth layers placed on
wooden planks, while the rest of the buildings is covered by corrugated iron sheets, tiles or
thatch. The use of corrugated iron sheeting is generally limited to covering the semi-open
spaces and only infrequently used in residential buildings, given this material's poor properties
of thermal insulation. Though praised for their thermal comfort, stone masonry houses with
heavy roofs perform poorly under earthquake forces.
20.   In contrast to the substantial houses of the wealthier villagers and land owners, the poor
tend to live on the edge of the village settlements in houses consisting of wattle and daub walls
and thatched roofs, which range in size from 150 to 500 square feet. The ratio of usable space
in these buildings is exceptionally high, with covered area amounting to about 80 percent of the
total floor plan.
Rehabilitation Policy
21.   A policy framework for the rehabilitation program has been prepared by the GOM and
reviewed and confirmed at negotiations. The policy provides a clear statement of objectives of
the rehabilitation program by village, household, and individual. It defines the criteria for
selecting the villages to be relocated, and those where houses are to be reconstructed on their
original sites. It also describes how and which households and individuals would benefit from
the program, and clarifies the entitlements of the more vulnerable groups in the society including
tenants, the landless, as well as women and orphans. A baseline survey of the 67 villages most
affected by the disaster has already been completed by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences
(TISS).
22.   For the relocation villages, the policy provides for the affected persons to be resettled in
socially, culturally and economically self-sustaining commnunities with an emphasis upon their
social and kinship relations. It includes provisions for tenants and encroachers who do not pay
house-tax but whose houses have been damaged, and the landless whose houses have not been
damaged (as they lived in huts which survived the earthquake), and those who have been
affected by the land acquisition. The GOM has accepted that they are an integral part of the
community upon which they depend for socio-economic and cultural support.



- 5 -
23.   The GOM would relocate those villages where more than 70 percent of the houses were
either destroyed or substantially damaged. Currently it is estimated that there are 49 villages
which fall into this category, comprising about 23,000 houses. In 2,500 other villages, in 13
districts, it is estimated that about 29,600 houses will have to be rebuilt in-situ and about
180,000 require repair.
24.   The reconstruction program would be developed in detail through extensive participation
of the affected communities. This would include the following major elements:
(a)   In the relocation villages, there would be three house types with an internal floor
area of 250 square feet (the core house), 400 square feet and 750 square feet, on
plots of 1,575 square feet, 2,520 square feet and 5,000 square feet, respectively.
Each new village would be provided with an infrastructure comprising roads,
drainage, electricity, drinking water through standposts, public health and
medical and social centers.
(b)    The entitlement of the beneficiaries to a particular plot size would be on the
basis of the agricultural land holding and the house tax paid by the beneficiaries
for the dwelling owned in their original village. The landless, including widows
and tenants, and those holding up to one hectare, would be entitled to a plot of
1,575 square feet with a core house. Those with a holding of between one and
seven hectares would receive a plot of 2,520 square feet, and those with a land
holding of more than seven hectares would be entitled to a plot of 5,000 square
feet with one of the larger houses. The benefits would also be extended to those
affected by land acquisition.
(c)    Those families with more than 10 members or owning more than 10 hectares of
land would be given an additional bare plot, except where extended families
have more than one legally separated kitchen in the old house. They would then
be entitled to more than one plot with a core house for each family with a
separate kitchen.
(d)   In the relocation villages, a plot and a core house would be provided for all
beneficiaries in the form of a grant. For those beneficiaries who had owned
larger houses, the incremental cost of building larger houses would be provided
as a loan at an annual interest rate of 8 percent repayable over 20 years. The
loan administration would be handled through the office of the District
Collector. The proceeds of the Credit would not be used to finance the loan
portion.
(e)    The percentage distribution of the three sizes of plots and houses would be based
on the features of the old village configuration, and taking into account the sizes
of land holdings. Generally, the ratio of 250 square feet, 400 square feet, and
750 square feet core house distribution in the relocation villages would be in the
range of 52:39:8, respectively.



- 6 -
(f)    For the houses to be rebuilt in-situ, the maximum benefit would be Rs. 54,000
(suitably adjusted fo: inflation), the estimated cost of building a 250 square foot
core house.
(g)    In addition to those living in the 49 villages which are to be relocated, there are
18 villages where the population was moved into transit housing by the GOM
after the earthquake. These villages are to be rebuilt in-situ. In these villages
the landless would also be eligible for a core house.
(h)    Benefits would be provided in the joint names of husband and wife. Provision
would also be made to protect the rights of children who became orphans but
who have inherited property and land.
25.    Other issues addressed  in the policy statement relate to social and economic
rehabilitation of the affected persons, provision of civic amenities and social infrastructure,
ownership of existing house sites and the rubble, repair and strengthening of partially affected
villages, land acquisition for relocated gaothans, and improvements to transit housing as the
villagers would have to stay in them for longer periods due to the length of the construction
program. The policy statement also sets out a framework for monitoring and evaluating the
prograni and would provide appropriate grievance procedures, should any of the affected parties
feel that they are not being fairly treated. The first level of appeal is to the District Collector
and the second to the Secretary and Special Commissioner (Earthquake Relief and
Rehabilitation) (SCER).
26.   Rehabilitation Action Plan for those Affected by Land Acquisition. The GOM has
prepared a rehabilitation action plan to mitigate any adverse effects of land acquisition for the
relocation villages and the GOM has agreed to implement this plan in a timely manner for each
relocation village. Specifically, this plan provides the following: (i) a list of all individuals
from whom land was acquired; (ii) a list of their respective land holdings, before and after the
acquisition program; (iii) a list of all those who have been rendered landless or marginalized;
(iv) a commitment to undertake a survey to identify any others who may be affected by the land
acquisition program; (v) a list of benefits which affected individuals are entitled under the
Rehabilitation Policy with an expected timetable for their distribution; (vi) list of other GOM
and GOI programs which are available in each village and a timetable for their application; (vii)
the budget for the rehabilitation action plan; and (viii) a description of the proposed
organizational structure for implementing the plan, including appropriate grievance procedures.
Community Participation
27.   To implement successfully both the rehabilitation policy and the program, active
participation of the affected communities is deemed essential. During the life of this project,
community participation would extend beyond obtaining consent from Sarpanches (village
leaders), and would ensure that the views of all sections of the community are sought,
understood and acted upon.  The involvement of communities in the rehabilitation program
would ensure that the people's concerns and needs are better understood and incorporated in the
plans. It would also permit the communities to develop a stake in the rehabilitation process,
rebuild their self confidence and empower them to shape their own lives rather than become
helpless victims of a disaster.



-7 -
28.   The GOM's rehabilitation policy would be shared with the people, and the communities
would participate in all relevant aspects of the rehabilitation program including:
(a)    The house design-to understand the people's perceptions and concerns about
the design of their new houses in relation to their requirements and lifestyles.
(b)    Planning  the village layouts-to determine the people's preferences for the
layout of the new village.
(c)    Village rehabilitation plans-to publicize and discuss rehabilitation plans in each
village.
(d)    Allocation of plots-to inform people who is getting which plot so that they can
take interest in monitoring the construction work and have a stake in the
construction process.   The criteria for allocation would be defined in
consultation with the people.
(e)    Construction-to involve the people in the construction process. (Ideally the
house construction work would be handled by the village community itself.
However, given the scale of operations and the time constraint, this would be
not a feasible option in the relocation villages. Contractors would have to be
used. However, the repair and reconstruction works in the villages to be
reconstructed in-situ would be mostly community-based.)
29.   The implementation of the participation process would require the full commitment of all
government officials.  For community participation to become an integral part of the
development process, the GOM would involve local NGOs in the process to the maximum extent
possible. The proposed procedures for use during the design and planning of the relocated
villages are summarized in Attachment 3.

Note: The total project cost is US$327.8 million (about Rs. 10,870 million), inclusive of duties and taxes, estimated
at US$15 million. Of this about US$32.7 million are foreign exchange costs. The base costs were estimated at the
time of appraisal. Physical contingencies amount to about 2% of the total. Price contingencies of 3% per annum
were added to foreign costs and 6% per annum for local costs for the first two years, and 5% for the third year.
Housing (Rs. 6,340 million)
32.    This component would finance the reconstruction of 49 villages on new relocation sites,
comprising about 23,000 houses (of which about 5,500 would be built by donors); the
reconstruction of about 29,600 houses on existing sites; the repair and strengthening of about
180,000 damaged houses; the construction of 500 model houses; and the pilot program for
strengthening 5,000 other houses in the region, which are of a similar type of design and
construction.

33.    Standards for Housing and  Village Development.   New  buildings would be
constructed to the earthquake-resistant criteria established by the GOM upon the advice of such
research centers as the CBRI at Roorkee. These have been set, at least in the interim, to
conform to those applicable to a seismic Zone IV2, or a high risk seismic zone, of the Bureau of
Indian Standards. This is acceptable for the reconstruction program in the short term, since any
change is unlikely to have a major impact on the cost of a single story house. However, in the
context of the long term rehabilitation, it would be necessary to expedite further discussions
within the technical community so as to confirm that this is the most appropriate zoning for the
region. The cost difference for repairs and strengthening between Zone IV standards, and to
say, Zone III standards, may be significant for the larger components of infrastructure, such as
dams and long span bridges. Such works may be required after further design studies.
34.    As far as possible, the new housing would be built to conform to the layouts of the
traditional houses and villages, and to the preferences and needs of the local residents.
Traditional building materials would be used as much as possible. Past housing construction
techniques, however, would be replaced by earthquake-resistant building practices.  Local
masons, carpenters and artisans would be trained in the new building strategies. While stone
may remain the basic building material, the use of reinforced concrete beams at floor, lintel and
roof level would be required, along with the use of lighter buiiding materials such as hollow and
solid concrete blocks. The selected roofing system would not only have to satisfy the need for
seismic resistance, but would also have to have good thermal insulation properties and
preferably enable the farmers to continue using flat roofs for drying their agricultural produce.
The building techniques adopted would have to allow replication by the village builders.
35.    When choosing building materials, account would be taken of the fact that there may be
little good quality sand available in the area, and that good quality bricks cannot be made during
the monsoon season. An alternative that merits consideration would be the local production of
concrete blocks, made from crushed stone. Stone is the most readily available building material
in all the villages. However, given the initial hesitancy of the survivors to rebuild in original
locations and to use the stone that had killed their next of kin, this proposal would require
careful "marketing".
36.    A number of NGOs and other donors have already begun a process of housing
reconstruction, using a wide variety of housing layouts, building materials and construction
methods. This program could be used to test alternative house designs and demonstrate the
feasibility of building earthquake-resistant buildings out of traditional materials.
37.    Relocation Villages (Rs. 2,002 million)3. The land for about 40 villages has already
been acquired mainly through negotiations. Village layouts would be efficient, and contain
about 60 percent net residential plots. They would reflect the residents' views on the gaothan
configuration, and location of civic amenities. Every house would be provided with a low cost
2      Indian Standard Criteria for Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures (IS: 1893-1984). The zones
correspond to the following intensities on the Modified Mercalli scale (MMI): lowest, Zone 1, maximum intensities of
V and under, Zone 11 (MMI VI), Zone III (MMI VII), Zone IV (MMI VIII) and the highest, Zone V (MMI IX and
up).
3      The program includes the sum of Rs. 507 million which will be financed by other donors.

toilet (twin-pit pour-flush latrine) and a smokeless stove, and the location of houses on the plot
would permit future expansion to suit the functional needs of the house owners.
38.    An environmental statement would be prepared for each relocation village. It would
contain an assessment of relocation impact on the natural and physical environment (both
positive and negative), water resources, drainage and loss of agricultural land. It would also
specify the impact of land use conversion on the economic activities of the local agricultural
producers.
39.    Construction of this part of the program would be mainly by contractors, or larger and
proven NGOs.
40.    Repair and Reconstruction In-Situ (Rs. 4,164 million). According to the preliminary
danage assessment performed by the GOM, about 29,600 houses would have to be totally
reconstructed in-situ. In addition, about 180,000 houses that have suffered various degrees of
damage require extensive or minor repair.
41.    The extent of damage to each house would be assessed to determine the repair solution
and the cost of reconstruction. This exercise would be undertaken by experienced technical
teams in the PMU, assisted by outside specialists, including qualified structural engineers with
seismic engineering experience. The current estimates indicate an average cost of Rs. 6,000 for
Category4 I and II and Rs. 20,000 for repair of Category III, or approximately Rs. 35 per square
feet. The GOM will provide grant assistance to repair such houses to the extent of the cost of
repair, but not exceeding the estimated cost of a core house (currently Rs. 54,000).
42.   The new houses will be built by contractors only if sufficient number of houses can be
conveniently packaged for individual contracts. However, given the size of individual works,
and the spatial distribution of houses to be reconstructed or repaired, most of this component
would be implemented under the control of the owners. The owners would be supported by
materials and appropriate technical personnel, and the construction would be carried out through
small contractors or village masons, stone-cutters, carpenters and other village artisans, and
assisted by non-skilled workers.  The PMU  would develop guidelines for screening and
maintaining a list of approved contractors and artisans, who would have undergone training in
seismic-resistant construction techniques.
43.    Funds for owner construction and repair would be made available through a village fund
if the villagers so desire. Owners may also be provided with staged cash advances or building
material through a project-operated or private material depots. Given the nature of the work
involved, and the poor availability of chief building materials in the region such as cement and
reinforcing steel, one option under consideration by the PMU is the bulk procurement of
materials (through ICB) for supply to concessionaires, who in turn would issue the materials to
individual beneficiaries.
44.    To manage this component, full time seismic engineering advisors would be appointed to
the PMU. An expatriate seismic engineer with experience in organization of the reconstruction

process, and the repair and strengthening of stone masonry buildings would also be appointed.
This expatriate specialist would help design the strategy for and advise on the methods of repair
and strengthening of buildings. He/she would also assist in developing a training plan for the
PMU staff. This expert would spend 5-6 months initially in the earthquake affected area, and
return every 3 months thereafter to monitor and a3sist in implementation. Appointment of the
seismic engineering experts would be required prior to Credit effectiveness. Construction works
for this component would begin only after the GOM have prepared a strategy and
implementation plan satisfactory to the Association.
45.   Strengthening of Houses (Rs. 61 million). It is estimated that there are more than 2.5
million traditionally built stone masonry buildings in the high risk seismic zones in this region.
In view of the total destruction of more than 52,000 similar houses during this earthquake, the
benefits of strengthening the existing housing stock are apparent. However, this process can
only be implemented by the house owners at their cost and at their own pace.
46.   To launch the strengthening program, the GOM  would initiate a pilot program  in
selected villages to strengthen about 5,000 houses. Specialized consultants would be employed
to develop technical solutions and cost estimates for the pilot houses. For these efforts to be
sustainable, this program must train local artisans--masons, carpenters, stone cutters and others-
in seismically-resistant construction techniques and the repair and strengthening strategies for the
traditional stone masonry building. Agreement on the criteria for the selection of beneficiaries
and implementation would be reached prior to construction.
47.   Model Houses/Buildings (Rs. 43 million). Early in the rehabilitation program, 500
model houses and buildings would be constructed, to demonstrate cost-efficient building
techniques, the use of local materials, and incorporation of earthquake-resistant construction
features. Apart from helping improve traditional building techniques, this component would
help generate confidence among residents that stone can be safely used for house construction
(along with its by-products, such as hollow and solid concrete blocks). These model houses
would also be used to facilitate participation and solicit comments from the affected persons
about the proposed designs in order to refine them. The buildings could be used for local
government offices, staff quarters or other community uses.
Infrastructure (Rs. 2,985 million)
48.   The GOM's proposals for infrastructure are consistent with the purposes of an
emergency loan. Provision would be to standards applicable to rural areas, and would not
generally be higher than those already existing in the districts. The agreed project components
would have the following limited objectives: (a) to make good the damage caused by the
earthquake; (b) to raise the standards of basic community infrastructure to an acceptable
minimum; and (c) to strengthen infrastructure to withstand a higher degree of seismic intensity.
49.   Upgrading  the Transit Shelters (Rs. 70 million).  A realistic timetable for the
construction of the new villages is not less than two years. In the interim, it would be necessary
to upgrade the facilities in the transit housing areas, which consist of about 23,000 rooms, one
per family. The improvements would include: raising of the plinths, improvements to surface
drainage, compaction and dressing of roads and footpaths, improved ventilation and thermal
insulation of the housing units, improved sanitation and water supply, and structural
strengthening of the buildings before the monsoons begin.



- 12 -
50.    Infrastructure and Arnenities in Relocation Villages (Rs. 1176 million)5. The new
villages would have access roads, internal roads, water supply through standposts with the
distribution system designed for 30 percent individual connections, storm water drainage, power
distribution and street lighting. Beneficiaries would make arrangements with the utility agencies
for individual supply connections, upon payment. Except for the larger villages, the maximum
right of way for roads would be nine meters with a hierarchy appropriate for village conditions.
51.    The program would include repair and rehabilitation of damaged water supply systems in
the districts of Latur and Osmanabad, restoration of borewells in 278 villages, 6 regional water
supply schemes to service about 37 villages supplied from the impounded storage of the Terna
reservoir, and 10 independent village water supply schemes in the affected areas. The regional
water supply schemes from ground water sources would be prepared by consultants, to be
financed under the project. Interim arrangements would be made te supply water to the
resettlement villages through the use of existing or new borewells.
52.    Amenities would be provided in relocation villages to replace such facilities that existed
in the damaged and destroyed villages. These would include panchayat offices, community
centers, schools, health centers and anganwadis. Some facilities such as schools and health
centers that were substantially deficient on space and equipment would be upgraded to conform
to the norms of the state.
53.    Roads and Bridges (Rs. 257 million). This sub-component would include: (a) repair of
damaged culverts and minor bridges; (b) reconstruction of existing culverts and bridges on rural
roads to facilitate all weather access; (c) strengthening of major bridges in the affected areas,
following detailed study by consultants; and (d) construction of off-site roads to resettlement
sites.
54.   Public Buildings (Rs. 261  million).   The project would  include repair and
reconstruction of: (a) state buildings, comprising residential buildings, administrative buildings,
primary health centers, hospitals, polytechnics and industrial training institutes; and (b) Zilla
Parishad buildings, comprising residential and administrative buildings and rural health centers.
55.    School Buildings (Rs. 443 million). This component would include the reconstruction
of about 815 rooms in two districts and repairs to 9,811 rooms in eight districts in 955 primary
and 27 secondary schools.
56.    Irrigation (Rs. 659 million). The program would include short-term and long-term
repair and strengthening of irrigation structures and buildings to conform to the required seismic
zone. The short-term work would include repair and strengthening of embankments in the
Lower Terna dam and the Talni aqueduct, strengthening of embankments less than 10 meters in
height, repairs to about 1,475 percolation tanks in Latur and Osmanabad districts, strengthening
of 180 kilometers of Kohlapur-type weirs and repair and reconstruction of offices and quarters.
S      This component does not include funds for power supply and distribution (Rs. 120 million). It has been
agreed that from the Second Maharashtra Power Project (Loan 3498-IN) would be used to finance repairs to the
distribution system and the connections to the new villages.



- 13 -
57.   The strengthening of 156 embankments, greater than 10 meters height, in Latur and
Osmanabad districts, would be undertaken following studies and recommendations of the state
Dam  Safety Panel, which has yet to be appointed.  To conform  to the Association's
requirements, the findings will be subject to a review by an independent dam safety review
panel. Following this review, the GOM Irrigation Department would prioritize the works for
execution. A provisional sum of Rs. 348 million has been allowed for these works. Once the
study is completed, a prioritization exercise would be undertaken to develop the investment
program, which would be agreed with the Association prior to implementation.
58.   Repairs and  Strengthening  of Historic Monuments (Rs. 119 million).   A
comprehensive study would be undertaken by specialist consultants to review the damage to
protected (state) monuments and other monuments administered by private trusts, in order to
develop a meaningful rehabilitation program. Following this study, the essential and necessary
restoration program would be undertaken after a prioritization exercise. The study would also
include preparation of drawings necessary for repairing the structures and would cover 19
protected monuments and a sample of other monuments yet to be identified.  An expert
committee would be formed to assist in identification and selection of consultants, and advise on
the methods of repair and restoration.
Conununity Rehabilitation (Rs. 301 million)
59.   The costs of works and materials borne by the GOM when re-establishing the essential
services in the transit housing areas would be eligible for financing under the project, provided
their procurement was carried out under procurement procedures acceptable to the Association.
The items that fall under this category are: (i) the replacement of medicine stocks (other than
those provided by donors) for human and veterinary services; (ii) the construction of transit
shelters; and (iii) the provision of services for the transit housing areas.
Economic Rehabilitation (Rs. 185 million)
60.   The program includes the provision for replacement and reconstruction, on a grant basis,
of business losses. This would include replacing farm implements, minor equipment, bullocks,
milch cattle, sheep and goats, repairing dug irrigation wells, and providing rehabilitation
programs for artisans and those operating small businesses.
Social Rehabilitation (Rs. 397 million)
61.   The program would make provision for special facilities and activities to address the
needs of women and children affected by the earthquake, and marginal improvement of facilities
throughout the 13 districts. It would address the broad areas of: shelters for destitute women
and female children, orphans and the handicapped children; counseling and trauma care; and
economic rehabilitation to assist women in becoming independent. The program would provide
2 district resource centers, 10 Balika Sadans, 52 community centers, construction of homes for
the aged and the handicapped, and 2,067 anganwadis. Start-up recurring costs would also be
provided for the district resource centers.  Provision would also be made for employment
training and a village development fund, which would provide opportunities for self-help
income-generating activities for women affected by the earthquake. Prior to utilization of funds
earmarked for the village development fund, the GOM will prepare a detailed proposal
acceptable to the Association.

Environmental Impact
62.   This is a Category B project. It would raise the quality of the environment in the new
villages above the standards to be found in the older villages in the region. The more generous
provision of standpipes for drinking water and the twin-pit latrines in every dwelling unit would
make a major contribution to the health and welfare of the local population. However, no
project that involves the relocation of such a large number of people is expected to have only
positive environmental impacts. To examine the potential environmental effects of each new
village, the GOM has agreed to provide the Association with an environmental statement for
each relocation village and to demonstrate how any adverse impacts would be mitigated. The
issues to be addressed would include surface water drainage, water supply, sanitation, any
reduction in the land available for agriculture and changes in the economic status of the farming
population.
Social Issues
63.   The local population was shocked by the earthquake and continues to be disturbed by the
aftersho.,ks. Throughout the region most people appear to have lost confidence in their old
villages and want to move to earthquake-resistant houses in a new location. In most villages
many people are still living in temporary shelters because they are afraid of their old houses.
Village relocation under this project is voluntary.
64.   To minimize any negative impacts of the resettlement program the GOM has prepared
and is in the process of publishing a full rehabilitation policy and has made arrangements for
implementation plans to be discussed in each village. Appropriate appeals procedures have also
been built in. The agreed planning process is community-based so as to ensure, as far as
possible, that the designs of the new houses and villages are acceptable to the people who would
live in them. Additionally, a rehabilitation action plan has been prepared to the satisfaction of
the Association, to mitigate the effects of land acquisition for relocation villages.
65.    The program also begins to address the problems caused by the loss of confidence of the
local people in their old houses and in the traditional building materials. The project includes
the construction of model houses and a pilot program for the strengthening of the traditional
houses.  It also includes a confidence-building program  as a part of the component for
developing a disaster management system.
Technical Assistance, Training and Equipment (Rs. 662 million)6
66.   This component would provide assistance to both the GOM  and the GOI for project
preparation and implementation, training and equipment. At the state level, the inputs would
include training of small contractors and artisans, and of NGOs, consultants' advice for various
studies and services, incremental costs connected with the PMU operations, recurrent costs of
social programs and off.ce equipment, field equipment, vehicles, and ham radio communications
for the disaster management system. At the GOI level, assistance would be provided to the
6      Excludes recurrent costs of social programs, which are shown under Social Rehabilitation.

Ministry of Science and Technology to develop a program for seismic monitoring and research.
About US$250,000 would be used from the Project Preparation Facility offered by IDA.
67.   Project Preparation and Implementation.  The services needed by the GOM  to
facilitate project preparation and implementation would include:7
(a)    program management experts;
(b)   local and foreign earthquake engineering experts to design the strategy for the
reconstruction, in-situ, and the methods for reconstruction, repair and
strengthening of existing buildings;
(c)    consultants for the condition survey and rehabilitation of public buildings;
(d)    consultants for the condition survey and rehabilitation of historical buildings;
(e)    consultants to undertake the condition survey and advise on strengthening of
major bridges;
(f)   the independent dam safety review panel to study dam strengthening;
(g)    consultants experienced in earthquake engineering to investigate and test, both in
the laboratory and in the field, stone masonry strengthening and repair solutions
to be adopted in the affected areas;
(h)    experts for preparation of educational video films for confidence-building and
public awareness;
(i)    architectural, engineering  and  planning  consultants  to  prepare  detailed
architectural and engineering designs and drawings and contract documentation;
(j)    consultants for quality assurance and technical audit functions;
(k)    consultants to advise on community participation and to monitor the process;
(I)    consultants for preparing the detailed engineering and contract documentation for
the regional water supply schemes;
(m)   consultant for developing the State of Maharashtra disaster management system;
(n)    consultant to advise on emergency radio communication network;
(o)    experts to train village builders and artisans, and NGOs; and
(p)    consultants to advise on the development, implementation and managing of the
earthquake monitoring and research.
Terms of Reference have been prepared and agreed for each consultancy.

68.   Training of Construction Personnel. A primary objective of the housing programn is
the transfer of technology to small contractors and local artisans so as to promote the use of
earthquake-resistant building technology and the safe use of local building materials, particularly
stone. The program would develop three approaches to meet this objective: (a) establishment of
building centers by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) for training
village builders and artisans of various profiles; (b) introduction of new least-cost building
materials; and (c) provision of training programs organized by a PMU.
69.   The structured program of training by the PMU would include the use of specialists to
train the trainee instructors who would, in turn, train local artisans and NGOs. The training
would cover hands-on building works, educational materials and training classes throughout the
13 districts where stone masonry has been used to build the traditional village houses. The
PMU would organize the training through individual specialists or through an appropriate
qualified institution. Proposals would be developed by the PMU for review and approval by the
Association.
70.   Disaster Management System.  It h?s been agreed that the disaster management
program for the state of Maharashtra will have a multi-disaster focus. In addition to being an
earthquake-prone area Maharashtra is known to be affected by floods and cyclones on a regular
basis and portions of its Marathwada region are long-term  drought areas.   A  hazard
preparedness, mitigation and prevention strategy that addresses all relevant disasters would be
much more likely to engage and maintain the attention of the general public and interest of
political decision makers. The plan would be defined with the help of consultants financed
under the project. In addition the project would finance mobile HAM communication equipment
at 24 centers.
71.   Disaster management system consists of the following components: (a) risk assessment,
(b) research and technology transfer, (c) education and training, (d) implementation of hazard
reduction strategies in the built environment, and (e) emergency preparedness planning. All
five components are of equal importance, and the absence of any one of them could undermine
the efficiency of the whole system. The program would develop a disaster management system
for the state of Maharashtra, with an emphasis on disaster emergency response, disaster
awareness, and education. One educational component would be to build confidence in the new
construction techniques within the communities recovering from the earthquake.
72.   The system would have a multi-disaster, natural and manmade hazard focus, and would
target the political and administrative decision-makers, school chiidren, and the public at large.
Audience-specific awareness and education campaigns would be organized; attention would be
paid to continuing education; and training workshops would be planned and conducted for
contractors, developers, design professionals (including architects, engineers and planners), and
members of the construction industry in both the formal and the informal sectors. In this respect,
special attention would be paid to education and training of village masons and artisans in sound
construction practices, including the aseismic component. A consultant would be appointed to
study the available institutional structuie of the State of Maharashtra and to develop a proposal
for a state-wide system of integrated disaster management.
73.   Earthquake Monitoring and Research.  This would be a GOI-managed project
component. The Killari disaster points to the need to augment earthquake research efforts in
South India. India has a well-developed earthquake research community, including a number of



- 17 -
leading seismologists and earthquake engineers. Several national and state organizations have a
long track record of significant contributions to the overall understanding of Indian and global
seismicity, as well as of the effect of earthquakes on buildings.
74.   To initiate a systematic study of earthquake activity in the southern part of India, it
would be necessary to deploy an array of strong motion instruments in the middle and southern
portion of the Indian peninsular shield. Additionally, portable strong motion instruments would
also be provided to enable appropriate monitoring of earthquake aftershocks. The project would
finance earthquake monitcring equipment to be managed by the GOI's Ministry of Science and
Technology. The component would be implemented through a consortium of research agencies
in India. The proposed improvements to seismic monitoring, data processing, staff training and
data sharing would be refined following discussions between all interested parties in India and
with the assistance of an international advisory group. A provisional allocation of Rs. 250
million would be provided in the project. Expenditures for this component would be approved
only after the Association had reviewed a formal proposal endorsed both by the members of the
Indian research conmmunity and the international advisory group.
Program Financing
75.     The total program cost estimate including contingencies is US$327.8 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$32.7 million (10 percent). The proposed Credit of US$246
million would finance about 78 percent of program costs, excluding taxes and duties, which are
estimated at US$15 million. The GOM would finance US$39.7 million (12 percent of program
cost) and the GOI would finance US$1.0 million (0.5 percent of program cost). Donors would
finance US$41.1 million (12.5 percent of program cost). The donor contribution includes 10
million Pounds Sterling (about US$15.3 million) of cofinapcing from the British government,
which has been agreed in principle. Parallel financing of US$0.6 million from ADB has also
been agreed in principle to finance program  implementation support.  The repair and
reconstruction of power supply and distribution estimated to cost about US$4.0 million would be
separately financed out of the Second Maharashtra Power Project.
D. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
76.   Experience from other emergency projects indicates that effective project management
would require the following:
(a)    a strong manager and management team with drive, leadership, and authority;
(b)    an autonomous implementing agency with full administrative and financial
powers including delegated powers to procure goods, works and services
without reference to higher levels;
(c)    a steering committee that would provide guidance and prompt action to remove
obstacles;
(d)    availability  of requisite  technical  inputs  recruited  from  outside  the
administration;



- 18 -
(e)    availability  of project management experts recruited  from  outside the
administration; and
(f)    capability and capacity to monitor and report on the program, trouble shoot, and
adopt corrective measures where appropriate.
Program Management Structure
77.   To address these requirements, the GOM  has introduced a three-tier institutional
framework:
(a)    cabinet sub-committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister for program
policy and guidance;
(b)    Central Implementation Group (CIG) under the chairmanship of the Chief
Secretary for monitoring and facilitation. Other members of the CIG would
include: Principal Secretary (Finance Department), Secretary and Special
Commissioner (Earthquake Relief and Rehabilitation); and
(c)    Program Management Unit (PMU) with overall responsibility for implementing
the program. The PMU would be headed by the SCER, which is a special post
created for implementing the program.  The SCER-PMU  would be the
nominated Project Director (PD), who would have full administrative and
financial responsibility including approval of village and house planning, project
preparation, contract awards, construction supervision, monitoring and
reporting. The PD would be assisted by a consultant project management team
assembled from outside the GOM.
78.   The GOM  has agreed to introduce the following operating procedures to facilitate
program implementation:
(a)   the PD will be delegated full administrative and financial powers for the
implementation of the program, including the award of contracts;
(b)    a new budget head will be created for the Emergency Earthquake Rehabilitation
Project;
(c)   the PD will have the powers to allocate funds to the line departments for
program implementation;
(d)   the PD will employ a program management consultant team to drive and monitor
program implementation;
(e)   the PMU will be staffed with technical officers, administrative officers (of
Deputy Collector rank), financial officers and sociologists from other
government departments against posts created for the PMU-
(f)   the PMU would engage external experts for village planning and design of
housing and infrastructure services, earthquake and structural engineering,



- 19 -
damage assessment, monitoring and supervision of works, community
participation, and for any other specific short-term activities;
(g)   the PMU will be fully responsible for all housing components;
(h)   for non-housing activities, teams of specialist staff will be created in each
concerned line department for program implementation;
(i)   for contract awards, the special teams from line departments will carry out bid
evaluations and submit their recommendations directly to the PMU, without
routing them through their own departments;
(j)   the District Collector of each district in the affected area would act as an agent
of the PMU to coordinate and monitor project activities and provide logistical
support to the PMU. The District Collector would be assigned an Additional
District Collector who would be engaged full time on the program activities.
The District Collector would be empowered to provide administrative approvals
for sub-projects up to a fixed value;
(k)   the Chief Engineer of the PMU will have full power for technical sanctions and
award of contracts; and
()    an independent full-time quality assurance and technical audit team will be
established to review the delivery and quality of the program outputs and to
assess whether they meet program objectives.
Program Implementation
79.   Implementation Period and Credit Closing. The program would be implemented over
a three-year period. The Credit closing date has been fixed for June 30, 1997.
80.   Agencies. The PMU will be responsible for implementation of the whole program. The
PMU will be directly responsible, through its own staff and consultants, for implementation of
the housing components. For the relocation villages, PMU would engage consultants to prepare
house designs, village layouts, engineering designs and contract documentation. They would
also carry out supervision of works and contract administration. PMU's technical officers,
assisted by specialists, would be responsible for the reconstruction of individual houses in the
old villages and the repair and rehabilitation components. The non-housing components would
be implemented by the line departments, but under the overall supervision of the PMU. A bar
chart indicating the implementation phasing of the various components is given in Attachment 4.
81.   Ownership and Quality at Entry.  Considerable emphasis would be placed on the
project ownership through an extensive consultative process with the affected people,
particularly those slated for relocation to new relocation villages, even though this would be an
entirely voluntary exercise. Through village groups and committees, the affected people would
be involved in site selection, layout development, house designs, plot allocation, and monitoring
the construction by contractors, and sometimes, the construction process itself.  For the
individual house construction (of 29,600 units), and repair and rehabilitation (of 180,000 units),
the work would be undertaken as a community-based owner-controlled exercise assisted by the



- 20 -
PMU officers and specialists. The GOM has agreed that the time investment in community
participation would be worthwhile. Despite the emergency nature of the program, detailed
engineering design, working drawings and contract documentation were ready by negotiations
for about 25 percent of the relocation villages, and for other infrastructure such as roads and
irrigation works these were ready by negotiations.
82.   Quality Assurance and Technical Audit.  In addition to the supervisory functions
carried out by program consultants and line agency staff, the project would provide for
additional independent checks of quality of work and an audit of assets created.  This
management tool would be used by the PMU and the CIG to review the delivery and quality of
products, to assess whether they meet program objectives, and to take necessary corrective steps.
The functions of quality assurance and technical audit would be done by independent consultants
who would visit the work sites periodically, but no less than once a quarter. They would report
their findings to the PD and the Chief Secretary (in the capacity of chairman of the CIG).
83.   Procurement. All procurement of works, goods and consultancy services would be in
accordance with the Association Guidelines.  Procurement plans, giving details of the
procurement arrangements for all project expenditures to be financed by the Association, are
agreed. The procurement methods are summarized in Schedule B attached to the MOP. Bid
documents have been agreed, based on the Association's standard bid documents for civil works
and goods procurement. These will be used by all agencies.
84.   For housing and infrastructure in the 49 relocation villages, about a quarter of the
houses to be reconstructed in situ (7,000 units), and other civil works, the contracts would be
small. They would also be scattered over the districts of Latur, Osmanabad and Solapur, located
500 kilometers from Bombay. The contracts for these would be unlikely to attract interest of
foreign contractors, and the bidding would use LCB procedures acceptable to the Association.
These would total about US$142 million and vary in value from Rs. 10 million (about US$0.3
million) to Rs. 100 million (about US$3.2 million). Bids would be invited on a "slice and
package" basis. Post-qualification would be adopted for all LCB contracts with the minimum
qualifying criteria fixed for each slice and group of slices.
85.   Procurement of small and emergency works, such as restoration of essential services,
and embankment repair costing less than US$100,000 each (estimated total of US$7.7 million)
would be carried out either by force account, or by limited local bidding (that is, inviting bids
from not fewer than three bidders, from a pre-selected list of bidders meeting minimum
qualification criteria).
86.   The balance of the sub-component for housing  reconstruction, repair and
rehabilitation in-situ (22,600 houses and 180,000 damaged houses) will be carried out through
community-based construction by owner-controlled mechanisms using small contractors,
artisans, or the house owner's own labor, assisted by NGOs, with PMU staff providing the
technical support to produce earthquake-resistant houses and using materials provided by the
government. The GOM is required to prepare an action plan acceptable to the Association to
implement this sub-component prior to construction. Subject to the agreement of the action
plan, it is proposed that the GOM would procure the materials through a mixture of ICB,
estimated at US$56 million, and LCB procedures estimated at US$27 million. They would be
distributed through materials stores operated by the PMU or concessionaires. Except for sand,



-21 -
gravel, bricks, blocks and other basic building materials, all other materials would be procured
on the basis of ICB.
87.   To estimate the cost of the repairs the PMU would develop unit labor rates for different
items of work, based on bid prices received for contractor-built houses. Contracts would be
between the homeowner and small contractors or NGOs. Fund allocations to beneficiaries
would be based on the extent of damage, varying from about Rs. 1,000 (about US$35) up to a
maximum of Rs. 54,000 (about US$1,730), the latter being the value of a 250 square foot core
house. Materials and funds would be made available to eligible beneficiaries on a staged basis
with appropriate control mechanisms. Labor cost for owner-controlled works is estimated at
US$15 million.
88.   Contracts for other equipment, materials and vehicles costing US$200,000 or more
would be procured under ICB procedures. Contracts under US$200,000, up to an aggregate of
US$30 million, would be procured using LCB procedures acceptable to the Association. Local
shopping following three quotations would be used for items such as seismic equipment and
computers, and for the purchase of equipment, materials and vehicles, costing less than
US$50,000 each, up to a total of US$2 million.
89.   Beneficiary purchases at livestock markets and fairs, under the supervision of veterinary
officials, would be used for procurement of livestock costing up to US$500 each, up to an
aggregate of US$2 million.
90.   Prior reviews would apply to contracts for works costing US$500,000 or more, totaling
an estimated US$100 million (about 50 percent of works), and contracts for equipment, materials
and vehicles costing US$200,000 or more, totaling an estimated US$80 million (70 percent of
materials and equipment).
91.   Consulting services would be procured in accordance with Association Guidelines on
the Use of Consultants. Some services which are required on an emergency basis and where
work must begin immediately may be procured on a sole-source basis, subject to the
Association's approval of the consultant selection and the consulting contract including terms of
reference and work plan. A mixture of consulting firms and individuals is anticipated. These
sole-source consultancies would be for community planning, village and house designs,
infrastructure service designs and seismic experts. Consultant services will be procured largely
from Indian sources, but some experts for the dam safety review panel and some seismic experts
would be from overseas. The aggregate value of sole-source consulting services is estimated at
US$1.5 million, out of the total of about US$3.4 million allocated. Other consulting services
would be procured following the preparation and Association approval of short lists, terms of
reference and draft contracts, the invitation of proposals, and the award of the contract after the
Association's approval of the proposal evaluation report and the Association's review of the
winning proposal.
92.   Bid Evaluation and Award. Pre-qualification of contractors is not proposed because of
the nature and size of works and the time constraints. Post-qualification criteria would be
explicitly stated in the bidding documents, and those who do not meet the criteria would be
declared unresponsive. The two-envelope system for civil works contracts would not be
acceptable. Bids would be received on the prescribed day, following a bidding period of 30
days minimum (this would vary from 30 to 90 days depending on the size of the package), and



- 22 -
opened in public. All bids would be opened and read out irrespective of whether or not the bid
security was enclosed. If the bid did not meet the post-qualification criteria or did not contain
the bid surety, such bids wou'.. be rejected, even if they were the lowest bid. Bids would be
evaluated and awarded within the original bid validity period, which would not exceed 90 days.
Re-bidding to obtain lower prices will not be permitted, unless adequately justified and approved
by the Association beforehand.
93.   The Association's prior review and approval of tender documents, prior to tender
invitation, and of tender evaluation reports prior to contract award would be required for
contracts for works costing US$500,000 equivalent or more, and contracts for equipment,
materials and vehicles costing US$200,000 equivalent or more.
Disbursements
94.   The project is expected to be implemented in three years, with a Credit closing date set
for June 30, 1997. Retroactive financing for expenditures incurred between the date of the
earthquake and Credit signature would be eligible for disbursement. A maximum of SDR 10
million (about US$14 million equivalent) will be required for this purpose.
95.   The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed against eligible expenditures at the
following percentages: 75 percent of expenditures for civil works, 100 percent of foreign
expenditures, 100 percent of local ex-factory expenditures, and 80 percent of expenditures for
other items procured locally for materials, equipment and vehicles; 100 percent for project
preparation and implementation support and training; and 75 percent of expenditures for
incremental costs of PMU and recurrent costs of social services. An estimated schedule of
disbursements is given in Attachment 2 and summarized in Schedule B of the MOP.
96.   To facilitate project implementation, a Special Account would be established in US
dollars at the Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$20 million, equal to about
three-months expenditures, from which project expenditures would be reimbursed. The GOI
would, throughout the life of the project, release about three months worth of anticipated project
expenditures, in advance, to the GOM. The GOM would make similar advances to the
implementing agencies promptly after such releases, for project expenditures, through setting up
the Letters of Credit, release of funds and governrnent orders to implementing agencies, in
accordance with the normal procedures for financing state expenditures.
97.   Disbursements against civil works contracts of under US$0.5 million, contracts for
materials under $200,000 and incremental operating costs would be made against Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs). All other payments would be made against full documentation. All
supporting documents for SOEs would be retained by the responsible participating agencies, and
appropriately filed to enable easy access for subsequent review and audit.
98.   For those expenditures that have been authorized for the use of SOEs, the Association's
normal procedures would be followed. SOEs would be certified by the GOI as representing
eligible project expenditures and on which basis (in addition to the normal documentation such
as Withdrawal Application and Special Account Statement) the expenditures would be
reimbursed from the Special Account, which would subsequently be replenished by the
Association.



- 23 -
99.   The procedure for preparing SOEs would be as follows:
(a)    project expenditures would be summarized monthly for each participating agency
or department under expense headings agreed %,ith the Association and would
accompany a sub-SOE (an SOE for a single agency or department) which would
be certified by the designated signatory ar.d forwarded to the PMU within five
working days of the end of each month;
(b)   the PMU would summarize the sub-SOEs into an SOE which would be certified
and forward within 10 days of the end of each month to the of the GOI for
processing and reimbursement from the Special Account.  (All supporting
documentation for the SOEs would be retained by the responsible participating
department or agency and filed for purposes of future review and audit);
(c)   throughout the life of the project, the GOI would advance about three months
worth of expenditures to the GOM. Promptly after each advance is received, the
GOM would make similar advances, for project expenditures, to the
participating departments and agencies, through setting up the Letters of Credit,
release of funds and government orders; and'
(d)   the GOM would make counterpart funds available in a timely manner through
inclusion in the annual state budgets including a supplementary provision until
the next budget plan is prepared.
Accounts, Audits and Reports
100.  The project accounts would be maintained according to the following guidelines:
(a)   the project accounts prepared by each participating department or agency would
be subject to the normal GOI and GOM accounting procedures and controls with
the added requirement that a separate heading would be created in the accounts
for each department or agency with appropriate sub-headings for each sub-
component of the project;
(b)   the monthly summaries, prepared to support the sub-SOEs, would provide the
"basic building block" for the project accounts maintained by the PMU with
appropriate cross-referencing to allow the "paper trail" to be followed. Non-
SOE expenditures would be separately incorporated into the accounts and copies
of the related documentation retained for inspection;
(c)   the project accounts would be summarized on an ongoing basis to show:
(i)    actual versus planned expenditures for each quarter;
(ii)   how expenditures are financed, by the Association and the
GOM;
(iii)  actual versus planned expenditures to date; and



- 24 -
(d)    appended to the project accounts would be a listing of the Withdrawal
Applications for the period concerned, showing the amounts reimbursed.
Unaudited project accounts with this attachment would be eubmitted by the
PMU, on a quarterly basis to reach the Association within 45 days after the end
of the quarter.
101.  The Accountant General of the Maharashtra would be considered the acceptable auditor.
Audited project accounts, including SOEs and accompanied by an auditor's report, would be
submitted annually to the Association, no later than nine months after the end of each fiscal
year.
102.  The Auditor General of India would be the acceptable auditor for the Special Account.
The Auditor's Report, accompanied by a Summary Statement of the Special Account, would be
submitted to the Association no later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
103.  The PMU would prepare a quarterly progress report in an agreed format, showing the
physical progress of each project component, compared against the agreed plan with an
explanation for each deviation and listing the remedial action taken. Such quarterly reports
would be submitted to the Association concurrently with the quarterly accounts discussed above.
A list of performance indicators is included as Attachment 5.

Community Participation Procedures
Rapid Assessment of People's Views on House Design
1.        Identify major groups within a village (on the basis of caste, class, etc.).
2.         Ask each of the identified groups to show layouts of their earlier houses (on paper or on
the ground).
3.         Visit some of the existing old houses in the village with the people.
4.         Discuss space use and important features of the houses.
5.         Ask them to list out the features of the earlier houses that they would like to retain (to be
shown on the diagram with the location).
6.         Ask them if there are any new features that they would like to see in their new houses and
where should these be located (to be shown on the diagram).
7.         Ask the people to sketch out the layout of the new houses (as they would like to see
them). Provide outeines of the plots in square and/or rectangular shapes.
8.         Architects to prepare 3-4 different house designs (for each of the three categories) on the
basis of these inputs from the people.
9.         Prepare scale models of these designs.
10.        Take these back to the village and show them to the people (in groups) and get their
feedback.
11.        Make necessary changes and finalize the choice of designs.
Planning the Village Layouts
12.        This process has to be carried out in every village.
13.        Ask the people to prepare a layout of the old village (on ground or on paper).
14.        Ask them to show (on the diagram) the important features of the old village.

15.        Walk through the old village with the people and ask them to explain the layout (also
observe and ask questions).
16.        Walk through the new site with different groups of people to understand the space
available.
17.        On a blank site outline (on paper) ask different groups to indicate their preferred space
use (houses, open spaces, roads - shape, width and length, configuration, infrastructure, services,
community buildings and spaces, etc.
18.        Refer to the old village layout and ask them to indicate the features that they would like
to retain (also what they don't want and any new features that they may like).
19.        Presentation of the analysis done by different groups in a village meeting and arrive at a
consensus on broad delineation of space use and infrastructure.
20.        Planners to prepare a site layout on the basis of inputs provided by the people. (More
than one option can also be generated.)
21.        Take the proposed layout(s) to the village and discuss, in groups, with the people.
22.         Incorporate their feedback and finalize the plan.
23.         Display the plan in the village.
