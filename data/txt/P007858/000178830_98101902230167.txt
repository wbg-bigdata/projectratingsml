REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY
FOR THE 34ALL FARMER CREDIT AND RURAL DEVELOPMENI PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$11.0 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for Small Farmer Credit and
Rural Development. The part of the proceeds of the proposed Credit (about
US$6.2 million) allocated for on-farm credit would be relent to the
Government-owned Banco Nacional de Fomento for 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, at an interest rate of 5% per annum. The Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk.
PART I   -   THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Paraguay in September 1973 and again
in February 1974. The resulting economic report (299a-PA) was distributed
on May 1D, 1974. A summary of Country Basic Data is attached in Annex I.
3.        Paraguay is a predominantly agricultural country of about
2.4 million inhabitants, located in the flat tropical heartland of the
South American continent. After a long period of political and economic
turmoil following the Chaco War (1931-35), the country's economy recovered
in the 1960s and achieved an average annual growth of 4.6% per annum during
1962-72. Output growth proved insufficient to provide adequate employment
opportunities but continued emigration to neighboring Argentina helped to
contain the growth of population, eased the unemployment problem and per-
mitted an improvement of almost one-fifth in per capita income during the
decade. Although per capita income in 1970 was less than one-half of the
South American average, its distribution was about the same as that of the
continent. Literacy rates appear to be higher than for countries at a
similar stage of development, notwithstanding below average educational
facilities.
4.        Paraguay is a landlocked country and conducts most of its world
trade through Argentina and Brazil. The high cost of shipping its products
to the nearest seaports has delayed the country from taking full advantages
of its agricultural and labor resources and determined the nature of its
export trade. Paraguay specializes in the production of agricultural and
livestock goods with high unit values. In addition to world market fluctua-
tions, a significant part of the country's exports is dependent on supply



- 2 -
and demand fluctuations in neighboring countries. Paraguayan econcnic
prospects appear to be favorable, however, over the longer term. Exten-
sive areas of unused land suitable for agropastoral and forestry produc-
tion provide opportunities for large scale colonization and expanded
production. Technological improvements, now underway, are expected to
increase substantially the productivity of land already under cultivation.
The country's vast water power resources are expected to provide a plenti-
ful source of cheap energy and foreign exchange earnings. Additional
transportation facilities are expected to further enhance the competitive
position of Paraguay's products in world markets. Finally, the deepening
of agricultural and forestry products processing industries is expected to
continue raising the value-added content of Paraguayan exports.
5.        Economic growth accelerated in the 1970s.   Between 1969 and 1973,
overall output increased at an average rate of 5.5% per annum and, despite
a setback in 1971 resulting from adverse weather conditions, the aggregate
production target set by the 1971-75 Development Plan was met in 1973. The
Paraguayan economy responded quickly to the stimulus provided by rising
world demand for its export products during the period. The supply response
was facilitated by earlier investments in transportation, official assistance
to mechanize agriculture, and the reinforcement of fiscal and credit export
incentives. Export earnings boomed between 1969 and 1973, easing the foreign
exchange constraint to growth and boosting damestic savings.
6.        Government investment spending in the last three years lagged
behind the targets set by the Development Plan. The country's investment
rate, however, increased as a result of greater investment outlays by the
rest of the public sector and by the private sector. The decline in
Government investment expenditures was caused by the completion of some
lumpy infrastructural projects as well as by budgetary stringencies during
most of the period.
7.        The fiscal situation deteriorated in the early 1970s.   Despite the
expansion of output and trade, Government revenues remained almost stagnarLt
in the face of growing current expenditures. To deal with this situation,
the Government made key personnel changes in the tax and customs administra-
tion and introduced a number of revenue measures.   At the CIAP Country Review
held in January 1972, the authorities established targets for fiscal improve-
ment in 1972 and 1973 aiming to restore Government savings to the peak levels
achieved in the past. The fiscal situation deteriorated further in 1972,
but improved markedly in 1973, when the revenue targets established two years
earlier were met and Government recourse to Central Bark financing ceased.
This was made possible by Government's actions to increase certain taxes and
to improve the performance of the Income Tax and Customs Administrations as
well as by an upsurge in imports, which helped to increase revenues from
import duties.
8.        While the strengthening of external demand for Paraguayan products
gave considerable impetus to output growth in the 1970s, increased export
prices and world inflationary conditions broke Paraguay's impressive record



- 3 -
of price stability. The consumer price index which, iII the secorn half
of the 1960s, increased at an average annual rate of 1.3%, rose br 5% in
1971, 10% in 1972 and 13% in 1973. Wholesale prices, however, increased
faster last year (33%) largely reflecting price hikes in interiationally
tradeable commodities.
9.        Government efforts to curb inflation followed a three-pronged
approach: measures to control domestic prices of exportable foodstuffs
(particularly beef), strict control over real wages, and increased fiscal
effort to mop up purchasing power. At the same time, disincentives to
imports of consumer foods were maintained while applying a liberal policy
of duty exemptions towards imports of capital goods and transport equipment.
Although they helped to contain price rises, these policies failed to break
the inflationary impulse. Beef price and marketing controls, most of them re-
moved since February 1974, proved to be largely ineffective as the system of
export quotas associated with them created speculative expectations on the
part of ranchers and led to scarcities in the domestic market. Government
incomes policy depressed real wages in urban areas (particularly those of
public servants), but real wages in the countryside increased rapidly under
the influence of rising export prices and labor shortages at harvesting time.
The improvement in the Central Government financial situation in 1973 and
the elimination of the overall fiscal deficit contributed, however, to cooling
off the economy.
10.       Given the Paraguayan economy's relatively small size and large
degree of openness, anti-inflationary policy is likely to be only partially
effective so long as worldwide inflation persists. The Government strategy
to contain inflation has been by and large correct, except for the beef price
policy followed until recently. As long as fiscal, monetary and incomes
policies continue in their present form, domestically generated inflation
is likely to subside. Inflationary prospects, however, have become somewhat
more threatening as a result of the increase in world petroleum prices. In
recent months the price of oil landed in Asuncion trebled, which caused re-
tail prices of petroleum products to double. It is expected that the price
hike will trigger a first round increase of some 3% in the consumer price
index, but its impact over the year is likely to be somewhat greater.
11.       As of December 31, 1973, Paraguay's outstanding and disbursed
external public debt repayable in foreign currency was US$106 million, compared
with a total of US$97 million a year earlier. The Bank Group share in the
former total was US$28 million as compared with a level of US$25 million a
year before. In 1973, net public medium and long-term external debt is est-
imated to have increased at a somewhat higher pace as a consequence of the
upturn in investment experienced during the year.
12.       Paraguay contracted new external obligations amounting to US$115
million in 1968-72, over 60% of which was contracted with bilateral credit
agencies. Of the remaining 40% the Bank Group provided the largest share
(18%), with roughly a blend of 50% IDA funds and 50% of IBRD funds. In



- 4 -
addition, new loans disbursable in foreign currency but repayable in local
currency were contracted with the IDB for a total of US$64 million. The
rhythm of new external commitments is expected to accelerate in 1974 as a
result of certain bunching in the preparation of projects amenable to exter-
nal financing as well as greater availability of counterpart funds following
recent improvements in domestic resource mobilization.
13.       Despite Paraguay's impressive export performance in 1972-73 and
the promising prospects for 197h-76, the country will continue to need sub-
stantial inflows of external assistance in order to attain its growth and
employment objectives. Furthermore, local cost financing appears justified
on grounds that the country's economic performance, particularly the fiscal
effort, has continued to improve, and that in order to fully cover the resource
gap, external lenders would need to finance part of the local costs of projects
in which they participate. Additional capital inflows will also be required
to finance the increase in Paraguay's import bill resulting from the recent
increase in international oil prices. The oil import bill, which in 1972 was
about US$8 million or 11% of imports of goods, is expected to climb to some
US$30 million in 1974, which would be about 20% of total imports. However,
since Paraguay has obtained the bulk of its foreign capital needs on conces-
sionary terms and since its exports are expected to continue increasing at
.high growth rates, the country's creditworthiness is not expected to be impaired
Db the recent changes in oil prices.
14.       The debt-service ratio remained within the range of 10% to 16% in
1968-72 and declined in 1973 to 14.4% of exports of goods and nonfactor ser-
vices. The country's debt service ratio is unlikely to exceed 10% in the
remainder of the decade provided that additional capital is contracted on
terms comparable to those of the recent past. The Bank Group's share in the
debt service amounts to about 5% of the total and in 1973 represented 0.8%
of exports of goods and nonfactor services. Under these circumstances, and
while the country ought to continue meeting its capital requirements on at
least as favorable terms as it enjoyed in the past, Paraguay remains credit-
worthy for a limited amount of IBRD lending. However, given Paraguay's limited
foreign exchange earnings and debt servicing capacity, its relative poverty,
and development performance, Paraguay has a continuing need for some financing
on IDA terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PARAGUAY
15.       Paraguay has received US$48.3 million (net of carcellations) in
Bank loans and IDA credits. Of this amount, US$21.8 million has been in the
form of six IBRD loans, while five credits totalling US$26.5 million have
been from IDA resources. As of June 30, 1974, the Bank held US$16.3 million,
including US$2.5 million undisbursed, and IDA US$26.3 million, including
US$5.1 million undisbursed. On a sectoral basis, Bank Group assistance to
Paraguay has been 50% for agriculture, 39% for transportation, and 11% for
education. Execution of Bank Group-financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory. There has been a delay, however, in disbursing the loan for
the Second Highway Maintenance Project, as the fiscal situation forced the



Government to reduce the highway maintenance budget; this has now been
corrected since the Government has appropriated sufficient funds in the
1974 Budget for this purpose.
16.       Thus far, IFC has made no loans or investments in Paraguay.
It is studying an integrated forestry project which could have a significant
impact on Paraguay's foreign exchange earnings. Annex II contains a summary
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of June 30, 1974, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
17.       In FY74 the Bank Group did not make any new loans or credits to
Paraguay. In FY75 the lending program consists of the proposed credit, the
loan .to help expand beef production also under consideration today, and a
highway project, the appraisal of which is being completed. Also, highway
maintenance, pre-investment and agro-industrial projects are being prepared,
for possible consideration by the Executive Directors at a later date.
18.       In lending to Paraguay, the Bank Group tries to assist the
Government in achieving four major objectives. These objectives are inter-
dependent and complementary; hence, it is not possible to rank them in order
of priority or importance. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth
more widely than before and, more particularly, to attack directly the prob-
lem of rural poverty. A second objective is to help Paraguay expand output,
including exports, by investing in projects that directly or indirectly make
large contributions to production and employment. A third objective is to
bring about institutional improvements in the management of the economy and
in the development of public financial intermediaries.  A fourth objective is
to transfer sufficient external resources to complement Paraguay's domestic
savings and provide the necessary funds for maintaining an adequate level of
economic and social investments in a framework of sound domestic finances and
a viable balance of payments position.  In keeping with the latter objective,
Paraguay would, as a "blend" country, receive IDA and Bank financing.
19.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of the
Bank Group's program in Paraguay, the other three jointly determine its
structure. The Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project is designed
to help ease the rural poverty problem; basically, the Bank Group would
assist in consolidating three colonization settlements, a strategy which is
consistent with promoting better resource utilization and which complements
the role of other international lenders, notably IDB and AID, in the small
farmer field. In addition, through the credit portion of the proposed Small
Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project, the Bank Group plans to strengthen
Banco Nacional de Fomento, the country's principal development financing
institution, in cooperation with the IDB. Loans for highway and highway
maintenance are designed both to transfer resources to Paraguay and to help
expand the country's paved road network, which is considered crucial for ex-
panding agricultural output, and to consolidate the Bank Group's ongoing
efforts to strengthen the highway maintenance organization. Bank Group



assistance for agro-industry is to help increase the processing of
agricultural products destined for export and expand marketing outlets,
particularly for small farmers.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
20.       Agriculture dominates the Paraguayan economy and is likely to
continue to do so for the foreseeable future because of the country's
factor endowment, its lack of most other natural resources (excepting
hydroelectrical energy) and the limited size of the domestic market. The
proportion of population engaged in agriculture has remained steady at
about 60% during the 1967-72 period. Agriculture's contribution to GDP
was 31% in 1972. Within agriculture, crop production contributes 58% and
is the most important subsector, followed by livestock with 30% and forestry
with 12%. The sector supplies 93% of the domestic needs for agricultural
products and provides 91% of the country's total export earnings.
21.       The performance of agriculture over the last decade has been
mixed. Between 1962 and 1970 production increased at an average rate of
about 2.5% per annum, barely keeping pace with the annual rate of population
growth (2.4%). In response to the Government's programs to increase the
area planted to wheat, soybeans, rice, and sugarcane, however, output accel-
erated and reached an average growth rate of 4.3% per annum during 1969-72.
22.       While there are still considerable cultivatable virgin lands, most
of the country's settled area has an uneven land distribution. About 96%
of the total number of farms are of less than 100 ha. in size and 61% are less
than 10 ha. Moreover, 60% of these small units (10 ha.) are concentrated
in the area south of Asuncion known as the "minifundia" zone which covers
less than 4% of the total area. At the other extreme, 76 extensive livestock
ranches each larger than 25,000 ha. in the Chaco, and 106 holdings of more
than 10,000 ha. in the Eastern Region account for 14 million ha. or 36% of
the whole country. A large portion of these lands, however, is either un-
suited for cultivation or, if suited, has at present no economic justific-
ation for its use for crop production. Extensive livestock operations are
likely to prevail on them for the foreseeable future. Also, the state still
owns 29% of all land, mainly in the semiarid Chaco.
23.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) is responsible for
policy formulation and administration of supporting services for the sector.
The most important functions of MAG are: agricultural development, technical
education, research and extension, agricultural credit and cooperatives,
agricultural statistics and land reform.  Most of the agricultural education
and research is provided by the National University at Asuncion. The Institute
of Rural Welfare (I3R) is responsible for land tenure, land reform and



- 7 -
colonization programs. Credit is provided by the Banco Nacional de3
Fomento (BNF), the Fondo Ganadero (FG), and the Credito Agricola de
Habilitacion (CAH). The National Service for the Control of Foot-and-
Mouth Disease (SENALFA) and a National Program for Livestock Research
(PRONEGA) provide services for the livestock subsector.
Rural Poverty
24.       Although the data available on income distribution in Paraguay
is scanty and little is known about its representativeness and reliability,
a household incones survey for 1970 carried out by the Instituto de
Desarrollo Integral y Armonico (IDIA) showed, among other things, that the
poverty problem is particularly critical in the rural areas. This skewness
is easily explainable in an economy where the population is mainly rural
and where well over four-fifths of the farmers may be characterized as
small farmers, a high proportion of whom are in the subsistence category.
25.       No satisfactory single assessment can be made of the problems
effecting small farmers in Paraguay; they range from extremely low capital
formation to the intrinsic difficulties found in a poor rural society. One
problem is ccmmon, however: small farmers receive insufficient credit and
technical assistance; their conmunities have deficient transport and market-
ing facilities and also lack social infrastructure. Overccning these con-
straints would go a long way in providing them with a sound basis for raising
productivity, inccmes, and output.
Government Action
26.       With the assistance of external lenders, the Government has
embarked upon programs to help improve the inccme levels of the rural poor.
An IDB-sponsored program is providing credit, storage, marketing, research,
and agricultural education, while AID is financing cooperatives and credit
associations of small farmers. The Government is now concentrating on the
consolidation of land settlements. This is a departure from previous policies
which were aimed at settling the largest number of families at the lowest
possible cost. Settlements on this basis clearly failed to increase appreci-
ably the living standards of the settlers. Between 1908 and 1962 the Government
settled 45,000 families in 170 colonies and from 1962 to 1973 another 40,000
families in 2h8 colonies, for a total of over 400 settlements on 3.7 million
ha. This massive movement of population has relieved, to a large extent, the
pressure on the minifundia areas, where the number of holdings of less than
ten ha. is estimated to have decreased by 13% between 1961 and 1971. At the
same time it served to open up the country. But, because of limited resources
and institutional weaknesses, settlers have not received sufficient back-up
services, financial support, and technical assistance to enable them to rise
much above a subsistence level of production. The Government has now decided



- 8 -
that much more has to be done by way of infrastructure, technical
assistance, and credit if settlers are to break away from rural poverty.
In 1972, as a first step in this direction, the Consejo Nacional de
Progreso Social (CNPS), with the assistance of UNDP/FAO, mounted a five-
year integrated development program covering 23 Government-sponsored
colonies on the "northern axis."
27.       To increase the volume of credit channeled to small farmers,
the Government plans to strengthen Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF). In
this context, it is seeking technical assistance and financial support
fram external lenders, particularly frca the IDB which has been associated
with BNF for about 12 years.
Bank Group Strategy for Rural Development
28.       The Bank Group's strategy for rural development would be to assist
the Government in its efforts to consolidate the existing colonization
settlements. This strategy is consonant with promoting better resource
utilization and would have the dual objective of raising the inccmes of the
rural poor and agricultural output. The main beneficiaries of the proposed
Bank Group assistance for rural development would be families whose inccre
levels fall within the lowest 40% of the population, i.e., an annual average
family income of less than US$875, measured in 1974 dollars.
29.       The approach would cover a wide spectrum of activities, including
credit for on-farm investment and production, technical assistance, road
construction and improvement, rural education, health, and community dev-
elopment.  Although the projects would have an important regional impact,
the major benefits would accrue to the specific colonies included in the
project.  The project has been designed so as to maintain the cost per settler
at a reasonable level. As more experience is gained with the progress made
under the proposed Small Farmer and Rural Deve:Lopment Project, adjustments
would be made, if necessary, in the design of similar future Bank Group projects.
PART IV - TBE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project would be the fifth Bank Group operation for
agricultural development in Paraguay. In 1951 a US$5 million loan was made
to finance the importation of supplies and equipment to help improve farm-
ing methods and transport facilities.  This was followed by a US$3.6 million
IDA credit to support the first stage of the Government's cattle development
program. The project was ccnpleted successfully and, as a consequence, in



- 9 -
1966 IDA granted a second credit, this time for US$7.5 million, for the
continuation of the cattle development program. The second project was
also successful and in 1969 the Bank made a US$4.3 million lo-n, and IDA
a US$h.3 million credit, to help finance the third stage of the cattle
development program. Project execution has been satisfactory despite the
one-year delay in disbursing the Third Livestock Credit Project. In add-
ition to these projects, a US$10 million loan to further assist cattle
development in Paraguay is being presented for your approval today.
31.       A Bank Group economic mission identified the project in October 1971
and the preparation report was completed by the FAO/IBRD cooperative program
in April 1973. The project was then appraised by a Bank Group mission in
October 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington from July 1 to 2, 1974.
32.       A project appraisal report entitled "Paraguay - Small Farmer
Credit and Rural Development Project" (No. 413a-PA dated July 17, 1974)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. The main
features of the project are summarized in Annex III hereto.
Project Description
33.       This is an integrated rural development project aimed at increasing
production and at improving the level of living of the rural poor. The pro-
ceeds of the proposed credit would be used, in part, to support a three year
lending program of the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) which would provide
short-term working capital and long-term investment credit to benefit small
farmers in three public settlement colonies in the Eastern Region of Paraguay:
Mallorquin, Repatriacion, and Gen. Stroessner. The credit would also finance
basic infrastructure investments. These would consist of: (a) the purchase
of earthmoving equipment for the construction of 250 km. of earth roads; (b)
the construction of bridges and culverts for earth roads; (c) the construction
of 60 km. of all-weather roads; (d) the construction of 26 primary schools for
a total of 102 classrooms; (e) making available better health facilities by
constructing two health centers and by equipping an already built center; and
(f) the construction of three community centers. If successful, the pattern
of this project would serve as the basis for developing the many other exist-
ing settlements which are in need of similar investments and assistance.
Project Administration and Coordination
3h.       The project would be carried out by different ministries and public
agencies; each responsible for the component falling under its jurisdiction.
Roads and community centers would be built by the Ministry of Public Works,
schools by the Ministry of Education, and health centers by the Ministry of
Health. Extension work would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Agri-
culture, land titling would be covered by the Instituto de Bienestar Rural
(IBR), and credit by Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF). The Consejo Nacional de
Progreso Social (CNPS) would coordinate the activities of the various insti-
tutions involved. CNiPS, an in-terministerial organization which includes rep-
resentatives of IBR and BNF, was established in 1967 to plan and supervise the
execution of integrated rural development programs. Its experience makes it the
most suitable governmental agency for coordinating the project. To perform this
function, CNPS would appoint a project coordinator acceptable to IDA. In



- 10 -
addition to coordinating the projectts activities at the field level,
the coordinator would prepare the annual work programs, authorize dis-
bursement applications in accordance with the program approved by CNPS,
and prepare the special budget allocations required for each institution
involved in the project.
On-Farm Investment Credit and Working Capital
35.       About 2,000 small farmers would receive long-term and short-term
credit for investments and working capital expenditures. The typical farm
unit in the colonies would be between 10 and 20 ha. and normally would have
been occupied by the farmer for 5 to 10 years. Only about five ha. of the farm
would previously have been partially cleared, with logs and trunks left on the
ground, making cultivation practices very rudimentary. The on-farm invest-
ment credit would be mainly for purchasing draft animals and cows (37% of
investment), cutting and burning forests (19%), establishing pastures and
fences (21%), purchasing of farm equipment, and erecting s-torage facilities
(23%). Total investment per farm would be about 0330,000 (US$2,600). In
addition, farmers would require an average of about 0190,000 (US$1,500) of
incremental working capital to cover costs of seeds, fertilizers, insecticides
and cultivation. It is expected that an average farmer benefitting from long-
term credit and technical assistance would clear about five ha. of forest over
a two-year period--four ha. for cultivation and one ha. for pasture. This
would increase his cultiva-ted area from five ha. to ten ha., including 3.5 ha.
of pasture. As a result, we estimate that about 10,000 additional ha. of
arable land would be brought into production. The main crops likely to be
grown are maize, cassava, cotton, soybeans, tobacco and vegetables.
Relending Terms
36.       The National Development Bank (BNF) would be responsible for
administering the lending program conponent of the project, i.e., on-farm
investment and incremental working capital requirements.   The Government
would assume the foreign exchange risk and relend the proceeds of the pro-
posed credit to BNF for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest
rate of 5% per annum, which is the Central Bank's rediscount, rate for agricul-
tural paper. BNF would make subloans for working capital for up to one year
and for on-farm investment for a period of between five and ten years. BNF
would finance up to 90% of the cost of individual farm investment plans and
charge an interest rate of 12% annually. It would thus receive a spread of
seven percentage points. This is sufficient to roughly cover its lending costs,
taking into account that the Ministry of Agriculture and the Instituto de
Bienestar Rural would assume the cost of necessary extension services.
37.       The rate of 12% at which BNF would lend to the small farmers
participating in the project would be the same as the interest rate it charges



for other lending to small farmers. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that BNF would raise its interest rate for all its lendir.g from
the present level of 9% to 12% per annum to take account of the prospective
upward movement in the general price level.
Roads
38.       Rainfall throughout the year quickly converts unengineered roads
into tracks impassable by wheeled transport.   The road component of the pro-
ject has been devised to ensure access to the settlements all year round at
a minimum cost. It would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Public
Works (MOPC) and would be divided into three elements all of which would be
planned, designed, and supervised by a firm of consulting engineers appointed
by MOPC and acceptable to IDA. The cost of the road program is 0642 million
(US$5.1 million), including contingencies.
39.       Specifically the three elements are:   (a) 250 km. of earth roads to
be constructed by MOPC in cooperation with consulting engineers and using
earthmoving and ancillary plant (referred to as the earthmoving unit) to be
procured under the project; the roads would be fully designed for future
improvements but only the first stage would be constructed under the project;
the cost of this element is estimated at 096 million (US$762,000); (b) cons-
truction of timber bridges (4 m. wide) and precast concrete pipe culverts
(full formation width) along the 250 km. of earth roads to be built by
the earthmoving unit; the estimated cost of this element is 0138 million
(US$1.1 million); and (c) 60 km. of all-weather roads to provide a 10 km.
link between Repatriacion and Caaguazu Township and a 3 km. link between
Pastoreo Township and the highway; the remaining 47 km. would be dis-
tributed between the three colonies so that dry-weather access between
the farthest farm plots and an all-weather road or the highway is of as
equal length as the colony layouts allow; the project cost of this elenent
is estimated at 0216 million (US$1.7 million).
Schools
40.       The provision of primary schools is essential to the development
of the colonies and the project would finance the construction of a total
of 26 schools, or 102 classrooms (working in two shifts, each classroom
accommodates 2 x 40 = 80 children), together with the necessary ancillary
facilities and furniture. The schools would be distributed throughout the
colonies so that student walking distance would not exceed about 3 km. each
way. The estimated project cost of the schools program is 0137 million
(US$1 .1 million).
Health Centers
41.       The project would include the construction of a new building
(210 m2) at Repatriacion and of a similar one at Gen. Stroessner; both
would be furnished with basic equipment, water supply, and an electric
generator. Funds would also be provided for special medical equipment



- 12 -
for these two centers and the one already constructed in Mallorquin. The
construction work would be undertaken by contract and supervised by the
Ministry of Health.  The Ministryrs standard building specifications and
suitably adjusted standard block layouts would be used. The estimated pro-
ject cost of the health program is 025 million (US$0.2 million).
Community Centers
4-L.      The project would finance the const;ruction of a per.manent building
(200 m2) in each of the three colonies ccxprising a meeting room, one large
and two small offices, a washroom and a large, covered, open-sided area which
would provide the focal point for larger meetings and social functions.
Funds would also be provided to purchase office equipment and three two-
channel radio transmitter-receiver sets operated by 12 volt wet batteries.
During the development phase, these centers would be used as offices by the
project staff. The Ministry of Public Works would be responsible for the
construction which would be undertaken by contract and designed and super-
vised by the consulting engineers for the road program. The estimated project
cost of providing these facilities is 016 million (US$0.1 million)0
Technical Assistance
43.       The UNDP would finance three internationally recruited experts
in the fields of agronomy, marketing, and credit to work under the proposed
project. They would assist the project coordinator in: (a) guiding the
activities of the Ministry of Agriculture's extension agents, particularly
in the preparation of farm development plans for those farmers seeking
credit; (b) assisting in the promotion of farmers' cooperatives, partic-
ularly with respect to marketing arrangements; and (c) giving technical
guidance to BNF's branch managers and agents, especially in the appraisal,
supervision and recovery of subloans to be made under the proposed project.
All three technicians would be required to live in the project area and t.o
train counterpart officers during their assignment.
Project Cost and Financing
U .      The project cost, ~1,996 million (U$15.8 r3million), would be
financed as follows:  sub-borrowers would contribute ~114 million
(US$0.9 million) or 6% of project cost; Government would contribute
0494 million (US$3.9 million) or 24%; and IDA would finance the balance,
01,388 million (US$11.0 million) or 70%, which would be US$i3.9 million
more than the estimated foreign exchange component (45`).



- 13 -
Marketing
45.       Crops such as maize, cassava and beans are mostly produced for
subsistence or sold for consumption within the colonies. They are also used
for animal feed mainly within the colonies. The marketing of cotton, soy-
beans and beef is somewhat more developed and about one half of the incremental
output would be absorbed by the domestic market and the other half by the
export market. Farmers in the three project colonies would be in a relatively
favorable position, since investments in roads would facilitate transport to
the main asphalt highway which links the colonies with the Brazilian border
as well as with Asuncion, the major consumption center and export outlet. The
Government's ongoing efforts to enlarge storage facilities, the road improve-
ments, and the technical assistance provided under the proposed project are
expected to improve marketing conditions in the three colonies.
Procurement
46.       The items to be financed for on-farm investment and working capital
for the approximately 2,000 sub-borrowers over the four-year investment
period are varied and would not be suitable for bulk procurement through
international competitive bidding. Construction of 60 km. of all-weather
roads, bridges and culverts, schools and health centers would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the
guidelines for procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits. Civil works
would be grouped into contracts, insofar as possible, to facilitate the partic-
ipation of international contractors. The Paraguayan construction industry is
dominated by firms from nearby Brazil and Argentina and many have established
subsidiary companies with local participation. Earthmoving equipment which
would be used by the Ministry of Public Works (MOPC) for constructing and
maintaining earth roads, as well as the vehicles for technical staff, would
also be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. The cons-
truction of the three community centers (total cost US$124,000 equivalent) and
the furnishing of schools, health and community centers (total cost US$140,000
equivalent) would be awarded on the basis of local bidding since the amounts
involved would not attract international firms.
Disbursement
47.       With BNF's commitments for on-farm investments extending over three
years, the disbursements by BNF would spread over four years, and the disburse-
ments by IDA over 41½ years. IDA would disburse, against the statements of
expenditure, 78% of the amounts disbursed by BNF for on-farm investments.
For short-term working capital subloans IDA would disburse, against the state-
ments of expenditure, 78% of the amount disbursed by BNF during each of the
first two half years after the date of the Credit Agreement and thereafter the



- 14 -
sane percentage of each six-month period incremental lending. The
documentation for such expenditures would not be submitted to the Association
for review but would be retained by BNF and made available for inspection by
the Association during the course of supervision missions. IDA would also
disburse, against appropriate documentation, the CIF cost of earth moving
equipment for road construction and vehicles for technical staff, and 70% of
the cost of construction of roads, schools, health centers and community
centers.
The Credit Channel
48.        The National Development Bank (BNF), a Government-owned autonomous
entity under the authority of the Ministry of Finance, was established in
1961 following the closure of the Bank of Paraguay. Its stated objectives
are "to promote and finance general program and specific projects to develop
agriculture, livestock, forestry, industry, and commerce." It is governed
by an administrative council comprising a president, appointed by the execu-
tive, and seven members. BNF has three separate banking departments:
Commercial and Savings, Development, and Agriculture and Livestock. The
authorized capital is 02,600 million (US$20.6 million) and the paid-in capital
at the end of 1972 was 1,523 million (US$12.0 million).    BNF provides annually
around 17% of all bank credit in Paraguay but the volume of its lending to the
agricultural sector, excluding livestock, during the four-year period 1969-72
constituted 82% of the total. Its year-end portfolio of loans outstanding to
the crop subsector rose from 02,804 million (US$22 million) to %4,804 million
(US$38 million) during the same period.
49.        BNF's financial situation is weak due to a number of factors, the
most significant of which is an inadequacy of equity capital in relation to
the volume of its operations and a high rate of default. Since its establish-
ment BNF has also been affected by a shortage of working capital, which has
forced it to depend heavily on borrowed funds for its operations. Delinquent
loans (loans containing principal repayments overdue by more than 30 days)
totalled 01,234 million (US$9.8 million) representing 15% of the total portfolio
(excluding the National Grain Program loans) at December 31, 1973. If loans
under the National Grain Program, which were a success in encouraging greater
agricultural output but a financial burden to BNF, are included (J1,323
million or US$10.5 million), then the arrears amount to V2,557 million
(US$20.3 million), representing 26% of BNF's total portfolio.   The ratio of
long and medium-term debt to equity at December 31, 1973 was 3.7:1 conpared
with 2.9:1 at the end of 1971 reflecting an increase in borrowing over two
years. The liquidity ratio of December 31, 1973 was slightly negative at 1:1.04,
with current assets 4.5% below current liabilities, excluding short-term CB
financing. A substantial recovery of its overdue loans, as well as an increase
in its paid-in capital, would help improve BNF?s liquidity position and thus
permit a significant increase in its lending. Although BNF has a weak fin-
ancial position, it is considered a suitable lending channel for the agricul-
tural credit component of this project because: (a) it has a good technical
staff; (b) it has successfully implemented similar externally financed projects;
and (c) it has experience in lending to small farmers. Nevertheless, to facilitate



15 -
close supervision of lending and recovery activities under the project,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that BNF would maintain a
separate project account, which would be audited quarterly by independent
auditors, acceptable to IDA.
50.       IDB is actively considering an additional loan (US$8 million, of
which US$6 million would be for agriculture) to help recapitalize BNF. As
a condition of the proposed loan, the Government would assume debt service
obligations to IDB and transfer the proceeds of the loan to BNF as a capital
contribution. The Government would also be required to make additional
capital contributions before year-end 1975. Included in the proposed loan
would be a technical assistance package to strengthen BNF's management and
operations, particularly to help improve the institution's debt collection
efforts. IDM has already approved a grant of US$24,000 for the employment
of two consultants for the purpose of preparing the terms of reference for
the aforementioned technical assistance. While IDB, therefore, would carry
a portion of the efforts aimed at strengthening BNF, IDA would support and
complement these efforts by including certain performance conditions
in the proposed Credit Agreement for BNF (see below). There would be, there-
tore, a concerted effort by the IDB and IDA to assist the Government in
overcoming BNF's problems.
Special Assurances and Undertakings
51.        To set up the institutional arrangement for implementing the project,
assurances were obtained from the Government that: (a) each participating
agency (BNF, MOPC, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health) would carry
out its specific role under the project; (b) CPNS would coordinate overall
project execution; (c) CPNS would appoint a project coordinator; (d) IBR and
IAG would appoint 15 technicians each to improve land titling and agricultural
extension; and (e) it would make available to BNF additional paid-in capital
of not less than 0150 million (US$1.2 million) per year during 1975-1979 (dis-
bursements from the proposed IDB loan would be part of this transfer) and would
pay BNF all debts owing by miristries (055 million--US$0.4 million--at Dec-
ember 31, 1972).
52.        To strengthen BNF, assurances were obtained from the Government
that: (a) unless the prior consent of IDA is obtained, it would not permit
BNF's liquidity ratio (defined as the ratio of assets recoverable within 12
months to liabilities maturing within a comparable period excluding short-
term financing from the Central Bank) to be less than 1.1:1 and its debt/
equity ratio (defined as the ratio of outstanding debts of more than one yearts
maturity to total paid-in capital plus free reserves), to be more than L:l;
(b) it would cause BNF to strengthen its collection division and, within 12
months from the date of signing the Credit Agreement, to recover not less than
20% of the subloans in arrears (as of December 31, 1972) under the National
Grain Program and present an acceptable plan to IDA for collecting the remain-
ing arrears not later than May 28, 1983 in respect of principal and not later
than May 28, 1988 in respect of interest; (c) it would cause BNF to present to
IDA within 12 months from the date of signing the Credit Agreement an acceptable
plan for reducing arrears to not more than 10% of the portfolio of each banking
department in a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of the Credit
Agreement; and (d) it would raise BNF's minimum interest rate for all its lend-
ing from '% to 12% per annum.

Economic Benefits and Justification
53.        The project is consistent with Paraguay's strategy of consolidating
colonization settlements and making a direct attack on rural poverty. An
estimated total of 7,000 low-income rural families (about 42,000 people)
would benefit from the proposed improvements, i.e., roads, schools, and health
and community centers, of which about 2,000 families would also benefit from
on-farm investment and working capital credit. As a result of the project,
the latter would increase their annual family income from 0110,000 (Us$873)
to 0252,000 (US$2,000) at full development. At the same time, the incremental
output generated by the project of cotton, maize, cassava, soybeans and beef
would correspond to 6%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 1% of the national production in 1972
respectively.
54.        The project would be a first step to help small farmers in public
settlements of which there are over 400 in the country. If successful, the
project would lend itself for multiplication in other areas with similar prob-
lems. The proposed project would also help reduce considerably the seasonal
underemployment of the small farmers living in the project area.
55.        The project's overall rate of return to the economy is estimated at
13%, excluding the costs and benefits of investments for social infrastructure,
i.e., schools, health and community centers. The financial rate of return to
farmers participating in the credit program is estimated at 35%. If the gross
value of farm output were to be 15% below the best estimate, the financial rate
of return would then drop to 16%. On the other hand, if only on-farm investment
costs were to rise by 20%, the financial rate of return would still be 29%.
These returns should provide farmers with sufficient incentives to undertake
the intended investments.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.        The draft Credit Agreement between 'FDA and the Republic of
Paraguay, the draft Project Agreement between IDA and BNF, the report of the
committee provided for in Article III, Section {4)(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
57.        The special features described in subparagraphs b, c, d and e of
paragraph 51 of this report are reflected, respectively, in Sections 3.07,
3.08, 3.10 and 3.14 of the Credit Agreement.
58.        The special features described in subparagraphs a, b, c and d of
paragraph 52 of this report are reflected, respectively, in Sections 4.05,
3.02, 3.03 and 4.04 of the Project Agreement.



- 17 -
59.       Finally, additional conditions of effectiveness include:
(i)    The project coordinator has been appointed and has
commenced his assignment;
(ii)   Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganaderia, IBR, and BNF
have assigned, respectively, 15 technicians each to the
Project Area;
(iii)  The Borrower has transferred to BNF, and BNF has credited
to the project account, not less than 030.0 million as
payment for BNF capital stock;
(iv)   The Borrower has transferred to BNF not less than
(55.0 million as payment for the Borrower's outstanding
debts to BNF.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMtENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

B. Projects in Execution and Notes on Cornpleted Projects-
Loan 396      First Road Project, US$6.0 million and US$2.2 million,
Credit 12     October 1961 and December 1964.
Work financed by the Bank Group for improving a road between
Asuncion and Encarnacion was completed satisfactorily in March 1970.
The Genaan Contractor Hochtief claims that it is entitled to US$11.1
million more than the US$9.6 million it has received for its work under
the contract. For some time Hochtief tried to resolve its claim through
direct negotiations with the Paraguayan Government. In June 1972, Hochtief
1/ These notes are designed to infonm the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II

altered its approach and attempted to settle its claim by invoking the arbitra-
tion clause of the contract.  The Government, however, has not yet appointed
its representative on the arbitration panel as called for in the arbitration
clause, and Hochtief has asked for Bank assistance in bringing the Paraguayans
to arbitration. We have advised the Government of the Bank's interest in
having the parties to Bank-financed contracts adhere to the disputes provisions
of such contracts and have advised Hochtief that, under the circumstances, its
most appropriate course of action would be to pursue and exhaust the judicial
remedies which are still open to it under Paraguayan law for establishing the
arbitral tribunal.
Loan 620      Third Livestock Project, US$4.3 .illion, IBRD and
CrediT156     US$4.3 million, IDA, June 25, 1969.
The US$4.3 million from Credit 156-PA was fully disbursed by January
of 1973. The funds provided by Loan 620-PA were fully conmmitted by June 30,
1974. The project was about one year behind schedule due to slow disbursements
during the 1970-72 period.
Loan 652      Second Road Maintenance Project, US$6.0 million,
January 9, 1970.
The project comprises provision of maintenance and shop equipment,
improvement of the maintenance organization and its operations, and training
of personnel.  Road maintenance is gradually improving as a result of the
project, approximately 70% of the provision for equipment has been disbursed
but further procurement was delayed pending the provision of adequate local
funds to operate the extra equipment. These funds are now available and will
enable the remainder of the equipment to be procured in 1974. In this event,
the project should be completed by the end of 1974, approximately one year
behind schedule.
Credit 347    Secondary Education Project, US$5.1 million, December 22, 1972.
After a seven month delay due to a nrcess in both houses and an
ensuing backlog of pending legislation, the Credit Agreement was ratified by
the Congress on September 14, 1973, and the Association declared it effective
on October 30, 1973. Key staff of the project implementation urnt have been
appointed and, at this stage, no special problems are envisaged for the proper
carrying out of the project.  Since the Govermnent met CIAP's 1973 fiscal
targets, the second tranche of the Credit, which was conditioned on the Govern-
ment meeting these targets, has been released.

PARAGUAY
SMALL FARMER CREDIr AND RURAL EEVELOPMENN PROJECT
CREDIr AND PROJECT SUKMARY
Borrower and Guarantor: Republic of Paraguay
Beneficiary:             Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Education,
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture,
National Development Bank and the Institute of
Rural Welfare.
Amount:                   US$11.0 million equivalent
Terms:                    Standard IDA terms
Relending Terms:         The Government would onlend about US$6.2 million
of the proceeds of the Credit to BNF for 20 years,
including 5 years' grace, at an interest rate of
5% per annum. BNF, in turn, would grant sub-loans
for working capital for up to one year and sub-loans
for investments for a period of five to ten years
and charge an interest rate of 12% annually. The
Government would assume the foreign exchange risk.
Project Description:     This is an integrated rural development project,
aimed at increasing production and at improving the
level of living of the rural poor. Project area
would be three public settlement colonies, i.e.,
Mallorquin (including O'Leary), Repatriacion and
Gen. Stroessner (formerly Pastoreo), situated in
the Eastern Region of Paraguay. The project would:
(a) include a lending program over a three-year commit-
ment period to about 2,000 small farmers, or 40% of
all farmers in the settlements as a first step, for
on-farm investments and working capital; (b) improve
the road system by providing finance for the purchase
of an earthmoving unit for the construction and
maintenance of 250 km. of earth roads, the construction



ANNEX III
Page 2 of 3
of bridges and culverts for these earth roads,
and the construction of about 60 km. of all-
weather roads; (c) provide schooling facilities
for farmers' children through the construction
of 26 primary schools providing some 102 class-
rooms; (d) make available better health facil-
ities by constructing and equipping two health
centers and by financing the purchase of equip-
ment for an already built health center; and
(e) encourage community development by construct-
ing three community centers.

Procurement
Arrangements:            The items to be financed for on-farm investment and
working capital for approximately 2,000 sub-borrowers
over a four-year investment period are varied and not
suitable for bulk procurement through international

competitive bidding. Construction of all-weather
roads, bridges and culverts, schools and health
centers would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding procedures in accord-
ance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits". Civil works would be
grouped into contracts insofar as possible in order
to make practicable the participation of international
contractors. Earthmoving equipment which would be
used by the Ministry of Public Works for the construc-
tion and maintenance of earth roads, as well as the
vehicles for technical staff, would also be procured
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
The construction of the three community centers
(total cost US$124,000 equivalent) and the furnishing
of schools, health and community centers (total cost
US$140,000 equivalent) would be awarded on the basis
of local bidding since the amounts involved would not
attract international firms.
Consultants:       The Ministry of Public Works would appoint a firm of
consulting engineers, acceptable to IDA, to design,
plan, control and supervise the road program being
financed by the IDA Credit.
Rate of Return:    The economic rate of return, calculated on the basis
-  of projected world market prices, plus an allowance
for transportation costs for the major agricultural
products expected to be produced under the project,
is estimated at 13% excluding the costs and benefits
of investments in social infrastructure, i.e5, schools,
health and community certers.
