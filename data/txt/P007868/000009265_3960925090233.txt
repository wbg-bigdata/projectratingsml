LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1674-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The Livestock and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1674-PA)
was approved on March 22, 1979, for US$25.0 million. This is the Project
Completion Report (PCR) of four of five components (US$12.2 million of the
Bank loan): small mixed-farm development; feeder roads; Wholesale Market;
and agricultural census. A PCR for the project's fifth component, livestock
(US$12.8 million, the balance of the Bank loan), was issued on June 12, 1985,
and was included with the audit of the Sixth Livestock Development Project
(Ln. 1979-PA) issued as PPAR Number 6126 by the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED). The LAC region also evaluated the technical assistance component
under an agrepinent between the Bank and UNDP, and two related reports were
submitted to UNDP on April 16, 1985. The original Closing Date of the pro-
ject, June 30, 1984, was extended to June 30, 1985. Disbursements were
authorized through December 31, 1985, and US$332,687.39 of the loan was can-
celled on December 31, 1985.
The project was the fifth of a series of livestock development
project financed by the Bank in Paraguay. The four previous projects were:
Credit 47-PA (US$3.6 million); Credit 86-PA (US$7.5 million); Credit 156-PA/
Loan 620-PA (US$4.3 million for each of them); and Loan 1037-PA (US$10.0 mil-
lion). These credits/loans were satisfactorily implemented by the Fondo
Ganadero (FG). The project was planned to be a follow-up of the Small Farmer
Credit and Rural Development Project (Credit 509-PA) approved in August 1974
and closed in May 1981.
This report was prepared by Agricultural Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a country visit in
February 1986. Other sources of information for the Completion Report were:
the Appraisal Report No. 2272-PA, dated March 6, 1979; the Loan and Project
Agreements No. 1674-PA, dated April 6, 1979; Supervision Reports; correspon-
dence with the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda as contained in relevant
Bank files.
Following a review by OED, it was decided not to audit the project,
and the draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments in October 1986.
Comments received from the National Office for the Coordination of Rural
Development Projects (ONCP), the Management Unit of the Wholesales Market of
Asuncion (DAMA), the Gabinete Tecnico of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the
Livestock Fund (FG) of the Central Bank are given in Annex 2. None of these
comments is affecting the substance of this PCR.

HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The objectives of the project components covered under this PCR
were to increase agricultural production through area expansion and increased
productivity: raise income levels; increase foreign exchange earnings; and
strengthen the administrative and technical capabilities of the participating
agencies by: (a) providing credit to finance the development of small mixed-
farms; (b) constructing and maintaining feeder roads; (c) completing the
Wholesale Market of Asuncion; (d) carrying out an agricultural census; and
(e) providing technical assistance to participating agencies. The objectives
were generally met.
2.        The components weze soundly conceived and technologies involved
were well understood in Paraguay. However, completion was delayed by one
year, mainly due to the fAilowing reasons: (a) low agricultural prices and
excessive rains during the first two years which slowed down the implementa-
tion of the small mixed-farm component; as a result, credit operations were
lower than projected and arrears were high; (b) extension services suffered
from lack of operating funds during these two years; (c) lack of counterpart
funds and delays in contracting the consulting engineers caused delays in the
construction of feeder roads; and (d) the Rural Welfare Institute delivered
only 812 land titles by mid-1984, instead of the 500 yearly expected at
appraisal.
3.        The execution of the Wholesale Market of Asuncion was highly
successful and considerably surpassed appraisal expectations. The major
reasons for the much higher achievements obtained were thorough project
preparation; strong support by the Municipality of Asuncion, the Government
of Japan, UNDP and the Bank; the establishment of the Market as an
autonomous, self-supporting entity; and the appointment of competent and
dedicated project management and consultants.
4.        The implementation of the Agricultural Census component was also
successful. It generated an operationally useful statistical base which was
highly appreciated by Paraguay's agricultural planners.
5.        The project cost in US Dollar equivalent was 8% below appraisal
estimates. The re-calculated financial rates of return (FRRs) for typical
small farms ranged between 16%-18% compared to appraisal estimates of
31%-40%, and the project's economic rate of return (ERR) was Te-estimated at
21% compared to 28.5% estimated at appraisal. The lower than expected FRRs
and EERs are mainly due to higher than expected annual costs of production of
crops cultivated and lower relative product prices.
6.       The performances of project implementing agencies, project-financed
consultants, and the Bank were satisfactory.
Sustainability
7.        The prospects for sustainability of benefits from the four project
components appear uncertain at this stage. Although the Wholesale Market is



- v -
an autonomous and self-supporting entity with competent project management at
present, there are indications that the municipality may discontinue DAMA's
budgetary and administrative autonomy. This could result in a severe
slowdown of the markets overall performance. In the case of the feeder roads
component, MOPC will need to receive timely funds from the Central Government
budget (a current issue) to carry out the yearly maintenance work. Regarding
the sustainability of the on-farm, small-mixed farm development, there are
two main concerns; (i) possible weakening of the existing extension service
and/or shortage of BNF production credit; and (ii) the actual low fertility
of the soils of the project area could further decrease and lead to rapid
soil degradation and poor yields if the present trend of high input prices
and relatively low output prices will continue, which could result in
increasingly low use of inputs. Finally, in the case of the agricultural
census component, it will be necessary to allocate sufficient local funds to
keep the system of collecting, actualizing and processing agricultural data
and filed information going.
8.        Other points of interest are:
(a)  issuance of land titles and construction of feeder roads should
receive more emphasis during the first project years as these are
critical constraints for smooth project implementation
(para. 3.04);
(b) the inclusion of the Wholesale Market component in the project
proved to be a successful operation (paras. 6.05-6.07). In order
for the Market to continue to progress, the Municipality of
Asuncion should maintain the quality of the presently existing
staff, allow the continuation of budgetary and administrative
autonomy of DAMA and proceed slowly in the assignment of new
responsibilities to DANA (para. 7.02); and
(c) auditing of project accounts by the Comptroller of the Ministry of
Finance was not satisfactory (paras. 3.23 and 7.02).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01.     In June 1978 the Paraguayan economy was expanding with growth rates
of about 10% per year. The population was about 2.9 million, 65% rural. The
high growth rates were fueled mainly by the Itapua Hydroelectric Dam. The
agricultural sector followed the trend with growth rates of about 5.5%. The
sector accounted for about 28% of GDP, 45% of employment, and 99% of exports.
Sector growth resulted mainly from expansion of cropped areas in the eastern
part of the country, and favorable international prices for Paraguay's main
exports, soybean and cotton.
1.02      Agriculture is still the most important sector in the economy and
continues to grow, albeit at a lower rate. The Bank has continued to support
the sector, and has approved three subseq'ient projects, the Caazapa Area
Development Project (Loan 2087-PA), approved in January 1982, the Eje Norte
Rural Development Project (Loan 2141-PA) approved in May 1982, and the
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2304-PA) approved in June 1983. In addi-
tion, an Agricultural Sector Study was issued in June 1984 and discussed with
the Government in March 1985.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification throughBoard Approval
2.01      The project was identified in the second half of 1977 by an
FAO/CP-Bank mission, and preparation was completed by the Government and
FAO/CP in early 1978. It was appraised by the Bank during June/July 1978.
Negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. in February 1-6, 1979. The loan
was approved by the Board on March 22, 1979, without significant discussion.
B. Objectives and Components
Objectives
2.02      The obJectives of the project components covered under this PCR
were to: (a) increase agricultural production through area expansion as well
as increased productivity; (b) raise income levels; (c) increase foreign
exchange earnings; and (d) strengthen the administrative and technical
capabilities of the executing agencies.



-2-
Components
2.03      The four components dealt with in this report accounting for about
45% of the entire project, are: (a) an agricultural credit program to finance
lending through the National Development Bank (BNF); (b) construction and
maintenance of feeder roads through the Ministry of Public Works and
Communications (MOPC); (c) completion of the Wholesale Market of Asuncion
through the Project Unit of the Wholesale Market of Asuncion (DAMA); and
(d) carrying out of an Agricultural Census by the Agricultural Statistics
Office with FAO assistance. The Livestock Development and the Technical
Assistance components for which PCRs have been issued (see Preface para. 1)
accounted for about 55% of total costs of the entire project.
C. Cost and Financing
2.04      At appraisal, total cost of the four project components was estima-
ted at US$24.9 million, including allowance for physical and price contingen-
cies. The Bank loan financed US$12.2 million (49%) and the Government and
participating institutions provided US$10.2 million (41%); UNDP,
US$0.8 million (3%); and producers, the remaining US$1.7 million (7%).
III  IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
3.01     The loan became effective on November 20, 1979, after a three and
one-half months delay because the Government's signing of subsidiary loan
agreements with the participating agencies took more time than anticipated.
According to appraisal projections, the project was to be completed by
December 31, 1983 and the Closing Date was to be June 30, 1984.  Completion
was delayed by one year because of lack of demand for the agricultural
development credit in the early project years.  Also, the implementation of
the feeder roads' component started two years behind schedule because of lack
of counterpart funds and delays in contracting consulting engineer<.'
B. Implementation of Project Components
Small Mixed-Farm Development
3.02      The project provided long-term credit for on-farm investments for
small mixed-farm production and technical assistance, namely (a) two
internationally recruited specialists for the project area for three
years--one on agricultural extension and one on credit; (b) one vehicle for
each specialist; (c) miscellaneous equipment; (d) implementation of trial
work on existing farms; and (e) various operating costs.
3.03      A total of 3,000 subloans were to be extended (2,600 for the
development of 10-ha farms and 400 for 20 ha farms). At completion, only
2,418 subloans were granted (81% of appraisal estimate). The average amount
per subloan was US$5,050 (101% of appraisal estimate). The total amount of
subloans amounted to US$12.21 million (about 90% of the appraisal estimate).



- 3 -
3.04      Low agricultural prices and excessive rains during the first two
years of the project slowed down the implementation of this component, but
picked up starting in 1983. The executing agencies were BNF's field offices
for the credit activities, the Agricultural and Livestock Extension Service
(SEAG) of MAG for extension services to farmers, and the Rural Welfare
Institute (IBR) for land titling, The first two years, credit operations
were lower than expected and arrears were high, ranging from 18% to 29% In
the different branch offices. There were delays in construction of the
proposed feeder roads, pioviding staff for the extension service and in
obtaining transport facilities. The Extension Service also suffered from
lack of operating funds. Finally, IBR delivered only 812 titles by mid-1984,
instead of the 500 yearly expected at appraisal. However, st:arting in 1983,
the demand for farm commodities and prices increased sharply, resulting in
increases in crop areas and credit demand. As a consequence, the financial
situation of farmers and credit recovery began to improve. During 1984, BNF
had a loan recovery of about 90% in the project area, including recovery of
many loans which were overdue since the 1980 crop year, because of a year of
excellent crop yields and prices.
3.05      The Bank was also concerned with the impact of the monocultural
practices in the area of the project with cotton and also with the low level
and quality of extension efforts. The poor quality of extension was partly
due to a high percentage of new agents with little experience and partly to a
lack of better technologies which should have been provided by the research
activities of MAG. SEAG, along with the UNDP-financed consultants, looked at
possible crop alternatives for diversification. Unfortunately, alternative
cash crops with a ready market were not fully identified and promoted. Due
to these collective problems and the initial lack of demand for subloans in
the project area, the Bank agreed in August 1983 to amend the loan Agreement
to allow use of US$2.0 million in Itapua, an area where credit had previously
been provided under Loan 1418-PA. In Itapua, there was greater agricultural
potential, more farmers with land titles and greater demand for subloans.
The Wholesale Market of Asuncion
3.06      The project was designed to complete and expand the Wholesale
Market to eliminate the growing congestion in the area of Asuncion's whole-
sale/retail Market No. 4, to reduce spoilage of produce, and to provide
better market conditions. The project was to finance: (a) completion of two
of six existing market halls with a total area of 5,260 m2, an administrative
building of 304 m2 and a service building of 230 m2; (b) paving of circula-
tion and parking areas comprising 21,140 m2; (c) provision of water supply,
including a 50 m3 reservoir; (d) installation of electricity; (e) construc-
tion of drainage and sewerage; (f) erection of fences; (g) landscaping;
(h) provision of salaries for the staff of DAMA; and (i) technical assis-
tance. Technical assistance included two internationally recruited wholesale
market experts (30 man-months); short-term marketing consultants (four man-
months); visits of six wholesalers and other users of the new market to
neighboring countries to study the functioning of wholesale markets; two
vehicles, including operating costs; miscellaneous equipment; overseas
training of project staff (eight man-months); and various operating costs.



- 4 -
3.07      After DAMA's Director was appointed in July 1979, implementation of
the market was carried out with vigor. The new Director and mission from the
Brazilian Food Company (COBAL), a Brazilian institutic,n highly experienced in
wholesale marketing, carried out a comprehensive survey of the wholesale
market activities in Asuncion. The survey indicated that: (a) the actual
wholesale volume was estimated to be about 75% larger than the appraisal
assumption (180,000 tons/year versus 103,000 tons/year); (b) there were
actually 190 potential wholesalers compared to the 140 estimated at apprais-
al; and (c) there was a higher than anticipated demand for renting of space,
in addition to an unanticipated demand for cold storage facilities. The
survey thus concluded that, in order to avoid the development of parallel
wholesale markets in Asuncion, rehabilitation should be increased from two to
four market halls. The Bank agreed to this expansion in project scope and,
on May 6, 1981, US$520,000 were reallocated from the Loan Account to cover
the corresponding increased construction costs for the Market.
3.08      Construction designs were prepared by Paraguayan Consulting
Engineers with the assistance of two short-term COBAL consultants. Construc-
tion started in mid-August 1980 with a nine-month completion target. Traffic
and parking areas were paved by the Muncipality on force account. Wholesale
operations began on October 19, 1981. At that time, all market hall spaces
were assigned to wholesalers, and larger wholesalers installed their own
cooling facilities for refrigeration of fruits and vegetables (45 facilities,
each with 45 m2 on average). The transfer of wholesale activities from
Market No. 4 to the new Market was smooth; and within a short period of time,
virtually all the wholesale marketing of fruits, vegetables, edible grains,
and dairy and poultry products was being conducted at the new market.
3.09      Because of the successful beginning of the market, the new market
obtained many requests for space rental by additional fruit, vegetable,
edible grain and beef wholesalers. A fifth building was thus rehabilitated
in 1982 with funds from the Municipality and the sixth (and last) one in
1983/84, utilizing loans from future wholesalers. In physical terms, the
Market surpassed appraisal expectations by almost five times. Six market
halls covering a total of 23,906 m2 were actually rehabilitated as compared
to appraisal projections of only two market halls with a total of 5,794 m2.
In addition, another market hall, a cold store with a 600 m3 capacity as well
as entrance, grading, storage and banking facilities, and a small chapel with
a total of 3,606 m2 had been constructed; and a water tower with a capacity
of 100 m3 was erected, double the size originally planned. Moreover, an area
of 36,835 m2 was actually paved compared to 21,140 m2 projected at apprais-
al. Marketing facilities rehabilitated and built under the project are of
modern, cost-effective design and their overall standard of workmanship is
good. Working and hygienic conditions are adequate, and garbage and effluent
disposal is handled by specialized trucks.
3.10      Since 1982 the Japanese Government has granted substantial
technical assistance to the Market, valued at about US$2.8 million, for
(a) hiring consultants (US$1.5 million)- (b) training 23 Paraguayans in Japan
(US$200,000); and (c) acquiring 1,500 mi of refrigeration units, produce
cleaning and grading equipment, three buses, two dump trucks, two cleaning
trucks, one micro bus, four small vehicles, and computing equipment



(US$1.1 million). The Japanese assistance has been a most valuable asset for
the Wholesale Market and the Technical Assistance Agreement has been recently
extended by another two years.
Feeder Roads
3.11      To facilitate the extension of credit, technical assistance, input
supply and produce marketing, the project was to improve the rural roads net-
work in the area covered by the small mixed farm development component by
constructing about 120 km and improving about 120 km of feeder roads and
maintaining about 500 km of rural roads per year. Execution of the works was
to be carried out by the General Directorate of Roads (DGV) by force account,
except for pipe culverts, which were to be constructed through contract. The
project was to finance machinery and equipment, spare parts, workshop equip-
ment and tools; direct cost of equipment operation; construction of 14 timber
bridges 4 m wide and 200 concrete pipe culverts; and consulting engineers to
assist DGV in the engineering, planning, organizing and supervising of the
works enumerated above.
3.12      The road construction/improvement component was programmed to be
carried out over a four-year period starting in January 1980. However,
because of delays in the contracting of consultants to prepare engineering
designs and supervise construction, this component began only at the end of
1982. Implementation was slow mainly because of lack of timely counterpart
funds, shortages of spare parts and fuel and delays in the construction of
culverts and bridges. Implementation was thus completed only in May 1985.
About 40 km of roads not anticipated at appraisal were built (17% above
appraisal estimates).
3.13      Road maintenance began in early 1982 with the arrival of the new
road maintenance equipment. In 1982, 195 km of roads were maintained, Road
maintenance work in the following years was around 500 km per year, the same
as projected at appraisal. Two to three maintenance passes/road were
required each year, for which local communities raised some of the fuel
costs.
The Agricultural Census
3.14      In addition to carrying out the 1980 agricultural census, the
component's other main objective was to establish a continuous system of col-
lecting and disseminating agricultural statistics on an annual basis. The
project provided for (a) 76 man-weeks of technical assistance; (b) rental of
cars and motorbikes and purchase of fourteen 4-wheel-drive vehicles, includ-
ing operation and maiaitenance costs; (c) purchase of equipment and materials
for data processing; (d) provision of travel and subsistence allowances for
field work; (e) publication and distribution of the census; and (f) training
in agricultural statistics in the country and abroad.
3.15      Getting the census started was difficult mainly due to lack of
trained local staff and the need to obtain the collaboration of virtually all
public institutions having representatives in Paraguay's rural areas, includ-
ing BNF, IBR, SEAG, Agricultural Credit for Housing (CAR), National Livestock



- 6 -
and Animal Health Service (SENAGSA), and the Ministries of Education,
Industry and Commerce, Interior and Defense as well as Municipalities, and
Agricultural Cooperatives and Societies. As a result, actual field data
collection did not start until August 1981 and was completed in October of
the same year. There was also a considerable delay in the processing of the
census data due to belated completion of data entry and computer programs.
Data processing was completed in December of 1983, about two years later than
originally anticipated. Although implementing the census involved deployment
of over 8,000 persons, there was concern about the completeness of the census
coverage, especially in regard to the rapidly expanding rural areas of
eastern Paraguay. Several post-census surveys have thus been undertaken to
rectify possible omissions.
C. Cost Estimate
3.16      The total cost of the four components at completion was about
US$22.9 million equivalent compared to an appraisal estimate of US$24.9 mil-
lion. Except for the small mixed-farm development and the agricultural
census components, where the actual cost was virtually the same as projected
at appraisal, the actual cost of the feeder roads component was lower (17%)
and that of the wholesale market component was higher (24%) than the apprais-
al estimates. A comparison of appraisal cost estimates and actual cosrs is
shown in Annex 1 (Table 1).
D. Disbursements
3.17      Annex 1, Table 2 shows actual and estimated disbursements by
component, as well as actual and estimated expenditures by the UNDP, the
Government and participating local institutions and subborrowers.
3.18      Disbursements during the first three project years were below 50%
of appraisal estimates because of low demand for subloans for the small farm
development component during the initial project years and two years of delay
in starting up the feeder roads component.
E. Procurement
3.19      ICB procurement of equipment and vehicles for the four components
of the project was carried out satisfactorily. Goods required by subborrow-
ers were purchased directly from local suppliers and no serious problems were
encountered.
F. Reporting
3.20      Project reporting was generally satisfactory.  Semi-annual progress
reports were sent to the Bank by BNF, MAG, IBR, MOPC and the Municipality of
Asuncion on their respective components. BNF has been delivering monthly and
semi-annual reports which contained data on financial and physical implemen-
tation of the small farm credit component. The Office for the Implementation
of Rural Development Projects of the National Council for Social Progress
(OIRD/CNPS) was supposed to be responsible for the evaluation of the small



- 7 -
mixed-farm component; however, no systematic data were recorded on the impact
of that component by OIRD/CPNS.
G. Auditing
3.21      Separate project accounts were to be kept by the BNF, MAG, MOPC and
DAMA.  Auditing of the project accounts of BNF and DAMA was carried out by
private firms, and of MAG and MOPC by the Comptroller of the Ministry of
Finance as agreed by the Bank in June 1981. BNF's 1980 audit reports pointed
out deficiencies in its accounting system and internal controls. The biggest
problem was lack of consolidated data on BNF's credit operations in its
45 branches. BNF's 1981 audit report was not received until March 1983 and
the opinion of the auditors was again qualified; it pointed out that many of
their earlier suggestions to remedy deficiencies in administration had not
been taken into account. BNF's 1982, 1983 and 1984 audit reports were
received with still some delay, but the 1985 report was on time.
3.22      The Municipality of Asuncion contracted an outside accounting firm
to audit the DAMA accounts to cover the period from the initiation of cons-
truction until the end of 1981. Subsequently, this same firm continued in an
annual basis. Audit reports were received with two to eight months of
delay. The opinions of the auditors were unqualified.
3.23      Audit reports of MOPC and MAG from inception of the project through
1982 were only received in January 1984. These reports made minor
qualifications but listed serious deficiencies in the accounting system and
internal controls of both agencies. Audit reports for 1983 were received in
January 1985. The Bank informed the Government in January 1985 that the
Comptroller would no longer be acceptable as an external auditor for MOPC and
MAG and that a private auditing firm should be contracted.
H. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.24      IBR did not comply with Section 3.08 (a) of the Loani Agreement,
which provided for the issuance by IBR of 500 titles per year for four years
starting August 1, 1979. By mid-1984 only 812 land titles had been
delivered.
3.25      The executing agencies did not fully comply with Section 4.02 (a)
of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.04 of the Project Agreement concerning
submission to the Bank of audit reports. In spite of the Bank's request for
timeliness, reports were consistently late.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      The performance of BNF has been satisfactory in spite of the fact
that lending to small farmers was slower than expected during the initial
years of project implementation. This was due to lack of credit demand
(paras. 3.04 and 3.05). The performance of MOPC was satisfactory despite the
consistent lack of counterpart funds. The performance of the consultants



tthat provided the design and work supervision of the road works was also
satisfactory.
449(2     The Municipality of Asuncion supported the project well by
providing financing to DAMA.  DAMA provided administrative, functional and
flijancial independence to the Market. The Project Director of DAMA performed
-, an outstanding m:anner, as did COBAL which provided both a long-term and
slhort-term consultants.  UNDP was most accommodating regarding the funding of
ihe project's technical assistance component.
4)J       The performance of MAG was satisfactory in spite of the fact that
tLile small farmer cowponent was well behind schedule due to delays in provi-
dinig a satisfactory quality extension service and delays in obtaining
v\chJlles. Regarding the agricultural census, MAG provided good support to
(oltoct and process the field data. The performance of the three FAO
; .51Itants was also satisfactory.
V. ROLE OF THE BANK
,i.N      The role played by the Bank through the execution of the project
was satisfactory. Relations among the Bank, BNF, MOPC, DAMA and MAG were
cordial at all times, and the Bank was supportive and flexible in responding
to Government requests for reallocation of the proceeds of the loan,
specifically to increase project funds to the feeder roads and the wholesale
market categories and to increase the percentage of Bank financing of the
teeder roads category, The Bank approved the use of US$2.0 million from the
small mixed-farm credit category in the area of Itapua (Loan 1418-PA) and
approved the extension of the project Closing Date to June 30, 1985.
Regarding the Wholesale Market, the Bank, after initially being hesitant to
Widorse the mich larger thati originally planned scope of the component, fully
3spported it.
VI. PROJECT IMPACT
6.01      The basic strategy pursued during project implementation was to
increase the production through area expansion oil cotton (the monocultural
crop in the area of the project) and introduce new cash crops, such as,
soybeans and sunflowers. At the same time manloc production was to decrease
and bean production to be abandoned so that farmers could concentrate on more
profitable crops. Comparison of actual production during the last cropping
seaseon with appraisal estimates is shown below:

Financial Rate of Return
6.02      The financial rate of return (FRR) for the small mixed-farm
component computed over 20 years, was re-estimated using the following
assumptions:
(a) Two representative farm models were prepared based on survey data
from 117 farms of the project area obtained by the Technical
Cabinet of MAG. One model was a'12.5-ha farm which benefitted from
improved road infrastructure and extension services; the other was
a 14.0-ha farm which, in addition to the above, also benefitted
from credit. This was the basis for measuring the agricultural
impact of the project; and
(b) input/output prices were adjusted to 1980 price levels.
Based on the above, the FRR (excluding the road component) was re-estimated
at about 16-18% compared to appraisal estimates of 31-40%.
Economic Rate of Return
6.03      The economic rate of return (ERR) on investment in the small
mixed-farm component, including the cost and benefit of the road component,
been re-estimated at 21% compared to the appraisal estimate of 28.5%.
Feeder Roads
6.04      Due to the implementation of this component, the overall status of
the road network in the project area is now fairly good. The 280 km of roads
implemented/improved under the project are dirt roads of good standards
which, in addition to about 300 km of already existing roads, are expected to
be regularly maintained with the facilities, equipment and staffing
established under the project.



- 10 -
Wholesale Market
6.05      The Wholesale Market itself, the two producer markets at Ita and
Oviedo, and the three satellite and five mobile retail street markets are in
full operation and under capable management. The importance of the Market in
servicing the wholesale distribution of fruits, vegetables and tubers in the
greater Asuncion area is demonstrated by the fact that about 85% of these
products now pass through the Market. The Market also handles a substantial
volume of meat, grains, canned goods, eggs and dairy products. Moreover, the
general level of sanitation and presentation of produce has been vastly
improved as compared to the conditions of the previous Market No. 4. DAMA
functions as an autonomous, self-supporting entity with a total of 115
employees, of whom 15 are higher level staff. Revenues from rentals
(G 700 per m2, which generates about 80% of total income), market entrance
fees (G 50 per vehicle), cold stores, fruit/vegetable cleaning and grading
equipment, and bus transport are in the order of G 700,000 per day. The
Market is handling about 170,000 tons per year compared to 103,000 tons
expected at appraisal. DAMA, assisted by Japanese technicians, keeps
up-to-date information on daily volume, place of production, type of product,
and prices; price information is available to producers through the media to
help them with marketing decisions. Although adequate data do not exist to
prove the effects of the Market on producer prices, limited studies made by
DAMA suggest that these have improved, thus demonstrating increased efficien-
cy of the market channels. About 600 wholesalers occupy the Market, 150 of
whom are large ones with a daily turnover of over 5,000 kg of produce.
Wholesalers appear to be fully satisfied with the new Market and the way it
is operated, and demand for rental space is high (2,000 additional written
applications have been submitted to DAMA for space rental).
6.06      The economic rate of return (ERR) for the Market was estimated at
appraisal at 20.3%, the only benefits considered in the analysis stemming
from a reduction in produee losses and spoilage estimated at 3% of fruits and
1% of vegetables. Although DAMA has no reliable data on actual reduction of
produce losses and spoilage as a result of the project, the appraisal
estimate of produce losses and spoilage was quite conservative. The esti-
mates ran as high as 50% for bananas and plantains, but are being reduced to
about 10% with appropriate cool storage and handling practices offered by the
Market. Similarly significant reduction in losses and spoilage is being
reportedly obtained for other produce as a result of the Market. Therefore,
the actual ERR is expected to exceed the appraisal estimate.
6.07      Apart from reduced losses and spoilage of produce, the subproject
generated other important benefits: (a) creation of 115 jobs; (b) better
sanitation, presentation and quality of produce; (c) reduced congestion in
the former wholesale marketing area of the Market No. 4; (d) better market
accessibili,y; (e) improved price information;   (f) improvement of three
zonal retail markets to the hygienic and administrative standards of the
Wholesale Market; and (g) concentration and standardization of produce
through the establishment of produce reception centers in two important
vegetable producing areas to lower transport costs and promote product
quality.

The Agricultural Census
6.08      The Census generated an operationally useful statistical base,
which is highly appreciated by Paraguay's agricultural planners. Undoubted-
ly, it improved the quality of recently designed agricultural projects and
strategies. This can be demonstrated, for example, by the good quality of
the preparation report of the Alto Parana Sur/Itapua Agricultural Development
Project completed in early 1986. In addition, the Census trained a team of
123 persons attached to the Agricultural Statistics Office, capable of con-
tinuously collecting and disseminating essential agricultural statistics with
the help of modern computing equipment and programs. It is up to Paraguay's
agricultural establishment to make fullest possible use of this potential.
VII. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      The objectives of the four components have been attained.  The
production of crops in the project area has increased substantially and
productivity is starting to improve as a result of financing subloans to
increase diversified crop production and higher use of fertilizer and other
inputs. The feeder roads component is considered successful despite the fact
that it started slowly and faced shortages of counterpart funds. The rehabi-
litation of the Wholesale Market of Asuncion was a most successful opera-
tion. The major reasons for the much higher achievements obtained under the
component were: thorough project preparation, strong support by the
Municipality of Asuncion, the Government of Japan, UNDP and the Bank, the
establishment of the Market as an autonomous, self-supporting entity and the
appointment of competent and dedicated project management and consultants.
The Wholesale Market can be used as an example for similar operations in
other countries. The agricultural census component has provided useful
sectoral data to the country. Despite a one-year delay in project comple-
tion, actual expenditures under the project (in US $ equivalent) is about 8%
below the appraisal estimate. The performance of the implementing agencies
has been satisfactory.
7.02      The key lessons learned from impiementing the four components
discussed above are:
(a)  the inclusion of the Wholesale Market component in the project
proved to be a successful operation, mainly because the Administra-
tive Unit of the Municipality (DAMA) was a strong and well managed
entity, which received good technical assistance support. In order
for the Market to continue to progress and to cover debt service,
it is recommended that the Municipality maintain the quality of the
presently existing staff, allow the continuation of budgetary and
administrative autonomy to DAMA and proceed slowly in the assign-
ment of new responsibilities to DAMA; and
(b)  auditing of project accounts of MOPC and MAG carried out by the
Comptroller of the Ministry of Finance was not satisfactory partic-
ularly in the timing of submission to the Bank (para. 3.23). A
better alternative would have been to use private auditors. This
has already been communicated to the Government in the context of
other Bank financed agricultural projects, and the Government has
accepted to use private auditors.

Re: Livestock and Agricultural Developmetnt Project (Loan 1674--PA).
Concerning the draft PCR on the above project, forwarded with your
letter of October 16, 1986, I wish to report that the Ministry of Agriculture
and livestock    has no comnents to add since the report in general covers the
major aspects of execution of the project, and since much of the information
on which it is based was supplied to the Bank's staff by this Ministry's
lechnical Bureau.
Nevertheless, I would point out that the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit of the Technical Bureau, together with the Of icina Nacional de Progreso
Social, is now completing the evaluation report on this project. This report
will elaborate in greater detail on the degree of attainment of the objectives
of the various project components, in particular the "Small Mixed-Farm
Development" component, and on the impact on local producers.
I shall be pleased to let you have a copy of the report once it is
printed.
Regards. Conrado Pappalardo M., Coordinator, Gabinete Tecnico.

Dear Sir:
I was very pleased to receive the draft PCR on the Livestock and
Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1674-PA).
I noted that the report did not include the fifth component
(Livestock), which is the one that most closely affects our institution, and
concerning which we would be able to offer appropriate comments, in view of
our links with the sector and with that particular component.
In reading the document, I noted the sections on Institutional
Performance and the Role of the Bank, which contain satisfactory conclusions,
stressing the Bank's flexibility in handling the changes and reallocations
necessary for achievement of the project's objectives. These are followed by
sections entitled Project Impact and Summary and Lessons Learned, which report
that the objectives of all the components have been attained and refer to
certain factors, already corrected, that will make it possible for similar
projects to proceed efficiently.
Since favorable conclusions have been reached in the light of the
project results and the evaluations of specific missions, and since the Fondo
Ganadero is the administrative agent in charge of the fifth (Livestock)
component, without any direct participation in the other components, it is
difficult for us to offer any responsible comments on those points. We shall
therefore reserve our opinions for the livestock project, for whose execution
we were responsible. In consequence, we have no comments or objections to
offer concerning the other project components.
Sincerely,
Dr. Epifanio Salcedo C.
Chairman, Coordinating Committee
