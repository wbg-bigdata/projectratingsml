I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.01      The oil price increase of 1973 terminated a long growth period of
the Jamaican economy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined every year
between 1973 and 1980. Total GDP in 1980 was 18% below the level of 1973,
and GDP per capita was US$1,030 in 1980 at constant prices, over 25% lower
than in 1973. The economic recovery process, initiated in 1981 with GDP
growth of 1.9%, continued at a slow pace in 1982, when GDP rose by less than
1%, as product prices and output levels of the important mining sector fell
sharply, but several other sectors of the economy continued to slowly
recover. In particular, manufacturing growth seems to have accelerated in
1982 to 3%, compared to 0.4% in 1981.
1.02      Despite the slow pace of the recovery process, economic growth
prospects of Jamaica in the medium and long term are good. The country has a
well-educated and skilled work force, substantial mineral resources (bauxite)
with good long-term potential on the world market, and a proximity to the
North American market for exports of manufactured and agricultural goods.
But these prospects can become a reality only if economic policies are put in
effect which provide the incentives to make efficient use of the country's
development potential. In early 1983, the Government has taken the important
step toward this end by legalizing the parallel foreign exchange market and
providing incentives to non-traditional exports. The strengthening of export
financing provided by the Export Development Fund (EDF) forms an important
part of this recently introduced export incentive package. The measures
taken by the Government will go a long way in supporting the necessary
structural adjustment of the economy toward export orientation and efficient
use of labor and resources. Supporting measures are needed for reducing the
public sector deficit and thus providing additional resources to the
development of private sector activities. In addition there are still
deficiencies in the country's external trade policies and industrial
incentive system, which favor capital intensive and import dependent
industries and reduce export competitiveness. A Bank mission studied
Jamaican industrial policy issues during December 1982 and presented
recommendations on their improvement to the Government. Part of these
recommendations will be implemented under the Bank's Second Structural
Adjustment Loan to Jamaica.

B. The Manufacturing Sector
1.03      During the long recession of 1973 to 1980, industrial activities
declined by over 30% which is substantially above the decline of the overall
economy. Consequently, the shares of manufacturing in GDP fell during this
period from about 18% to 15% (Table 1.1). These shares are smaller than in
other middle-income developing countries which is largely due to the
increasing roles of Government and other services (particularly tourism) in
the Jamaican economy. While practically all major economic sectors declined
during the 1970s value added of Government services doubled; their
contribution to GDP is now 20% of the total. The sharply increasing role of
Government is also demonstrated by the ratio of Central Government
expenditures to GDP which increased from less than 25% in the early 1970s to
43.3% in fiscal year 1981-82. As Government revenues rose much less than
expenditures, the ratio of fiscal deficit to GDP increased from 6% to 15%
during this period. The poor performance of Jamaican manufacturing in a
declining economy is largely a result of the excessive expansion of the
public sector at the expense of private sector activities, supported by
inappropriate trade and incentive policies.
1.04      The recession of the 1970s affected industrial sub-sectors to a
different extent. Overall, the industrial decline strengthened the relative
importance of resource based consumer goods manufacturing, in particular
foods and beverages, at the expense of intermediate and capital goods
producing industries. The manufacture of consumer goods now dominates
Jamaican industry with about 60% each of manufacturing value added, factory
employment and exports. The manufacture of non-resource based consumer goods
-- textiles, clothing, footwear, furniture -- declined sharply during the
recession. The structural changes within the Jamaican consumer goods
industry were due largely to the country's industrial incentive and
protection policies. Under a system of tight import protection which
shielded the labor intensive garment, footwear and furniture sub-sectors from
foreign competition, the industries became increasingly uncompetitive on
export markets and concentrated largely on the contracting domestic market.
The comparatively capital intensive industries processing foods, beverages
and tobacco products generally maintained their competitiveness supported by
considerable tax and import duty concessions. The unbalanced import
protection and industrial incentive policies prevailing during the long
recession are also the main reason for decline of the intermediate goods and
metal products industries. Overall, during the period 1974-1980 the
industrialization of Jamaica, which had made strong progress during the 1960s
suffered a serious reversal. While the economic policies largely responsible
for these adverse developments are currently being revised, the industrial
sector has recently returned to growth, albeit still at low rates of 0.4% in
1981 and 3% in 1982. Particularly the growth of the depressed textile and
apparel industry in 1982 (+22%) provides an indication that the industrial
policies initiated by the new government which took office in 1980 are in the
right direction.

1.05      The past industrial decline has not changed the main character of
Jamaica's manufacturing sector which remains largely organized in medium size
formal factories. Few workshops which dominated manufacturing in Jamaica
until shortly after independence seem to continue operation, although no
statistical information is available on non-factory manufacturing.
Nevertheless, it is estimated that over 40% of the labor force employed in
manufacturing in 1981 worked in the non-factory sector. In the factory
sector, the number of registered factories has remained practically unchanged
since 1973 at about 1,250, but as factory employment declined from a peak of
about 55,000 in 1974 to 44,000 in 1980, average employment per factory fell
from 43 workers in 1974 to 36 in 1980. Only a few plants, which operate
generally in food, beverages and tobacco processing have a work force of over
500. These sub-sectors, together with footwear manufacturing, oil refining,
tire manufacturing and production of packaging materials also have the
highest degree of :Lndustrial concentration with a small number of enterprises
controlling major shares of domestic market production. High industrial
concentration seems to affect industrial efficiency only in the cases of
tires for automobiles and packaging materials, where price controls and
import competition are inadequate to assure the supply of the domestic market
with products at competitive prices and quality. Exports which have been
inhibited by the high cost and inadequate quality of domestically produced
packaging material will be able to utilize imported products under recently
revised policies of the Government (para 1.19).
1.06      Notwithstanding the severe economic decline during the period
1973-1980, total employment in Jamaica increased by about 15% to 720,000 on
average during 198C0. However, since the labor force rose at a higher rate
than employment, the unemployment rate increased from about 22% in 1973 to a
peak of 28% in early 1980. As the economy recovered in 1981 and 1982 the
unemployment situation has slightly improved; the unemployment rate was 27%
in April 1982. Employment generation in manufacturing was inadequate to
maintain the already low share in total employment (12.5% in 1973) during the
recession; by 1980 manufacturing employed less than 80,000 workers, only
about 10.5% of the employed labor force. Most of the reduction of
manufacturing employment occurred in the registered factory sector which cut
employment by 11,000 workers during the recession. Industrial employment
increased during 1981 and 1982 in line with the recovery. About 15,000
manufacturing jobs were added during this two-year period and industrial
employment in 1982 is above the level reached before the recession. Both the
decline of industrial employment during the 1970s and the recent recovery
occurred largely in the registered factories, while employment in workshops
remained remarkably stable.

Mission calculations
1.07       During the recession of 1973-80, the real value of compensation
paid to the industrial work force declined considerably less than industrial
value added. As a consequence, the share of wages in industrial value added
increased from less than 40% during the early 1970s to about 50% in 1979-80.
Profitability levels in industry declined sharply, thus reducing the
incentives to invest and replace obsolete equipment. Industrial capital
formation in machinery and equipment fell by more than 50% after 1974.
Investment levels recovered in 1981-82 but they are still about 25% below the
levels reached during the early 1970s. Industrial real wages declined during
the recession, but not to an extent which would have compensated for the
reduction in labor productivity of about 25%. Industrial labor productivity
continued to fall in 1981 and 1982, while real wage levels seem to have
stabilized.
C. Industrial Policies
1.08       Trade Policies are of crucial importance in Jamaica for achieving
sustained industrial growth. In 1981, imports reached about 50% of GDP,
while the share of exports in GDP was much lower at 32%. Shares of
merchandise imports and exports in GDP have been highly erratic during the
1970s, varying between 31% and 50% for imports and 20% and 35% for exports,
but the overall trends of the shares has been rising over time. As a result,
the country's economic development depends to a high extent on the
performance of foreign trade. Four products, bauxite, alumina, sugar and
bananas, have generated in the past about 80% of total export earnings, which
exacerbates the economic dependence on changing foreign market conditions.
Thus, the sharp decline of bauxite and alumina prices during 1982 caused a



- 6 -
reduction of export earnings of about US$250 million, about 25% of total 1981
export earnings. Inappropri.ate trade policies have helped to prevent a
diversification of exports toward non-traditional products, which is
necessary both to reduce the country's dependence on a small number of
primary commodities subject to sharp price fluctuations and to give to
non-traditional industrial and agricultural products broader outlets than the
small domestic market.
1.09      Protection of domestic market oriented manufacturing against import
competition represents the most important instrument of Jamaican import
policy. Jamaica is a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (CARICOM)
and applies CARICO:M's common external tariff system to imports originating in
third countries. Tariff levels are moderate, varying on average between 15%
for raw materials and 45% for consumer goods. However, duty exemptions are
widespread and import duty collections (including stamp duties) were only
about 5% of non-CARICOM imports in recent years. In 1981, concession imports
exempted from duties were about 80% of total imports and 70% of non-fuel
imports. Most duty exemptions are for imports of raw materials and capital
goods which has contributed to creating a capital intensive and import
dependent industrial sector. The diversified tariff structure and the high
concentration of duty exemptions on production inputs contribute to the high
effective protection afforded to major consumer product categories. A recent
sjudy on trade policies of Caribbean countriesl/, found that effective
protection in Jamaica for some consumer goods is extremely high and their
domestic prices (e.g. for shirts, footwear) are more than 100% above world
market levels. The study found cases of gross industrial inefficiency in
Jamaica, with negative value added at world market prices (e.g. shirts),
largely attributable to quantitative import restrictions. Nevertheless, the
tariff structure has a negative impact on Jamaican industry which would
increase with the planned gradual removal of the QRs.
1,10      Quantitative Import Restrictions are the most important instrument
in Jamaica's protection system. In principle, all imports are subject to
licensing. In addition, imports are categorized into restricted and
non-restricted items. Items on the restricted list may be imported only
under special licen,ces which are issued after detailed analysis by government
institutions. Most, items on the restricted list do not obtain an import
license. Until 1982, the number of items on the restricted list was
continuously enlarged from 158 items in 1968 to 364 at the end of 1981.  The
restricted list was reduced to about 240 items in February 1983 and all
restricted items are to be eliminated by 1985. A study is under way to
determine the optimum order for removal of these QRs, and to ascertain
whether additional tariffs and/or excise taxes will need to be temporarily
introduced. In practice, however, the coverage of the restrictive list is
_ G. Ranis et al.: Production and Export Incentives in the CARICOM Region,
May 1982.  The study was commissioned by the CARICOM Secretariat and the
World Bank. This draft report is in the Project File.



much broader than indicated by the number of items, as broad product
categories are frequently registered on the list in one item. Basically, the
restricted list covers all important products manufactured domestically as
well as a small number of products, including automobiles, which have an
important impact on the balance of payments. Therefore, in line with the
country's production structure, the restricted list covers mainly consumer
goods. In early 1982, only 52 items on the restricted list were intermediate
and capital goods.
1.11      Until early 1983 the granting of import licenses both for
restricted and unrestricted items, was extremely complex and unsupportive of
industry. There were no consistently applied criteria for providing
manufacturing with licenses for needed imports of raw materials and
equipment, and only about one half of applications for licenses of raw
materials and capital goods imports were approved. As a consequence,
Jamaican industry was generally inadequately provided with needed production
inputs, while an important share of managerial effort had to be spent on the
processing of import licences. Only enterprises with some export production
which obtained financing from the Export Development Fund (EDF) or maintained
their own accounts in foreign exchange ("retained accounts") had practically
unrestricted access to imports of domestically unavailable production
inputs. Since early 1983, a thoroughly revised import licensing system is in
operation which provides Jamaican industry with automatic licenses for all
except a few restricted production inputs (para 1.19).
1.12      Until early 1983, the scarcity of foreign exchange, and the related
cumbersome import licensing system, constituted important obstacles to
industrial investment and production. Industrial importers of raw materials
and capital goods competed for a declining share of licenses funded with
foreign exchange as the official exchange rate. Since the
institutionalization of the parallel market in early 1983 the uncertainty
about the availability of foreign exchange has practically been removed.
Industrial inputs imported without EDF short-term financing are at the
parallel exchange rate and automatic licences are provided for all
unrestricted goods. While imported production inputs are now on average
considerably more costly than before, their unrestricted availability should
have a positive effect on planning of production and investments in
manufacturing.
1.13      Industrial Incentives in Jamaica are granted under the Industrial
Incentives Act, the Export Industry Encouragement Act, and a Government
regulation providing general duty exemption on imports of raw materials and
intermediate inputs. The incentives granted by the two Acts consist mainly
of import duty exonerations on capital goods and corporate tax exemptions for
up to ten years. The Incentive Acts are administered by the Ministry of
Trade and Industry and JNIP, and decisions for granting the incentives are
made by an Inter-ministerial Committee chaired by the Prime Minister. At the
end of 1982 approximately 120 industrial enterprises were entitled to
benefits under the two Incentive Acts, about 20 of them were registered



during 1982. The continued high rate of registration under the Incentives
Acts is an indication of their effectiveness in encouraging industrial
investments. However, the duty exemptions have the additional undesirable
effect of providing relatively strong support to industries and enterprises
with high capital intensity, thus discouraging industrial employment
generation.  In addition, the duty exemptions provide negative protection for
domestic production of raw materials, intermediate products and capital
goods, while increasing protection of the domestic consumer goods industry.
Encouragement of capital intensive activities is particularly undesirable,
given Jamaica's high unemployment. These duty exemptions are granted by all
CARICOM countries in the framework of regional industrial incentives
agreements and cannot be removed unilaterally. The Government is aware of
these problems and is discussing them with Jamaica's CARICOM partners. Among
industries benefiting from the existing incentives, the investment cost per
job was about US$27,000 in 1982. Although the figures in Table 1.3 are
derived from inforimation provided by the investors applying for incentives or
credit and are not independently confirmed, they appear roughly in line with
the investment coslt per job for industrial machinery and equipment estimated
by the Department of Statistics for the total industrial sector. Investment
cost per job under the Industrial Incentive Act appear particularly high,
when compared with the cost of job creation in export industry supported
under the Bank financed medium term credit line of the EDF.

D. Exports
1.14      The bulk of Jamaica's foreign exchange earnings from commodity
exports results from traditional products, bauxite, alumina, sugar and
bananas. In spite of sharply fluctuating production and price levels of
these products, their share in total exports has remained stable at over 80%
in recent years. Only the sharp recession of the bauxite and alumina market
during 1982 depressed the share of traditional exports below 80%.

1.15      Exports of manufactured products and of non-traditional
agricultural products have both more than doubled in current US dollar during
the period 1972 to 1982. Exports of manufactures (excluding petroleum
products) were about US$115 million in 1982 and exports of non-traditional
agricultural products increased to about US$23 million, compared to total
exports of an estimated US$700 million. Non-traditional agricultural
products have hardly increased their exports in constant prices since 1979,
and export volumes of several products have been declining. Only coffee
experienced a strong recovery on export markets during 1982. Similarly, the
export performance of manufactures has been rather weak since 1977. Measured
at constant prices, manufactured exports in 1982 were somewhat below the
level reached in 1977. The manufactured export performance was particularly
disappointing in 1982, when the upturn initiated in 1981 was not sustained
and manufactured exports declined by about 4% in constant prices.
1.16      Product composition and market direction are major determining
factors for Jamaica's past manufactured export performance. Processed foods,
beverages, tobacco products and machinery and equipment registered real
export growth during 1972-1981, while chemicals and textiles, garments and
footwear exports suffered real declines. In particular, the poor export
performance of textiles and apparel, which provided about one quarter of



- 10 -
manufactured exports in 1972 but less than 10% in 1981, was a major factor in
the overall export performance. The resource-based exports of foods,
beverages and tobacco products performed comparatively well during the period
1972-81 and their manufactured export share increased from less than 40% in
1972 to over 50% in 1981. But exports of resource-based manufactures
suffered from intermittent raw material supply problems and the large
enterprises producing foods, beverages and tobacco products generally lack
aggressiveness in their export marketing effort. Resource based manufactured
exports have so far not realized their full growth potential.

1.17      The direction of manufactured exports has changed substantially
since 1972. The share of manufactured exports which went to the protected
CARICOM market increased from one third in 1972 to over 70% in 1982. Since
1977, third market manufactured exports have stagnated in current prices at
somewhat above US$40 million per year. The increase of third market exports
between 1978 and ]L980 was due to the temporary effects of the 1978 exchange
rate adjustments. In 1982 these exports declined to about US$42 million, the
same amount reached in 1977, as the effects of the exchange rate adjustments
were successively absorbed by domestic price and wage increases. Currently,
only tobacco products, rum and small quantities of processed foods and
garments are exported to countries outside of the CARICOM area. The high
export growth on the CARICOM market is particularly remarkable, considering
the market's small population of about 3 million people, which is little more
than Jamaica's own population. But Jamaica's manufacturers benefitted from
the duty free accetss to CARICOM, the proximity to the market and historically
developed business relationships. However, the most important factor in



- 11 -
Jamaica's success on the CARICOM market is the purchasing power increases
experienced by oil-rich Trinidad and Tobago. Over two third of Jamaica's
manufactured exports to CARICOM in 1982 were sold in Trinidad and Tobago.
Since the last oil price increase in 1979 all additional Jamaican CARICOM
sales were made in Trinidad and Tobago. As the CARICOM system is put under
stress and declining oil prices force Trinidad and Tobago to take restrictive
economic measures, Jamaica's exports require increased marketing efforts in
order to maintain past growth rates. Jamaica's main export potential is in
third countries where existing but neglected export links have to be revived
and new markets have to be developed.
1.18      Manufactured export performance has suffered from inadequate
incentive policies. With the brief interruption of the 1978-79 devaluation,
when manufactured exports initiated a rapid increase, production for the
domestic and CARICOM market was continuously more profitable than export
production for third countries. In addition to high protection,
manufacturers producing for the CARICOM market have benefited from improving
real exchange rate relations. Between 1978 and 1982 the real exchange rate
for Jamaican exporters to Trinidad and Tobago improved by about 8%, while
exporters to the major third markets in the USA, Canada and United Kingdom
faced a deterioration of the real exchange rates by about 7%. The sharply
differing performance of CARICOM and third market exports demonstrates the
important effect of the exchange rate on export profitability. The
increasing bias against third market exports was also not compensated by
export incentives. The Export Industry Encouragement Act provides for duty
exemption on imported capital goods and a reduction of corporate profit taxes
in proportion to the shares of exports in total production. The duty
exemption is not differentiated according to export market, and its cost
reducing effect is small due to the low level of duties on capital goods.
The tax incentive in the Export Industry Encouragement Act was never
implemented, since it is excessively complex and income tax exemption is
already provided to most industrial enterprises under the Industrial
Incentives Act. Finally, the establishment of the Export Development Fund in
1979 contributed decisively to reestablish the trust of foreign suppliers in
Jamaican industry and also helped to provide Jamaican importers with
favorable suppliers credit. In this way, financing and foreign exchange
provided by the EDF was necessary for the manufactured export performance
since 1979. However, EDF financing which is at market conditions could
contribute little to reduce the strong anti-export bias prevailing until
early 1983. About 80% of short-term financing provided by the EDF was for
CARICOM exporters who were largely unaffected by the anti-export bias.
E. Reform of Industrial Incentives
1.19      The economic measures taken by the Government in early 1983 go a
long way in reducing the anti-export bias faced by Jamaican manufacturers
exporting to third markets. Within the policy package implemented, the
export incentives and measures to reform import licensing are the most
important steps to both achieve substantial export growth and raise the



- 12 -
efficiency of domestic market oriented industry. The Government has rightly
concentrated on exchange rate and import licensing policies, which according
to experience gathered in the past are most effective in promoting exports
and strengthening industrial efficiency. Third country exporters of
manufactured and non-traditional agricultural products are now permitted to
retain 50% of their foreign exchange proceeds from sales in third countries
to pay for their own imports of production inputs or sell the foreign
exchange in the paraLllel market, established in January 1983. The resulting
improvement of export profitability is estimated at about 25% of export
value, taking into account the exchange rate prevailing on the parallel
market (about J$2.60 per US dollar). On the other hand, in May 1983 a fixed
exchange rate for CARICOM trade was agreed to by Jamaica and its CARICOM
partners (J$2.25 per US dollar), which tends to improve further the incentive
structure in favor of Jamaica's third country exports. The reform of
licensing for imports is the second measure taken by the Government to
redress the anti-export bias faced by Jamaican industry. All enterprises
exporting more than 5% of their production or having access to EDF financing
are obtaining unrestricted access to imported production inputs under fully
automatic licensing. Liberalized import licensing will support export growth
both in the short-term, due to the unrestricted access to imported raw
materials and intermediate products, and in the medium-term, when new
efficient export production capacity would go into operation. In a separate
measure of reform of the licensing system, the Government is providing
exporters with automatic import licenses for a number of important
intermediate and capital goods which are on the restricted import list. This
measure provides manufacturers with necessary inputs, particularly packaging
material, of suitable price and quality for competitiveness on export
markets. The liberalization of import licensing and the successive reduction
of the restricted import list will also raise the competitive pressure on
industry producing for the domestic market. The reduced relative
profitability of domestic market production would induce manufacturers to
employ a larger part of capacity for export production than in the past.
1.20      The expanded and financially strengthened EDF has an important
complementary role in the export drive initiated by the Government in early
1983. Without the adequate provision of foreign exchange credit by the EDF,
the measures to liberalize imports of production inputs and to raise the
profitability of exports would remain ineffective. The import needs of
exporters are high and, after the measures taken by the Government in early
1983, the EDF is the only source of foreign exchange for imports outside of
the parallel currency market. The strong demand for EDF financing by both
existing and new exporters which was effective during the first weeks after
taking the new export incentive measures indicates the importance of the EDF
export credit system. Also, the strong demand in early 1983 for EDF's
medium-term financing required by the export industry for replacement of
equipment and for the increase of permanent working capital is an indication
for the continued need to modernize plant for meeting product standards on
export markets.



- 13 -
1.21      While the export incentive measures taken in early 1983 go a long
way in reducing the anti-export bias and the distortions among factors of
production prevailing in the Jamaican economy, additional supportive policy
changes may be required in the medium term. For this purpose, Bank staff is
currently carrying out a study of competitiveness of Jamaican exports of
goods and services. Also, the Bank mission analyzing industrial policies in
Jamaica in December 1982, recommended a revision of the import duty system
and of the industrial incentive laws at a time when industry would have
adjusted to the measures taken in early 1983. With respect to the
medium-term revision of the import duty structure, the Bank mission
recommended introduction of a 10% stamp duty on imports of raw materials,
intermediate goods and capital goods, with the intention to achieve a better
balance between the industrial uses of domestic and imported production
inputs. Exporters would be compensated for the related increase of
production cost. The Bank mission also recommended to introduce an
employment generating incentive and a general reduction of corporate tax
rates into the Industrial Incentives Laws which should also be operated in an
automatic and non-discretiotiary way. The purpose of these suggestions was to
encourage labor intensive industrial production and to simplify the currently
complex administration of industrial incentives. The Government has reacted
positively to these proposals and is keeping both the industrial incentives
and the import protection system under review per discussions and actions
within the ongoing SAL process.
F. Prospects for Industrial Exports and Investments
1.22      After a brief period of adjustment to the policy measures taken in
early 1983, manufactured exports can be expected to achieve substantial
growth, particularly on third markets. As profitability of third market
exports is now improved, existing idle capacity in most industries can be put
back into operation for export production within a comparatively short period
of time. In addition, constraints on exports to the demanding third country
markets have been removed with the measures to permit the unrestricted import
of all materials required for the manufacture of quality export products.
The increased supply of suitable export products would be further enhanced by
technical assistance to be provided under the Loan (para 3.12) which would
focus on production improvements in export industries and export marketing
support. On the demand side, third market exports of manufactures also seem
to have the best prospects for a substantial increase in the short term.
Jamaican export manufacturers can probably recapture rapidly only recently
lost markets, considering their re-gained price competitiveness. The
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) could provide a further boost to exports to
the US market. On the other hand, it will be difficult for Jamaican
manufacturers to achieve comparably high export growth in the CARICOM
market. Profitability of these exports is practically unchanged as compared
to the situation in 1982, when CARICOM exports increased at about 15% in



- 14 -
current prices. The mediumr-term outlook of Jamaican manufactured exports for
1984 and 1985 is largely determined by a successful structural adjustment of
the economy. In particular, third market exports which face few demand
constraints will grow largely in line with the capability of Jamaican
industry to produce exportable goods. Some supply limitations remain for
resource-based products (foods, tobacco products), but most other products,
particularly garments, footwear, metal products and machinery, would be
mainly constrained by inadequate price and quality competitiveness.
Considering the strongly supportive measures initiated and planned by the
Government to secure the price competitiveness of Jamaican exports, as well
as the Bank supported technical assistance effort which is underway to
improve product quality and marketability, third market exports should
continue to rise at high rates in the medium term. Overall, growth rates of
manufactured exports could range between 20% and 30% on third markets and 5%
and 20% on the CARICOM market at current US Dollars. Exports of
non-traditional agricultural products, which are mainly limited by domestic
supply constraints may be increasing at rates of 5% to 10% p.a., which were
experienced in the past. The substantial range of possible growth rates is a
reflection of the high degree of uncertainty prevailing on both the export
supply and demand' side of Jamaican manufactures and agricultural products.
1.23      Since resumption of industrial growth in 1981, investments in
manufacturing have increased at a high rate. The major part of investments
was probably for replacement of obsolete equipment, since much of Jamaican
industrial production capacity is run-down after many years of inadequate
investments. Considering the still existing excess capacity, a major part of
investment requirements will continue for some time to be for replacement and
balancing of existing machinery. Aggregate industrial investment estimates
are practically impossible because of insufficient statistical data, but
imports of non-automotive machinery and equipment for industry would form a
reasonable base for a projection. These imports were over US$100 million per
year in 1981 and 1982. Taking into account the real growth of this base and
international price increases as well as additional requirements for
permanent working capital of industry, industrial investments could average
about US$150 million per year during the 1983-85 period. A medium-term
credit component of US$5 million as part of the proposed Loan to the EDF
would finance about 3% of these annual requirements. Approximately 500 jobs
could be created with this investment.

II. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. Institutional Structure
2.01      Jamaica's financial institutions includes:  (a) the central bank,
Bank of Jamaica (BOJ), (b) 9 commercial banks with 150 branches, (c)
specialized institutions, such as merchant banks, trust companies, building
varieties and a mortgage bank; and (d) development finance institutions.
2.02      Bank of Jamaica, (BOJ) is responsible for the currency issue; it
acts as the government's bank by keeping the government's accounts and
providing advice on financial policy formulation; and as the bankers' bank,
it regulates, keeps accounts of and provide clearing facilities to the
commercial banks. It also administers foreign exchange reserves and executes
monetary policy decisions which must be agreed with the Minister of Finance.
In addition to its central bank function, BOJ has a number of specialized
agencies through which it provides student loans, oversees the stock
exchange, insures and finances exporters, and extends term credit for private
enterprises using credit lines from international and foreign institutions.
All its credit operations are conducted through commercial banks.
2.03      The most important agency of BOJ is the Jamaica Export Credit
Insurance Corp. (JECIC) which provides various facilities to exporters. It
offers export credit insurance, an important means of protecting the
exporter's foreign receivables against commercial and political risks of
default and delayed payments which are beyond the exporter's control. It
enables a Jamaican exporter to compete more effectively for overseas business
and permits him to assign his bills and foreign receivables to his commercial
bank thereby facilitating access to bank financing, sometimes on more
advantageous terms. In addition, JECIC has 3 specialized programs of
financial support to help meet the needs of Jamaican exporters for short-term
working capital during both pre-and post-shipment periods. All these
operations are through commercial banks. The Pre-Shipment Financing Facility
is intended to provide pre-shipment short-term assistance for the exporter up
to 60% of the FOB value of an export order premissory note. Under the
post-shipment financing JECIC through its Export Credit Facility provides
90-day credits for up to 100% of the CIF value of the exported goods.
Furthermore, JECIC may issue, through its Bankers' Export Guarantee Facility,
an unconditional guarantee to the commercial bank on the amount advanced to
an exporter which remains unpaid due to the buyer's failure to make payment
on the due date. In this way it eases constraint on the exporter's
liquidity.
2.04      With the establishment of EDF in 1979, the use of discount
facilities has been limited to non-EDF clients and their operations have
drastically declined. On the other hand credit risks on the sub-loans made
by commercial banks under EDF as well as under the Rehabilitation Fund



- 16 -
program financed by IDB could be guaranteed up to 80% by JECIC under its
Banker's Import Guarantee program thus enabling the banks' marginal customers
to have access to financing offered by these funds. JECIC also administers
for BOJ special credit lines provided by a number of governments, foreign
banks and export organizations to facilitate Jamaican imports and generally
tied to country of procurement and governed by special termns and conditions.
2.05      A separate agency of BOJ, Premier Investment Corp. (PIC) has been
providing credit, through commercial banks for small businesses, primarily
under World Bank financing. Since 1982 its activities have been largely
limited to collection of outstanding loans and are being phased out.
2.06      Commercial banks are mainly locally owned but still retain strong
ties with their present or past parent institutions in Canada, England and
USA. They generally follow the traditional banking principles of safety and
liquidity, making mostly well secured short-term loans which can be rolled
over subject to yearly reviews. About 10% of their portfolios is in mortgage
loans to selected clients secured either by residental properties valued at
least 25% above the loan amount, or by tangible business assets valued 50% or
more over the loan. In addition, commercial banks usually establish a
"ceiling" for each borrower above which they will not lend irrespective of
additional collateral or activity to be financed. In 1982, the commercial
banks' outstanding loans for manufacturing activities amounted to over J$320
million, representing over 20% of their overall loan portfolios.
2.07      Specialized Institutions.  Some industrial financing is provided by
merchant banks but their total lending operations represent about 3.5% of the
commercial banks' loan portfolio (1982). They accept time deposits but have
no current accounts. Although authorized to make equity investments, their
assets are mainly in short-and medium-term loans. Since their capitalization
is very low (about 5% of total assets) and their activities are concentrated
on a few selected customers, they will be allowed to use financing under the
proposed project only up to double the amount of their equity. Trust
companies, building societies and a mortgage bank - finance primarily
residential and commercial mortgages and as such are not of interest for the
proposed project.
2.08      Development Finance Institutions (DFI).  Until mid-1981 there were
3 public DFIs involved in industrial lending, namely, the Jamaica Development
Bank (JDB), the Small Industries Finance Co. (SIFCO) and PIC. In 1981 the
Government decided to gradually phase out all these institutions, and to
establish the National Development Bank (NDB) as the only public sector bank
to provide industrial financing through commercial banks and other financial
intermediaries. At the same time, the Government established the
Agricultural Credit Bank to consolidate public sector financing in the
agricultural sector. At present, the three DFIs named above do not make new
loans and only administer their existing loan portfolio and collect
outstanding loans. It is the government's stated intention to liquidate them
as soon as legal and administrative aspects can be worked out and the final



- 17 -
audit establishes their net portfolio and asset value. In the meantime, a
common Board of Directors is to be established for NDB, JDB and SIFCO to
oversee an orderly liquidation of the last two institutions. Liquidation
proceedings on PIC are to be undertaken as soon as its 1982 audit is
available.
B. Monetary Policy and Interest Rate Structure
2.09      The main instruments of monetary policy are:
(i) The Bank Rate which is the interest rate charged by BOJ on its
loans to commercial banks for meeting their liquidity requirements.
Traditionally, the prime lending rate of the commercial banks has been 2
percent points above the Bank Rate. Since January 1980 the Bank Rate has
been 11% p.a.
(ii) Reserve Requirements are the amount of cash reserves and
liquid assets that commercial banks are required to hold. Cash reserves have
never been changed from their initial level of 5% of the commercial bank's
deposits. However, the liquid assets ratio (cash and short term assets of up
to 9 months maturity) has varied and is presently 29.5% (official reserves).
In January 1979 BOJ approved a "voluntary" increase in the liquid assets
ratio to 40%, which represents the present effective reserve requirement.
The "voluntary" reserves are held in Treasury Bills now yielding about 10%
p.a.
2.10      In addition to the above regulatory instruments of monetary policy
which have not been employed in the last few years, BOJ may use selective
credit controls (used in 1980 to limit consumer's credit), and moral suasion
to affect the credit supply of the commercial banks. Because the securities
market is very narrow, open market operations cannot be effectively applied.
In general, the monetary policy instruments have not been used effectively in
Jamaica. The supply of domestic credit largely depends on the volume of
exports and the government's budgetary situation. The banking system had a
high level of liquidity during part of 1982 because of a rapid increase in
deposits. Towards the end of the year and in early 1983 liquidity declined
as the rate of growth of deposits slowed and demand for credit from the
private sector increased rapidly.
2.11      Commercial banks do not pay interest on demand deposits.  On
4        savings accounts there is a fixed interest rate of 9% p.a. and time deposits
(6 months or more) pay between 7 1/2% to 13% p.a., depending on the amount of
deposit and its maturity. There is no official ceiling on lending rates.
The prime rate is 13% p.a. (2% above BOJ's discount rate) but the typical
effective rate is about 17% p.a. including banks' customary charges. Some



- 18 -
banks also charge an additional fee on undisbursed balances. On this basis
commercial banks earn an average interest spread of about 5.2% p.a.'/
2.12      Considering that the inflation rate in 1981 was about 4% and for
1982 is estimated at 8%, the existing lending interest rates were positive in
real terms. Following the establishment of the parallel market in January
1983, domestic prices are expected to rise, but after a short adjustment
period they should stabilize and then follow the level of international
prices. Thus, the lending rates are expected to be positive in real terms.
1/ Based on:  (a) savings and time deposits are 75% of total deposits at an
average cost to commercial banks of 7.5% p.a.; (b) average earnings on the
required reserves is 6.2% p.a., and 17% p.a. on advances.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Previous Loans
3.01      The Bank has made two loans to Jamaica for financing of exporters.
The first Loan 1715-JM (Second Program Loan) of US$31.5 million was for EDF's
short-term pre-shipment financing (US$30.0 million) and financing of
technical assistance (US$1.5 million), mainly for the Jamaica National Export
Corporation (JNEC). The Second Loan 1978-JM (Second Export Development Fund
Project) of US$37 million helped to establish, in addition to strengthening
EDF's short-term pre-shipment financing operation with the amount of US$22.0
million, a special short-term operation of US$4.0 million to provide export
financing to banana producers who had been affected by Hurricane Allen, and a
medium-term operation of US$10.0 million for financing of permanent working
capital and equipment of export manufacturing enterprises for periods of up
to four years. US$1.0 million of the second loan financed technical
assistance requirements of EDF and JNEC. With the exception of parts of the
medium-term operation and the component for banana producers, both loans were
disbursed by March 1, 1983.
3.02      EDF's main short-term operation was also supported by the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) with an amount of US$7.5 million, which
at the end of 1982 brought total resources available in EDF for export
financing to US$68.9 million, including retained profits. These financial
resources have permitted the EDF to support an increasing volume of
manufactured exports and, at the same time, building-up a strong liquidity
position. In 1982, EDF disbursed US$45 million to 110 export enterprises,
thus supporting manufactured exports of over US$60 million, more than
one-half of Jamaica's total manufactured exports. In addition, EDF financed
US$14 million of imports of domestic linkage industries whose contribution to
exports would spill over to 1983. The medium-term operation contributed to
the rehabilitation of 20 exports manufacturing firms at comparatively low
cost per job created of US$10,000. The amounts remaining in the medium-term
operation at the end of 1982, were committed to five enterprises during the
first months of 1983. The amount of US$4.0 million allocated under the
second loan to the Banana Company of Jamaica Ltd. was disbursed slowly, due
to the longer than expected depressed situation of banana production.
However, as banana exports recovered strongly, 1982 disbusements reached
about US$1.5 million. On December 31, 1982, about US$2.5 million of EDF's
banana operation were committed; the remainder of US$1.5 million would be
sufficient to meet the import financing needs of the Banana Company for some
time. Therefore, no strengthening of this EDF operation is called for under
the proposed loan.
3.03      In spite of the overall success of the two previous loans to the
EDF, some deficiencies have come to light during appraisal of the proposed
third loan. In order to remedy these deficiencies as well as to adapt the



- 20 -
EDF operations to the new exchange rate system which has been in place since
January 1983, the following adjustments are currently being made:
(a) EDF's short-term operations have been cumbersome and
time consuming, while providing inadequate control
over delinquent borrowers.  Administrative
procedures of EDF are being simplified and controls
strengthened with technical assistance to be
financed retroactively by the proposed loan (para.
3.14).
(b) EDF financing was limited to export manufacturers
and manufacturers supplying them with inputs. This
has excluded both products and enterprises with good
export potential from obtaining EDF financing.
Under the proposed loan the range of firms and
products eligible for financing will be broadened
(para. 3.14(b)).
(c) Import volumes financed with EDF credit were
generally limited to the estimated import
requirements of the exporting enterprises. Under
EDF's revised operations, most exporters have higher
allocations of financing by EDF than in the past.
They may also import a number of important
production inputs on the restricted list which will
strengthen their competitiveness on export markets
(para. 3.14(c)).
(d) EDF accummulated in the past excessive liquid
reserves which were not required for its
operations. Disbursements under the proposed loan
will assure an adequate but not excessive level of
liquid reserves for EDF operations (para. 4.05).
B. Objectives
3.04      The proposed third EDF loan seeks to build on the achievements and
experience of the twro earlier loans supporting the following objectives:
(a) in the context of the trade liberalization and
export incentive measures taken by the Government of
Jamaica in January 1983, to provide additional and
adequate foreign exchange resources for imported
inputs of export manufacturers;



- 21 -
(b)  to support the projected growth of non-traditional
exports with foreign exchange and credit financing
for meeting the import requirements of industrial
and independent agricultural exporters;
(c)  to allow improved utilization of installed
production capacity and to help rehabilitate
production facilities which could be used in export
manufacturing;
(d)  to strengthen the administrative capabilities of
institutions involved in financing and provision of
technical assistance to exporters.
3.05      The above listed objectives have been discussed in detail with the
Government, which is aware of the need for increased imports of production
inputs, if the export drive is to be successful. The proposed loan would
help to provide the foreign exchange required for these imports.
C. Participating Institutions
3.06      Under the proposed project the overall institutional arrangements
of the previous loans would be continued, although some important measures to
simplify procedures and improve the cooperation among the institutions
involved are currently under implementation. Short-term import financing
would be provided by commercial banks, which upon lending and arranging for
payment of overseas obligations would be reimbursed in foreign exchange by
the EDF. The Bank of Jamaica would continue administration of the EDF
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Jamaica Export Credit Insurance
Corporation (JECIC). The Jamaica National Export Corporation (JNEC) would
provide marketing assistance to industrial and agricultural exporters,
including clients of the EDF.
The Export Development Fund
3.07      The EDF was established in May 1979, and began operating a
revolving fund for short-term export financing in September, 1979. In
September 1981, the EDF introduced a medium-term credit operation for
financing of permanent working capital and plant rehabilitation of export
manufacturers. The medium-term fund is also operated on the revolving
basis. At the end of 1982, EDF's total financial resources for its
short-term operations were US$ 68.9 million of which US$31.4 million were
disbursed and outstanding for export financing, and US$37.5 million were held
as liquid reserves, largely on EDF's account with Bank of Jamaica.
Disbursements from the medium-term fund resources on December 31, 1982 were
about US$1.9 million, but loan commitments were US$6.5 million.



- 22 -
3.08      The EDF is administered by staff provided by JECIC, but its
accounts are maintained separately. The EDF has also a separate Board of
Directors, including representatives of Bank of Jamaica, the Ministries of
Finance, of Industry and of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and of private
manufacturers and commercial banks. The Board of Directors played an
important role during establishment and initial period of operations in
assuring EDF's functioning as an effective source of export financing. More
recently, EDF's operations have been less effective, and under the revised
EDF policies and procedures, the Board's functions in monitoring performance
and providing guidance and direction to EDF's management has been
strengthened. Bank staff has been closely involved in designing the revised
EDF policies and is monitoring their implementation (3.18).
3.09      EDF's Board of Directors received in October 1982 the first audit
report prepared by EDF's external auditors which summarizes EDF's financial
position as of December 31, 1982 (Annex 2, Table 4). During negotiations of
the proposed loan, agreement was reached on enlarging the coverage of future
audit reports which would be in line with Bank requirements.
3.10      During three years of operation, the EDF has matured
substantially. JECIC has allocated a staff of 20 officers to the EDF, about
one third of its total establishment. This comparatively small staff has
performed with increasing efficiency a rising volume of business activities.
Particular progress was made in improving EDF's accounting system.
Accounting entries which were in 1981 up to three months late were
practically current in February 1983, before introducing the new operating
procedures. Part of the operational improvement made during 1982 can be
attributed to technical assistance provided by two consulting firms, financed
out of the proceeds of Loans 1715-JM and 1978-JM. The technical assistance
helped EDF to restructure its organization, responsibilities and workloads of
staff and prepare up-to-date policies, procedures and operating manuals.  The
technical assistance included also considerable training activities.  An
electronic data processing system for EDF's accounting system was acquired
with funds provided under Loan 1715-JM, and extensive technical assistance
and training of EDF staff performed by consultants and financed from proceeds
of Loan 1978-JM, helped to make the system operational. During the initial
periods of the training activities, the consultants provided also operational
support to EDF. The EDF is obtaining additional technical assistance by
consultants to prepare revised manuals on procedures, in computerizing the
accounting system and in supporting EDF staff in performing the heavy work
load during the period of administrative transition. A major share of these
technical assistance activities for an amount of about US$200,000 incurred
since January 1983 would be financed retroactively from the proceeds of the
proposed loan. EDE can be expected to require additional technical support
after adjusting to the new operational procedures for which funds would also
be made available under the proposed loan (para 3.12).



- 23 -
3.11      In the course of 1982 a consulting firm advising EDF on
administration and financial control system analyzed EDF operations and
concluded that it would require substantial reorganization and strengthening
of staff to perform effectively the rapidly increasing work load.1/ In the
light of the revised operations, EDF's management has been working since
January 1983 on restructuring its administration. However, EDF's management
believes that external management consultants should analyze the
substantially changed responsibilities and work loads among EDF staff and
operating divisions before an effective reorganization of the EDF should be
initiated. The terms of reference of this management and organization study,
the selected consultant and his contract (which would be financed from the
proceeds of the proposed loan) would be approved by the Bank.
Institutions Benefitting from the Technical Assistance Component of the
Proposed Loan
3.12      The proposed loan would have a component of US$2 million for
financing of technical assistance. US$0.5 million of the total amount has
been allocated to EDF for technical support of its operations arnd US$1.5
million to support export promotion activities and the provision of technical
assistance to export manufacturing firms by JNEC and other Government
institutions. The Government has recently completed a review of institutions
involved with the industrial sector which would form the basis for the
organizational arrangements of technical assistance under the proposed loan.
By December 31, 1983, the Government will furnish the Bank with a plan for
technical assistance to the export industry. This was confirmed during loan
negotiations.
D. Revised Procedures for EDF's Operations
3.13      Revised operational procedures for EDF's short-term operations have
partially gone into effect on March 1, 1983. Since that date, the EDF has
discontinued the provision of export financing under the arrangements
prevailing in the past. Although disbursements from past approvals for
financing will continue during 1983, all outstanding amounts, including
arrears, will be collected by December 31, 1983. From January 1, 1984, the
EDF will operate fully under the new procedures, agreed upon during loan
negotiations (Annex 3).
Short-term Operations
3.14      Under the new procedures, the EDF is continuing its past program of
short-term import financing for export production. Including the proposed
loan the EDF would have increased resources of about US$93 million available
for this purpose. The revised EDF short-term operations differ considerably
in scope and procedures from those prevailing until February 28, 1983.
1/ The report of Peat, Marwick and Partners is in the Project File.



- 24 -
(a) Eligibility of Users. Under the new operations, an
increased number of enterprises is eligible for EDF
financing. In addition to export manufacturers and
manufacturing firms supplying inputs to exporters,
trading companies exporting industrial and
agricultural products and individual exporters of
agricultural products, except sugar and bananas, may
now obtain financing from the EDF. The provision of
import financing to trading houses supports small
companies in obtaining access to export markets and
will help to increase production under
sub--contracting arrangements. The financing
provided to producers of non-traditional
agrLcultural products is supporting exports which
have high, unutilized potential on third markets.
(b) Eligibility of Imported Products. Until February
28, 1983, the EDF provided short-term financing for
import of raw materials, intermediate goods, spare
parts and of equipment, which are not registered on
the restricted import list. Under the revised
procedures, EDF beneficiaries may also obtain
financing for production inputs which are on the
restricted list. Imported products can be used for
both export production and production for the
domestic market, except imports on the restricted
list which may only be used for export production.
The access of export manufacturers to restricted
imports is an important change as compared to the
previous arrangement. In particular, exporters have
now access to suitable packaging materials and other
imported production inputs which are needed for
successful export marketing.
(c) Amount of Financing. Maximum amounts of short-term
financing provided to exporters by the EDF are now
being determined on the basis of expected exports,
while under past procedures the EDF would finance
the import component of the manufacturers' exports.
Third market exporters are entitled to a maximum of
EDF financing corresponding to 50% of expected
export receipts; they may also retain the remaining
50% of export proceeds for import financing or sale
to other eligible importers (para. 1.19). CARICOM
exporters will obtain financing of 65% of their
exports (the estimated average foreign exchange
content of Jamaican exports to CARICOM), unless the
Bank and the EDF agree that the exporter has
demonstrated a higher actual import content. In
this way, the EDF supports enterprises with improved
export performance, while under the previous system
enterprises with high import requirements were
benefitting most from EDF financing. Linkage



- 25 -
enterprises which do not export themselves continue
to obtain financing for imports which they need to
produce inputs required by export manufacturing
firms (para 3.16).
3.15      The EDF is currently implementing major changes of its internal
administrative procedures, in order to perform effectively within its
expanded function and handle the expected substantial expansion of EDF's
export financing program. In particular, past administration procedures
required promissory notes to be paid from export proceeds. About 2,000
promissory notes were outstanding on average at any point in time during 1982
and EDF staff faced the difficulty of effectively handling the amount of
paper work involved. These procedures did not permit proper control of
non-performing EDF beneficiaries and may have also contributed to reducing
the number of exporters using the EDF. Less than one-half of eligible
exporters were registered with the EDF during 1982.
3.16      Under the revised operating procedures, the EDF is establishing for
each registered enterprise an account which will be operated like a
commercial bank overdraft account. Each account is assigned an initial
credit limit of foreign exchange which may be used for financing of imports
to initiate the first export cycle. The imported amounts are debited to the
exporter's account; export receipts are credited to the account. In addition
to the initial credit limit, exporters may obtain foreign exchange financing
of imports, only to the extent of their export proceeds received by EDF.
Thus, each exporter registered with the EDF may obtain EDF financing in
accordance with the following rule:
EDF Import Financing = Initial Credit Limit + EDF Recaptures from
Export Receipts - EDF Disbursements for Import Financing.
The small number of registered linkage enterprises which do not export
directly continue to operate under the previous system. These firms receive
allocations of EDF financing corresponding to the import share of supplies to
exporters. As in the past, each import activity of linkage firms is financed
by the EDF with a fixed expiration date.
3.17      The EDF determined the initial allocation of resources available to
each registered exporter for import financing in accordance with the export
incentive system introduced by the Government in January 1983. Under the
export incentive system, third market exporters, who retain 50% of their
export proceeds, are entitled to obtain EDF financing for imports
corresponding to the remaining 50% of their exports. CARICOM exporters are
entitled to EDF financing of 65% of their exports. The EDF decided for the
transition period of 1983 to limit the initial credit limit of import
financing for existing exporters up to 75% of annual allocations. This
volume of financing for imports would cover the requirements of all
categories of exporters until export receipts are obtained to replenish their
accounts with EDF, which would permit further import financing. New
exporters who do not have a past record of export performance may also obtain



- 26 -
for a limited period of one year an increased initial credit line of up to
75% of annual entitlements. This measure provides special support to the
substantial number of enterprises which intend to export for the first time
given the improved export profitability. However, after completion of the
transition period of one year, all exporters' credit limits will be reduced
to one-half of the revised annual allocations, which is fully adequate for
satisfying the financing needs of performing exporters. Initial allocations
for all registered exporters and linkage firms are fixed for a twelve-month
period and they determine, at the same time, the maximum amount of advance
import financing (credit limit) that each exporter may receive during his
allocation period.  At the anniversary date of each annual allocation, the
EDF will review the account and adjust the annual allocation (as well as the
credit limit) to export levels expected in the coming year, taking into
account past performance.
3.18      Once an account with a credit limit is established with the EDF, an
exporter may freely use the available balance for financing eligible
imports. In the past, exporters and their local suppliers (linkage
enterprises) obtained loans from a commercial bank which were financed by the
EDF with full recourse to the commercial bank. The present system will be
principally the same. The EDF is debiting the exporters' accounts with the
amounts in US dollars disbursed within the credit limits. Replenishment of
the EDF accounts, which entitle to further import financing, may be effected
at any time but would normally occur from export receipts. Commercial banks
obtaining foreign currency receipts resulting from exports by EDF registered
enterprises would automatically transfer to EDF 50% of third country export
receipts. In the case of CARICOM export receipts BOJ will deposit Jamaican
dollars in the exporter's commercial bank account at the CARICOM rate of
exchange, which is the rate at which trade balances are settled in the
CARICOM clearing facility. The commercial bank will then be required to
convert the Jamaican dollars into US dollars through purchases in the
parallel market. BOJ will make up the difference between the CARICOM and the
parallel exchange rates in order that commercial bank could fully repay EDF
in US dollars. Linkage enterprises would be required to pay their
obligations to EDF in US dollars purchased in the parallel market (para
3.19). After deducting the interest charge, the EDF would credit the
accounts of the exporters with the amounts received. Overall, the EDF
revised operating procedures represent a considerable simplification compared
to past procedures and should permit the existing staff of the EDF to handle
an increased volume of business. Control of loan delinquency and arrears
which presented a serious problem under the previous procedures is also
facilitated and non-performing EDF beneficiaries will have to cancel their
credit balance at the end of the year in foreign exchange. Arrears carried
over from past operations are taken into account by the EDF when determining
the initial allocaLtions under the new system, and they will be eliminated by
the end of 1983. Loan delinquencies could arise under the new procedures
mainly from exporters without past export record, but EDF has taken special
precautions, when evaluating export plans of firms without track record for
determining initiaLl credit limits. During negotiations, EDF's experience



- 27 -
with the new operating system was reviewed, and agreement was reached on the
revised EDF policies and procedures. This agreed version was approved by the
Board of Directors of EDF, JECIC and BOJ on April 29, 1983; subsequent
amendments to reflect CARICOM transactions at the CARICOM exchange rate were
agreed to with EDF management on May 24 and are included in Annex 3.
3.19      According to procedures agreed upon between the Government and the
Bank under the previous loans to the EDF, Bank of Jamaica was obliged to
convert EDF's soft currency receipts from exports and from sales by linkage
industries to exporters into US Dollars. During the second semester of 1982,
BOJ practically discontinued conversion of soft currency receipts and
transferred only part of the hard currency receipts. EDF's operations did
not suffer from BOJ's non-performance since its liquid resources were ample
during this period. However, in view of the expected strong increase of
demand for EDF financing, BOJ agreed during loan negotiations to repay all
the dollar amounts overdue to EDF according to an agreed three-month schedule
beginning June 1, 1983. Some of the US dollar repayments may be made by
permitting EDF to purchase US dollars in the parallel market with Jamaican
dollars provided by BOJ. However, the full payment of such arrears in US
dollars will be a condition to loan effectiveness. Since all future loans by
EDF will be denominated and repayable in US dollars, no conversions by BOJ
with respect to these new loans will be necessary. However, BOJ will be
required to convert within 30 days all EDF's local currency receipts
resulting from past operations.
Medium-term Operations
3.20      The US$5 million medium-term credit component of the proposed loan
would provide additional resources to EDF's successful lending operation for
equipment replacements and permanent working capital. The main purpose of
this loan component is to continue providing medium-term financing for the
rehabilitation of export production capacity and to help finance replacement
of equipment and the expected increased permanent working capital
requirements of exporters until the National Development Bank (NDB) is fully
operational and can assume this function. The medium-term credits permit the
EDF arrangement of financial packages which proved in the past an effective
means of support to exporters. Past administrative procedures for the
medium-term operations have been fully adequate and funds have been generally
used for well-conceived and profitable projects. In particular, the cost of
employment generation in projects financed from EDF's medium-term program
have been comparatively low at about US$10,000 per job (para. 1.13). The
simple project appraisals and viability of the borrowing enterprise which was
required under the previous loan would continue to assure, that the equipment
financed from EDF medium-term funds forms part of an existing production
facility; that a reasonable proportion of the output from the production
process using the equipment is being used for export manufacturing; and that
the permanent working capital financing is used only for the initial stock of
raw materials and supplies, or the increase in such stock needed for the
expansion of operations.



- 28 -
3.21      The past financing mechanism of the medium-term operations will
generally be maintained under the proposed loan. Similar to EDF's short-term
operation, the medium-term loans will be made from a revolving fund which is
replenished fromi repayments of the beneficiaries. Loans will continue to be
made through commercial banks but, unlike the previous system, all new loans
will be denominated and repayable in US dollars, to be purchased, if
necessary, in the parallel exchange market. The necessary changes in EDF's
policy statements for the medium-term operations were agreed to during loan
negotiations (Annex 3).
E. Resource Requirements for Short-Term Operations
3.22      The use of EDF short-term resources for export financing has been
slower than anticipated under Loan 1978-JM; the EDF was expected to be
without liquid resources by early 1983. However, at that time the EDF still
maintained about US$38 million of reserves. There existed a number of
constraints to a higher use of EDF financing which have been largely removed
by the Government measures taken in January 1983. The poor performance of
manufactured exports was the most important reason for the past low use of
EDF financing. A strong anti-export bias prevailed until January 1983, when
the Government introduced the export incentive system. Exports are now more
profitable than lbefore. Also, since January 1983 exporters have unlimited
access to parallel market funds for their import requirements and they are
assured automatic import licensing, which increases further the
attractiveness of export production. As a consequence, non-traditional
exports which are eligible for EDF financing can be expected to grow at a
substantially higher rate than in the past (paras. 1.22 and 1.23). The
Government measures of January 1983, included several steps which increased
the relative attractiveness of EDF export financing. Over 200 "retained
accounts" maintained in foreign exchange by exporters to pay for their own
imports were abolished. Other foreign exchange resources for imports
provided in the past by Bank of Jamaica at the official exchange rate are
also no longer available, but can now be obtained as export credit from EDF
repayable in US dollars. The number of exporting enterprises using EDF
financing should therefore increase rapidly. Finally, demand for EDF
financing will be stronger than in the past because of the enlarged number of
eligible enterprises and products. Small producers of manufactured and
agricultural prod[ucts may export through trading houses with access to EDF
financing or may obtain export financing directly from the EDF under
simplified administrative procedures.
3.23      The above factors -- strong growth of exports, increased number of
exporters eligible for EDF financing, and high usage of EDF financing by
qualified exporters -- have been taken into account in the projections of EDF
resource requirements presented in Annex 2, Table 2. The projection assumes
that the recently introduced export incentives will have a significant impact



- 29 -
on the growth of exports, particularly to third countries, and that the
changes in EDF procedures, coupled with the other incentives to exporters,
will lead to a significant increase in the number of EDF users. The specific
assumptions of this projections are:
(i) manufactured exports to third markets grow at 30% p.a. in
nominal terms, and at 15% per annum to CARICOM;
(ii) non-traditional agricultural exports grow at 10% per annum;
(iii) 95% of all manufactured exports would be covered by EDF
financing; and
(iv) 25% of all non-traditional agricultural exports would be
covered by EDF financing.
Under this scenario, the EDF would require additional funding by the end of
1983 when liquid resources would fall below the amount equal to a total of
two months consecutive disbursements, which is considered necessary for
working capital of the Fund (para 4.05).



- 30 -
IV. THE LOAN
A. Borrower and Terms
4.01      The proposed loan of US$30.1 million (including capitalized
front-end fee (0.25%) of US$75,062) would be made to the Government of
Jamaica for 17 years, including four years of grace at the prevailing
standard variable interest rate (presently 10.97% p.a.). Under a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement to be signed prior to loan effectiveness, the Government would
onlend US$28 million to EDF on the same terms and conditions as the proposed
Bank loan. The balance of approximately US$2.0 million would be used by the
Government to finance technical assistance to EDF (about US$500,000), and to
support export promotion and technical assistance to export manufacturers
through JNEC and other government institutions. Of the EDF portion of the
loan, US$23 million would be added to EDF's resources for financing imports
of eligible industrial and agricultural exporters and linkage firms, and US$5
million would be used for EDF's medium-term operations of financing permanent
working capital and the equipment replacement needs. The loan documents
allow the Bank to reallocate loan components after prior consultation with
the Government, in accordance with development of demand and resource
availability for the different programs (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para 5).
B. Interest Rates and Commissions
4.02      The existing EDF structure of interest rates and commissions would
be maintained under the proposed loan, but its adequacy would be reviewed
every three months and would be adjusted in consultation with the Bank,
taking conditions on national and international money markets into account.
This was confirmed during loan negotiations. The interest rate charged to
the exporters for the short-term operations would be at least 15% p.a., and
would consist of an EDF interest rate of 11%, an administration fee of up to
2% p.a. for JECIC, and a 3% spread for the commercial banks.
4.03      The EDF medium-term subloans would be for fixed periods of one to
four years, including up to one year of grace. They will be made at 16%
p.a., consisting of EDF interest rate of 11%, JECIC's administration fee of
2% and 3% spread fDr the commercial banks. In the past, several subloans
were given for periods of less than one year, which is now inappropriate,
since the short-term loans are satisfying the exporters' financial
requirements of less than one year. Subloans would be denominated in US
dollars. The "free limit" of US$250,000 would be maintained.
4.04      The commercial banks would be required to assume the full risk for
the US dollar amounts outstanding in the exporters' accounts with the EDF.
However, they could request JECIC to provide back-up guarantee of up to 80%
of these amounts. JECIC charges a fee on the guaranteed amount corresponding



- 31 -
to an annual rate of 1% to 3%, depending on the individual subloan risk.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on both a policy for granting the
back-up guarantee and the level of the guarantee fee which would support
marginal exporters. This is reflected in EDF's revised policies and
procedures (Annex 3).
C. Disbursement and Procurement
4.05      Disbursement procedures for the short-term component of the
proposed loan are designed to prevent the creation of excess reserves, while
providing EDF with adequate liquidity. The short-term component of the
proposed loan would therefore be disbursed in tranches of US$4 million each,
whenever EDF's total undisbursed short-term resources (including the net
amounts due from BOJ)1/ would fall below an amount corresponding to EDF's
disbursements in the two prior months. This was confirmed during loan
negotiations.
4.06      Procurement under the proposed loan would follow past procedures
for IDF-type loans. Formal bidding would be impractical for the usually
small items financed under the proposed loan. Whenever feasible equipment
items will be procured on the basis of several quotations, in accordance with
standard practice for IDF-type projects.
4.07      Tranche disbursements for EDF's short-term financing of eligible
imports would be made against a statement of expenditures by EDF, evidencing
the agreed minimum liquid resource level. Documentation on all final
expenditures by EDF would be available for Bank inspection. The external
audit of the EDF would be required to cover verification of these
expenditures and supporting documents. Disbursement procedures for
medium-term financing of the permanent working capital and equipment will
follow the standard disbursement procedures. Expenditures for technical
assistance contracts under the proposed loan would require prior Bank
approval of the terms of reference, selected consultant and his contract. Up
to US$200,000 for technical assistance to EDF could be disbursed
retroactively (para 3.10). According to projections in Annex 2, it is
expected that disbursement for EDF short-term resource requirements would be
completed within two years. Disbursements for EDF medium-term credit and
technical assistance should be completed in three years. Annex 1 shows the
schedule of estimated disbursements. The relatively short disbursement
period of the proposed loan is considered realistic in view of our experience
with the past EDF loans and short-term consultant contracts envisaged under
the loan. Accordingly, the final date for submission of requests for
financing under the loan will be December 31, 1985 and the closing date for
disbursements will be December 31, 1986.
1/ Cash and short-term deposits with commercial banks, including deposit
callable on demand, and any amount due from BOJ less any amount payable
by the Fund to commercial banks, BOJ and JECIC.

D. Benefits and Risks
4.08      The main benefits anticipated from the proposed loan will result
from its supporting the projected rapid increase of manufactured and
agricultural exports. These exports are expected to rise from about US$138
million in 1982 to over US$200 million in 1985 which would not be possible
without the adequate provision of foreign exchange credit by EDF for needed
production inputs. Higher exports would create employment opportunities,
generate foreign exchange earnings and allow increased utilization of
industrial and agricultural production capacities. The medium-term component
of the proposed loan would support the on-going industrial rehabilitation
process by providing foreign exchange credit for replacing run-down
equipment. The resulting improvement of industrial efficiency and product
quality is a condition for the successful export drive. The technical
assistance component of the proposed loan will further strengthen the EDF
which would provide continued efficient service for a rapidly increasing
number of exporters. Technical assistance financed from the proposed loan
would also support the operation of other institutions serving exporters.
Effectiveness of this support can be expected to improve, as the funds
provided under the proposed loan for this purpose would help to establish a
coordinated program for export promotion of all institutions involved.
4.09      The restructuring of Jamaican industry towards increased export
production is under way and important economic policies supporting the
strengthened industrial export orientation have been initiated in January
1983. However, the speed of Jamaican economic recovery and the response of
exporters to the improved export incentives is still uncertain, and demand
for EDF short-term export financing could well be much lower than projected
for the proposed loan. Lower-than-assumed export growth would result in a
slow-down in the speed of disbursements of the proposed loan.

V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      Pursuant to the project objectives, the following agreements were
reached during loan negotiations:
(a)  With the Government on
(i) possible reallocation of EDF resources (para 4.01);
(ii)  JECIC's policies for granting back-up credit guarantees
and for the level of the guarantee fee (para 4.04);
(iii) plan for technical assistance to the export industry
(para. 3.12).
(b)  With the EDF on
(i) coverage of audit reports of EDF's operations in line
with Bank requirements (paras. 3.09 and 4.07);
(ii) revision of EDF's policies and procedures (para. 3.18);
(iii) quarterly review of interest rates and commissions
(para. 4.02);
(iv) minimum level of liquid reserves of EDF which would
permit withdrawal of funds from the proposed loan (para.
4.05);
5.02      The following will be condition to loan effectiveness:
(i) Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (para 4.01).
(ii) Full repayment of US dollar arrears by BOJ to EDF (para 3.19).
Recommendation
5.03      With the above assurances the proposed project constitute a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Government of Jamaica of US$30.1 for a
term of 17 years including four years of grace at the prevailing Bank
interest rate.

PART I
I. OBJECTIVES
Revised EDF operational procedures will go into
effect in January 1983 as part of the Government of
Jamaica's comprehensive new export development program.
This new facility represents a greatly expanded and
streamlined version of the present program.
The new procedures are intended to:
(a) assure continued availability of foreign
exchange to meet the requirements of non-
traditional exporters for import of raw
materials, intermediate goods, spare parts,
components, packaging materials, capital goods,
and other eligible products;
(b) complement other export development policies
being implemented by the Government of
Jamaica, including a system of retention of
a portion of export proceeds by exporters to
third countries and automatic import licencing
for EDF users;
(c) help assure the provision of credit to non-
traditional exporters; and
(d) strengthen the institutional infrastructure
that provides assistance and support to exporters.
The revolving feature employed in EDF's utilization
of its foreign exchange resources provides assurance to
non-traditional exporters of the continued availability of
foreign exchange to finance their necessary imports.
Availability of the foreign exchange provides additional
confidence in, and evidence of, the Government's comrmit-
ment to development of non-traditional exports. The
result is a stimulus to private sector export production
and marketing efforts, and the encouragement of subsequent
investments in market development and the plant and
equipment required to expand export capacity.

II. ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS
A.   Statutory Form
Export Development Fund Jamaica Limited (EDF) is a
separate legal entity, owned by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ)
and managed under contract by BOJ's wholly-owned subsi-
diary, Jamaica Export Credit Insurance Corporation
Limited (JECIC).
B.   Duration
EDF was legally constituted on 9th May 1979, with a
mandate to conduct business for a period of at least six
years. Such mandate is superseded by a new mandate that
the EDF shall conduct business until 30th June 1990, or
for such period as Jamaica, The World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) may jointly determine.
C.   Authority
EDF has authority to hold and manage its liquid
foreign exchange assets, to lend and borrow, to contract
in its own name, and to do all banking business necessary
in connection with the financing of imported goods for
incorporation into and production of Jamaican exports.
D.   Capitalization
EDF has an initial authorized capitalization of
$250,000 of which $200,000 was subscribed and paid by
the Bank of Jamaica.
E.   Independence of Accounts
Receipts and disbursements of the EDF shall not be
included in the totals of the Government of Jamaica budget
nor shall EDF funds be co-mingled with the funds of the
Bank of Jamaica or any other agency or institution.
The resources of the EDF shall be managed separately
from Jamaica's normal foreign exchange accounts, and the
EDF will maintain its funds in commercial bank accounts
in Jamaica and abroad in order to facilitate fund operations.



-41-                     ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 30 pages
F.   Conduct of Operations
All lending and investing operations carried out by
the EDF shall be conducted in accordance with sound busi-
ness principles. The operations of EDF will be conducted
in accordance with these General Policies and Summary
Procedures which have been approved by EDF's Board of
Directors and may be modified from time to time by EDF's
Board of Directors in agreement with international
institutions which have provided EDF's foreign exchange
resources.
G.   Board of Directors
EDF's Board of Directors is chaired by the Managing
Director of JECIC and includes three representatives of
the Bank of Jamaica, and one each from the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(through the head of the Jamaica National Export Corpora-
tion), the Ministry of Finance, the private banking sector
and the private business sector.
The Board of Directors meets in regular session in
accordance with the Articles of Association, not less
frequently than quarterly, and in special session as
called by the Chairman of the Board.
The Board has the following responsibilities:
(1) to review the activities of EDF;
(2) to rule upon policy;
(3) to approve the annual report and the projected
annual budget;
(4) to approve those individual commitments, credit
limits and transactions which involve a depar-
ture from the established policies and procedures;
(5) to provide general guidance, direction and advice
to management;
(6) to monitor export performance under EDF, dis-
cussing its broader implications and examining
other desirable government policies to stimulate
exports; and



ANNEX 3
-42-                    Page 5 of 30 pages
(7) to make recommendations to other concerned
agencies of government regarding administrative
actions which would improve EDF's effectiveness
and be helpful in the overall development effort.
The Board of Directors may appoint a committee of its
members with specific responsibilities to carry out the
actions required in item (4) above.
H.   Management
EDF is administered by JECIC under the terms of a
management contract between two parties and approved by
the Board of Directors of EDF and JECIC. JECIC, subject
to policy directions and guidance received from EDF's
Board, will manage the business of EDF in accordance
with this statement of General Policies and Operating
Procedures.
As compensation for the performance of administrative
and management services for EDF, JECIC shall receive a
management fee in the form of an agreed percentage of the
interest paid on outstanding disbursements of foreign
exchange.



ANNEX 3

III. FINANCING AVAILABLE TO EDF BENEFICIARIES
EDF currently offers two types of financing to
exporters: short-term credit financing under the Foreign
Exchange Facility, and medium-term financing of replace-
ment equipment and permanent working capital.
Operation of the Foreign Exchange Facility involves
the extension of short-term credit by EDF in foreign
exchange to EDF beneficiaries. EDF users will be expected
to sign a credit agreement agreeing to repay EDP for
foreign exchange advances made on thei  behalf.
The medium-term financing will provide foreign exchange discount
loans to exporters to finance "permanent working capital" and purchases
of replacement capital equipment. General Policies and Summary Procedures
governing the operation of the medium-term facility are contained in Part
II of this document. Medium-term sub-loans will be denominated in US dollars.



ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 30 pages
IV. QUALIFICATION OF EXPORTERS
A.   Rationale for Qualification Process
The success of the EDF program depends upon broad
distribution and maximum efficient utilization of the EDF
resources by non-traditional exporters. In order to
establish the amount of foreign exchange needed by each
exporter, which will be a strict function of projected
export proceeds, each beneficiary will be pre-qualified
for a maximum amount of foreign exchange credit from EDF.
B.   Information Required
As part of the qualification procedure, EDF will re-
quire each applicant to submit the following:
(1) an application for commitment under the EDF
which will give summary information on the
nature of the applicant's activities, the
applicant's projected exports and the record
of past exports;
(2)  an undertaking by the applicant that, if its
application is approved, it will (a) use the
proceeds of the credit solely for the purposes
stated in its application; (b) grant to EDF and
the institutions which provide loans to EDF the
right to inspect (i) the goods purchased by use
of foreign exchange loan proceeds, and (ii)
the applicant's premises and processes by which
such goods are utilized; (c) provide all infor-
mation which EDF may reasonably request in
relation to the applicant's operations and fi-
nancial condition; (d) acknowledge the right
of EDF to suspend disbursement of foreign
exchange loans if the applicant does not fulfil
its obligations as an EDF beneficiary, including
its obligation to repay in full its account with
EDF under certain circumstances; (e) purchase
and maintain insurance on the goods purchased
with credit facility proceeds, in such amount as
to assure that the loss of such goods due to the
insured risks will not impair the ability of the
applicant to fulfil the repayment requirements
of its EDF foreign exchange credit.



ANNEX 3
45 -                     Page 8 of 30 pages
The linkage company applicant will be required, in
addition, to furnish summary information on the amount
of actual imports incorporated in customers' exports,
past and projected; a summary of the projected imports by
type, and certifications of the linkage company's exporting
customers of these amounts.
C.   Types of Users
Eligible Jamaican business firms are those which can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the EDF that they are
either bona fide exporters of non-traditional manufactured
goods or direct exporters of agricultural products, or
that they are "linkage firms" engaged in the manufacture
of products used as inputs for exporters. Included as
eligible exporters are "trading companies" which export
for their own account manufactured and agricultural goods
and which purchase eligible imports for resale provided
that the import requirements of such individual producers
or companies are met.
D.   Extent to Which Users May Access EDF Foreign Exchange
Applicants awarded qualified exporter status or
qualified linkage firm status by EDF will be allocated an
amount of foreign exchange equal to the sum of:
(1) 65 percent of their projected exports to CARICOM
markets for the following year; and.
(2) 50 percent of their projected exports to third
country (non-CARICOM) markets for the following
year.
Such allocation will apply regardless of the percen-
tage of import content of the applicant's exports.
EDF will establish a revolving account for each
qualified exporter under which it will make disbursements
of foreign exchange to cover eligible imports. The
outstanding amount of these disbursements to any benefi-
ciary will not exceed at any time a specified credit
limit approved by EDF for that beneficiary, equal to 50
percent of the annual allocation of the beneficiary, ex-
cept that in the cases of first-time users of EDF such
outstanding amount will not exceed 75 percent of the first
annual allocation.



- 46 -                             ANNEX 3
Page 9 of 30 pages
Repayments by a beneficiary to EDF from export proceeds will be applied
by EDF to reduce that user's outstanding obligations within the credit limit
(with any net proceeds applied to increase the credit limit).
E.   Delinquent Accounts - Remedies of EDF
On the anniversary date of an exporter's credit agreement, the credit
limit of a beneficiary will be revised in accordance with past export
performance, as verified by the export proceeds received by the EDF. Any
third country exporter who has an outstanding and unpaid debit balance
and has not earned any export proceeds for a period of one year after the
first EDF disbursement will be required to repay his entire EDF debit
balance, using US dollars purchased in the parallel exchange market.
Similarly, CARICOM exporters will be required to repay through their
commercial banks their entire EDF foreign exchange debit balance, in Jamaican
dollars equivalent at the CARICOM rate of exchange prevailing at the
anniversary date. The commercial bank will convert the Jamaican dollars
so received into US dollars at the parallel rate of exchange. Bank of
Jamaica will make available to commercial banks the necessary Jamaican
dollar funds to cover the dlifference between the applicable parallel and
CARICOM rates of exchange.
In case of default by the exporter in making such payment or any part of
it, or in the case of the bankruptcy or insolvency of any beneficiary, the
guarantee of the commercial bank would become payable in US dollars.
In the case of a CARICOM exporter, Bank of Jamaica will provide the
necessary funds to cover the difference between the parallel and CARICOM
rates of exchange.
F.   Priority of Users
The EDF facility will operate on a "first-come-first-served" basis.
In the event the EDF does not have sufficient resources to satisfy all the
needs of eligible firms, priority in using the EDFts funds may be given to
those firms that are hard vs. soft currency earners, have the highest
Jamaican value added in their exports, the best record of past export success,
and the greatest prospects for further export growth.
G.   Qualification Procedures
The EDF will review all of the information submitted by the applicant
as specified in Chapter IV-B above and determine to its own satisfaction
that:



ANINEX 3
- 47          ~         Page 10 of 30 pages
(1)  the applicant individual exporter or trading
company exporter is current in the repayment
of principal and interest to the EDF, and is
in good standing with JECIC under other export
assistance programs; and
(2) if the applicant is a linkage firm, the precise
relationship or linkage between the applicant
and his exporter customers is disclosed, and
that the goods to be imported are indeed re-
quired for resale to the subsequent exporters.
In addition, if Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)
funds are to be used for a particular exporter, EDF shall
determine whether the applicant is eligible for use of
IADB funds; i.e., whether at least 80 percent of the voting
stock of the applicant is owned by persons who are na-
tionals of Jamaica or any of the developing countries which
are members of IADB, and whether or not such stock owner-
ship is reflected in the structure of the management of
the applicant.
H.   Denial of Qualification
Should it be determined that the applicant will not
qualify for EDF facilities, it will be so informed in a
timely manner and its application will be placed in an
inactive file.
I.   Approval of Qualification
If it is determined that the applicant has qualified
for use of EDF facilities, the applicant will be notified
of approval by issuance of a commitment letter which wil'
include the following:
(1) the maximum amount of foreign exchange which the
EDF will make available to the beneficiary during
the period of the commitment for disbursement to
purchase eligible imports, and his revolving
credit limit;
(2) an outline of the procedures to follow in
applying for each foreign exchange disbursement;
(3) the termination date of commitment, (one year
from date of issuance); and
(4) the percentages of export proceeds for servicing
EDF sub-loans.

J.   Exchange Regulations
All EDF beneficiaries will be expected to comply
with current exchange regulations of the Bank of Jamaica
which are applicable to them.
K.   Import Licences
The EDF beneficiary will receive an automatic import
licence for import items not on the restricted list.
Applications to obtain import licences for items on the
restricted 'List should identify the procurement item,
quantity to be imported and estimated price, and should
include a certification that such item(s) will be used
solely in the manufacture of specific export products.
EDF will assist the exporter in obtaining these licences.

V.  DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES
A.   General
The importer (EDF beneficiary) will order the goods
covered by EDF from the supplier and will request his
Jamaican commercial bank to make payment for the goods
on due date by using foreign exchange obtained under the
EDF facility.
B.   Disbursement of Foreign Exchange by EDF
(1) Signing of Credit Agreement with EDF
After an exporter has received a notice of
approval of qualification in the form of a commitment
letter, he will execute a credit agreement along with his
coramercial bank, JECIC, and EDF. The credit agreement
will provide, in summary, that EDF will disburse foreign
exchange to pal for imports of the beneficiary up to a
specified maximum amount, or annual allocation; that not
more than 50 percent of the allocation (the credit limit)
will be outstanding at any time, except that in the cases
of first-time users of EDF, such outstanding amounts will
not exceed 75 percent of the first annual allocation;
that the commercial bank will guarantee repayment of the
amount disbursed; and that repayment will be made out of
65 percent of CARICOM export sales receipts and 50 percent
of third country export sales receipts, and in the case
of linkage companies, in U.S. dollars.
(2) Interest Rate on Outstanding Balances
The interest rate on outstanding debit balances
expressed in foreing exchange will be established initially
at a level of 15 to 16 percent per annum as determined by
EDF. This rate will be reviewed by JECIC every ninetv davs
in consultation with the World Bank and IADB, and will be
adjusted if conditions in the capital market so warrant.
(3) Credit Risk Under Foreign Exchange Credit Facility
The risk of commercial default by the exporter
(borrower) will be borne by the respectivc guarantors (see
Section VIII C).



-50 -                     ANNEX 3
Page 13 of 30 pages
(4) Exchange Risk under Foreign Exchange Credit Facility
The exchange risk inherent in the obligation to repay
foreign exchange to EDF at a latter date, due to variations in
the corresponding rates of exchange (CARICOM rate for CARICOM
exporters or the parallel rate for third country exporters) between
due dates and. pavment dates, shall be the risk of the exporter
receiving the foreign exchange from EDF (Section IV.E).
(5) Commercial. Bank Share of Interest Paid under Credit Agreements
In recognition of the commercial bank's risk assumption and
its administration of the credit, the bank shall receive in Jamaican
dollars, a fee eqcual to three percent per annum of the Jamaican dollar
equivalent at the corresponding rate of exchange (CARICOII rate for
CARICOM exports or the parallel rate for third country exports), of
the total outstanding balances under the credit agreement to be paid
out of interest paid bv the beneficiary to EDF.
(6) Disbursement of Foreign Exchange by Commercial
Bank
Upon due date of payment to the foreign supplier,
the exporter's commercial bank shall arrange for payment of
the supplier from its foreign currency account.
(7)  EDF Reimbursement of Commercial Bank Disbursements
When the foreign supplier has been paid, the
commercial bank will furnish EDP with:
(i)   a copy of the purchase order or pro-forma
invoice;
(ii)  telegraphic or other evidence of (a)
shipment made to the Jamaican beneficiary
(b) payment to the foreign supplier.
EDF will reimburse the commercial bank in U.S. dollars
for the amount of its disbursement, which shall not exceed
the amount of foreign exchange used by the commercial
bank to pay the supplier and to pay reasonable bank and
transfer fees related to the payment to the supplier.
Final invoice, bill of lading and evidence of payment will
be retained by the commercial bank to be available for
inspection by EDF upon request.  The amount so reimbursed
will be charged to the beneficiary's account and will
reduce the amount available under beneficiary's credit
limit.

VI. REPAYMENT AND REPLENISHMENT PROCEDURES
A.   General
It is essential, for continued access of a benefi-
ciary to EDF facilities, that balances due to the EDF
be repaid in foreign exchange either from the proceeds
of exports of the beneficiary, or, if such exports do
not produce sufficient foreign exchange receipts, from
foreign exchange obtained in the parallel market. Ex-
porters who fail to generate or obtain foreign exchange
to replenish EDF will be denied further access beyond
their initial credit limit. The agreed portion (50 per-
cent or 65 percent) of foreign exchange received from
export sales will be used to first repay interest, and
then principal on the beneficiary's outstanding debit
balance.
In the event export proceeds are received by an exporter and
surrendered to EDF by his commercial banks, when his debit balance
is less than the amounts surrendered the resulting credit balance
in favor of the exporter may be at his option be retained in foreign
exchange on an, interest beariug_basis to be agreAd un-T  __n _
EDF and the exporters, or sold to the Bank of Jamaica at the
corresponding rate of exchange (CARICOM rate for CARICOM exports
or official rate for third country exports).
B.   Collection of Export Proceeds
All receipts of foreign exchange in payment- for
exports of an exporter must be collected through the
facilities of the exporter's commercial bank in Jamaica.
To accomplish this, upon delivery of an export shipment
to an ocean freight carrier or to an air ftreight agent by
an EDF exporter utilizing the EDF facility, the documents
received by the EDF exporter (e.g., dock receipts, or
board bill of lading) must be delivered immediately by
the exporter to the Jamaican commercial bank which has
provided access to EDF foreign exchange for the exporter,
for collection of the foreign exchange receivable in
accordance with the terms of sale arranged by the exporter
with the foreign buyer.
The receivable resulting from an export by an EDF
exporter utilizing the EDF facility may be discounted
only by the Jamaican commercial bank which has provided
access to EDF for the exporter.

C.   Procedures for Repayment of Disbursements Under
Credit Agreements
(1) Third Country Currency Export Proceeds
All third country currency foreign exchange
received by a Jamaican commercial bank in payment of
obligations of foreign buyers for export shipments made
by a client EDF exporter shall be applied by the
commercial bank as follows:
Fifty (50) percent of such receipts shall be paid
by the commercial bank to EDF on behalf of its exporter
client to discharge indebtedness created by disbursement
under the Credit Facility. All amounts so received by
EDF shall be applied in the following priority:
(i) accrued interest, including the JECIC
administration fee, on the exporter's
credit balance; and
(ii)  principal on the credit balance.
(2) CARICOM Currency Export Proceeds
On receipt of export proceeds, at the CARICOM rate of exchange,
the commercial banks are required to apply 65% of such receipts towards
the purchase of US dollars in the parallel market. The amount of
US dollars to be so purchased is to be determined by applying the
CARICOM rate of exchange for US dollars. The commercial bank shall
then make a claim on the Bank of Jamaica for any amount in Jamaican
dollars required to offset the difference between the parallel
market rate of exchange and the CARICOM rate of exchange actually
applied to the export proceeds.
(3) Repayment of Foreign Exchange to EDF by Linkage Companies
Linkage firms which utilize EDF's credit facility shall rcpay
EDF disbursements in U.S. dollars at the expiration of the term set
in the credit: agreement for individual disbursements to be obtained
in the parallel market.

VII. FINANCING
A.   Sources of Funds
(1)  World Bank Loan
The initial and major source of EDF's resources
for its short-term facilities are loans aggregating
US$66 million from the World Bank to the Government of
Jamaica, the proceeds of which were passed on to the EDF
as long-term loans with appropriate subordination and
standby provisions.
(2) Co-Financing
The Inter-American Development Bank extended a
long-term loan of US$7.5 million to the Government of
Jamaica, the proceeds of which were passed along under a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement to supplement funds available
from the World Bank.  This loan is used only for dis-
bursements under the Foreign Exchange Credit Facility.
(3) Interest and Fee Earnings
EDF resources provided by World Bank and IADB
loans will be augmented on a regular basis by the amounts
of commitment fees, interest earned on sub-loans and on
Jamaican dollar deposits, less the spread payable to the
commercial banks and the administration fee payable to
JECIC.
(4) Short-Term Commercial Bank Bridge Financing
In order to assure its foreign exchange liqui-
dity at all times, a bridge financing of US$5 million
was arranged by EDF with the Royal Bank of Canada. Ad-
vances under this line of credit are repaid within
forty-five days by EDF, using moneys received from World
Bank and IADB reimbursements. The bridge financing
bears interest at not more than 1-1/2 percent above New
York prime.
B.   Maintenance of Adequate Balances
EDF shall be managed so that foreign exchange
assets available from first tranche lenders and from sub-
sequent replenishments are always adequate both in amount
and time of availability to meet scheduled disbursements
of funds and repayment requirements. Sufficient balances



ANNEX 3
- 54 -                    Page 17 of 30 pages
will be maintained within the EDF at all times to
sustain the full confidence of lenders, suppliers, and
EDF beneficiaries that foreign exchange will be avail-
able to pay for the import needs of qualified non-tradi-
tional exporters.
C.   Assets Management
JECIC has undertaken a program of sound management
of the EDF's liquid assets. Such assets not required
for immediate use shall be invested in short-term
interest-bearing obligations in foreign currency with
maturities which will match scheduled reauirements for
normal EDF operations. As general criteria, liquid
assets will be invested in securities which have a
high degree of assurance of repayment, which will pro-
tect against the erosion of value because of exchange
fluctuations, and which bear a good rate of return.
Professional fund managers in major capital markets
will be consulted by EDF administrators for suggestions
on appropriate security vehicles, or for assistance in
actual management of liquid asset balances.

VIII. OBLIGATIONS OF BANK OF JAMAICA
A.   General
Bank of Jamaica is the parent company of both EDF
and JECIC. Its obligations in connection with the EDF
and the activities of JECIC related to EDF are of two
types, conversion of foreign exchange and making
available funds to cover losses.
B.    Obligations in Relation to Conversions
In order to assure swift replenishment and smooth operation
of EDF, the Bank of Jamaica will undertake to:
(1) Make available to commercial banks, at the date of receipt
by commercial banks of export receipts resulting from
exports by an Eligible Enterprise to the CARICOM Market,
any amount in Jamaican dollars required by the commercial
banks to offset the difference between (i) the Parallel
Market Rate of Exchange used by the Commercial Banks to
convert such export receipts into dollars, and (ii) the
CARICOM Rate of Exchange actually applied to the export
operation which shall have generated such export receipts.
(2) Convert within thirty (30) days to US dollars, Jamaican
currency tendered to EDF by commercial banks and by
JECIC in satisfaction of their guarantees of obligations
of exporters to EDF which are in default.
(3) Convert immediately to Jamaican currency foreign exchange
sold by EDF for beneficiaries with balances in their
favor and who have elected to do so.
C.    Obligation in Relation to Losses
(a) Under JECIC Guarantee Scheme
In order to induce JECIC to guarantee under its Guarantee
Scheme, the Bank of Jamaica, to the extent and in the manner permitted
by the Bank of Jamaica Act, will undertake to make funds available
to JECIC to replace losses under this program. In consideration for
this cover, JECIC will pay Bank of Jamaica 20 percent of all fees
received under JECIC's guarantee to the EDF.
(b) Under Commercial Banks' Guarantee with respect to
CARICOM exporters
BOJ shall provide to any commercial bank or to JECIC upon
demand any amount in Jamaican dollars required to offset the difference
between (i) the CARICOM Rate of Exchange, and (ii) the Parallel Market
Rate of Exchange applicable to purchases of dollars made by such
commercial bank or JECIC for the purpose of repayment of sub-laons
to EDF.



-56-                      ANNEX 3
Page 19 of 30 pages
IX. JECIC GUARANTEE SCHEME
If the commercial bank is unwilling to take all
of the credit risk on EDF advances to its client, but
believes that JECIC might make a finding of reasonable
assurance of repayment under less stringent credit
criteria, the commercial bank may apply directly to
JECIC to provide a JECIC guarantee to EDF to a maximum
of 80 percent of the credit limit.
The commercial bank will pay a fee to JECIC equal
to from one to three percent of the principal amount
guaranteed by JECIC, depending upon JECIC's assessment of
risk factors and related assurance of repayment. The fee
will be Dayable to JECIC at the time of the first disburse-
ment under the EDF credit. On a case-by-case basis, JECIC
may require collateral which they deem to be necessary and
desirable.

PART II. The Medium-Term Financing Program
PREAMBLE
The medium-term financing program (hereinafter
referred to as "EDF-MT") will provide assurance to non-
traditional exporters and their domestic suppliers of the
continued availability of foreign exchange needed for the
following purposes:
a) that needed to purchase imports of essential
replacement equipment; and
b) that needed for permanent working capital purposes
meaning initial stocking of raw materials, supplies,
and spare parts or the increase in such stock
needed to attain the production level commensurate
with installed capacity.
An additional dimension of the new medium-term
facility is that it will assure the availability of
higher levels of inventories of essential imported
raw materials and components and this will support
higher production levels of Jamaican exporters' products.
The institution and operation of this medium-term financing
program should provide additional confidence in and evidence
of the Government's commitment to development of Jamaica's
non-traditional exports. The medium-term resources consist
of US$10 million under World Bank Loan 1978 JM and additional
resources of US$5 million to be made available under a new
World Bank Loan (third EDF project).

Page 21 of 30 pages
I. QUALI-FICATION OF EXPORTERS FOR MEDIUM-TERM
FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCING
A. Rational f.or Qualification Process
The success of EDF's medium-term financing program
will depend upon broad distribution and maximum efficiency
of utilization of the resources made available to EDF.
To enable EDF to establish the amount and terms of
foreign exchange credit needed by each exporter, the
types and quantities of goods required, and to assure
that acquisiti.on of such goods will contribute to the
expansion of Jamaica's export trade, each applicant for
EDF-MT assistance must. be qualified to utilize EDF's
short-term program, regardless of the extent to which the
EDF short-term facilities are in fact utilized by the
applicant simultaneously with his proposed use of the
medium-term assistance. Quialified applicants are those
whose established record of export performance, whose
plans for future performance, and whose financial,
managerial, and technical capabilities as detailed in
their applications for qualification have been measured
and, as a result, have been granted "Qualified Exporter"
status by EDF for access to EDF short-term program
facilities.
B.  Information Required to Attain Qualified Exporter Status
The information required of applicants is summarized
in Export Development Fund's Operating Policies and Summary
Procedures for Short-Term Financing, which policies and
procedures are incorporated herein by reference. Applicants
for medium-term equipment and permanent working capital
financing who are not currently Qualified Exporters under
EDF's Short-Term Program may apply to EDF for such status
in the maniner described in the Operating Policies and
Summary of Procedures for Short-Term Financing. When
granted Qualified Exporter status by EDF, the applicant
should then proceed to apply for the desired medium-term
financing as explained hereinafter.
C. Information Required in Application for EDF-MT Assistance
In order to utilize EDF's medium-term facilities, the
exporter must obtain a sub-loan from his commercial bank



ANEX 3
_ 59                       Page 22 of 30 pages
in US dollars. Applicants will complete the Medium-Term
Sub-Loan Application (Form EDF-MT-001) in which they will
submit directly to their Jamaican commercial bank information
regarding tl-le following:
(a) Amount and terms of financing requested.
(b) Details on the sources, uses, and character
of the new equipment to be purchased.
(c) Associated capital costs of purchasing the new
equipment and how these will be financed.
(d) Associated current costs of operating the
new equipment.
(e) Expected changes in export sales arising from
use of the new equipment.
(f) Expected changes in capacity, utilization, and
employment arising from use of the new equipment.
If the application concerns only permanent working
capital financing, it must be limited to 25 percent of
the reasonably projected initial or increased annual
export sales. Applications for permanent working capital
financing should be accompanied by detailed sales forecasts
and financial information demonstrating that expected
increases in export sales are realistic.
D. Application Appraisal - Medium-Term Equipment Sub-Loans
Essential procedures of appraisal of an application
for financing of capital equipment will assure, among other
matters, that:
1.  The applicant (borrower) (a) is a qualified beneficiary
in good standing under the EDF-ST program for foreign
exchange financing of imports of raw materials, replace-
ment equipment, and spare parts; and (b) has and will
have the financial capability to discharge the medium-
term sub-loan being applied for in accordance with
its terms and conditions.
2.  The equipment to be purchased with EDF-MT program
financing is intended to be installed in an existing
production process.
3.  The equipment to be purchased with EDF-MT program
financing is to be used to break existing production



ANNEX 3
Page 23 of 30 pages
bottlenecks, increase efficiency of the existing
process, produce an input that is currently purchased
from others, or to allow the applicant, if an exporter,
to improve quality and meet new product standards in
overseas markets, or for similar purposes.
4.  A reasonable proportion of the manufactured output
from utilization of the equipment to be purchased
with EDF assistance will be exported (or sold to
Jamaican exporters for incorporation into goods
manufactured for export).
5.  The applicant, if an exporter, has furnished its
projections of export sales receipts over the term
of the proposed medium-term credit which, upon
examination and analysis, appear credible and indicate
the reasonable likelihood that sufficient revenues
will be earned by the exporter, through its sales
of products in the international market to service
on a timely basis without dependence upon other
resources of the applicant, the obligations it
has undertaken and proposes to undertake for
discharge of sub-loan notes under both the short-
term and medium-term programs of EDF.
6.  The applicant, if a linkage-type beneficiary, has
furnished projections of sales to Jamaican exporters
and verified by such exporters over the terms of
the proposed medium credit which, upon examination
and analysis, appear credible and indicate a reasonable
likelihood that sufficient revenue will be earned by
the applicant from such sales to service, without
dependence upon other resources of the applicant,
the obligations it has undertaken and proposes to
undertake for discharge of the loans made by EDF
under both the EDF short-term and EDF medium-term
programs.
E. Application Appraisal - Medium-Term Working Capital Sub-Loans
Essential procedures of the appraisal of an application
for a medium-term sub-loan for financing of working capital
will assure that:
1. The applicant (borrower) is a qualified beneficiary
in good standing under the EDF-ST program for
foreign exchange financing of imports of raw
materials, intermediate goods, and spare parts.
2. The raw materials, intermediate goods, and spare
parts intended to be purchased with EDF-MT financing



ANNEX 3
- 61                     Page 24 of 30 pages
are needed to enable the applicant, if an exporter,
to support a projected increase in exports and sales,
or if the applicant is a "linkage type" company,
to support a projected increase in sales to other
Jamaican entities which will incorporate such
products into products which are to be exported.
3.  The total amount of medium-term working capital
financing approved for any exporter-applicant does
not exceed 25 percent of the anplicant's reasonable
projected initial or increased annual export sales.  (If
applicant is a linkage company, an essential procedure
will be to assure that the amount approved does not
exceed 25 percent of the applicant's reasonable
projections of projected initial or increased annual
sales to exporters who can be expected to incorporate
these products into products which are to be exported.)
F. Approval of Applications
1. Submission of Application to EDF
If the commercial bank of the applicant is prepared
to grant to the applicant the sub-loan requested in the
form MT-OO], it will forward the application, with all
attachments, to EDF, with (a) a statement of its willingness
to grant the sub-loan; (b) the terms and conditions of
the loan the bank is prepared to grant; and (c) its request
for EDF's commitment.
2. EDF Consideration of Commercial Bank's Request
for Commitment
Upon receiving the Request for EDF's Commitment, EDF
will review the application of the exporter received from
the commercial bank. EDF will appraise the proposal
using the procedures specified in Paragraphs D and E above
and will ascertain that adequate funds are available to
discount the note and that the supplier is in a World
Bank member country or in Switzerland or Taiwan. If EDF,
after such appraisal, gives its approval to the request
for commitment, it will forward a Request for Approval to
       World Bank, along with the following:
(1) The text of all terms and conditions which the
commercial bank and EDP propose in connection
with the granting of the loan and discounting
of the note respectively.
(2) Description of the borrower.
(3) Description of the borrower's business, and
analysis of principal factors affecting the

(4) Description of the goods to be purchased and
how they are to be used in the borrower's
business.
(5) Description of the procedures to be followed
in the procurement of the goods to be purchased;

of approval by EDF's Loan Committee or Board
of Directors, as appropriate.
(8) Such additional information regarding the
transaction as World Bank may reasonably
request.
3. World Bank Action on EDF's Request for World Bank Approval
When World Bank has completed its consideration of EDF's
request for World Bank approval of a sub-loan, as outlined
above, it will inform EDF by the most expeditious and feasible
manner or communication, indicating either (a) approval
of the proposal, with or without stated exceptions, or
(b) disapproval, with reasons therefore.
4. EDF's Issuance of Commitment
When World Bank has informed EDF of its approval of
a sub-loan request, EDF will issue to the commercial bank
its commitment.
5. Commercial Bank Notice to Applicant of Approval by EDF
When the commercial bank is furnished with the commitment,
it will so inform the beneficiary (borrower) and inform the
borrower of procedure for consummating the sub-loan transaction.
6. EDF's Commitment
EDF's commitment, in addition to stating the amount in
US dollars, shall state the expiry date of the commitment,
the terms of the sub-loan, as well as the goods to be
imported and to paid for by use of the loan proceeds. A
one-time commitment fee equal to 1 percent of the committed

ANNEX 3
-63 -                    Page 26 of 30 pages
the commitment date.  The fee shall be payable by the
commercial bank in Jamaican dollars at the prevailing
parallel market rate* at the date of EDF's commitment.
G. Limitations on Approvals
1. Limitations on Frequency of Applications for
Medium-Term Assistance
It will be EDF's policy to encourage participants
to submit only one application per company for EDF medium-
term assistance in any period of twelve consecutive months.
Exceptions to application of this policy will be considered
by EDF only upon justification it considers adequate,
such as, for example, sudden and unforeseen breakdown of
essential production machinery for which no feasible
alternative exists other than immediate acquisition of
replacement machinery.
2. Limitations on Amount of EDF Medium-Term Assistance
Per Applicant
The limitation of EDF's resources for use in the
medium-term program will normally limit outstanding balances
to US$1,000,000 for any one beneficiary.
*The parallel market rate is the arithmetic average of
the last closing selling rate of exchange of the US dollar
published by commercial banks under the parallel market.

II. DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES
A. General
Disbursements on approved loans will be made after
the commercial bank has received and submitted to EDF a
properly signed and approved agreement for the full amount
of the loan.
EDF, at the request of the commercial bank, will
disburse funds in either one of two ways:  (a) by
reimbursing the Jamaican commercial bank for money
paid on the borrower's behalf to an overseas supplier,
or (b) for purchases over US$50,000 by arranging for
World Bank to guarantee reimbursement to an overseas
bank for payments made to the overseas supplier under
an approved letter of credit.
B. Reimbursement Procedure
Upon Option "(a)", the Jamaican commercial bank will
arrange for payment directly to the overseas supplier upon
shipment of the related goods and delivery of the related
documents to its correspondent bank.  The Jamaican comrmercial
bank must receive the original supplier's invoice, or a
legible copy thereof, which is to be submitted to EDF,
together with Form EDF-011-MT (Banker's Report of Payment
and Request for Reimbursement). EDF will reimburse the
Jamaican commercial bank or its approved designee within
five (5) working days of receipt of the request for reimbursement.
C. Letters of Credit Procedure
If it wishes to use the guaranteed letter of credit
procedure under Option "(b)", the Jamaican commercial bank
will draw up a proposed letter of credit for the overseas
supplier well in advance of proposed shipment, and submit
it to EDF, together with Form EDF-OllA-MT and a copy of
the contract or purchase order. In return for a letter
of credit fee of 14 of 1 percent, EDF will arrange for
the World Bank to issue a written agreement to the issuing,
advising, or confirming bank in the supplier's country,
confirming that World Bank will reimburse that bank promptly
for payments made to the supplier under the letter of credit.
Amendments to letters of credit may also be made by applying
to EDF, which will forward advice of requested changes to
the World Bank, which in turn will notify the issuing,
advising, or confirming bank of its continued willingness
to provide reimbursements under the revised letter of credit.

Page 28 of 30 pages
D. World Bank Disbursement
Simultaneously with any disbursement by EDP, under
Option "(a)" a withdrawal application will be made to
World Bank by EDF using World Bank Application for Reim-
bursement, Procedure 1, Form 1, and the related Statement
of Expenditure, Procedure 1, Form 1C. Documents listed
above in Paragraph B, Reimbursement Procedure will be held
by EDF for post-audit by the World Bank. Upon receipt
of the withdrawal application, World Bank will reimburse
EDF in US dollars for the amount disbursed by EDF. If
Bridge Financing funds were used, they will then be
repaid using the World Bank loan proceeds.

Page 29 of 30 pages
III. REPAYMENT OF MT LOANS
A. General
Loans under the EDF medium-term facility will be
installment loans denominated in US dollars.
B. Repayment Terms
Loans will have a term not in excess of four years,
including up to a one-year grace period on payment
of principal. Payment of loans will be made in US
dollars in equal quarterly or semi-annual installments
of principal plus accrued interest to the date of
payment.
C. Credit Risk
The responsibility for making all required payrnents
promptly to the EDF shall be assumed by the commercial
bank. In case of default, payments to the EDF shall be
assumed by the commercial bank and JECIC as established
by the guarantee arrangements for that loan. A loan
shall be considered in default whenever any installment
remains unpaid to EDF for a period of six months.
D. Interest Rate Policy
The EDF-MT loan interest rate initially shall be
16 percent per annum, of which 3 percent shall go to the
commercial bank for administration and risk-taking,
2 percent to JECIC for administration, and 11 percent
to the EDF. Al:L payments of interest shall be in
US dollars. AlL EDF interest rates will be reviewed
every three mon-ths in consultation with World Bank,
and will be adjusted to apply to all new commitments
if conditions in the international capital market so
warrant.
E. Prepayment Conditions
The EDF-MT loans will contain conditions which will
apply to any prepayment. The conditions will specify
the minimum amouint of prepayment, a notice of intent
to prepay, and a variab:Le prepayment penalty, the
amount of which will depend upon the date of prepayment.

IV. JECIC GUARANTEE PROGRAM
A. Rationale
It may be difficult or impossible for some Jamaican
firms who have been granted provisional access to the EDF
to arrange the necessary sub-loans. In order to assure
the broadest possible utilization of the EDF, even for
firms which appear marginally creditworthy, but, nonetheless,
in the opinion of JECIC, offer a reasonable assurance of
repavment, JECIC will consider extending a direct guarantee
to EDF up to a limit of 80 percent of the loans made by EDF.
B. Guarantee Fee
The commercial bank shall pay a fee to JECIC ranging
from 1-3 percent per annum of the princ.ipal amount guaranteed
by JECIC to EDF depending upon JECIC's assessment of risk
factor. The fee shall be paid to JECIC by the commercial
bank on the same schedule that principal and interest on
the guaranteed loan are payable to EDE.
