3. Program Description

3.a. concise description of the overall program, citing any changes since the previous operation

3.a.1    After achieving Independence on May 20, 2002, the Government of Timor-Leste faced the challenges
of nation-building with very limited human resources, embryonic institutions, a stagnant economy, and high
levels of poverty and unemployment. The National Development Plan (NDP), prepared shortly before
Independence, outlined the Government's development and poverty reduction objectives. A Stability Program,
announced in January 2003, served as a guide to the FY2004 planning and budgeting exercise, highlighting the
areas of the NDP which the Government considered its immediate priorities.

3.a.2    The Transition Support Program (TSP) provides a framework for multi-donor budgetary support to the
implementation of the NDP, mobilizing additional resources for core poverty reduction and governance
programs in the lean years before substantial oil and gas revenues come on stream. TSP financing covered about
40 percent of the Government's Consolidated Fund expenditures in FY2004. The Bank's contribution of
approximately US$4.1 million leveraged approximately US$32 million in co-financing from 10 bilateral
development partners, of which US$29 million was channeled through World Bank administered Trust Funds.
All development partners have played an active role in program preparation and monitoring. TSP has supported
the Government's internal planning process, serving as a framework for identifying key priorities for the year
ahead and monitoring progress. In contrast to the first TSP for FY2003 (which was prepared immediately
before Independence when the Government did yet have detailed annual work plans), the annual program for
FY2004 was based on the line agencies internal annual action plans. At the Government's suggestion, actions
have been tied to technical assistance support where necessary, facilitating the Government's coordination of
external assistance.

3.a.3    Initially, three annual TSP operations were foreseen, covering the period FY2003 to FY2005. In
December 2003, the Government requested that the International Development Association (IDA) schedule two
further TSP operations in FY2006 and FY2007, in anticipation of a delay in the flow of oil and gas revenues.
More recent projections point to a significant increase in oil and gas revenues. The Government has indicated
that it still wishes the TSP process to continue, regardless of the financing requirements, because the TSP
process is seen as fulfilling three critical functions: (i) capacity building in identifying yearly priorities and
monitoring progress; (ii) providing oversight in an environment where the oversight institutions are still weak;
and (iii) enhancing donor coordination.

3.b. brief description of the operation and its relationship to the program (with attribution to the Bank's
operation where it can be established)

3.b.1 Financing for each TSP is agreed on the basis of an annual program laid out in the Government's Letter
of Development Policy and Action Matrix. These actions constitute a sub-set of the activities presented in the
Government's internal annual action plans, prepared by all agencies as part of the annual planning and budget
process. The sub-set reflects both Government's and partner donors' appreciation of policy and operational
priorities for the year ahead. IDA provides support to and monitors those activities within the annual Transition
Support Program as consistent with its institutional mandate. Activities related to the strengthening of the
national police are supported and monitored by bilateral TSP partners.

3.b.2    The first TSP (FY2003) focused on the creation of the institutions, establishment of the legislative and
regulatory framework, and strengthening of management systems for core government functions. TSP II
(FY2004) covered three thematic areas, reflecting NDP and Stability Program priorities: Good Governance,
including: strengthening State institutions, public sector management and public expenditure management; and
strengthening administrative capacity in the justice sector; Service Delivery for Poverty Reduction, particularly
improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness in the health and education sectors; and Job Creation,
especially through private sector development and agriculture.

3.b.3    In line with the programmatic approach, TSP II is assessed on progress in key policy actions,
summarized Table 1.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

brief description of the achievements of the loan/credit, supported by a table derived from program matrices
comparing the achievements of the operation against the operation's stated objectives (including the
achievement of the triggers, the current status of the program, and status of the next planned operation).

4.1   The Government's first and second Transition Support Programs were intentionally ambitious both in the
range and number of actions and timing of milestones. While this approach obviously entailed the risk that
some programmed actions would not be completed, the annual TSP provided Government with a framework for
coordinating and monitoring its overall program. It also served as a framework for harmonizing external
partners' support around the Government program.

4.2   Broad progress has been made in the implementation of the actions identified under TSP II (FY2004).
During the first half of the operation, progress was slowest in the area of governance, particularly as regards the
establishment of oversight and internal control mechanisms. However, the critical actions ­ passage of the
Public Service Statute and the Organic Law of the Provedor ­ were completed in the third quarter. There have
been significant delays in the preparation of legislation across the program. Concerns have been raised
regarding proposed legislation on private sector investment, which diverges from international best practice in
terms of treatment of tax incentives and international investors.               Progress in the preparation of policy
frameworks for education and agriculture has also been slower than anticipated, with agriculture policy
approval in the first quarter of FY2005 and the education policy still awaiting approval when TSP II closed. Of
particular concern has been the slow pace of capacity building and institutional development. The proposed
design and implementation of a HR development strategy for the Ministry of Planning and Finance did not take

place. This action has now been rescheduled to TSP III and will be linked to the development of a multi-donor
capacity building project.

4.3    Within the broad program presented by Government for TSP II (FY2004), the Staff Assessment in the
Program Document identified eight actions that were considered important to the achievement of the program's
development objectives and laying the foundations of the TSP III (FY2005). Five of these actions were
completed by the end of FY2004 (a to e below), and a further two actions partially completed (f and g below):

       a) Establishment of an independent oversight function through the approval of the Statutes of
           Ombudsman (Provedor de Direitos Humanos e Justiça).

       b) The Recipient has promulgated the Public Service Statute, including a framework for management
           systems and disciplinary procedures.

       c) The Recipient has prepared the FY2005 Annual Action Plan and presented the FY2005 Budget to
           Parliament.

       d) The Superior Council of the Judiciary, created by Law 8/2002, has been established and has initiated
           its functions.

       e) The Recipient's Ministry of Health has established annual district health plans as a routine tool for
           decentralized management of health services. The Recipient's Ministry of Education, Culture, Youth
           and Sport has developed a pilot program in decentralized financial management by schools and parent
           teacher associations.

       f) The Recipient has approved the policy framework for the agricultural sector (education policy
           framework under review by the Council of Ministers).

       g) The Recipient has promulgated the law on commercial entities to promote private sector development
           (law on investment under review by the Council of Ministers).

4.5   The next operation, TSP III (FY2005), was approved by the Board on October 28, 2004. TSP III supports
implementation of the National Development Plan in the areas of: (i) Good Governance, including the
establishment of oversight institutions and arrangements, public sector and public expenditure management, and
improvements in administrative capacity in the justice sector; (ii) Service Delivery for Poverty Reduction,
particularly improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the health and education sectors; and (iii) Job
Creation, especially through private sector development, including agriculture, and improvements in basic
infrastructure.

5.    Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

concise discussion of any major issues of design, implementation, or political/economic context (positive or
negative) that may have arisen and could affect program results.

5.1      The program supported under TSP II sought to build on the solid foundation of legislative and
institutional development achieved under TSP I and the Government's own program as laid out in the National
Development Plan and Stability Program. Most of the TSP II actions were drawn from agencies' annual action
plans, prepared before the appraisal mission. In some cases, the annual work plans were adjusted at TSP II
appraisal, following discussions with Ministry of Planning and Finance and TSP partners. All the actions
identified were within government control and monitored regularly through Quarterly Reporting Matrices.
Significant progress was made in most areas of the program and, where progress was slower than anticipated,
the Government has identified and sought to address the causes of delays. Where progress was slower than
anticipated, actions were rescheduled or redefined during the first progress mission (in November 2003) or
transferred to TSP III during the second progress mission (in May 2004).

5.2      Capacity constraints are acute throughout the public sector in Timor-Leste, with a shortage of qualified
and experienced personnel suitable for senior posts, particularly in areas such as financial management. In some
cases, technical assistance provided by bilateral partners has played a critical role in ensuring quality and
timeliness of outputs, for example in the area of land legislation and registration. In other cases, the quality of
technical support has been poor and there have been shortages of expatriate personnel with relevant in-line
management experience. The need for a more coherent, long-term approach to capacity building is recognized
in TSP III. The TSP II matrix identifies the short-term technical assistance inputs required to support the
implementation of actions. Delays in mobilization of this assistance occasionally resulted in delays in
implementation.

5.3      Low levels of budget execution were symptomatic of management weaknesses and lack of
understanding of routine procedures in some line agencies. Inevitably this has impacted on the delivery of
services, notably in education and roads. The Government established a commission, under the Prime
Minister's Office with representation from key agencies, in April 2004, to address issues of budget execution
and oversight. In the case of the community-based road maintenance program, stalled as a result of a
reallocation of funds, the Government has taken steps to reactivate this program.

5.4      The legislative program for FY2004 was extremely ambitious. Legislative processing was hampered by
lack of a clearly defined policy and legislative process within the executive, and lack of scheduling and
management tools to help prioritize processing. Legislation that was not completed under TSP II has been
rescheduled under TSP III.


6.    Bank and Borrower Performance

short description of salient points including compliance with relevant Bank environmental and business
policies. Note whether OP4.01 applies.




                                                       9

6.1     Bank performance. The Bank has effectively supported the Government's program through continued
dialogue with the authorities, timely responses to their requests for technical and implementation assistance, and
close monitoring of the TSP. The Bank has undertaken significant analytical work to underpin the TSP II,
including a Public Expenditure Review, Country Procurement Assessment, and issues papers prepared prior to
TSP II progress missions, first on expenditure policy and management, and second on governance. The
preparation of issues papers on salient topics has improved the quality of dialogue by helping to focus the
attention of Government and development partners on key program design and implementation issues.

6.2     The TSP is relatively unique in pursuing a results-based approach in the context of a post-conflict, low-
capacity country. Both the Government and development partners have praised the process of TSP preparation
and supervision for its focus on building capacity, providing oversight in an environment where the local
oversight institutions are weak, and emphasizing coordination with development partners. The Bank's role in
administering TSP helps the Government coordinate program design and implementation with other
development partners. External partners have played an active role, not just in program design and monitoring,
but also in ensuring that Government agencies have access to the technical support needed to implement the
program. Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory.

6.3     Recipient performance. The Government of Timor-Leste has taken the lead in the preparation and
supervision of TSP II. The program is based on activities identified in Government agencies' annual action
plans. The Government monitored the program as part of its regular Quarterly Reporting Matrix, provided
timely and comprehensive reports on program implementation and proved highly responsive to the Bank's
request for additional information on the progress of program activities. Recipient commitment to program
implementation was strong. Overall Recipient performance is assessed as satisfactory.

6.4     OP 4.01 does not apply.

7.      Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

7.1     Focusing on systems performance by making greater use of quantitative performance indicators. The
development of sector management information systems permits a gradual shift away from milestones towards
performance indicators. The health sector program is already formulated in this way, using a mixture of
coverage and expenditure allocation indicators. The TSP III program includes management system and service
delivery performance indicators for key sectors. Where feasible the definition of output and outcome indicators
has been based on the national Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This has implications for the design of
future programs. TSP I and TSP II focused on putting in place institutions, the policy and regulatory framework
and systems. While some work still has to be done in these areas, and administrative systems will only
gradually become capable of producing these indicators, the priority has shifted toward making these systems
work effectively. This calls for greater emphasis on performance measurement, using internal administrative
indicators to determine whether public services are being delivered effectively.

7.2     Introducing a medium-term perspective. Both TSP I (FY2003) and TSP II (FY2004) were prepared and
implemented as rolling annual programs. Recent work on sector policies, Sector Investment Programs (SIPs)
and the formulation of national MDG targets and indicators has allowed the Government to better define its
objectives for the period to FY2007. Medium-term objectives and outcomes are presented in TSP III (FY2005)
in order to guide the design and monitoring of subsequent annual programs.

7.3     Mainstreaming gender issues. Survey data reveal significant gender inequalities in development
indicators and access to public services. There are, moreover, concerns that gender issues are not given
adequate attention in the development and poverty reduction policy agenda. In this context, the Government
asked the TSP partners to collaborate with the Office for the Promotion of Equality (OPE) with a view to
integrating gender-disaggregated performance indicators and specific issues critical to gender equality into the

TSP process. Gender mainstreaming is to be piloted in the preparation of annual action plans for the FY2006
budget exercise in four sectors.

7.4     Mainstreaming TSP in the planning process. The TSP has built on the Government's planning process,
by incorporating priority actions identified in agencies' annual action plans. In the preparation of TSP III, the
Government carried this process one step further, by outlining the Transition Support Program in its Budget
Books submitted to Parliament. This presentation helps focus the executive and oversight bodies' attention on
the priority actions, establishes a link between the budget and the government's development program, and
strengthens internal accountability. Further work will be needed on the budget books, particularly as regards
presentation of a synthesis of the key policy and development actions to be implemented by Government, with a
view to ensuring the continuity of this presentation of the Government program after TSP has ended.

7.5     Linking to sector working groups. The scope and detail of the TSP and its annual matrix are, in part, a
consequence of the TSP assuming a coordinating role across a wide range of sectors. The Government plans to
establish sector working groups to support the finalization and implementation of the Sector Investment
Programs in FY2005, providing an opportunity to shift part of the policy dialogue and planning functions to
these working groups as they are created. The TSP may continue to provide a coordinating role at a cross-
governmental level, by highlighting the highest priority activities identified in the sector working groups, whilst
leaving the sector working groups and sector programs to deal with the detailed implementation issues.

7.6     Providing timely analytical inputs. The TSP has been built on detailed analytical work. Timeliness has
been important, with the preparation of issues papers helping to focus attention on program design and
implementation issues just prior to the fielding of progress and appraisal missions. TSP III will continue this
practice, with the preparation of an issues paper on Sector Investment Programs scheduled for the first progress
mission. Further analytical work is needed on the private sector regulatory framework, with a view to improving
the responsiveness of the public sector to private investors' needs.

7.7     Detail and scope of the Program and Action Matrix. There has been much debate regarding the
appropriate scope and detail required in the TSP program and action matrix. Some partners, notably the
Norwegian representatives, have advocated a much more streamlined program, with a small number of key
performance indicators and milestones monitored through the TSP process. The Government has opted for a
broader program, with a detailed action matrix incorporating quarterly milestones, largely in order to support its
internal scheduling and monitoring. The TSP Team, following the recommendation of most program partners,
has sought to adjust program design to meet the Government's needs, accepting that the Action Matrix is much
more detailed than seen in comparable Bank operations. These requirements and the design implications will
need to be reassessed in light of the establishment of the sector working groups, on the basis of a clear division
of labor between the planning and coordination instruments available to Government and TSP partners.

7.8     Preparation, appraisal and monitoring. The Government has argued that TSP progress and appraisal
missions have placed a considerable burden on the administration, with the counterpart teams fully engaged in
the TSP process during missions. This is partly due to the TSP missions serving as an opportunity for internal
review of the Government's program, with discussions between the MPF as coordinating body and line
agencies, and between Government and its external partners. It is also a consequence of the program design,
with a detailed program matrix requiring missions to review a large number of program activities and outputs to
meet the Bank's due diligence requirements for project appraisal and monitoring. Efforts have been made to
streamline the process, by reducing the number and duration of missions, but this has not proved a satisfactory
solution: missions were intense, with a huge workload crammed into a short period of time, and consultations
with external partners crowding out time for consultations between the MPF, line ministries and the TSP
technical team. Again, the appropriate mission schedule and composition will depend on future program design.
However, there are clear advantages to following a two stage preparation and appraisal process, with a small
preparation mission early in the budget process to highlight key policy and program design issues and a larger
appraisal mission, ideally of longer than two weeks, focusing on selection and scheduling of the key actions to
be included in the matrix. During appraisal, adequate time needs to be programmed for meetings between MPF,



                                                        11

line ministries and the TSP technical team to work on the draft matrix before consultations begin with external
partners. The current format of discussions between external partners and the TSP technical team at the start of
the mission, to focus attention on priority issues, followed by tripartite meetings--Government, TSP partners
and TSP technical team--on the matrix during the last week of the mission, seems to be effective. These
opportunities for externals partners' participation have helped secure broad agreement on the program and
identify supporting activities financed by TSP partners.

7.9     Consultations with civil society. The Bank has consistently argued for the engagement of civil society in
the TSP process, preferably through consultations on key policy issues at the start of the mission, followed by a
briefing session at the end of the mission to review key developments. The Government has agreed to lead the
briefing session at the end of the mission, but has informed the Bank that it would not participate in preliminary
meetings. During the second supervision mission, the Bank organized a preliminary meeting in the first week of
the mission. It was not a success, owing to the lack of preparation on the part of the TSP Team. Discussions
with some members of civil society highlighted the need for the preliminary meeting to be scheduled well
before the TSP mission arrives in Timor-Leste, with a clear explanation of the meeting's purpose. From civil
society's side, there is some awareness that the various organizations will need to prepare for the meeting by
identifying the key policy issues that they would like to raise. It will be important to manage expectations about
what these consultations can achieve: the Bank is eager to hear civil society's concerns and can raise issues in
discussions with Government where the TSP partners consider these issues pertinent to program design and
implementation. However, consultation on policy issues is no substitute for civil society's policy dialogue with
Government which should be pursued directly. As part of TSP, the Government has provided an opportunity for
civil society to establish a "high level mechanism," which could provide a forum for such dialogue.

7.10    Capacity building. The TSP has supported capacity building through its dialogue on policy design and
policy implementation. The Government's capacity is much stronger in these areas today than it was at
Independence in May 2002, though there continues to be a heavy reliance on international technical assistance.
The Government has been adamant that adequate technical assistance should be programmed to provide the
support needed for implementation of scheduled actions. This is reflected in the TSP matrix. While these
contributions to capacity building are significant, they do not address the fundamental shortage of skilled and
experienced technicians and managers. Furthermore, it is clear that the transitional approach to technical
assistance and capacity building has been severely flawed, failing to ensure effective transfer of skills and build
up a cadre staff with the key skills to fulfill essential public administration functions. Dependence on external
assistance has persisted. The TSP has not been able to resolve this problem. Where TSP II sought to integrate
the development of a capacity building strategy in financial management to address these problems in a
specific, high risk area, there has been no progress. Whilst recognizing that budget support operations cannot be
directly used to implement capacity building programs, which will require parallel project interventions, further
work is needed on the incorporation of capacity building activities or indicators into future programs, not least
so that progress on this critical issue can be monitored. The Government has requested the development of a
multi-donor Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program, which is expected to go to the
World Bank's Board of Executive Directors in early FY2006, to address capacity needs in MPF and in financial
management positions within line ministries and districts.

7.11    Supporting Policy Dialogue. The TSP has provided a key forum for policy dialogue between the
Government and its external partners. UNDP has provided the Government with a technical advisor to assist in
this policy dialogue. Additional support has been provided, on occasion, from a legal advisor. The participation
of these advisors has been invaluable in fostering and supporting constructive policy dialogue between TSP
partners. The TSP team would encourage the Government and UNDP to continue to provide this support in
future operations.
