                         The project development objective is to assist the Borrower to strengthen local governance and improve the provision of selected urban services by participating Urban
                         Local Governments (ULGs) and additional participating ULGs.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been very successful in strengthening governance in the 10 participating urban local governments (ULGs) and has completed 15 investment sub-projects aimed at
                         improving provision of services. All the ULGs have met, and in some cases exceeded, the project’s specific reform and governance objectives related to transparency, participation,
                         accountability, financial management, and procurement management, as reflected in the performance indicators. The project also completed construction or rehabilitation of 13 public
                         markets, 1 bus terminal, and 1 fish auction facility. While the quality of the infrastructure itself is good, final outcome assessment is still underway because about half including three
                         sub-projects that were completed only recently are not yet fully operational. In most cases, those that are operational have been found to have increased local government revenues,
