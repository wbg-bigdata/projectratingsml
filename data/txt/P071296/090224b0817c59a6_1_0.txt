                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is nearing completion of physical works and governance reforms being undertaken by 10 urban local governments (ULGs). The investment subprojects are mostly aimed
                         at upgrading and rehabilitating public markets, and have already provided better, cleaner, and more modern facilities for vendors and customers, and increased revenues for
                         operation and maintenance. The ULGs have also strengthened governance by improving transparency and accountability, systematically disclosing public information, establishing
                         complaints handling mechanisms, evaluating performance of contractors/suppliers, improving financial management regulations and systems, and finalizing the national urban
                         strategy, policy, and economic development plans.
