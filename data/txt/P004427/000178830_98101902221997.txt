REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR THE AURORA -
PENARANDA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for an equivalent of US$9.5 million and a proposed development credit
for an equivalent of US$9.5 million to the Republic of the Philippines to
help finance an irrigation development and rehabilitation project in Luzon.
The loan would have a term of 25 years including seven years of grace with
interest at 7-1/4% per annum. The development credit would be on standard
terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 78-PH of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). Since imposing martial
law in September 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reaching
economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian reform,
taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and government organi-
zation. These reforms provide an opportunity to improve the performance of
the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity boom in the inter-
national markets, economic activity in the Philippines gained considerable
momentum and registered a strong recovery in 1913. The growth rate in real
GNP, which had been about 5% a year for more than a decade, is estimated to
have doubled and reached a level of 10% in 1973. This high growth rate
resulted mainly from increased agricultural production, a recovery in the
industrial sector including a growth of manufacturing exports, a boom in
export incomes and an expansion in public and private investment. However,
the economy is now threatened with a possible slowdown due to increased oil
prices. The long-term implications of the current energy crisis for domestic
production, the balance of payments, costs and employment, as well as other
aspects of the recent economic developments are being examined by an economic
mission now in the field. Annex I contains the country data.
3.        The strong recovery of the Philippine economy in 1973 was led by
the agricultural sector followed by manufacturing, mining, utilities and
services. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from adverse weather
conditions during the previous three years grew by 11% in 1973. Rice pro-
duction during the present crop year is estimated to have increased by 30%
over the level of the previous year when floods had reduced production levels.
This increase has been mainly due to favorable weather conditions, increased
use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments in sup-
porting rural services as part of a general investment drive for rice self-
sufficiency. The Government has also accomplished more in the last year than
in the previous ten years in implementing agrarian reforms which were accorded
high priority in its development efforts. These reforms involve transferring
titles to tenants and improving supporting services.



4.        The increased activity of the agricultural sector has provided the
base for renewed expansion of the industrial sector. The growth of indus-
trial production for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's
industrial export drive which included a range of export incentives. Non-
traditional industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are
estimated to have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million. The prospects for
increased profitability in this area are attracting a large amount of new
investments into industries like plywood, textiles and garments, handicrafts,
light consumer durables and electronics. The Board of Investments, in its
attempt to exercise a measure of control over the pattern of private indus-
trial investment, is placing emphasis on investments which are labor-intensive
and heavily dependent on domestic raw materials. Recent Government policies
also encourage the development of small and medium-scale industries by adopt-
ing an integrated approach for assistance in the areas of finance, technology,
promotion, procurement and marketing.
5.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant im-
provement in the financial position of the Government. After martial law
was imposed, the Government implemented a series of long-needed tax reforms
and improvements in tax administration, such as customs and tariff reform,
tax amnesties, reforms in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the
export tax, and increased taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These
reforms resulted in a 38% increase in tax revenues in 1973. Sustained im-
provement in tax administration, further tax reforms and a continued strong
recovery in income growth should permit a real revenue growth of about 8%
a year in future. This would provide increasing local resources for the
Government investment program which before the increase in oil prices called
for an outlay of about P 13 billion on infrastructure and other public in-
vestments during FY 1974-77. This would mean doubling the proportion of
these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY 1968-72 to about 3.5% in FY 1974-77.
Implementing this program would also call for continued improvements in public
sector management which has already been strengthened by the Government re-
organization.
6.        Another impressive feature of 1973 was the increase in net foreign
exchange reserves which rose by $553 million to reach $835 million by the end
of 1973. This was mainly due to booming world prices for primary commodities.
These reserves, equivalent to about five months of imports, considerably im-
proved the balance of payments outlook prior to the energy crisis. Export
receipts increased by 55% in 1973 and the merchandise trade account recorded
a surplus of about $280 million, a significant change from the $43 million
deficit in the previous year. Invisible earnings also increased in 1973
by about 180%. Merchandise exports are projected to increase by about 50%
for the entire period FY 1974-78. Most of this increase is attributable to
larger earnings from minerals and the projected 20% a year growth in non-
traditional industrial exports. With the improved outlook for domestic food
production and foreign exchange reserves position, but without considering
the impact of increased oil prices, we estimated late last year that the
Philippines should be able to sustain a growth in imports of raw materials,
intermediate and capital goods sufficient for a real GNP growth of 7-8% a
year.



- 3-
7.        Prior to the increase in oil prices, we projected foreign exchange
requirements for the period 1974-78 at around $4 billion. About three-fourths
of these would be provided by transfers, direct investments and private me-
dium and long-term loans while the remainder would come from official devel-
opment loans. Foreign private investors have been attracted to the Philippines
recently for two main reasons namely the increasing profitability of indus-
tries especially in the export sector, and the relaxation of restrictions on
the repatriation of profits and capital. At the time we made the projections,
commercial and medium-term public loans of about $1.5 billion during the pe-
riod of 1974-78 appeared quite consistent with sound debt management and the
Philippines' debt servicing capacity. These projections did not include
financing for new lumpy public investments being considered, such as, an
integrated steel mill and a nuclear power station. The Philippine Consulta-
tive Group reviewed the improved foreign exchange position at its meeting in
May 1973 and accepted the need for some official commodity aid in addition
to rising levels of commitments for development projects to support the
Philippines' increased development program. During 1969-73, over 40% of
the total disbursements of official development assistance came from the
Japanese Government (of which, more than three-quarters was in commodity
loans) followed by about 28% each from the US Government (of which more than
85% was in commodity loans) and the World Bank Group.
8.        The projections set out above do not take account of the long term
implications of recent increases in petroleum prices since we do not yet
have enough information to analyze the problem fully. Our preliminary
analysis suggests that the net oil import bill (c.i.f.) for 1974 could
exceed $700 million compared with $200 million in 1973. Despite this
sharply increased oil import bill, the balance of payments this year would
not be cause for undue concern. Provided the prices of Philippine exports
hold up as expected, the Philippines appears to have the capacity to absorb
the increased cost of fuel imports in 1974, while maintaining minimum ade-
quate reserves and providing for growth of imports at the projected rate
of 8% in real terms. In 1975, however, the deficit would be much larger due
to higher import prices and additional long-term financing would be needed
if the Philippines is to avoid a sharp decline in her international reserves.
Thus efforts will be needed both to increase the flow of official project
loans and to maintain the 1972-73 levels of quick-disbursing commodity
assistance.
9.        Prior to the energy crisis it was our judgment that, provided ade-
quate levels of official commodity and project assistance are forthcoming a.d
particularly if the improvement in export prices was maintained, management
of the Philippines' external debt and debt servicing should not present
serious problems. Thus in the absence of the need for additional finanzce
because of the energy crisis, the debt service ratio was expected to improve
from the present level of about 21% to about 18% in the latter part of the
decade. When the economic mission returns in early May, a detailed analysis
of the impact of higher oil prices on the longer term outlook and on the
external position will be undertaken.



-4-
10.       Whatever the outcome of this analysis, the Philippines' development
program will continue to require resources in excess of the foreign capital
which will become available for financing the import component of development
projects. Part of these resources will be provided from commodity assistance.
In addition, some financing of local currency expenditures will be justified
especially for projects of economic and social importance which need only
limited amounts of foreign exchange. Given the poverty of the Philippines,
its continued debt problems and the general improvement in the management
of the country's economy, it is appropriate that we continue our policy,
begun in April 1972, of blending in a limited amount of IDA credits along
with our bank lending to the Philippines.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
11.       The Philippines has received 22 Bank loans and two IDA credits
totalling $375 million, net of cancellations. About 60% of the Bank/IDA
lending, about $232 million, has been for infrastructure projects in power,
transportation, water supply and for education. The remainder has been
divided about equally between agriculture and industry. About $85 million
of this has been for irrigation, livestock, rice processing and rural credit
and about $65 million for industry in three loans to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines. There has been a marked improvement in the
way our projects in the Philippines have been executed in the last two or
three years compared with experience in the 1960's when shortages of peso
counterpart funds combined with poor administration caused serious problems.
Apart from the rice processing project, where some major changes made neces-
sary by changed circumstances have been proposed, all our projects are now
going well. Annex II contains a simiary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of February 28, 1974, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
12.       The size of our lending program will increase substantially this
year reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and its
improved capacity to prepare and implement projects. If our projects come
forward as planned and are approved by the Executive Directors, our lending
in the Philippines could exceed $160 million in FY 1974 compared to an aver-
age of about $30 million a year in the previous five years. Future Bank/IDA
lending will continue to concentrate on public infrastructure and agricul-
ture. We will also continue to help industry and provide more assistance
for projects in the social sectors. The following projects are among those
which should be ready for Board consideration during the remainder of FY 1974
and in FY 1975 - Industrial Investment, Rural Credit III, Population, Power VI,
Inter-island Shipping, Tarlac Irrigation and Mindoro Rural Development.
13.       Bank/IDA lending to the Philippines could continue at a relatively
high level provided that the economy is managed reasonably well and that the
Philippines continues to improve its capacity to prepare and implement
projects. During the past five years the Bank/IDA has provided about a
third of the total commitments of official development assistance. Our
higher level of lending, during the next five years, could increase this



-5-
share. The Bank/IDA present share in total debt outstanding is about 9%,
and its share in debt service is about 5.5%. On the trends expected before
the increase in oil prices, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding
would rise to about 17% by 1978 while its share in debt service would be
about 10%. Our future level of lending will be re-examined in the light of
the findings of the economic mission now in the Philippines.
14.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $66.0
million for investments in nine companies in the fields of development
banking, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products,
nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these invest-
ments, as of February 28, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million
cancelled and $1.6 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $45.8 million.
On the same date $14.2 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have
been received for an aluminium smelter and other projects in the pulp and
paper, dinner ware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
15.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
generating approximately one-third of the gross national product, accounting
for one-half of total employment and about three-quarters of export earnings.
Over 60% of the total land under cultivation is taken up by cereals, of which
rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land is primarily taken
up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples and
tobacco.
16.       During the first half of the last decade, agricultural production
increased by only 2.4% a year. However, with a breakthrough in rice produc-
tion following the increased use of high-yielding varieties, fertilizers and
irrigation in the sixties, the sector was growing at a rate of almost 7%
a year by the latter part of the decade. During the past three years the
sector has suffered from adverse weather conditions including severe typhoons.
These disasters slowed progress towards self-sufficiency in food crops and
imports of about 600,000 tons of rice were needed in 1972 and 1973. However,
due to favorable weather conditions and a crash rice production program
called "Masagana 99", 1/ a harvest of 3.7 million tons of milled rice equiva-
lent is expected this year - an increase of 30% over the 1972/73 harvest. In
this past year, fertilizer use on food crops (mostly rice) tripled and
supervised credit increased almost eight fold.
1/   "Masagana 99" is a drive by Government with a target of achieving
99 cavans of paddy per hectare (4.4 tons/ha) country wide. In Tagalog
"masagana"l means abundant.



17.       The major export crops have not been seriously affected by the
natural calamities and have provided increasing foreign exchange revenues
mainly because of favorable world commodity prices. Livestock and poultry
production, which accounts for about 15% of agricultural output, is not
sufficient to meet the demand for meat, requiring imports of about $6 million
a year.
18.       The perfor-imance of the rural-agricultural sector will be crucial
in determining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly
and equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products is
limited by relatively low and stagnant rural 'ncomes.   Problems of poverty
and income maldistribution are particularly acute in the rural areas. Of
the 15 million people in the bottom 40% of the income scale, 12 million
live in rural areas. This represents 45% of the rural population. The
Government is aware of these problems and is moving in the right direction
by stressing self-sufficiency in cereals, laying the base for future diver-
sification, reforming the tenancy structure, and increasing institutional
support to agriculture.
19.       Achieving self-sufficiency in cereals, particularly rice and
maize, is a major Government objective which is important not only to
strengthen the balance of payments, but also as a means of raising incomes
for an important segment of the rural population. Most increases in rice
production will have to come primarily from the present land under cultiva-
tion since the scope for area expansion in rice is very limited. Thus,
attaining self-sufficiency before the end of the present decade will depend
largely on increasing yields through expansion and rehabilitation of the
area under irrigation, increased use of fertilizers and agro-chemicals, and
provision of adequate credit and other supporting services. At present,
only 900,000 ha or less than 30% of all land under rice cultivation is
irrigated. Investment in irrigation is therefore of high priority. Accord-
ing to the Bank's Philippines Agricultural Sector Survey of May 2, 1973,
meeting the domestic demand for rice by the end of the 1970's will require
a program of irrigation rehabilitation and new construction in rice lands
of 50,000 ha a year for the remainder of the decade.
20.       Apart from rice, considerable potential also exists in feed grain
and corn production, livestock, fisheries and forestry development. Diversi-
fication is important not only to meet the growing domestic demand for food
and raw materials, but also to improve incomes in poor areas less suited to
rice production. Better conservation of natural resources can be achieved by
developing the l±vestock and forestry potential of uplands not suitable for
cultivation.
21.       Apart from irrigation, institutional support for agriculture will
involve greater attention to rural credit, agricultural extension, research
and development of infrastructure. There has been considerable progress in
developing institutions to provide credit for small farmers, most notably
the rural banks and, after rgny years of slow progress, the Government is
giving high priority to agrarian reform. The present program concentrates



on rice and corn tenant farmers, who number about one million, and includes
the transfer of titles from landlords to tenan!ts, an expanded program of
rural credit, and increased investments in supporting rural services. In
the first year of the new program the Government has concentrated its efforts
on the large tenanted estates. It has issued 205,000 land transfer certifi-
cates to about 143,000 tenant farmers who cultivate about 255,000 hectares of
land. More has been accomplished in this year than in the previous 10 years
when a total of 55,000 tenants were converted to leasehold status and 3,000
to freehold status. The Government faces some difficult problems in dealing
with small landholdings which are tenanted. Some 82% of land owners have
7 ha or less and 34% of all rice tenants are on these holdings. The latest
directives suggest that small landowners who cultivate part of their holdings
would be expected to enter into cooperative arrangements with their tenants.
It is not yet clear how far the Government will go in requiring small ab-
sentee landlords to transfer their land to their tenants. Since over 80%
of all farms are under five hectares, the future growth in agriculture which
would result from the expansion of irrigated land would directly benefit the
small farmers.
22.       According to the Government's Four Year Plan (1974-77) projections
the agricultural sector, after two successive poor rice crops in 1972-73,
is expected to post significant gains in 1974 with a 4.8% growth rate. By
the end of the Plan period, agricultural production is expected to be growing
at 4.5% per annum. Export crops are expected to perform well. However, the
recent increase in the price of petroleum with its effect on the price of
fertilizer and the amount available poses a difficult problem for the Govern-
ment. The use of fertilizers on rice alone increased from 44,000 on the wet
season crop in 1972 to 162,000 tons in 1973. Prices were held at the 1972
level by subsidy. Based on planned programs for rice and corn, fertilizer
requirements will rise perhaps by 250,000 tons most of which will represent
additional import requirements. Although Government officials indicate
that about 75% of the 1974 fertilizer requirements have been contracted for,
there are indications of shortage and the price of fertilizers has doubled
despite the subsidies. The impact on the farmer of this increase has partly
been cushioned by an increase in the support price of paddy by 50% to
P 40 for 50 kg. In order to maintain incentives for increased fertilizer
use by the farmers, the Government may have to raise paddy prices further
and/or increase the subsidies. The implications of these alternative courses
of action on the budget and on the cost of living are being carefully examined
by the Government.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The project is the second irrigation development and rehabilita-
tion project to be financed by the Bank. The first one is the Upper Pampanga
River Project (UPRP) (Loan 637-PH). The project was prepared by consultants
(financed under the UPRP Loan) and the National Irrigation Administration (NIA).
A Bank mission appraised the project in September/October 1973 and negotia-
tions were held in March 1974. The leader of the Government negotiating



-8-
team was Mr. A. L. Juinio, Administrator of the National Irrigation Adminis-
tration. The Appraisal Report (No. 348-PH) on the proposed project is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan/
credit and project stnAry.
Description of the Project
24.       The project consists of two elements, the diversion of water from
the Aurora river basin through a ridge into the Pampanga river basin and the
Penaranda Irrigation System. Water would be transferred from the Aurora
basin by means of two diversion dams on the Diayo and Canili rivers and a
diversion channel routing the water into the Pantabangan Reservoir of the
Upper Pampanga River Irrigation Project (UPRP). The diverted water would
be used to provide year round irrigation to a total of 25,300 hectares
of rice land of which 16,700 ha are within the command of the existing
Penaranda River Irrigation System and the balance - 8,600 ha - represents
an extension towards the south of the same system.
25.       The project would also include the preparation of an Irrigation
Study for Central Luzon. This important rice growing region covers 1.8 mil-
lion ha in eleven provinces of which about 1.6 million ha are in five prov-
inces with a population of 2.3 million people. About half of the land area
in these five provinces is suitable for irrigated agriculture. The Study
would include a comprehensive inventory of water, land and other resources
required, and it would identify priority irrigation projects against a
long term perspective for sound water use in the Central Luzon Basin.
Project Execution
26.       The project would be implemented by the National Irrigation Ad-
ministration (NIA) over a five-year period. NIA was established in 1964
to be responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of all
national irrigation systems in the Philippines. NIA is a well managed
institution which is executing the Upper Pampanga River Project (UPRP)
very successfully through a special project office under the direction of
a Project Manager. The UPRP section of NIA would be responsible for
implementing the Aurora Penaranda Irrigation Project. Work on the Aurora
diversion would begin as work on the construction of Pantabangan Dam under
UPRP - which is running ahead of schedule - tapers off.
27.       The Upper Pampanga River Project Section of the National Irriga-
tion Administration would also be responsible for carrying out the proposed
Central Luzon Irrigation Study. A Project Development Division, which
would eventually have 30 professional staff, has already been established
for this purpose. Consultants would be engaged by NIA to provide guidance,
special technical services and to assist in training staff engaged on the
Study.
28.       The Government has also set up an Agricultural Development
Coordinating Council to coordinate agricultural supporting services in
the Upper Pampanga River Project Area. The Government would reconstitute



-9-
it so that it can plan and coordinate all agricultural supporting services
such as the provision of production credit, fertilizer and extension serv-
ices, in the area covered by both projects. The Government has agreed to
provide the additional extension staff needed.
Cost Recovery
29.       For the purpose of setting and administering irrigation fees, the
area covered by the Upper Pampanga River Project and this project would be
treated as a single unit. The National Irrigation Administration would
gradually increase the water rates over a period of 5 years from completion
of construction to a level sufficient to cover operation and maintenance
costs and to recover (without interest) the total investment cost over not
more than the 50 year life of the project. The Government has agreed to
transfer water rights in the Aurora basin to NIA and not grant any private
water rights which might affect water supply to the project.
Project Cost and Financing
30.       The project is estimated to cost $40 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange cost of $19.0 million, including interest during con-
struction. The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit of $19.0 million would
finance the foreign exchange cost. The Government would finance the
balance of $21.0 million.
Procurement
31.       The Aurora diversion works (US$11.2 million) would be let as
one contract subject to international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank Group Guidelines. Works in the Penaranda service area (US$9.6
million) consisting of many diverse items scattered over a large area would
not be suitable for international competitive bidding since these works
need to be planned and executed at short notice to fit in with irrigation
releases and the growing season. Some of this work would be carried out
by National Irrigation Administration by force account. NIA has agreed to
investigate ways of expanding the execution of civil works in the service
area by local contract so that the amount of work done by force account
would not exceed 20% of the total cost of the work (paragraph B.3 of Sched-
ule 3 to the Development Credit Agreement).
32.       Equipment and vehicles for project construction, operation,
maintenance and for the Irrigation Study, costing about US$2.3 million,
would be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price
of imported goods would be extended to domestic manufacturers in the eval-
uation of bids. Procurement of off-the-shelf items costing less than
$10,000 each would be exempted from international competitive bidding
and would be purchased through normal government procurement procedures
which are satisfactory. The aggregate cost of such items would not exceed
$100,000.



- 10 -
Disbursement
33.       The loan and credit would be disbursed over a period of 5 years.
The IDA credit would be disbursed first so as to reduce interest during
construction. Disbursement would be made at the rate of 100% against the
c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment or at the rate of 65% of the
total cost for imported equipment procured locally. For services of foreign
consultants and for overseas trainic.g, disbursement would cover the actual
foreign exchange cost. Disbursements for civil works would be 100% of for-
eign expenditures for contractor mobilization and equipment purchases and
at the rate of 27% of certified monthly progress payments or expenditures.
To ensure that expenditures including payments to contractors are made
promptly, the Government has agreed to set up a special fund sufficient
to cover expected expenditures for three months ahead.
34.       Retroactive financing is recommended for about $50,000 equivalent
for engineering services to be carried out from March 1, 1974 for the dams
and diversion channels.
Agrarian Reform in the Project Area
35.       Central Luzon, which includes the project area, is one region
in the Philippines where there has been notable progress in agrarian
reform. Since 1963, the Government has been gradually converting share-
croppers to leaseholders. Before 1964 sharecroppers accounted for 50%
of the farmers in the project area compared to 28% today. At present 60%
of the farmers are leaseholders. This achievement is substantially higher
than the national average and of considerable significance to the farmers
concerned. The leaseholder has security of tenure and pays fixed annual
land rent while the sharecropper has little security of tenure and must pay
a major share of the proceeds of his crop in rent.
36.       For the future, the Government hopes to continue the process
and, in line with the agrarian reform decrees promulgated since 1972,
convert more tenants into owners. Thus, the land tenure system in the
project area would probably evolve to a point where sharecropping would
disappear, the number of owner-operators would increase, but some residual
leaseholding would remain to avoid dispossessing small land owners unable
to engage in farming.
Economic Justification
37.       The project would help the Philippines Government attain self-
sufficiency in rice. In so doing, it would not only strengthen the balance
of payments but also help raise the incomes of the rural population. Because
of the limited scope for expanding the area of land being cultivated, much
of the additional rice production must come from improved land and labor
productivity in areas already under cultivation. The project would increase
rice yields in an area now dependent upon run-of-the-river irrigation and
rainfed cultivation by providing an assured year-round water supply, better
water control, improved drainage and the necessary agricultural supporting



services. Some 10,000 families, averaging six members per family, live in
the project area. The average farm size is 2.5 ha, with about 62% of the
farms covering 52% of the area, falling between 1 and 3 ha. Taking the
2.5 ha farm size as the average for the project area, present net farm
incomes of between P 1,835 and F 3,585 (US$270 to $530), depending on
whether the land is rainfed or irrigated, would rise at full project dev-
elopment to P 6,865 (US$1,020) for a leasehold tenant whose status did not
change. Should the same farmer acquire his land under the provisions of
the land reform program, his income would rise to P 8,480 (US$1,260). At
full development, some 25,300 hectares would have assured water supply for
two crops of rice a year and rice production in the area would increase
from 82,000 tons a year to 202,000 tons a year. The economic rate of
return on the project would be about 17 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTRORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of the Philippines and the Association, the Report and Recommendation, re-
spectively, of the Committees provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and in Article V, Section 1 (d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the texts of the Resolutions
approving the proposed loan and credit are being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. Substantive provisions concerning the project
are contained in the draft Development Credit Agreement incorporated by ref-
erence in the Loan Agreement. The draft Agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans and credits for irrigation projects except that the cost
of civil works carried out by force account will not exceed 20% of a portion
of project civil works (paragraph B.3 of Schedule 3 to the Development Credit
Agreement).
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreements of the Bank and of the Association.

PART VI - RECOMMNDATION
40.       In formulating this proposal it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
However available information indicates that the proposed loan and credit
remain fully justified.
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.

C.   Projects in Execution -/
Ln. No. 607-PH      Second Rural Credit; US$12.5 million Loan of
June 4, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly
due to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was
allowed to float in February 1970. The subsequent increases in prices of
farm produce together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengthen-
ing of staff and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of
disbursement. This has particularly quickened over the last nine months.
The Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973, has been postponed to
June 30, 1974. As of March 25, 1974, a balance of only $42,450 remained
uncommitted.
Ln. No. 637-PH      Irrigationi US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The project's
on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation
development in the country. Some delays were caused by the 1972 floods
but construction of the dam is now progressing ahead of schedule. All
work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30,
1976, the original completion date. Project costs have increased 34 percent
over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso
and design changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination
established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction instead of 13 years as appraised. The project remains
economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4. 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project provides long-term credit through the Development Bank
of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modernization
of the private sector of the rice processing industry. It included six large
integrated processing plants to produce the high quality rice required for
the anticipated exportable surplus, .which . did not materialize owing to set-
backs in rice production. The President's memorandum to the Executive
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 1T of 5 pages
Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) proposed amendments to the loan
agreement to shift the emphasis to rehabilitation of existing facilities and to
streanline procurement procedures.   In spite of this the project has made very
little progress and by the end of February, 1974, only US$0.5 million had been
disbursed. During the critical shortage of rice last year the Government
successfully encouraged an increase in maize production, and the consumption
of maize mixed with rice.  This has led to a demand for maize processing,
storage and handling facilities, and Government has proposed the project
be expanded to include grains other than rice. Much of the new demand will come
from public entities and small individuals, so that Government has proposed
they also be included, and that the minimum size of sub-loan be reduced to
cover the smaller processors.  These amendments, designed to widen the project's
objectives, to cover the changed conditions and to facilitate speedy and full
implementation, have been presented to the Executive Directors in the President's
Memorandum datalApril 15, 19714 (Sec  74-244).
Ln. No. 731-PH      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is in general progressing satisfactorily.
Work was, however, suspended in March 1973 because of civil disturbances
in the Cotabato area, but the contreactor has since resumed work from the
Digos end which is outside the area affected by the fighting. The project
also includes two components financed by UNDP: technical assistance to
the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements and
feasibility studies for future highway projects. Work on the technical
assistance component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have
been completed.
Ln. No. 809-PH and Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
Cr. No. 296-PH      and Credit of April 3, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the constructio of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected, although a further tariff
increase was imposed in January 1973 because of rapid domestic inflation.
However, the situation has been improved by the imposition in July 1973
of a surcharge to cover increased fuel costs. The closing date has been
postponed to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed procurement and be-
cause retention monies will not be paid to the major equipment supplier
until at leas one year after the plant is commissioned.
Ln. No. 823-PH      Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The prolect is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of
the Philippines. The project is progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education; US$12.7 million; Credit of
January 5, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project will assist Government to improve such areas as
education, planning, management and curriculum development, science
teacher training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and
farmers. Although no disbursements have been made, the project is
progressing on schedule.
Ln. No. 891-PH      Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine
and inland fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5,
1973. The demand for loans appears adequate and the organization to imple-
ment them has been properly established. The project is progressing satis-
factorily.
Ln. No. 939-PH      Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of
the ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of Mindanao.
The loan became effective on December 19, 1973. The project is progressing
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 950-PH      Second Highway; US$68.0 million Loan of
December 12, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program
of construction, improvement and rehabilitation of its highways and feeder
roads. The loan became effective on December 27, 1973. The project is
progressing satisfactorily.

Procurement:         (a)  Civil works for the diversion of water from Aurora
basin (including the two dams and diversion chan-
nels) would be let as one contract subject to in-
ternational competitive bidding. Works on the
Penaranda Service area consisting of many diverse
items scattered over a large area would not be
suitable for international competitive bidding.
Some of these (not more than 20 percent of total
cost) works would be carried out by the National
Irrigation Administration (NIA) on force account.
(b) Equipment and vehicles for project construction,
operation maintenance and for the Central Luzon
Irrigation Development Study would be procured
after international competitive bidding.    Procure-
ment of off-shelf items costing less than $10,000
each whose aggregate would not exceed $100,000
would be exempt from international competitive
bidding. A preference limited to 15 percent of
the c.i.f. price of imported goods would be
extended to domestic manufactures in the evalua-
tion of bids.
Consultants:              Consultants (Engineering Consultants, Inc. and
Engineering Development Corporation in the
Philippines) were appointed by NIA to assist
with the feasibility studies. Consultants
would supervise the implementation of the project
and conduct the Central Luzon Irrigation Dev-
elopment studies.
Rate of return:           17 percent
Appraisal Report:         Report No. 348-PH dated April 1, 1974,
