FOREWORD
This Report which refers to Credit 547-SU approved in May 1975 in the
sum of US$10.0 million, is a restricted document prepared for the Democratic
Republic of the Sudan, under the Co-operative Agreement between Unesco and the
World Bank. The original Project Closing Date of 30 June 1982 was postponed
twice, the final date being fixed at 31 December 1983, but the disbursement of
funds previously committed by this date s as honored until 28 4ugust 1984.
At the invitation of the Government, a Mission composed of Mr. M. Mason
(General Educator and Mission Leader), and Mr. J. Antoniou (Architect, Consultant)
visited the country for two weeks (2' March - 7 April 1984).
Before working in the country, the Mission made a one-week
comprehensive study of the relevant project files held by the World Bank in
Washington, D.C. and consulted with Bank officials involved with the Project.
These provided an essential background for the Mission's field work in conjunction
with discussions held with Government educational authorities involved with the
Project,  as well as consultations with international agencies involved in
educational developmerit in Sudan.
Subsequently, in May l984, the first draft of the Completion Report was
extensively discussed in Khartoum with the Project Director and other authorities
and a revised draft was prepared and sent to the Bank. Educational data were
limited at the time of the Completion Mission. The Bank requested and received
at a later date the most recent project data from the Project Director. In the
meantime t.e Bank officials read the revised draft Completion Report and
returned it together with their comn;ents and the recent data received from
Khartoum or '.he Project. This final version of the Completion Report has been
prepared incorporating the data received from Khartoum and the comments and
suggestions of the Bank.
The major assignment of the Mission was to determine to what extent the
Project objectives had been achieved and the expected benefits obtained, as stated
in the Appraisal Report. Two limiting factors to the Mission's work were the close
of the school year (vacation) and the difficulty and security risk in traveling.
Consequently, many project institutions were not visited.
This Report now presents the Mission's findings and conclusions.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 547-SU)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) of the Second Education
Project in the Democratic Republic of Sudan, for which Credit 547-SU was
approved on April 29, 1975 in the sum of US$10.0 million. The original
June 30, 1982 Closing Date was twice extended for a total of 18 months with
a final Closing Date of December 31, 1983. The credit account was closed
on August 28, 1984 resulting in full utilization of credit funds.
This PCR was prepared by UNESCO at the request of and with the
assistance of the Government. It was reviewed by staff in the Education
Projects Division of the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office who
also prepared the highlights.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
auditing, this project completion report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff as
the project was a comparatively simple one and the PCR gives a good account
of the project experience.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies and
comments received have been reproduced in the final report as Attachment 1.

SUDAN
Second Education Project (Credit 547-SU)
Highlights
A Development Credit Agreement providing US$10.0 million to the
Sudan for a Second Education Project was signed on May 16, 1975. The
project was basically intended to redress the existing acute imbalances in
educational opportunities between the North and South and among Provinces
by (a) providing training facilities for out-of-school youth and adults;
(b) upgrading and providing facilities for Primary and Junior Secondary
education; (c) strengthening teacher education and curriculum development;
(d) expanding training of skilled workers and (e) assisting a nationwide
sector review. In this endeavour, the project as designed included the
following components:
(1) Forty New Integrated Rural Education Centers (IREC) located
both in the North and in the South, in areas most deprived of
educational facilities.
(2) Three new Junior Secondary Schools in the South.
(3) Extension to one Primary Teacher Training Institute, in the
Northern Region.
(4) Extension to one Vocational Training Center in the Southern
Region.
(5) A nationwide Education Sector Review.
Project implementation was extended by 18 months due mainly to
slow project start-up, caused by weak management. Causes of further delays
include: shortages of Government counterpart funds; weak local
construction industry, aggravated by shortages of material and
transportation difficulties; and more recently security problems in the
South. (para 1.3). Construction and transportation problems caused the
project to be modified to reduce the 40 IRECs to 24, adding an unplanned
Senior Secondary school in Juba, because of its easier access compared to
other locations in the South. Of the 24 IRECs, 14 were to be built in the
South. However, security problems in the Region delayed work to such an
extent that three of the 14 IRECs for which prefabricated elements were
provided by the contractor, could not be assembled. Government is now
planning to have them built by provincial authorities. As a result, the
project will eventually provide only about 60% of the planned student
places (para. 6.1; Annex I; Annex IV.1)



- viii -
Project implementation must be viewed in the light of the general
situation prevailing in the country and in particular, of the security
problems in tie Southern Region. Under such circumstances even the reduced
completion of planned physical facilities represents a significant
achievement. An evaluation of the educational objectives at this stage is
premature, and both the Association and Borrower should consider
undertaking a review to determine educational results after a period of
three to five years, at which time most of the project institutions should
have produced their first output (paras 1.15-1.16).
Lessons learned point out to a) the importance of adequately
staffing the PIU; b) the importance of requiring suppliers to deliver goods
to final destination in order to overcome transportation problems; c) need
to establish a revolving fund (Project Advance Account) under PIU control.

CHAPTER I
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Oview
1.1    The Project, which was the second Bank Group operation supporting
eeucation in Sudan, include; five components: (i) 40 New Integrated Rural
Education Centers (IRECs) located in areas most deprived of educational facilities,
and were to provide 12,000 primary student places; (ii) three New Junior and one
New Senior Secondary Schools with 600 and 540 student places, respectively; (iii)
extension to one Primary .zacher Training Institute for 160 additional student
places composed the third; (iv) extensions to one Vocational Training Center for an
additional 140 student places; and (v) a nationwide education sector review. The
Project's main objective was to redress the existing acute imbalances in
educational opportunities between the North and the South and among Provinces,
resulting partly from the 17 year civil disturbances. Of the original 40 IRECs 18
have actually been completed, one of which has been temporarily occupied by the
Army and another converted into a secondary senior high z.ool (both in the
Southem Region). The other 16 provide 4,800 student places, btit according to
available data only 352 places in 3 IRECs in the North are knowr to have been
occupied. The Juba Day Senior Secondary School in the South has 137 per cent
occupancy and the IREC at Malek (South) converted to a Senior Secondary School
has 350 students, a 117 per cent occupancy. Data were not available on the other 3
completed junior secondary schools, BRTTI, and the Wau Vocational Training
Center. kistitutions completed and the number of student places provided are
given in Annex I After project implementation the present known outcomes are
below excpectations at Appraisal, but the educational objectives are expected to be
achieved within a few years of full operation of all project institutions. Major
factors contributing to low achievement of educational targets include:  (i)
dispersed nature of project sites; (ii) management weaknesses of contractor; (iii)
transportation difficulties; and (iv) security problems. The Project was expected
to provide skilled manpower for rural rehabilitation programmes. This benefit is
being attained through the Wau Vocational Training Center which is in operation.
The benefit in terms of reducing the imbalance in educational opportunities in the
South, especially for secondary students is being achieved as evidenced by the
overflow of students at Juba Day arnd the IREC Secondarv School at Malek. The
benefit of reorienting education in tune with the socio-economic needs of the
Sudan is being realized through the IRECs, based upon the curriculum developed at
BRTM.
1.2    Project lmplementation was extended by one year (30 June 1982 -30 3une
1983) while some project components remained unfinished at the time of the
Completion Mission (March 1984), nine nrr.ths after the extended Closing Date.
However, considering the dispersed nature of the sites in both North and South
regions and the logistical difficulties involved in a country with a weak
construction indus+.,, the overall performance of the PIU was adequate.
1.3    The delays in Project knplementation were due to slow project start-up
caused by unco-ordinated project management between two project units, one for
educational matters within the Ministry of Education, and the other for technical
affairs within the Ministry of Construction and Public Works. Both units were
inadequately staffed and the Government logistical support was unsatisfactory.
Management remained weak until the two project units were amalgamated in 1980.



-2 -
Main causes of further delays in implementation include:  (a) shortage of
Govemment counterpart funds; (b) management weaknesses of contractor; (c)
general poor condition of the construction industry, aggravated by a chronic
shortage of materials, transportation difficulties, and emigration of skilled and
semi-skiliAd labour to nearby oil-producing countries; and  (d) recent secjrity
problems- . However, there was no cost overrun because the Project was reduced
in scope.
1.4   Sorme major changes in project scope and use of facilities were made
including: (a) reducing the 40 IRECs (10 in the North) to 24 when it was evident
that IRECs expected to be constructed by villagers in the South under a low-cost
self-help scheme would not materialize because of poor response by the people; (b)
deletion of 3 IRECs in the South in order to avoid cost overrun after undue delay
caused by security risks; (c) reduction of the proposed expansion of Wau Vocational
Training Center by 35 per cent after the Federal Republic of Germany, which was
expected to equip and fumish the Center, reduced its funds from US$600,000 at
Appraisal to US$97,000; (d) addition of Juba Day Senior Secondary School upon
Government's request when the decision was made to reduce the IRECs in the
South from 30 to 14; (e) conversion of a classroom at BRTTI into a staff room and
seminar room; and (f) conversion of the IREC at Malek in the South to a Senior
Secondary School with 350 students.
1.5    The design for all buildings was done by MCPW, and project components in
the Northern Region were constructed by MCPW using force account method.
After a few construction altematives did not prove economical, the Borrower
proposed and the Association approved the use of a pre-fabricated building system
for all project components in the Southem Region, and negotiated with a
Portuguese Firm of Contractors, being the lowest evaluated bidder. Fumiture was
purchased through international competitive bidding, and equipment was purchased
through UNICEF. PIU reported that all schools have received equipment and
fumiture, including the three under construction in the North, and the three
deleted in the South. The Government has allocated LS430 thousand to complete
the three IRECs under construction in the North, according to recent data received
from the PIU, the authorities in the South were negotiating with the contractor to
build the three deleted against local payments.
1.6    Maintenance is already needed on some buildings, including the IREC at
Otek, where some panels have been blown off by the wind. Measures need to be
taken for timely and proper maintenance of ail facilities.
1.7    The Technical Assistance component was executed satisfactorily by Unesco
and the performance of the specialists and consultants was adequate. Of the 25
man-years of specialists services allocated, only the procurement post (8 man-
years) was cancelled, and the senior rural educator (2 man-years) was not
recruited. Although 6 man-years of fellowship were allocated for three teachers
from BRTTI to receive overseas training in curriculum development, teaching aids
and materials, and rural education, i total of 7 persons benefited from the
programme using only 5.3 man-years. However, only 2 of those trained were still
at BRTTI at the time of the Completion Mission. All covenants were complied
with.
1/    The Borrower holds the view that there were no security problems in the
early years of project implementation and had contractor's management
been adequate, most civil works would have been completed prior to the
security problems now existing.



-3-
1.8    The final cost of the Project as implemented was LS13.068 million, or
about US$14.688 million, about 70 per cent more or 22 per cent less than Appraisal
estimates, respectively. Substantial reduction in project scope, as stated earlier,
contributed to lower project cost.
Recommendations
1.9    At the time of Appraisal in 1975, the Association and the Government
decided that the services of the Ministry of Construction and Public Works would
be utilized for the design, preparation of construction documents and supervision of
construction, with the understanding that should an increased workload delay
project implementation, then consultants would be selected and appointed. After
poor response by contractors to bids for construction, the Govemment proposed
and the Association approved construction in the Northem Region by MCPW
utilizing force account method. Supervision proved inadequate and contributed to
project delay, but consultants were not selected and appointed to take over project
supervision. In future projects, PIU should undertake direct control of civil works,
with its own resident engineers to supervise and implement project components, as
in the case of Mileh IREC and the Extension to the Bahkt-er-Ruda Primary Teacher
Training Institute where improved management was observed.  Contractual
arrangements should include the careful monitoring of variations and changes to
building, both in terms of design and cost.
1.10   In analysing tenders for appointing contractors to undertake major projects
of this magnitude. particular attention should not only be given to cost but also to
managemc't ability. The contractor used had no experience in a country like
Sudan, did not visit the South before bidding, and his office was under-staffed.
1.11   Advisory services with financial and logistical support should be provided
to heads of schools and regional education authorities as to the management and
maintenance of buildings, fumiture and equipment. Each of the authorities in the
Educational Units in the Regional Ministries for Services should consider the
feasibility of assigning a technician the responsibility of maintaining project
institutions and provide the funds and logistical support for such services. The
maintenance of buildings, even already occupied over three years, was still the
responsibility of the contractor. Some buildings now need urgent repairs.
1.12  In undertaking similar projects in future, the P1U should be strengthened
through the provision of a deputy director, an accountant, and a procurement
specialist, as a minimum provision for improved efficiency and effective
implementation. It is suggested that the deputy director should have qualifications
and experience in administration and education with the view to monitoring the
educational aspects of the Project. Considering the lack of available nationals for
the above mentioned post, consideration should be given to providing specialists
services in the respective areas to the PIU with the view to training local
counterparts, who can take over work by the end of the specialist's contract. This
implies a minimum of change of counterparts during the specialist"s contractural
period.
1.13   Measures need be taken by the Borrower and the Association to improve
the conditions of employment and career prospects of nationals with the view to
retaining them for a long period of time in their positions, thereby stimulating the
institutionaT capacity building of the Borrower and in order to have an efficient
local staff after the departure of specialists. In this respect, the Borrower ought
to give serious consideration to augmenting the salaries of IREC teachers by 25 per
cent as recommended at the National 1978 and 1981 conferences, by virtue of the
exceptional nature of their responsibilities and in order to attract new teachers and
retain the employed ones.



-4-
1.14   As much as is possible, the arrival of specialists should be harmonized with
the work and building programme. Delays in construiction adversely affected the
productivity of some specialists, who left when they were most needed.
1.1   Since it is not possible at this time to attain educational benefits, attention
should be given by the Borrower and the Association to planning methods of
determnining the educational effects in the first few years of full operation of the
Project institutions. In the meantime, data on enrolments, dropouts and promotion
rates, seeds distribution, farm production, impact in homes (health condition, child
care, food preparation) teachers' suggestions about the curriculum, and the overall
impact (output) of the IRECs on the community and economy should be accurately
collected 1/ and be readily available.
1.16   Parallel with the full implementation of the IREC curriculum, an
examination based upon the programme, should be developed including all practical
aspects. Parents, teachers and students should be made to understand that the
national examination given to the traditional school students will be modified for
the IRECs to include the practical aspects of their programme, but that this
change will in no way prevent the children who are capable from pursuing further
education. With such understanding, the emphasis on passing the standard national
examination could be minimized without defeating the purpose of the IRECs.
Lessoni Learned
1.17   The Borrower is very aware that its lack of counterpart funds was a major
handicap to the implementation of the Project. Therefore, appropriate measures
need to be found (e.g. a revolving fund or a special fund) to resolve the problem of
shortage of Government counterpart funds and to strengthen the capability of the
PIU by providing the number and calibre of staff needed for effective pioject
implementation. An inadequately staffed PIU imposed an undue responsibility upon
the Director, and without a deputy director, administrative matters were greatly
delayed in the absence of the Director.
1.18   Difficulties encountered by the Borrower in transporting fumiture,
equipment, and other commodities to the sites have convinced the Borrower that in
future projects Ven. rs should be required to deliver their goods to the respective
sites in correctly pa *ed and labelled containers. Project funds should cover this
requirement.
1.19   Although there were criteria upon which site selections for the IRECs were
made, there was not sufficient firmness by the Association in maintaining the use
of some sites, once the decision was made. Consequently, Ministerial and Regional
authorities shifted many sites, owing to political expediency.  One Junior
Secondary School site was changed to what is now considered a very unsuitable
location.
1.20   The force account method did not work smoothly in the North. An
improvement to management was noted at Mileh and Bahkt-er-Ruda where the PIU
had complete control of the programme and funds. This experience and output
should be considered in future projects.
1/    Mr. A. G. 1. Mohammed did his master's degree thesis in education on the
experimental schools (Annex VI.4). Perhaps it would be appropriate to
assign this task to him at this early stage of the operation of the IRECs, as
a part of his responsibilities at BRTTI.

CHAPTER 1I
INTRODUCTION
2.1    The preparation of this Project Completion Report (PCR) has been based
largely upon data collected by a two-man mission to the Sudan during two weeks in
March - April 1984 and data available in the Bank Group files. At the time of the
Completion Mission there were limited clata on civil works and educational
statistics due to the fact that only a few of the educational institutions were
operating and it was difficult to send availabie data to Khartoum. The Mission
travelled by car and visited the Bahkt-er-Ruda Teacher Training Institute, the
experimental school at El Talha and the Mileh IREC in the North, the only one that
was operating at the time, but all schools were closed for the annual vacation.
Later the architect-consultant remained at the P[U in Khartoum and collected data
on civil works and project implementation, and held discussions with the
representative of the contractor for the South, while the general educator flew by
UNICEF airplane to Juba where he visited the Juba Day School, the PIU Unit and
staff houses, and consulted with the resident representative of Condaco, the
contractors for project components in the South. Discussions were also held with
the Minister of Education for Equatorial Province in the South. Because of the
high security risk and the long distances of the completed IRECs from Juba, the
visit was limited to Juba city. It was not possible to visit the Wau Vocational
Training Center because the UNICEF plane stopped at Wau en route to Juba where
it remained until the third day before returning North and this schedule was once a
week.
2.2    Before going to the Sudan, the Mission made a one-week study of the
-_.evant project files held by the World Bank in Washington, D.C., and consulted
with officials involved with the Project. The files include supervision reports,
quarterly progress reports, correspondance with the Borrowier and other documents
which had to be prepared during the generation of the Project and its
implementation. Since Unesco was the executing agency for the Technical
Assistance Component, its files were consulted for relevant data on specialists and
consultants services and fellowships. The first draft of the Completion Report was
extensively discussed in Khartoum with the Project Director and other authorities
and a revised draft was prepared and sent to the Bank. Since educational data
were limited at the time of the Completion Mission, the Bank requested by cable
and in return received on 28 November 1984 the most recent project data available
from the Project Director. In the meantime the Bank officials read the revised
draft Completion Report and returned it together with their comments and the
recent data received from Khartoum on the Project. This final version of the
Completion Report has been prepared incorporating the data received from
Khartoum and the comments and suggestions of the Bank.

CHAPTER m
PRO3ECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Ec6omic Settig
3.1    The Democratic Republic of the Sudan is the largest country in Africa and
has an area of approximately 2.5 million square kilometers (1,000,000 square
miles). At the time of the Project Appraisal in 1975, the population was estimated
to have been 16.5 million in 1973, growing at about 2.8 per cent per annum. During
the decade 1970-1980, the population grew at an estimated rate of about 3.1 per
cent per annum and is estimated to have been 19.2 million in 1981, but with a low
population density of 7.5 persons per square kilometer. Much of the country is
desert cr semi-desert and 50 per cent of the population is concentrated on 15 per
cent of the land. Sudan is divided generally into Northem Sudan with 6 regions and
12 provinces and Southern Sudan with 3 regions and 6 provinces. The GNP per
capita in 1981 was estimated at US$380.
Sector Settin
3.2   This Project was an effort to redress some major existing problems of the
education and training sector of Sudan at Appraisal. Enrolments of the eligible age
groups in school were about 38 per cent in primary (grades I - 6), 11 per cent in
junior secondary (grades 7 - 9) and 5 per cent in upper secondary (grades 10 - 12).
Only about 5,000 students out of 191,000 enroled at the secondary level were in
techniail and vocational courses. At the post secondary and higher education level
facilities were provided for 16,000 students.
3.3    The above low enrolment ratio reflected a major weakness which was the
shortage of facilities for the training of adults and out-of-school youths. It was
foreseen that the lack of these facilities would deprive this group of the pre-
requisite skills needed for active and effective participation in increased
agricultural production and improved living standards in rural areas at the time
when the Government was expected to give highest priority to agriculture and to
the infrastructure required for rural development. These included the training of
teachers and resource personnel for community development with the view to using
properly equipped and well supplied primary schools as focal points for community
development activities.
3.4   Furthermore, there were severe imbalances in educational opportunities
between provinces, with only about 10 per cent of the eligible children in the
Southem Region being enrolled in primary schools, compared to 47 per cent in the
rest of the country. At the secondary level, enrolment in junior secondary schools
was less than 6 per cent and about 5 per cent in upper secondary. Vocational
training in the Southem Region was in an early stage, and facilities were very
inadequate.
3.5   In general education, the curriculum was basically literary and essentially a
preparation for proceeding from one level to the next. As a result, drop-outs and
school leavers joined the labour force without the required basic skills and
attitudes on which to build on-the-job training and experience. Being inadequately
trained and unwilling to return to rural areas, gave rise to social and economic
problems. On the other hand, the technical and vocational institutes were too
small (with enrolment capacity varying from 18 to 100 students) to accommodate
tiis large unprepared group. Moreover, the institutes did not liaise with industry;
consequently, their graduates did not meet employers' expectations.



-8-
3.6    These problem areas were given high priority in the development of a long-
term strategy for educational investment as described below under justification.
Proiect Formulation
3.7    The Project was formulated over a period of about 24 months and was
signed in 1975 and completed on 30 June 1984, some 24 months beyond the original
closing date, 30 June 1982. It provided US$10 million for establishing a system of
htegrated Rural Education Centers (IRECs), secondary schools, a primary teacher
training institute and expansion of a vocational training center.
3.8    Preliminary  talks regarding  this Project were held  between  the
Govemment and the Bardc during a Bank Supervision Mission of Education I in April
1973, followed by a Reconnaissance Mission in August/September 1973 during
which the Project was estimated at US$13 million with US$9 million in foreign
exchange. A Preparation/Appraisal Mission followed in November/December 1973.
However, a Completion of Appraisal Mission was undertaken in March/April 1974
followed by a final meeting in Khartoum  in November 1974 to discuss the t
conditions precedent to negotiations which took place 27 - 31 January 1975. No
major issues which would have negatively affected project implementation were
raised during negotiation. In fact only minor modifications were made to the
Project before Board approval on 29 April 1975 and signing date was 16 May 1975.
The Credit became effective on 30 September 1975.
3.9    The Project prepared was in harmony with the country's education needs
and with the Governments objectives and development strategy.
Project Justiiction
3.10   The Project provided financial and Technical Assistance to assist Sudan's
education and training system to becornu- more responsive to socio-economic
development strategy by providing appropriate leaming opportunities to out-of-
school youths and adults to enable them to participate more actively in rural
development and to redress imbalances which existed in educational opportunities
between the Northem and Southem Regions and among the Provinces.
3.11   Since 90 per cent of the population lives in rural areas, it was essential
that any development strategy includes measures for the efficient mobilization and
productive utilization of available resources for rural transformation through an
integrated approach. Emanating from this conviction was the concept of the
Integrated Rural Education Center which would become the focal point for
development of village life by providing both formal and non-formal education and
training geared to the needs of rural regeneration.
3.12   The IREC Primary School was to offer orimary school programmes
appropriate to education needs of rural children, including using the local
environment as a basic source of curriculum content, and observation, analysis,
discovery and problem-solving as the essence of the teaching methods. Parents
and other members of the community with special knowledge and skills were to
serve as resource persons and aids to the teachers.  Although practical subjects
such as home economics, rural education and workshop practice were included in
the programme, the amount of time allocated to the various academic subjects was
to be the same. This was to ensure that the IREC would not be a second-rate
programme.



- 9-
3.13   Non-formnal education and training activities for out-of-school youths and
adults were to be based upon leeming needs in terms of knowledge, skills, and
attitudes which could be obtained from the local community, govemmental and
non-govemmental agencies serving in rural areas. 'The acquisition of knowledge
was to be aided by lectures on various subjects by knowledgeable and experienced
persons and through film shows by extension workers. Through participation in
practical work stituations sk-ilLs were to be developed, and attitudes orientated
through group discussions, group decision-making, role-playing, and problem-solving
activities related to immediate daily problems at home and in the rural community.
3.14   Two expected outcomes of the IRECs were (i) an output of 1,800 primary
school graduates per annum and (ii) an increase in the eaming potential of farmers
in the community.
3.15   The civil disturbances caused many junior secondary schools to be badly
damaged in the Southem Region; this Project was an effort to also redress this
condition, as well as to provide increased qualified manpower needed for national
development by expanding the Wau Vocational Training Center.  Curriculum
development includih-g innovative methods for rural education and continuous
evaluation led to an eptension of the BRTTI.
zbjectives
3.16   The overall objective of the Project as stated at Appraisal was to assist
Sudan's education investment programme aimed at expanding and improving
education in the most deprived areas of the country by:
(a)    providing training facilities for out-of-school youths and adults,
(b)    upgrading and providing facilities for primary and junior secondary
education,
(C)    strengthening teacher education and curriculum development,
(d)    expanding training of skilled workers, and
ie)    assisting a nationwide education sector review.
Coamponents
3.17   Part A of the Project was desigrned to increase basic education and traiing
places from pre-project 640 to 13,600 by adding 12,960 new places.
3.18   The Project content at Appraisal consisted of the construction or extension
and equipping of the institutions briefly described below:
A.    Institutions
Integrated Rural Education Centers QIRECs)
3.19   Forty new Integrated Rural Education Centers (IRECs) were to be
constructed, providing 12,000 student places thereby increasing basic education
enrolment by 10 per cent in the Southem Provinces and by 10 per cent in Kassala,
and 20 per cent in Darfur and Kordofan Provinces. The total annual output
expected was 1,800 students.



- 10-
3.20   Other services to be provided by the IRECs included (a) a dispensary which
would fumish essential medicines and vaccines for the school children and the
people of the rural areas; organize community activities for cleaning the villages
and their surroundings, and provide services for pregnant women; (b) a farm where
students would practice and observe in order to develop useful skills for growing
crops and raising farm animals and cultivate the right attitude to agriculture;
farmers would be assisted through demonstrations how to use new techniques in
plant and animal growth and development suitable to their respective areas; (c) a
store to stock improved seeds and other agricultural inputs such as pesticides and
insecticides for distribution to the local farmers at appropriate seasonal periods. It
would also serve as the office of the agriculture teacher where he would receive
visiting farmers and discuss their farming problems with them; and (d) a workshop
to provide pre-vocational leaming opportunities for the pupils of the school to
develop appropriate manual skills and would also be used by youths and adults in
the aftemoons and evenings for vocational training.
Junior Secondary Schools
3.21   Three new Junior Secondary Schools (grades 7 - 9) were to be built in areas
in the Southem Regions where none existed, providing a total capacity of 600
student places and an expected annual output of 180. These facilities were to
assist the Govemment in providing places for 5 per cent of the relevant age-group
in the South compared with 14 per cent in the rest of the country, and at the same
time lay the foundation for meeting the enrolment for upper secondary level
institutions.
Bahkt-er-Ruda Teacher Training Enstitutes (BRTTI)
3.22   This institute (Northem Region) with an existing capacity of 480 places
was selected by the Govemment as the headquarters for curriculum development
and promotion of innovative methods of pre-service and in-service training for
rural education. The Project was to provide an extension to the institute including
160 student places for IREC type school teachers and a Curriculum Development
Center where continuous up-dating and evaluation of primary and secondary
schools curricula would be carried out, and where IREC teachers would be trained.
Wau Vocational Training Center (Wau VTC)
3.23   During the period of the civil war, much skilled manpower in the Southern
Provinces fled to neighbouring countries. Therefore in 1972 when a special Bank
Economic Mission visited Southern Sudan, the former reported an acute shortage of
skilled manpower needed to implement Govemment rural rehabilitation and
reconstruction programmes in the Southem Region, and recommended the
expansion of Wau VTC, then the only existing facility of its kind in the Region,
from 3 capacity of 160 to 360, where carpenters, mechanics, bricklayers,
electricians and such other skilled workers would be trained to meet the pressing
demand for skilled workers. Instructional equipment and training personnel for the
Center were to be provided by the Govemment of the Federal Republic of
Germany.



- II -
B.    Technical Assistance
3.24   The Project also provided for the cost of 25 man-years of specialists'
services and 6 man-years of over-seas fellowships for training 3 staff members
from the BRTTI, the total Technical Assistance component being US$1.3 million
for: (a) teacher education, curriculum development, rural education and farmer
cooperatives; (b) planning and carrying out a nationwide education sector review,
and (c) project administration and implementation including design and supervision
of construction.
Expected Benefits
3.25   According to the Appraisal Report, it was expected that:
(a)   the foundation for supplying the minimum manpower and human
resources  needs  for  the  rehabilitation  and  development
programmes for the poorest areas of the country would be flrmly
laid through the development of skills of diverse levels and types,
especially in the Southem Regions;
(b)    a reduction in the imbalance in educational opportunities between
the project provinces and the rest of the country would be made.
For example, the 7 - 12 year age-group would have 30 per cent
more available primary school places as against only 16 per cent in
1973; and junior secondary students (aged 13 - 15) would have 8 per
cent more places in 1980 as against 4 per cent in 1973;
(c)   the reorientation of education to attune the content of instruction
(BRTTI) to the socio-economic needs of the Sudan would be
attained through the development of skills of small farmers
(IRECs) reorienting the role of the primary school teachers to
make them community development agents (IRECs), and by
providing skilled workers (Wau VTC) for t6he rural rehabilitation
programme.

CHAPTER IV
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
a~.aiie 1in Project
4.1    A number of major changes were made during project implementation,
including the following:
(a)    changes to the building components,
(b)    changes to the method of administration,
(c)    changes to the provision of professional services,
(d)    changes to the closing date of the Agreement.
4.2    Building components were allocated as ten IRECs in the North while,
project schools in the South were reduced from 30 IRECs (intended for "self-help"
construction) to 14. The location of one of the junior secondary school was
changed from Akobo to Pibor and a senior secondary school (with seven staff
houses) was added at Juba (decisions taken December 1978).
4.3    The first change made to project administration was under Amendment I of
20 December 1976 when the Government wished to have two project units, one for
educational matters, within the Ministry of Education, and the other for technical
affairs established within the MCPW. However, on 2 November 1980, the two
project units were amalgamnated into one PIU.
4.4   In practice, contrary to provisions in the Agreement, professional services
were provided by MCPW, without charge to PIU. Amendment 11 of 10 September
1979 approved the reallocation of the withdrawal of proceeds.
4.5    The official closing date was 30 June 1982. Due to delays and lack of
progress in the civil works, the closing date was extended to 31 December 1983, by
Amendment m of 18 May 1982, but disbursement of funds previously committed
was until 28 August 1984.
Poc M
4.6    Based upon the experience with the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for
the first project, the Association recognized the need to strengthen the
administrative capability of the Borrower's PIU and appropriate measures were
proposed, but they did not seem  to have fully materialized.  Consequently,
implenentation was delayed by one year and inflation caused the Project to be
reduced in scope (Annex III).  However, PIU based in Khartoum  provided
management and administration and recognised basic differences between
conditions and coordination in the North and South of Sudan.
4.7   It was therefore decided to use the force account method in the North with
the MCPW constructing the IRECs with local materials. Management for project
school building required the construction of IRECs to be undertaken in terms of
direct labour on actual costs as a special project entrusted to the regional divisions
of MCPW in each locality. PlI in Khartoum worked in coordination with MCPW
divisions and was responsible for the supervision and progress of work. Reports
were received and discussed at the PIU, and decisions as when to continue work
were taken locally depending upon the availability of funds.  Bahkt-er-Ruda



- 14_-
Primary Teacher Training Institute and one IREC at Mileh were also constructed by
direct labour on actual costs, but under a resident engineer responsible directly to
PIU (decisions taken on 10 September 1979). The Resident Engineer and his work
force were paid by PIU. This method proved to be the most effective way of
managing the Project in North Sudan.
4.8    Construction in South Sudan was undertaken under a fixed sum contract,
utilizing a prefabricated building system and a contractor. This decision was
subject to detailed discussion and it was believed to have been the fastest method
to build in the South in the shortest possible time with the view to avoiding as
much as possible price escalation.  Unfortunately at that time, neither the
Borrower, nor the Association understood the magnitude of the complexity of the
problem of logistics in getting the prefabricated buildings from abroad, coupled
with long and difficult transportation problems, compounded by a scarcity of semi-
and skilled manpower.
4.9   In spite of a regional project unit at Juba, attempts to monitor and control
the building programme remained unsuccessful mainly due to the wide distribution
of project schools, often located in remote areas, where roads were non-existent or
impassable during rainy seasons. Consequently, project management was largely
outside the control of PIU (as well as the Unit Office established at Juba) and in
the hands of the contractor who, while working under difficult conditions, was
initially unable to apply the necessary management skills to complete the work in
hand. Prefabricated system panels and other materials were transported from
Europe into East Africa (Mombasa, Kenya) and then across Sudan to allocated sites.
Construction and assembly on site were remarkably quick, often carried out in a
matter of weeks.
4.10   As a result of these limitations, project management remained weak until
the two project units were unified in November 1980 and real progress in the South
was not made until 1982. Aspects of the constraints and difficulties encountered
are reflected in this Report under respective components. However, it should be
emphasized here that the achievements in the construction of school buildings in
the South is largely due to the determination of the Portuguese contractor to
complete as much as possible of his contract. Moreover, the use of a letter of
credit to allocate local funds directly to the Project (although not extended over
the whole implemnentation period) assisted to a degree in providing some financial
liquidity. It is also of significance to note that accounts of projects in the North
were kept in Arabic by the local engineer. On the other hand, accounts of projects
in the South were in English, and were therefore kept by the quantity surveyor
(expatriate), who was returned as a consultant for one month to finalize the
accounts for the contract in the South only. His return was planned to meet the
contractor and both agree?d on and signed the final account.
Physical luplementation
4.11   Considering the dispersed nature of the sites in both North and South
Regions and the logistical difficulties involved in a country with a weak
construction industry, the overall performance of the PIU was adequate. However,
a one year extension period had to be agreed with the Association, while some
project components remained unfinished at the time of the Completion Mission,
nine months after the extended Closing Date.



- 15 -
4.12   Of the 10 IRECs undertaken in the North, seven have been completed and
the other three are under construction. According to the Project Director, the
Govemment has approved LS430 thousand in the remaining portion of 198S Fiscal
Year to co-mplete their construction. At the time of the Completion Mission the
Bahkt-er-Ruda Primary Teacher Training Center had also been completed. The
PIJ Engineer responsible for activities in the North was able to visit from
Khartoum a number of times the Bahkt-er-Ruda Primary Teacher Training
Institute, but visits to the IRECs were more limited due to reasons given in
paragraph 4.1 1.
4.13   Of the fourteen IRECs undertaken in the South (para. 4.2), eleven were
built and three have been deleted. However, the local authorities were negotiating
with the contractor to complete them with the understanding that payment would
be made from local funds, according to the Project Director. At the time of the
Completion Mission these three had been abandoned as a result of security
problems. However, the extension to the Vocational Training Center at Wau has
been completed. Similarly, the three Junior Secondary Schools have been erected
and an additional senior secondary school has been built in Juba, together with
seven staff houses.  All completed buildings have been handed over to the
Govemment.
4.14   Delays in implementation and lack of project completion haev  been
attributed to a number of factors including:
(a)    uncoordinated  project management during  the  early  stages
(including inadequate staffing);
(b)    cancellation of two previous calls for tenders relating to building
materials and civil works (see para. 4.21);
(C)    cumbersome local tender procedures (see pars. ;.21 - 4.22);
(d)    insufficient counterpart funds whether in  foreign or local
currencies creating project payment problems)];
(e)    lack of control by the PIU over locatio . of project building sites;
(f)    general poor condition of the cor.struction ndustry, aggravated by
a chronic shortage of materials and skilled labour;
(g)    high inflation, threatening to caux major project cost overruns
which in tum necessitated a reduction in project scope;
(h)    logistic problems in procurement and distribution where, materials
were ordererd in bulk for all sites in the North, with no indication
of quantities required at individual sites2/;
(i)    security problems in the South created transportation difficulties
and further reduced accessibility to remote sites;
(j)    limitations  in  transporting  across  the  country  imported
construction materials from Port Sudan (some of which
deteriorated, or were subsequently lost).
1/    In the North, where only the import of major building materials was funded
by the Association, it was difficult for MCPW to maintain a building
programme with the receipt of small intermittant funding.
2/    Consequently, some basic materials were purchased locally to carry on
with the building work while imported materials were subsequently sold to
pay for road transportation and overcome financial liquidity problems.



-16-
4.15   Three aspects of site albocation are relevant to the project schools:
regional distributlon, accessibility, and local locations of school buildingsi/.  At
the beginning of the Project, regional distribution was undertaken according to a
list of criteria by governors of districts and executive council of districts.
Locations for project institutions were made according to the distribution of
existing schools and the education and training needs of catchment areas. The
locations of IRECs were proposed in areas lacking educational opportunities,
placing considerable emphasis on the Southem Region; IRECs were also proposed to
serve as focal points for development of village life offering education and training
facilities for adults, as well as formal primary school needs. Therefore, in the
early stages of the Project, the selection of sites was considered important to the
success of the school in the community, and was, therefore, determined by regional
authorities. All layouts were done by the PIU except four in the South because of
their inability to get tnere due to the rainy season and security risk. The Junior
Secondary School sites were chosen for provinces where most schools were
destroyed or damaged during the political disturbances in the Southem Region.
4.16   In reality, allocation of the 24 IREC school sites on a regional basis was
undertaken partly according to political expediency and partly for reasons of
security and hence accessibility in the Southem Region where at least five sites
were repositioned three times either for reasons of security or political
expediency. Consequently, a number of schools have been provided in remote and
inaccessible areas, including the Junior Secondary School at Pibor, where there is a
village of only a few huts and one or two solid houses. The nearest village is some
30 km away. Vehicles visit Pibor once a month during the dry season only. Similar
conditions exist at the IREC sites of Gumnruk and Bahr Naam (the latter located
some 10 km from Maridi with no other village in the vicinity). In contrast, one
IREC has been sited at Malek, located 30 km from Bor, with a regular bus service.
Two other IRECs have been constructed inside Bor Town. Moreover, standardised
site layouts designed by MCPW were not prepared for individual sites. Standard
plans were provided for the whole of Sudan regardless of regional differences.
4.17   MCPW was responsible for design of all buildings. Plans for a typical IREC
provided a full six class primary school (one stream) with additional facilities for
rural education and inforrmal programmes. Facilities also included a workshop with
stores and an administration block (all incorporated within a site of SOm x 32m as
shown in Annex IV.2). Each center included facilities to support courses for adults
in domestic science, health, village crafts and agriculture (incorporating a 4 ha.
farm). Sets of 25 standard drawings were prepared showing elementary plans,
I/   A further issue is related to the regional distribution of IRECs specifically.
Sites widely scattered rnay be allocated according to needs and/or political
expediency. A concentration of sites may provide opportunities for regional
balance and the monitoring of experience for future expansion. The level of
accessibility is relevant to the catchment area which the school facilities
serve as well as offering opportunities for transporting building materials and
labour during the construction period. Local site allocation is related to the
role school buildings are to play in the community and the facilities available.

elevations and some details all of which assume traditional methods of
construction. According to discussions with members of the PIU in Khartoum,
MCPW normally produces drawings according to the requirements of the sponsors.
When preparing these drawings, reference is sometimes made to old standard
drawings and minor or major changes are introduced to suit the particular project.
At other times, completely new drawings are made. In the case of the drawings of
IDA 2, they were completely new and were approved by all parties concerned. The
Mission reviewed the drawings for the North at the local Resident Engineer's office
at BRTTI. In many instances, standard toilets were badly sited and inappropriate
to the surrounding conditions and the customs of the people.
4.18   The gross areas provided from the architectural worksheets relate actual
construction areas for the indiviciual IRECs (6 per cent more) and Bahkt-er-Ruda
Primary Teacher Training Institute (2 per cent more). There is considerable
difference between appraisal estimates and actual areas as built in the Junior
Secondary Schools provided at Pibor (130 per cent increase) and Aweil (90 per cent
increase). Rumbek was reduced by 5 per cent in area, while the extension to the
Vocational Training Center at Wau was reduced by 35 per cent. The increases to
Pibor and Aweil schools and the additional secondary school, with seven staff
houses for Juba Day Secondary School comply with the wishes of the regional
authorities (see Annex IV.3).
4.19   If any changes in drawings during construction were needed this was
referred to MCPW's office for amendment where proper drawings were produced to
suit the changes needed. However, no system of revising and reissuing drawings
according to amendments was devised by MCPW (major changes were conveyed to
the PIU either verbally or in written form, but were not recorded graphically). In a
project of this magnitude, it is important to monitor amendments made to standard
drawings, in order to introduce changes and update designs, thus reflecting more
concisely the needs of the Ministry of Education. More accurate drawings based on
regional differences and site requirements are also likely to reduce the cost of
external works and expenditure on project implementation generally. In addition,
once buildings are complete, advice should be made available to the relevant
representatives of the Ministry of Education as to the kind of additions and
improvements that can be introduced (shaded areas, wind breaks, planting and
decoration) by the school, utilising local participation, thus allowing greater
community involvement.
4.20   In relating the standard designs prepared to the schools actually built,
three kinds of changes have been noted:
(a)    Changes to Site Layouts
The standard layouts provided by MCPW, as shown in Annex IV.2,
were adapted by the Resident Engineer in the North or by the contractor in the
South to fit the topography of the individual allocated sites or according to the
function of a particular unit, upon the request of the users. For example, at Mileh
IREC, the dispensary was moved from the center of the site (adjacent to four
classrooms) to near the boundary so as to avoid the noise and other distractions to
students caused by patients attending the clinic. The layout of dormitories and
dining hall at Bahkt-er-Ruda was changed upon the request of the BRTTI
authorities and referred in writing by the Resident Engineer to the PIU in
Khartoum for approval. However, site plan changes, either by resident engineers
or the contractor, were made purely on construction criteria without
environmental considerations.



- 18-
(b)    Changes to Construction
The standard working drawings were adapted according to the
means of construction in the region.  At Mileh IREC and the Bahkt-er-Ruda
Primary Teacher Training Institutes, the window details were changed from timber
to metall/ due to the presence of termites, while the cotton soil required
considerable variation to foundation design!/. This being a force account with
MCPW, construction changes agreed upon were not recorded on drawings. In the
South the standard drawings were adapted for a prefabricated system by the
contractor.
(c)    Changes to Building Uses
A number of changes were made by representatives of the Ministry
of Education to the uses allocated on standard plans, without reference to PIU.
Such changes occurred during the course of construction or after the school
buildings were handed over to the Ministry of Education. These changes include: (i)
reducing the capacity of Dormitory A at BRTTI from 40 to 20 by using single beds
rather than bunk beds as specified, and from 32 to 16 in Dormitory B for the same
reason; (ii) eliminating the store to the kitchen at BRTTI by removing the wall
between the kitchen and the store so as to provide a larger kitchen; (iii) converting
a classroom at the Training Center at BRTTI into a staff room and seminar room;
and (iv) conversion of the IREC at Malek into a senior secondary school, with 350
students, both in the South.
i.21  In the course of the contract period, several alternative construction
methods were considered for both Northem and So hem Regions. In the Northern
Region, civil works for the Teacher Training Institute in Bahkt-er-Ruda were
submitted twice for tendering with no response from contractors. Therefore the
Borrower and the Association decided that imported building materials should be
put to tender and all project components in the Northern Region should be
constructed by the MCPW utilizing force account method. All bids for imported
building materials received for the first tender in 1977 were rejected due to
inconsistent documents. Revised tender documents were prepared and reviewed by
the Association before being submitted for retendering. Bids were received in
March 1978 and evaluated by the Tender Board Committee including a
representative from the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The lowest bids in each of the
12 tender groups were, according to Govemment's regulation, submitted to the
MOF for final approval. As a result of delays for final approval (the end of August
1978), some bidders refused to accept a contract since the bid validity period
expired in June 1978. Successive bidders were awarded contracts in 9 out of 12
tender groups, for supply of building materials.

construction.
2/    Regarded as a major change in construction.



- 19 -
4.22  In the Southem Region, construction would have been undertaken through
self help to minimise costs, ensure relevance to local conditions and encourage
participation of the population. Lack of interest in self-help created a possible
cost overrun. Civil works for Wau Vocational Training Center were submitted for
tender without response from contractors. Consequently, the Borrower proposed
the use of a prefabricated building system for all project components to be located
in the Southem Region and documents were prepared and submitted for tendering.
However, the initial tender documents were released without review by the
Association and were incomplete, and as a result, the bids received were rejected.
Revised documents were prepared and reviewed by the Association before being
submitted for retendering and bids were received in November 1978, followed by
the Tender Board Committee's evaluation. At that time, the Regional Minister of
Education for the Southern Region expressed a strong reservation about the use of
prefabricated materials and felt they would be totally alien to the concepts of
rural education. The MCPW, the representatives of other Ministries, including the
Ministry of Housing and Public Utilities of the Southem Region as well as
specialists of other agencies maintained that the use of a prefabricated building
system was t - only feasible solution to carry out a construction programme of the
size envisaged within the next three to five years. The Govemment and in
particular the Regional Ministry of Education in Juba discussed the possibility of
having some of the IRECs in the Southern Region built by Voluntary Agencies, such
as the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the Norwegian Church Relief (NCR),
with the result that a cost estimate from each of these Voluntary Agencies was
submitted. However, the Govemment decided rnot to use the services of the above
two agencies because their cost estimate for each IREC was higher than prices
submitted for the prefabricated building system.  The Regional Minister of
Education later agreed to the use of prefabrication. The Govemrnment negotiated
with a Portuguese firm of contractors, being the lowest evaluated bidder.
4.23   The schools visited by the Completion Mission in the North were generally
well constructed. Farefaced brickwork was in good condition and concrete work
adequate. Steel roof trusses were assembled on site and erected into position. The
cotton soil of the Region requih ed expensive piling (in some places 2.20m in depth).
The cement floor finish was generally adequate. At the Juba Secondary School in
the South, the floor finish was inappropriately rubber tiles, a number becoming
unstuck as a result of the hot climate (the school is without electricity, while
electric fans have been installed). Prefabricated elements in the South consisted
of galvanised steel perimeter pillars, spaced at modular distances which received
panels (4 cm thick of insulation material, wrapped by steel sheets) for internal or
extemal walls. The overall superstructure was light and was calculated t resist
certain forces.
4.24   However, the general lack of surveys undertaken for schools in both North
and South Regions increased the cost of external works and hence the cost of
foundations in difficult soils. This aspect was not reflected in the standard working
drawings prepared by the MC PW.



-20 -
Fumiture
4.25   The PIU procured all necessary furniture items and fully furnished the
project schools through three contracts with the main supplier, the Greek Metal
Furniture Industry, as a result of international tendering. Furniture consignments
have also been delivered to the three schools under construction and sufficient
were purchased even for the three schools deleted in the South. In the schools
visited by the Completion Mission, some 10 - 15 per cent of fumiture was damaged
in transit, mainly blackboards, desks and chairs. Wood work and metal work
benches were inadequate and more appropriate fumiture was produced locally in
the workshop at Bahkt-er-Ruda. The latter was more functional and stronger than
that imported. Fumiture was generally of good quality and sufficient, although the
quality of wood and methods of assembly were already causing maintenance
problems. No provision is made for maintenance of fumiture in the schools and
according to one head master, repairs are to be carried out by the pupils under
supervision. Heavier work would be sent for repair to Bahkt-er-Ruda. If the
fumiture is to survive over any length of time, regular maintenance and supervision
will be necessary. Metal cupboards at Bahkt-er-Ruda and at Mileh remained empty
and significantly under used.
Equipment
4.26   All equipment was procured and delivered to  PIU, Khartoum, for
distribution including that for the Wau Vocational Training Center and workshop
equipment for all 24 IRECs which was ordered through UNICEF.  Unesco
consultants assisted in the preparation of final lists.  The equipment for the
projects schools in Southern Sudan was sent to Juba for distribution. In the North,
equipment was distributed to sites from Khartoum. At the time of the Completion
Mission, all equipment had been delivered to the different sites. Equipment at the
school sites visited (including the Bahkt-er-Ruda Primary Teacher Training
Institute) remained underused and badly stored (although the Training Institute has
been in use for over a year). Some of the equipment, such as soldering irons, were
cumbersome and heavy for young children to use, while others, such as pressure
cookers, were inappropriate in villages without water and elec ricity.
Maintenarnce
4.27   Maintenance of buildings, fumiture and equipment is the responsibility of
the different Ministries involved. The maintenance of buildings is undertaken by
MCPW. As a rule, repairs to buildings are carried out every three years. In the
case of structure problems in any building (such as the significance of the cotton
soil at Bahkt-er-Ruda) estimates are made immediately and funds are requested for
maintenance. The Director of Education is also able to undertake minor repairs to
buildings which can be absorbed within his own budget.  At Bahkt-er-Ruda
(particularly in the teachers' dormitories) there is already an urgent need for
repairs, with all toilets either broken or not working. Similarly, the prefabricated
building system in the South will need to be maintained once the contractor hes
left the country (up to now, the contractor has voluntarily carried out repairs). For
example, the two IRECs built in Bor Town need painting and that at Otek requires
repairs where some panels have been blown off by the wind. In particular, although
not included in the Project, fencing is urgently needed at Juba Day School to
prevent villagers from free access to the ablution areas which have been closed for
a long time.

Technical Assistance
4.28  In order to effectively implement the proposed reforms in education,
including curriculum development, teacher education, project implementation and
implementation of the IREC programmes, the Project included 25 man-years of
specialists services, and 6 man-years of overseas fellowships in order to raise the
professional level of teachers at BRTTI. The combined cost of this component was
estimated to be US$1,326,000.
4.29   Under a contract signed in December 1976, and revised in 1978, between
Unesco and the Govemment, the former carried out the Technical Assistance
programme which was completed in 1981. It was not always possible to harmonize
the arrival of specialists with the work programme, and in such cases specialists
left when they were most needed. By and large, however, most of the specialists
arrived at the proper time and performed satisfactorily. Of the 25 man-years
allocated, only th.e procurement post (2 man-years) was cancelled, and the senior
rural educator (3 man-years) was not recruited.  However, the duration of
specialists services were adjusted according to felt needs during implementation
and therefore were not always in accordance with Appraisal time allocation.
Although six man-years of fellowships were allocated for three fellows from
BRTTI, only 5.3 years were used, but seven persons received specialized training.
Employment status of the seven fellows at the time of the Completion Mission was:
BRTTI 2; Ministry of Education Headquarters 1; Balla Ahmed El Abid Secondary
School 1; one each seconded to Yemen and Saudia Arabia; one in Saudia Arabia.
Five fellows studied in the United Kingdom; one each in Canada, and Italy. Further
details are presented in Annex NV.5. Due to an extension of the quantity surveyors'
contract by two years and assigning a quantity sur eyor to Juba PIU cost estimates
were exceeded by about 6 per cent totaling US$1,410,000. The quantity surveyor
later returned as a consultant to close the accounts for the Southem Project
comnponents. Details of the original allocated man-years and actual specialists
services are given in Annex IV.6. Listed below are the actual specialists and
fellowships as compared with the original estimate.

4.30   An effective component of any future Technical Assistance programme
would be the assignment of technical staff to provide basic instructions as to the
correct use, method of storage and maintenance of fumiture, equipment and
materials with the view to maximizing the life and use of them at a low
maintenance cost.
Covenants
4.31  In the early stages, due to management problems and lack of appropriate
staff, the Borrower had difficulties in carrying out the Project efficiently. At the
final stages, however, strong efforts were made to overcome many obstacles and
comply with the Association's conditions. Credit conditions have been complied
with in accordance with the Agreement (see Annex IV.6).
Risks Involved
4.32   The three major risks involved in the Project (Appraisal Report, paragraph
6.04) were: (i) fear that transportation difficulties would cause more serious
problems and delays than foreseen at Appraisal; (ii) impracticality of the self-help
scheme in the South; and (iii) interministerial coordination difficulties in
implementing the IREC programme. The solution proposed in the Appraisal Report
to the transportation problems anticipated in the Sudan was the establishment of a
sub-project unit at 3uba. This proved to be of some value but could not adequately
cope with the scale of supervision needed in remote and inaccessible areas. Self-
help was most effective in the South at a time (prior to project Appraisal) when
many communities participated in the expansion of existing schools from four to
six classroom. However, when asked to build schools on new sites as dictated by
centralized govemment authorities with IDA involvement, communities were not
motivated to take part. In the event, self help, as a method of construction had to
be abandoned (para. 4.22) and (reluctantly) a prefabricated system was used
throughout the Southern Region. Attemps to provide fnterministerial coordination
were successful. However, extensive delays in the construction period, eventually
lead to loss of interest and momentum in cooperation between the various
departments. Nevertheless, although solutions had limited success in extenuating
circumstances, the risks involved were correctly identified in the Appraisal Report.

CHAPTER V
PRO3ECT COSTS
CapiSa Costs
5.1    As implemented the final cost of the Project was LS 13.068 million, or
about US$14.688 million, about 70 per cent more (or 22 per cent less calculated in
US$) than Appraisal Estimates (see para. 4.12 and 4.13).
5.2    Comparison of the Project costs and implementation schedule, as
estimated at Appraisal and as actually implemented, is shown in Annexes V.1 and
V.2. At Appraisal, total estimated cost including contingencies, taxes and financial
contributions by other agencies was LS 7.534 million or US$ 18.910 million1/. As
appraised, the Bank group financing of US$ 10 million was to amount to 53 per cent
of the project cost. As implemented, the Credit financed 70 per cent of the final
cost2l. The financial participation of other agencies was limited to US$ 97,2753/
in place of US$ 600,000, amounting to 84 per cent less than Appraisal estimates
(para. 4.18 and 6.18).
5.3    A comparison of Appraisal estimates and actual costs, by category, is
shown in Annex V.3.
5.4    As compared with the Appraisal estimates, including contingencies,
fumiture and administration categories had major overrun costs, of which furniture
was the most significant, as shown in Annex V.3. The overrun on fumiture costs
was increased because the lowest bidder's price was about US$ 500,000 higher than
allocated in the Agreement. The Govemment subsequently reduced the fumiture
quantity by about 25 per cent. This meant that 30 to 50 per cent of class rooms
built were not provided with desks and chairs. The PIU was authorized by the
Association to fully furnish the project schools through a further contract, by
utilizing part of the remaining uncommitted credit funds. The cost increase for
Project Administration (between +200 and +70 per cent) is explained by the
increase of work load due to project extensions of 24 months from the Credit
Closing Date. Increased cost for Technical Assistance is also mainly due to the
extension of the quantity survey contract in accordance with revised project
completion dates (para. 4.29). Professional services were not charged to the
Project as these were undertaken by MCPW throughout the implementation period.
The other categories showed reduction. The reduced cost for equipment (between
-68 and -78 per cent respectively) arose from revised lists for procurement and
the reduced grant from the Government of the Republic of Germany for tie Wau
Vocational Training Center4/; conceming the civil works (between -9 and -28 per
cent respectively), the reduction in cost is mainly due to a diminishing number of
IRECs in the South. It should be noted that for individual IRECs, Appraisal
estimates were lower than actual costs.
1/    Appraisal, overall estimates include US$ 1.9 million equivalent as taxes.
2/    Calculated in US$.
3/    Equivalent to DM 208,380.
4/    The Sudan Government decided to reduce the overall enrolment capacity
from 360 to 300 student places (decision taken 18 May 1976).



- 24 -
5.5   In comparision with Appraisal estimates, the proportion of funds spent on
construction, fumiture and equipment were as follows:
Percentage Allocation
Construction   Furniture    Equipment     Ot;her
Appraisal Estimates           78%          3%           7%           12%
Actual Spent                  73%          11%          2%           13%
Areas and Costs per Student Places
5.6    Average cost per square meter and cost per student compared with
Appraisal Estimates are shown in Annex V.4.
5.7    Comparison of gross areas per institution between Appraisal Estimates and
actual are shown in Annex IV.3.
5.8    The cost per student place_/ for IRECs in the North is only 9 per cent
below Appraisal and 77.2/ per cent above in the South. The latter is attributed to
the high overall cost of ultimately building only 11 IRECs by a prefabricated
building system (including materials abandoned on 3 other sites) and the increase in
furniture costs. The cost per student for the Bahkt-er-Ruda Primary Teacher
Training Institute is 40 per cent below Appraisal as a result of reduced building
costs3/ and equipment. The cost per student place for the three Junior Secondary
Schools at Rumbek, Aweil and Pibor were -35, +19 and +34 respectively in relation
to Appraisal estimates. The areas of the two latter schools were substantially
increased. In the case of the Wau Vocational Training Center, the cost reduction is
mainly due to the reduction of area and equipment.
Disbursenient
5.9    Disbursements from Credit were completed in August 1984. A comparison
of the actual and estimated disbursement is in Annex V.5. A comparision oi the
original and actual allocation of the Credit proceeds by category is shown in the
Basic Data (page ii).
1/    An important element in the actual cost figures is the devaluation of LS in
relation to US$, as can be seen in the footnote of Annex V.3.
2/    On the basis of 14 IRECs, cost per student place of IRECs in South is 40
per cent above Appraisal Estimate.
3/    Project construction undertaken by the Project Implementation Unit,
therefore, directs monitoring of costs.

CHAPTER VI
INITt IAL PRO3ECT OPERATING OUTCOMES
Overview
6.1    The Project was developed with four major objectives: ti) provision of
training facilities for out-of-school youths and adults by establishing forty
Integrated Rural Education Centers which were to becorme focal points for
development of village life, and centers of adult education and training in areas
where fewest educational opportunities were available; tii) up-rading and
providing facilities for primary and junior secondary education by developing
primary school programmes at the IRECs and establishing three junior secondary
schools in areas in the Southem Region where none existed as a result of damages
caused by the civil disturbances; (iii) strengthening teacher education and
curriculum  development by expanding the BR.TI and providing it with a
Curriculum Development Center where prototype teaching materials would be
developed and innovative methods of pre-service and in-service training for rural
education would be promoted; and (iv) expanding the training of skiled workers by
expanding the Wau Vocational Training Center to provide the type of technicians
needed for the implementation of Govemment reconstruction and rehabilitation
programmes resulting from the civil disturbances when many people fled to
neighbouring countries. Available data are very limited due to communication
problems in remote areas where most of the institutions are located and where
security risk is high. However, the overall achievement in terms of institutions
built and enrolment11 as compared with planned are presented in the table below:

6.2    The main problem the Sudan faced at the time of project gestation was an
acute shortage of skilled manpower at the sub-professional and teacher training
levels. The Govemment was, therefore, faced with the need for teadjustments in
its training, and use of human resources and for developing a national learning
system which would take into account the wide ecological and ethnical differences
in the country, regional imbalances between supply and requirements of
educational outputs especially among secondary school leavers and dropouts who
joined the labour force without the required basic skills and attitudes on which to
build on-the-job training and experience, and development of a long-term strategy
for rural development taking into consideration the agricultural character and
potential of the country's economy and society.
6.3    The general acute shortage of skilled manpower needed for national
reconstruction also affected the Project in that it suffered from transfer of
personnel by the Govemrnment and migration from Govemrnment jobs to Gulf States.
In this connection, the PIU lost five engineers (one being a Deputy Director), two
foremen, all of whom left Grrernment employment. On the other hand, two
accountants and three educationalists were transferred.  An expatriate was
required to execute the World Bank procedures and had to return as a Unesco
consultant to close the books (see also paras. 4.10 and 4.29). There has been no
procurement specialist in the PiU.  Nevertheless, the Project has caused
marnagement expertise to improve.
6.4    The Project has provided the Sudan with an increased training potential at
both the sub-professional and teacher training levels, expanded basic educational
opportunities to remote areas, and laid the foundation for meeting enrolment for
upper secondary and university level institutions. However, it is practically
impossible at this atage to estimate the extent to which original project objectives
will be met although project concept and design were sound and in accordance with
the country's education needs and with Government's objectives and development
strategy. Major factors which militated against early achievement of project
objectives include: (i) transportation difficulties resulting in delay in construction;
(ii) chronic shortage of construction materials and skilled labour; (iii) location of
institutions in widely scattered and thinly populated remote areas; and (iv) security
problems in the South causing delays resulting in abandonment and eventually
deletion of three project IRECs due to cost overruns. Some other elements which
affected project implementation and initial outcomes were: (i) creation of two
PlUs and four years later amalgamating them for greater efficiency; (ii) reduction
of 30 IRECs, in the South, to 14 after it became clear that the plan to have them
constructed on a "self-help" basis would not materialize; (iii) relocation of Akobo
Junior Secondary School to Pibor; (iv) relocation, in the South, of 4 IRECs for
security reasons (para. 4.16), and (v) the addition of Juba Secondary Day School to
the Project.  Consequently, some of the IRECs have started operating only
recently, three are still under construction in the North, and three were deleted in
the South (paras. 4.12 and 4.13).
6.5    As a resuslt of the above factors, data are not easily available and
collection is difficult.  Therefore, project achievements would have to be
monitored over a period of about three to five years, at which time most of the
project institutions should have produced their first output. This exercise would
involve the systematic collection of data on enrolment, drop-outs, promotion and
repetition rates, teacher availability and qualification, curriculum development,
development and production of teaching materials, production and eamings of
farmers involved in the Project, dispensary attendance, the impact of health
activities in the community and, in general, adult activities, attendance and
outcomes, etc.

ttezrated Rural Education Centers CIRECs)
6.6    At the time of project generation, the Govemment decided that since
about 90 jier cent of the population was rural, the most appropriate development
strategy for rural transformation was the establishment of IRECs which would
become the focal point of village life by providing 12,000 new places in basic
education and training to children of regular school age and to out-of-school youths
and adults. However, as a result of the many problems encountered during project
implementation, 16 of the 30 which were to be built in the South under self-help
scheme, were deleted because of poor response by villagers, and later, after much
delay, 3 of the remaining 14 were also deleted because of inflation which would
have led to cost overrun; 3 of the 10 in the North are still under construction (para.
4.12 and 4.13). Therefore only a total of 18 of the original 40 have been completed
- 7 in the North and 11 in the South. The total loss in student places resulting from
the above circumstances is 6,600, leaving 5,400 of the original 12,000 student
places.
6.7   The total annual output expected was 1,800 students, representing a 10 per
cent increase in the Southern Provinces and more student places in the areas of the
provinces of Kassala in the North East, where only 10 per cent of eligible primary
school children found places and 20 per cent in Darfur and Kodojan Provinces in the
North West. Although 18 IRECs have been completed, only 16 are serving their
originai purpose. The army has temporarily occupied the Danger Shufu IREC (5-3)
in the South and the one at Malek (S-5) has been converted to a Senior Secondary
School with 350 students. Therefore only 4,800 (40 per cent) student places are
available of which 352 are known to have been occupied as shown below:

6.8   It is too early to know what the annual output wili be from this number.
The Government should be urged to monitor accurately the progress of these IRECs
and others that may open later, over a period of about six years when a first class
would have completed the primary education cycle of six years. If the successful
two-year experimental IREC programme can be used as a predictable yardstick,
then the future of the IRECs is promising. However, a note of caution should be
sounded conceming IRECs especially in the South, where population density is
about 7 persons per square kilometer, and where villages are widely dispersed only
with family groups scattered on their farms. A synopsis of the experimental
programme is given in Annex VI.2.

Seondarv EhMcation
6.9    Several junior secondary schools (grades 7 - 9) we-e badly damaged in the
Southern Region during the civil distrubances. As a result only about 17 per cent
of students who completed primary school could find places in junior secondary
schools. Therefore at the time of project generation, the Bank proposed to assist
the Government in its rehabilitation of some of those damaged schools by providing
three new schools with a total capacity of 600 students and an expected output of
180 per annum in areas where no junior secondary schools existed. This number of
student places was to increase total new places provided by the Govemment and
multilateral agencies to 2,000, thereby providing places for about 5 per cent of the
relevant age-group in the South compared with 14 per cent in the rest of the
country. At the same time these 2,000 places were intended to lay the foundation
for the development of high and middle level manpower by meeting enrolment
requirements of upper secondary level institutions and subsequently university
entrance. These schools have been built, equipped and fumiture has been installed.
Nevertheless, they were not functioning and no further information about them was
available to the Mission, with the exception that: (a) the site at Akobo was changed
to Pibor and (b) the top of one dormitory unit was blown off by the wind. No action
had been taken to repair it because of the high security risk involved (para. 4.2).
Zuba Day Secondary School (grades 10 - 12)
6.t0   This school was not included in the original project. However, when the
decision to reduce the 30 IRECs in the South to 14 was taken in December 1978,
the Bank agreed, upon the Government's request, to build the Juba Day Secondary
School and seven staff houses (para. 4.2), in order to provide educational
opportunities for students who otherwise had nowhere to go to further their
education.
6.11   3uba Day Secondary School is an academic secondary school and operates
in two shifts with the third year class operating in the morning and the first and
second year classes attending in the afternoon from 12:45 to 5:30. There are two
laboratories: one chemistry-physics and one biology, but lecture-demonstration is
the method mostly used in teaching. Laboratory equipment is not used very much
because (a) there is no electricity and (b) practicals are not required on the
examinations. Therefore teachers do not bother about conducting experirrents,
even those that could be improvised.
6.12   Although built for a capacity of 540 students, the school began with 800 (14
per cent girls) in its third year of operation (1983/84) and ended the year with 742
students reflecting a drop-out rate of 7.25 per cent. 393 students sat for the
National Examination, but the results have not been made available to the
Completion Mission.
6.13   The authorities wish to make this school a MODEL for the region;
community participation is encouraging, and the school has potential for the
future. However, the general qualification of the staff seems somewhat weak for
an academic senior secondary as shown below:



- 29 -
Staff Qualification   Percentage
Master's Degree            7.6
Bachelor's Degree         30.8
Diplomas                  38.5
Certificates              23.1
Total                    100.0
3uba Day Secondary School could become the model school desired provided the
following measures are taken as soon as possible: (a) up-grading of staff; (b)
improvements in science teaching; (c) library development; (d) stronger financial
support from the Regional Ministry of Servicesil; (e) closer cooperation with the
University of Juba; and (f) establishment of a good maintenance programme.
Further details on 3uba Day Secondary School are given in Annex V1.3.
6.14   Since no data concerning the three new junior secondary schools are
available, the Borrower should be requested to follow-up progress when possible
and provide the Association with data about enrolment, curriculum, drop-outs and
repetition rates, teachers available and their qualifications, and other internal
efficiency elements. This data collection should also include Juba Senior Secondary
School, and the Senior Secondary School which was converted from the IREC at
Malek (para. 4.20 (c) ).
Bahkt-er-Ruda Teacher Tran  Institute (BRTTJ)
6.15   This institute was selected by the Government to become the headquarters
for curriculum development and promotion of innovative methods of pr-service
and in-service training for rural education. At - * time of project generation, it
was recognized that without properly trained teadiers the IRECs would not provide
the type of educational programme envisaged for rural transformation. The
Project, therefore, provided an extension to the BRTTI including 160 student places
for IREC type school teachers to be trained and a Curriculum Development Center
where continuous up-dating and evaluation of primary and secondary school
curricula would be carried out, and prototype teaching materials would be
developed. One IREC was to be established in an appropriate village accessible to
BRTTI to serve as laboratory for teacher trainees. In this connection, the Project
provided for two man-years each for a curriculum development specialist and a
rural education specialist to assist in planning, organizing and supervising the
programme of the proposed CDC and to help the training of primary and junior
secondary school teachers in rural education. In addition, six man-years of
fellowship were provided for training three staff members of the BRTTI in
development of curricula, teaching aids and materials, and rural education.
1/    The Minister guaranteed (future) Regional support, but emphasized that the
city has out-grown the facilities - electricity, water and other services -
and budgeting contraints are very acute.



- 30 -
6.16   The CDC was established and a full-time director, who was still in post
during the visit af tne Completion Mission, was appointed.  All heads of
departments at BRTTI are members of the Center. The IREC experimental
curriculum was developed and tried out in two schools, El Talha and El Banjadeed
(Annex V.l.) and based upon feedback the final version was published in Arabic in
1983 (Annex VI.5). The 2Mission visited the IREC experimental school at El Talha,
and talked with some villagers, who expressed their satisfaction with the
agricultural programme and cultural activities.
6.17   The IREC curriculum has practical subjects and therefore requires at least
two specially trained teachers - one in home science and the other in pre-
vocational subjects, making a total of ten teachers as compared with eight
teachers in the ordinary primary school. The new IREC curriculum is now being
used in the IRECs, and 35 per cent of the weekly periods is deroted to practical
subjects including community development, basic agriculture, applied home
science, health and sanitation and metal and wood work.
6.18   The seven fellows who benefited from  the overseas fellowship had
returned, but only two were employed at the institution (para. 4.29), and the one in
Teaching Aids was away on holiday.  Therefore, the Mission did not see the
teaching aids and materials produced, despite all efforts made to visit the
production unit. However, some teacher guides, references, and pupil booklets
produced were seen by the Mission in the Director's Office. They are all in Arabic
and their English translated titles are listed in Annex VI.7. The specialists in
curriculum development and rural education assisted in developing the IREC trial
curriculum, participated in supervising its implementation and producing the final
version, and helped in training the first group of IREC teachers.
Wau Vocational Trahing Center (Wau VTC)
6.19   During the period of the civil war, much skilled manpower in the Southem
Provinces fled to neighbouring countries. Therefore in 1972 when a special Bank
Economic Mission visited Southem Sudan the former reported an acute shortage of
skilled manpower needed to implement Government rural rehabilitation and
reconstruction programmes in the Southern Region, and recommended the
expansion of Wau VTC, then the only existing facility of its kind in the Region,
from a capacity of 160 to 360, where carpenters, mechanics, bricklayers,
electricians and such other skilled w.orkers would be trained to meet the pressing
demand for skilled workers. Instructional equipment for the Center was to be
provided by the Govemment of the Federal Republic of Germany, which later
reduced its grant for the Center from US$600,000 at Appraisal to about US$97,000.
The Sudan Government, therefore, decided in May 1976 to reduce the extension to
the Center by 35 per cent and student overall enrolment capacity from 360 to 300
student places. This meant providing only 140 new places rather than 200.
6.20   The revised expansion was made and the facilities are being fully used,
according to the Juba PIU Director. Originally this Center was under the Ministry
of Public Service, but since regionalisation it has been placed under the Ministry of
Finance with the view to obtaining necessary funds more quickly for its operation.
No data were available to the Mission and because of difficulty and uncertainty in
travel schedules, the Mission did not visit Wau.

CHAPTER VHl
BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
7.1   The overall performance of the Bank was appropriate to the circumstances
prevailing at Appraisal and implementation.
7.2   The Government and IDA established an intensive and healthy dialogue at
the very beginning of project generation and maintained clear communication
throughout the life of the Project.
7.3    Details of the 25 IDA Supervision and other missions can be found under
Mission Data (page v).
7.4   The interval between missions was about five months, but with the range of
intervals varying from two to twelve months, with an exceptional 13-month (July
1980 - August/September 1981) interval. A mission averaged seven days in the
country. Sixty-two per cent of the missions were in the 3-4 months bracket and 21
per cent were in the 5-6 months period. All missions had to visit Khartoum; Bahkt-
er-Ruda was visited 6 times, Juba 4 and 6 other places!/ once each.
7.5   Supervision missions monitored the physical implementation progress, and
despite the many missions in Khartoum at the Ministry of Education and MCPW,
they could do very little to solve the vexing financial problems; managerial
problems were improved by the amalgamation of the two project units, but
management weaknesses of the contractor remained until the Project was 15
months behind the original implementation period at which time the Government
took a strong stand in April 1981. Of the 25 Supervision Missions, 12 were by an
architect, 4 by the Agricultural Educator, 4 by the Architect and Agricultural
Educator together, and the other 5 were composed of various combinations of
personnel.
7.6   The IREC concept was new to Sudan and without a model. Therefore
lengthy discussions and explanations were necessary before project agreement was
reached. Although this was a new type of educational facility, a pilot scheme was
not undertaken. Rather the 40 IRECs were located all over the country in an
attempt to reduce as quickly as possible the existing educational imbalances.
However, the approved standard design, prepared by MCPW, did not take into
consideration Regional differences. The concept and design of the secondary
schools were more appropriate to Sudan's conditions.
7.7   The IDA adopted a flexible attitude in its attempt to assist the Borrower in
meeting the basic project objectives by approving reallocation of proceeds among
Credit Categories, extending the Closing Date until 30 June 1983, and the
disbursement period to 30 June 1984. Site changes, which were approved by MA,
were not always to the advantage of the contractor, but neither the Borrower nor
IDA could do anything since the Regional authorities had more influence over such
changes (see also para. 4.15 and 4.16).
7.8   In summary, the overall performance of the Bank can be considered as
being good and a proper working relationship was established with the Borrower.

Detail Analysis of Physical Facilities
At Mileh IREC, White Nile Province
ProJect Managemet:
Mileh IREC (and the Bahkt-er-Ruda Teacher Training Institute) were
managed directly by the Project Implementation Unit in Khartoum. The Resident
Engineer and labour force were paid by the Project Implementation Unit direct.
Both institutions were relatively close to Khartoum (within 4 hours joumey by car)
so that it was possible to organise regular meetings and visits to both sites. In
spite of initial difficulties, the progress and control of construction, in comparison
to other sites in the north, went relatively smoothly.
Physical Implementation:
Although imported materials were available in Port Sudan from about
March 1979, local funds were not available to transport them to the school site.
There were also major difficulties in finding suitable labour to undertake work
(other international agencies were also building projects in the region, offering
much higher wages and taking on all available skilled labour at the time).
Foundations were dug by the beginning of 1980, but were abandoned for almost a
year, due to lack of materials and labour. Basic materials had to be purchased
locally to continue work and imported materials were subsequently sold. By March
1981, the buildings had reached roof 'evel. However, because of the pressing need
to have the Teacher Training Institute at Bahkt-er-Ruda ready for the training of
IREC tea'lhers, work at Mileh was stopped and the school was completed by
3anuary 1984.
Site:
Mileh IREC is within the vicinity of five villages (see also Annex VI.1,
page 1), ranging from I to 3 km from the school. A survey of the site was
undertaken and the standard layouts was pegged out according to drawings sent
from Khartoum (in the case of Bahkt-er-Ruda, the siting of dormitories was totally
changed from the site plan provided). The Mileh site is barren, away from the
villages, with strong north winds throwing a great deal of sand. The school has no
fence and is without tree planting. A canal in the vicinity is to be brought closer
to the School to allow water for planting. This should have been done prior to
building. There are no services provided and the school is without water and
electricity, which were not included in the project.  Water is brought by
tanker,daily from Bahkt-er-Ruda. Electricity is unlikely to be supplied in the
foreseeable future.

Annex IV.4
page 3J4
Design:
The layout is the standard school supplied and the rooms are adequate for
their purpose. The administrative block is located centrally with access to the
other four teaching blocks. The location of the two ablution blocks (pit latrines)
were found to be too exposed and were subsequently sited to one side rather than
on the center axis. Residential accommodation consisted of a house for the
headmaster and four houses for teachers. Although the school had started, none of
the houses were yet occupied. A shaded, gathering place for the school was
lacking. Inside as well as outside, no attempts were made so far to inject life into
the buildings (e.g. display of material, notice boards to show work carried out,
display of information etc.). Shaded and protected areas could be provided by
simple traditional materials and possibly built by villagers, thus creating a better
setting for the school children, as well as encouraging the participation of the
surrounding communities.
Construction:
The school is generally well constructed of 35 cm fare faced brickwork
(plastered and painted internally), with steel trusses supporting corrigated iron
sheets. Timber windows (as shown on the working drawings) were altered to metal
to avoid the effect of termites. The floor was farefaced cement. Due to the
presence of cotton soil, special foundations were needed (not shown on the standard
set of drawings). Foundations consisted of concrete piles (in some places 2.20 cm
deep, but normally 1.50 cm) on a 30 cm R.C. raft, with an exposed ringbeam.
Adequate quality of construction may be attributed to direct involvement of the
resident engineer working directly from the Project Implementation Unit.
Furniture and Equipmant
Arrival of fumiture and equipment took place some 18 months before the
completion of the school and were stored in part of the area already built. Some
15 per cent of the furniture was damaged (either in transit or storage). This was
mainly blackboards, desks, chairs, with a number of metal cupboards needing
rewelding). The wood work benches were too fragile and easily damaged. New
benches (as well as for metal work) were designed and made by the resident
engineer's work force. A number of desks (plastic faced) were becoming unstuck,
while others were split and could not be repaired. Metal cupboards fixed to walls
remained empty, with little apparant use (the same was true at the Teacher
Training Institute at Bahkt-er-Ruda which was in operation for a year).
Equipment has not been used yet and remains in piles in original cartons.
Instruction is required as to the correct use and storage of equipment (e.g. "T"
squares for drawing should have been hung from the wail to avoid buckling).
Similarly, surgical material was not stored in cupboards but was left on open
shelves (the situation was much worse at Bahkt-er-Ruda, where materials were
underused and badly stored, after a year of service). Some equipment appeared
extravagant in relation to community life. In a school (and surrounding villages)
without water and electricity, the supply of pressure cookers (still in plastic bags)
for domestic science lessons appeared out of place.



Annex IV.A                       - 42 -

Maknenance:
Provision was not made for maintenance (other than the standard provided
by the meagre resources of MCPW). Furniture and equlpment will also need
regular maintenance, but no provision is made other than the possibility of
furniture being repaired by school children, under teacher supervision. Maintenance
is therefore likely to be a major problem in the near future.
