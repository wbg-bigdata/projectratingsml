 A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE
 1. Countryandsector issues
 1.     Dominica has been successful in stabilizing its economy from a near crisis in 2001-2002
 when output contracted by some 10 percent. The crisis was, in large part, the result of the
 expansionary fiscal policy pursued by the Government in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A
 confluence of adverse factors in 2001, including a severe drought, the adverse impact of the
 September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, on the tourism industry, the accumulation of arrears, and
 very limited access to external financing pushed the economy into a deep recession. The overall
public sector balance deteriorated from a surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP in 1995/1996 to a deficit
of 10.9 percent of GDP by 2000/2001 and the public debt peaked at 130.8 percent of GDP in
 2003. The Country Poverty Assessment (CPA) conducted in 2002 found that 39 percent of the
populationand 29 percent of the households inDominicawere poor.

2.      In mid-2003, the government adopted a focused two-stage adjustment strategy which
sought to foster growth and ensure debt sustainability. The first stage focused on achieving
macroeconomic stability through a large fiscal adjustment and collaborative debt restructuring.
This effort was supported by an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and the
Bank's Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) in 2004. The economy stabilized in
2004, with GDP growth of 3.6 percent compared with a GDP contraction of 4.7 percent in 2002.
Inflation which had risen from 0.4 percent in 2002 to 2.9 percent in 2003 fell to 0.8 percent in
2004. The large increase in imports (driven largely by the tourism sector) in the face of slower
growth in exports, led to a worsening of the current account of the balance of payments from a
deficit of 13.8 percent of GDP in 2002 to a larger deficit of 17.2 percent of GDP in 2004. The
overall central government balance improved from a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to a
much smaller deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004. Over the same period, the primary balance
improved from a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP to a surplus of 3.6 percent of GDP. The stock of
public sector debt also fell from 126.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to 116.1 percent of GDP in 2004.

3.      The improvement in Dominica's debt situation has resulted largely from a restructuring
of Dominica's official debt under the Paris Club framework. About 72 percent of eligible debt
has been restructured. However, closure to the debt restructuring has been hampered by three
large nonparticipating creditors. Inthe meantime, new bonds have been issued to all participating
creditors and these new bonds are now traded on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange
(ECSE).The debt sustainability analysis for Dominica completed in 2005 shows that the 3
percent of GDP central government primary surplus being targeted under the current PRGF
would ensure a gradual decline in debt, provided growth remains at current levels' and Dominica
Social Security's (DSS) finances are improved. However, the public debt dynamics remain very
sensitive to both the assumed primary surplus and the economic growth rate. Abstracting from
DSS deficits, if a primary surplus of just 2 percent of GDP were to be targeted, the debt to GDP
ratio would remain above 80 percent through 2015. In a similar vein, an average growth
performance of 1to 2 percent during the projectionperiod would result in a similar very gradual



1GDPgrowth has averaged about 3 percentinthe last two years.

 decline in public debt. In both cases, the inclusion of DSS deficits projected under current
 policies would put the debt back on an unsustainabletrajectory.

 4.     The second stage of the adjustment strategy, being implemented by the new Government
 of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit i s aimed at implementingkey structural reforms to establish
 the basis for private sector-led sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The authorities have
 repeatedly stressed their desire to see the private sector play a dominant role in the economy.
 This second stage of the adjustment strategy, based on continuing fiscal restraint and structural
 reforms, as well as on measures to foster growth and reduce poverty, including maintaining and
 strengthening the social safety net, constitutes a major pillar of the Government's Medium-term
 Growth and Social Protection Strategy (GSPS).

 5.     The GSPS which encapsulates the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) provides
 the framework for Dominica's economic and social policies over the next five years (2005/06 -
 2009/10) and sets out: the macroeconomic framework; the growth strategy, including the
enabling framework for private enterprise, sectoral strategies and poverty reduction and social
protection programs. It also provides for the monitoring and evaluation of progress made in
implementing the strategy on an annual basis. In order to build strong public ownership for the
 strategy, the Government has held wide consultations inthe drafting of the GSPS.

6.      The GSPS is the Government's responseto the key challenge of moving the economy to
sustained higher growth to reduce unemployment and poverty. The GSPS seeks to foster
economic growthby building on four pillars:

        Fiscal policy and administrative reforms

        Enhancing the investment climate for private enterprise development

        Sectoral strategies for growth, and

        Strategies for poverty reduction and social protection

7.      In2002, 29 percent of households inDominica were classified as poor and 11percent as
indigent with 39 percent of the population poor and 15 percent indigent. There were
approximately 28,000 poor people in Dominica with 7,900 indigent. The incidence of household
and population poverty inDominica i s among the highest in the Caribbean, with only St. Vincent
and Guyana havingcomparable levels.

8.      There i s considerable variation in the incidence of poverty based on geography and age
distribution of the population. The incidence of poverty i s lowest in the urban areas of Roseau
and Portsmouth and highest in rural and east coast sub-centers of La Plaine, Marigot, Castle
Bruce and Grand Bay. The incidence of poverty i s also high among the Carib Indian population
of approximately 4,500, 70 percent of whom are poor and almost half are indigent.


9.      Poverty disproportionately affects children with approximately 50% of children aged 5-
14 years living inpoor households. Unemployment levels are also highest for school leavers and
the younger members of the labor force. The 2001 Census revealed that Dominica's


                                                  2

unemployment rate was 11.6%, but the unemployment rate was 40.5% for the 15-19 age group
and 20.8% inthe 20-24 age group.

10.     The primary cause of current poverty in Dominica was the economic slowdown, which
exacerbated high levels of unemployment and reduced incomes for many of those still in
employment. Inrural areas, this has been caused by the collapse in banana cultivation, while in
urban areas it has been caused by the stagnation in other sectors. Those displaced from banana
production have little alternative but to seek low and irregular income in casual labor and small-
scale food production, as employment opportunities inrural areas are limited.

11.     The GSPS identifies unemployment and underemployment-owning to the slow
economic growth since the mid-1990s and the contraction of the economy in subsequentyears-
as the primary causes of current poverty. The analysis in the Country Poverty Assessment shows
that almost three-quarters of the 15-24 year olds (not studying) from poor households are
unemployed.

12.     The Government's strategy for reducing poverty and improving social protection focuses
on invigorating private sector led growth and improving key social services including health and
education to build human capital, giving special attention to vulnerable groups. The GSPS
proposes to target sustainedeconomic growth of around 3 percent over the mediumterm based
on increased activities in all sectors, but more particularly in tourism, agriculture, fisheries and
water. It also indicates that improving export performance i s critical for growth and increasing
international competitiveness is a major challenge. Increasing the attractiveness of the economy
to investors requires reducing firm's cost and improving the reliability of transportation,
lowering the cost of energy and increasing the productivity of the labor force. The Bank's
analytical work2 and work by other donors have helped to fine tune the Government's role and
strategy for improving the enabling environment for private enterprise. Consequently, the GSPS
indicates that the main components of the enabling environment are (i)political and
macroeconomic stability (ii)      sound regulatory framework and efficient supporting institutions;
and (iii)an adequatephysical and social infrastructure.

13.     The GSPS proposes a number of strategic policy actions to facilitate private sector
development and improve the environment for private enterprise including:

        Intensifying implementation of its comprehensive Public Sector Reform Strategy (PSRS)
        aimed at improving effectiveness of service delivery, enhancing accountability, and
        streamlining regulations and procedures that may hinder private sector activities.

        Improving thejudicial and land administration systems;

        Implementing recommendations emanating from the comprehensive analysis of
        Dominica's investment climate by USAID, aimed at improving the climate for starting
        and conducting business inDominica;

                                                       3

         Implementing policy and regulatory measures aimed at lowering costs of transport,
          electricity, water and telecommunication;

         Amending labor legislation and regulations to enhanceflexibility inthe labor market.

 14.    The Prime Minister and Cabinet have acknowledged the need for policy reforms to
improve the efficiency of the public sector and facilitate private sector-led growth and are
already taking steps in this direction. The GSPS has also become the key focal point for donors'
support to Dominica. Although the Government i s committed to the reforms which admittedly
have strong support in the analytical work, implementation of these reforms in a timely manner
i s a key challenge for the Government given its limited fiscal and technical capacity.

 15.    Consequently, the proposed Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project
would focus on supporting implementation of a focused reform agenda in the following four
strategic areas: (i)   making the public sector more efficient and effective; (ii)         improving the
investment climate; (iii)reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector; and
(iv)improving social protection.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement
16.     Consistency with the FY06-09 CAS: The proposed operation is fully consistent with the
FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the OECS sub-region, including Dominica,
which was discussed by the Board in September 2005.3 The two pillars of the CAS are (i)
stimulating growth and improving competitiveness and (ii)           reducing vulnerability by promoting
greater social inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. The CAS presents a new
way of doing business to help countries in the sub-region meet the challenges facing them at this
critical stage of their development. The guiding principles of the CAS are: (a) supporting
regional integration and coordination efforts; (b) partnering and harmonizing inboth lending and
analytical work with other development partners; and (c) an active pursuit of simplification and
capacity buildinginitiatives tailored to small states. The project's four strategic areas focused on
spurringprivate sector led growth and improving social protection are therefore fully consistent
with the thrust of the CAS.

17.     In recognition of the high debt levels in most of these small states, including Dominica,
the Bank's activities under the CAS proposed the use of innovative mechanisms to leverage
available donor grant financing. The proposedoperation, in addition to its support for bothpillars
of the CAS of improving growth and competitiveness and reducing vulnerability, also
emphasizes the CAS guiding principle of using IDA and IBRD resources to leverage grant
resources. The EU will provide approximately US$12 million in grants for budgetary support
and proposes to align and harmonize its tranche disbursement conditions for this budgetary
support with the results framework agreed between the Government and the Bank. The EU will
also provide an additional US$0.58 million in grant for parallel co-financing of the technical
assistance operation (through a Bank administered trust fund).

Exploiting the comparative advantage of the Bank
18.     Buildingimplementation capacity in Dominica to undertake the necessary policy reform
will require a multi-sectoral responseto enhance capacity in key sectors to formulate, implement
and monitor the results of policy measures. Compared with the other donors currently active in
the sub-region, the Bank has significant comparative advantage in providing such multi-sectoral
support as well as taking the lead on harmonizing donor efforts. The formulation of the GSPS
offers a unique opportunity to better coordinate the work with all donors to minimize the
transaction costs for the Government and to exploit synergies.


Complementarity with other donor and multi-lateraldevelopment banks' activities
 19.    The preparation of this operation has been done in close collaboration with other donors
and multi-lateral development banks active in Dominica (EU, IMF, DFID, USAID, CIDA, CDB
and UNDP). On the investment climate, USAID is involved in Trade and Competitiveness
reform and following the recent completion of an Investor Roadmap, i s focused on supporting
the Government in the following areas: (i)      governance reforms mainly through legislative
reforms aimed at improving the business environment; (ii)         improving public/private sector
relationship; (iii) expanding the Doing Business indicators (in collaboration with the World
Bank); (iv) risk reduction through work on disaster preparedness; and (v) a Public Awareness
Campaign. In the energy sector, the OAS i s assisting the Government with its Sustainable
Energy Plan, the objectives of which include: (i)    ensuring the existence of adequate energy
supplies at affordable rates to sustain economic development; (ii)    promoting energy efficiency
and conservation at all levels of the economy; (iii)promoting the generation of income through
energy exports produced from indigenous energy sources including geothermal. On public sector
reform, CIDA i s providing support on trade policy; UNDP i s supporting institutional
strengthening through information and communication technology improvement and along with
DFIDproviding support inpublic sector financial management. The CDB is providingfinancing
for legal and judicial development as part of the overall support to the Caribbean Court of
Justice. The EU, CIDA and CDB are supporting the social protection efforts through a range of
projects. The Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre*(CARTAC) which began in 2001
with support from the Bank, IMF, CIDA, EU, UNDP and DFID is providing technical assistance
focused on training in public finance management, tax and customs policy and administration,
financial sector regulation and supervision, economic and financial statistics and financial
programming. On the social protection side, the EUhas provided support for community-based
social protection initiatives. The proposed project supports the implementation of reforms
complementary to the activities of other international development partnersinDominica.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes
20.    The proposed operation is designed to enhance the capacity of the public sector to
implement focused reforms geared at improving the public sector delivery of services as well as
creating the institutionaland policy framework to facilitate private sector led growth. Inaddition,
the operation will strengthen the Government's capacity to plan and administer its social
protection programs to ensure that the benefits from growth are equitably distributed for poverty
reduction.




                                                5

21.      The project will benefit Dominicans through (i)     enhanced private sector competitiveness
and productivity and improvement in employment prospects resulting from private sector-led
growth; (ii) improvement in the quality of public goods and services offered by a more efficient
public sector; (iii)more competitive pricing of electricity as a result of a better regulated
electricity sector; and (iv) better targeting and efficient delivery of social protection programs.

4. Poverty and social impact
22.      The proposed Growth and Social Protection Project i s expected to have a positive impact
on poverty reduction as it supports the implementation of the Government's medium-term
strategy for growth and poverty reduction as laid out inits Growth and Social Protection Strategy
(GSPS) 2005 Report, covering the five-year period from 2005/06 to 2009/10. Inparticular, this
operation proposes to enhance the government's capacity to implement a set of policy measures
detailed in the GSPS, which are aimed at improving the legal, regulatory and institutional
environment to facilitate private sector-led growth and better planning and administration of its
social protection programs.

23.      The 2002 Country Poverty Assessment for Dominica4indicated that unemployment and
underemployment due to slow economic growth i s the primary cause of poverty. Increased
private sector led growth is therefore expected to lead to increased employment and
consequently a reduction in poverty. In order to strengthen the poverty impact of the increased
growth, the operation would help improve the Government's established policies and procedures
for implementation of social safety net program, to ensure better targeting of social protection
beneficiaries and enhanced capacity to monitor and evaluate the implementation of social
protection programs for poverty analysis and targeting.

24.      Technical Assistance Credit (under IDA) of an equivalent amount of US$1.45 million.
The choice of a technical assistance credit responds to the Government's request to enhance its
capacity to implement focused reforms elaborated its Growth and Social Protection Strategy.

2. Project developmentobjective and key indicators
25.      The GSPTAP's development objective i s to enhance the Government's effectiveness to
deliver public goods and services by strengthening the institutional capacity of key agencies to
facilitate Dominica's private sector competitiveness and productivity and to provide targeted
social assistanceto reduce poverty.

3. Project components
26.      The design of the operation reflects Dominica's potential sources of growth and the key
constraints to private sector-led growth. The operation i s designed to support the second stage of
Dominica's two stage strategy for re-establishing the basis for sustained growth and poverty
reduction. The first stage which focused on achieving macroeconomic stability has been largely

successful. The second stage i s aimed at implementing key structural reforms to establish the
basis for sustainedprivate sector-led growth and poverty reduction.

27.      The government's structural reformagenda is relativelycomprehensivecoveringjudicial,
fiscal, financial sector, labor market, public sector, energy sector regulation, investment climate
and social protection reforms. The government i s already well advanced in implementing some
of these structural reforms. On Judicial reforms, some attempts have been made to speed up civil
processes, particularly through the use of alternative dispute resolution. On fiscal reforms, they
have implemented the Valued Added Tax (VAT), thereby providing greater equity in the tax
system. In addition, work is ongoing on the amendment to the Finance Administration Act, the
improvement of the PSIP and-the institution of rolling three-year expenditure plans in line
ministries. On the financial sector reform agenda, the main outstanding agenda item is the
establishment of a legislative basis for the Financial Services Unit (FSU) to supervise insurance
companies and regulate all non-bank financial institutions. The IMF i s supporting the
Government in this area.

28.      Following extensive consultations with the government including at the Cabinet level, it
was agreed that USAID would support targeted reforms, including in particular labor market
reforms, in coordination with the Bank's focus on four areas, namely, public sector reform,
energy sector regulatory reforms, investment climate reforms and social protection reforms.
Recent analytical work done by the Bank and other donors5highlight that limited public sector
capacity, inadequate investment climate and the highcost of electricity are a drag on growth. The
2003 Dominica Social Protection Review highlighted constraints in the delivery of safety net
programs. The recent Caribbean wide Social Protection Study also highlighted key issues that
needto be addressedinDominica.

29.     The 2007 Doing Business report which covered the OECS including Dominica for the
first time, also confirmed that the structural reform agenda and particularly the reforms covered
under the Bank's and USAID's support were critical to enhancing business activity inDominica.
In particular, the Doing Business report noted that in Dominica reforms should focus on; the
flexibility of the labor market, the ease and cost of registering property, improving customs-an
area where Dominica ranked the lowest in the OECS and judicial reforms to reduce the speed
and costs of enforcing contracts.

30.     The multi-sector design of the operation reflects a more holistic approach by the
Government to ensure the simultaneous targeting of the most binding constraint to growth as
well as strengthen the poverty impact of the increased growth through better targeting of social
protection programs.

31.     The project has five components: (1) Making the public sector more efficient and
effective; (2) Improving the investment climate; (3) Reforming the regulatory framework for the
energy sector; (4) Improving social protection; and (5) Project management. A description of
each of the components follows:

Component 1:Making thepublic sector more efficient and effective (US$1,240,000)
32.      This component will provide technical assistance to the Government to implement key
components of its public sector modernization strategy focused on streamlining the public sector
to increase the efficiency of service delivery while lowering costs. It will also assist in
strengthening control over public finances and increasing the transparency and efficiency of
public procurement. The sub-components include:

 1.1Strengthening of theReform Management Unit.
33.      This sub-component will support the strengthening of the technical capacity within the
Reform Management Unit to plan and implement the public sector reform program. The
activities to be financed include manpower needs assessments in targeted ministries and
departments and mapping of the change management process to guide the                            re-
organizationhestructuring of these ministries and departments. This sub-component will also
support the improvement of the technological capability of the unit.

1.2 Strengthening of Customs.
34.      Activities to be supported under this sub-component include: (i) implementation of a
                                                                            the
detailed action plan for the Customs Modernization Program including training of Custom's
staff; (ii)
          the implementation of a risk management system for customs inspections; and (iii)      the
modernization and automation of ports and customs information and payments systems,
includingthe upgrade of ASYCUDA-the           customs automateddata system.

1.3Modernization of Registry.
35.      This sub-component would finance the modernization of the Registry through the full-
scale computerization of Companies and Trade Marks section of the Registry to allow for on-line
business registrations and searches. The improvement of the computer technology within the
land titles section of the Registry i s also expected to reduce the turn-around time for registering
properties.

I.4Strengtheningof Fiduciary Capacity.
36.     This sub-component would support the strengthening of the fiduciary capacity in the
public sector through (i)the strengthening of financial management capacity within the
Accountant General's and Auditor General's departments; (ii)      implementation of a Procurement
Action Plan to modernize the public sector procurement system; and (iii)       taking measures to
integrate, where possible, into the pooled procurement initiative being piloted between Grenada
and St. Vincent and the Grenadines under the ongoing Grenada Public Sector Modernization
project.

Component2: Improving the investment climate (US$252,000)
37.     This component would strengthen the institutional and regulatory environment for
attracting investment into Dominica. Specifically, the activities under this component will seek
to address deficiencies in the current system of investment promotion as carried out by the
Dominica National Development Corporation (NDC), and prepare a National Investment
Strategy and an Action Plan to buiida well-functioning investment promotion agency (PA).

2.1 Development of a National Investment Strategy.
38.     This sub-component will support the development of a National Investment Strategy for
Dominica to focus the limited public resources in areas which support private sector
development and where attracting Foreign Direct investment (FDI) could contribute to the
national objective of increasingprivate sector led growth for poverty reduction.


2.2 Development and Implementation of a NationalAction Plan.
39.     This sub-component will finance the development of a specific action plan for the
investment strategy; and implementation of the action plan, including a restructuring of the NDC
charged with the mandateto implement the NationalInvestment Strategy.

2.2.1 Development of a National Action Plan
40.     The project will finance the preparation of a detailed action plan which will seek to
implement the National Investment Strategy including the restructuring of the NDC to meet the
mandate to implement the strategy. The restructuring of the NDC may involve a split into two
separate agencies; (i)  an investment promotion agency and (ii)Tourism Authority. There may
                                                                     a
be need to change the laws that governs the operation of the P A (which seems to be already be
underway).

2.2.2 Implementation of National Action Plan
41.    The financing of the implementation of the National Action Plan will be conditioned on
the establishment of the legal framework for the investment promotion agency (PA). This sub-
component will finance training of the P A staff in relevant activities (market intelligence, direct
contacts with investors, services to investors, and after-care of investors). The sub-component
will, in addition, finance the purchase of office equipment, computers, publication of
promotional material, improvement to the website, special software for access to foreign
investors' databases as well as subscription to other relevant international business information
databases and services.

Component3: Reforming the regulatoryframework for the energy sector (US$695,000)
42.    The objective of this component is to regulate the energy sector including the production
and distribution of electricity to improve competitiveness. The specific sub-componentsare:

3.1 Establishment of National Renulatow Commission.
43.    This sub-component will finance the establishment of a commission to provide regulatory
oversight for the electricity sector. This support will follow the passage of the Electricity Act
which will provide the legal basis for the establishment and sustainability of an independent
regulatory commission for the electricity sector in Dominica. This sub-component will provide
financing for the operation of the regulatory commission for the first 12 months covering office
operational cost, staffing, training and technical assistance. It is envisaged that after the first year,
the operations of the regulatory commission will be fully financed from license fees, other fees
and levies. It is estimated that under normal operation of the regulatory commission, these fees
and levies would represent approximately 1.22 percent of the revenues of the electricity
company.




                                                  9

 44.     It is also envisaged that in the medium-to-longer term Dominica will benefit from the
 regional electricity regulatory initiative, possibly resulting in further reduction of the national
 cost of regulation.

 3.2 Drafting of Alternative Energy Legislation.
 45.     This sub-component will support the drafting of legislation to provide the legal and
 regulatory framework for the development of alternative energy technology, including
 hydropower, wind and geothermal energy.

 Component4: Improving socialprotection (US$232,000)
 46.     The objective of this component is to strengthen the Government's capacity to better
 target, plan and administer social assistanceprograms for poor and vulnerable persons. There are
 three sub-components as follows:

 4.1 Beneficiarv Selection System Modernization.
 47.     This sub-component will finance activities designed to modernize and streamline systems
 for beneficiary selection and registration, including: (a) design and implementation of a
transparent and objective targetingmechanism for selection of beneficiaries; (b) development of
 a central beneficiary registry; and (c) application of information from the recently developed
poverty maps to better target community based, school-feeding and short-term employment
programs.

4.2 Institution Strengthening.
48.      This sub-component will support activities to strengthen the administrative capacity to
deliver social assistance through: (a) development of program databases to track beneficiaries
and expenditures for the Education Trust Fund and the School Feeding Program in the Ministry
of Education and further work on database development for the Public Assistance Program in the
Ministry of Community Development; and (b) documentation of policies and procedures for the
public assistance program and for the Education Trust Fund; (c) establishing linkages and access
to the different databasesto assist inpolicy decision makingat the sector level.

4.3 Public Information CamDaign.
49.      This sub-component will support the design and implementation of a public information
campaign to inform the public about new approaches to the delivery of social safety net
programs (including the new approaches to targeting and registration of beneficiaries) and about
other social protectionreforms.

Component5: Project Management (US$181,000)
50.      This component will finance the operation of the small Project Coordinating Unit
integrated within the Establishment, Personnel and Training Department and employing
permanent government staff and where necessary contract staff. More specifically, this
component will finance the project coordinator, the cost of the annual project audits, computers
for the PCU as well as the costs of staff assigned to the project.

 4. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design
 51.      The design of the project builds on key lessons learned from previous operations in
 Dominica and elsewhere in the Caribbean including Jamaica and Grenada. The design of the
 operation also draws lessons from recent analytical work by the Bank and other donors.

 52.      The following lessons are incorporated in the project design:

     (a) The importance of taking an incremental strategic approach focusing on areas that will
     produce the highest returns for the investment and at the same time address major constraints
     to private sector development.

     (b) The need for reform to address areas that will show early visible results to build strong
     ownership as the reform process moves forward to address more difficult issues. In this
     regard, the public sector reformcomponent focuses on improving customs and converting the
     registry into a self-financing semi-autonomous agency, two key areas where there i s a
     general public consensus that the Government should address. The Caribbean experience on
     improving customs i s deepening, following recent successful experience in Jamaica which
     has been based on international best practices.

     (c) The design of the energy sector regulatory framework also draws on lessons learned from
     the successful experience o f the development of the regulatory framework for the
     telecommunications sector within the Caribbean and elsewhere.

     (d) Small economies with severe capacity constraints in the public sector and subject to
     periodic natural disasters may require longer adjustment periods and greater flexibility on the
     part of donors. This is reflected in the design of the project to cover three years which better
     matches the Government's implementation capacity. In addition, the leveraging o f grant
     resources from the EU in the form o f budgetary support i s expected to provide greater
     flexibility for the Government inthe programming of these untied resources.

     (e) Projects that build institutional capacity and utilize existing government structures for
     implementation are more likely to succeed and be sustainable than projects that rely on self-
     standing Project Implementation Units (Plus); but at the same time, require clear delineation
     o f responsibilities among central ministry staff. The coordination of the TA effort by a
     central ministry i s essential when a number of beneficiary agencies are involved. The use o f a
     small unit integrated within the current Government structure with ministries and
     departments implementing the different components of the project, builds on these lessons.

     (f) Reforms require a champion who is not only committed to the reform process but has the
     energy and i s strategically located to drive the reform process. The appointment o f
     champions to head working groups for each component of the project builds on this lesson.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Development Policy Loan (DPL).
53.      This option was considered and rejected by the task team because: (i) expressed need
                                                                                 the
o f the Government i s for capacity building technical assistance to implement reforms to which
they are committed; (ii)   the EUhas agreed that a TA operation i s a more appropriate mechanism


                                                  11

for the strategic partnership with their planned budgetary support operation tied to the
achievement of specific results under the              government program of reforms whose
implementation i s supported by this proposed technical assistance operation.

Donor (grant)financedtechnicalassistance
54.     Donor (grant) financed technical assistance i s being leveraged by the Bank's operation.
The task team has been coordinating with the EU, USAID, CIDA, DFID and other donors. The
EU is providing grant financing to support the TA operation. In addition, the EU is providing
budgetary support of approximately US$12 million with conditions for disbursement harmonized
with the results framework (detailed inAnnex 3) of the technical assistance operation.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements
55.     This project will be financed by IDA credit of US$1.45 million andparallelco-financing
grant of US$0.58 million from the European Union. The Government will provide counterpart
support of US$0.57 million for the project. The EU i s currently preparing a an EU financing
agreement to provide support to the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica including
the parallel co-financing grant for this project to be administered by the World Bank under atrust
fund arrangement.The grant is likely to be available by the end of FY2007. USAID is proposing
to assist the Government in its private sector development efforts including support to a
restructured NDC and support for the modernization of legislation and regulations governing
private sector development. Donors will continue to support the public sector reform and social
protection efforts of the Government. The implementation of the project will be done in close
collaboration with all the donors active inDominica.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements
Implementationperiod: December, 2006 to December, 2009
56.    The Project will be implemented by a small PCU under the Establishment, Personnel and
Training Department. There will be close coordination with the relevant ministries and
departments. The PCU will be headed by a full-time CoordinatorProcurement Officer and a
small PCU team including a project accountant.

57.    The PCU will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the project including
finance, accounting, disbursement and procurement. The PCU will also be responsible for
providing timely reports to the government, the Bank and other donors.

58.    Given the multi-sectoral nature of the project, the steering committee for this project will
be the same committee established for reforms in Dominica. This committee i s headed by the
champion for reform, appointed by Cabinet. Currently, this reform committee consists o f the
Financial Secretary; all Permanent Secretaries; the Social Development Planner; a representative
from the private sector; the Chief Personnel Officer and a representative from the NGO sector.
The steering committee will oversee the project implementation process and provide overall
policy guidance to the PCU including monitoring and evaluation of implementationprogress and
addressingimplementation bottlenecks.

59.    To provide fully integrated technical support, there will be four Working Groups (one for
each of the first four components of the project) headedby appointed champions. These working



                                                  12

 groups are already in operation. The Working Group will be responsible for reviewing terms of
 references, clearing procurement and disbursement request, overseeing selection of consultants
 and monitoring their work to ensure the transfer of skills and the building of capacities in the
 relevant ministries and departments.The working groups will report to the steeringcommittee.

 3. FinancialManagementand ProcurementArrangements
 60.    All financial managementand procurement functions of the project will be carried out by
 the PCU. The PCU will prepare interim un-audited financial reports commonly referred to as
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to be submitted to the World Bank on a quarterly basis.
The FMRs would include financial, program progress and procurement information. The
financial reports will include a statement of periodic and cumulative cash receipts by sources and
expenditures by main expenditure classifications. Programprogressreports will include narrative
 and outcome indicators, linking financial information with implementation progress. Further
details are provided inAnnex 7.

61.     The PCU will oversee all procurement, based on the procurement plan. The procurement
of goods and related services financed under the credit will be done in accordance with the
Bank's latest (May 2004) "Guidelines for procurement under lBRD Loans and IDA Credits."
Contracts for consulting services under Bank financing will be procured in accordance with the
latest (May 2004) "Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers." The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Request for proposals will
be used. Further details are inAnnex 8.

62.     The transactions under the project would be reviewed by the internal auditor (the
Borrower's Audit Office) at least once a year. In addition, the accounts of the project would be
subject to an external audit by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit
report should be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. More details are
includedinAnnex 7.

63.     The financial management system will be upgraded to allow the production of timely
reports including audit reports.

4. Monitoring and evaluationof outcomes/results
64.     The framework for monitoring and evaluation of outcomes and results will be based on
the bi-annual and annual reports produced by the PCU as well as close oversight by the Bank.
Monitoring and evaluation of the project will be undertaken by the steering committee based on
the project objectives and the parameters detailed inthe Results Framework elaboratedin Annex
3. The Bank, in close collaboration and coordination with the EU will participate in monitoring
of project implementation through semi-annual supervision missions as well as through regular
dialogue with the authorities.

5. Sustainability
65.     The sustainability of the project hinges on both technical and political economy factors
which may affect each component of the project in a different way. On the technical side,
drawing from lessons which suggest that projects that build institutional capacity and utilize
existing government structures for implementation are more likely to succeed and be sustainable
than projects that rely on self-standing Project Implementation Units (PIUS),this project will be



                                                 13

integrated into the current Government structure. In addition, the involvement of the champions
from the various ministries and departments will help to ensure continued ownership of the
components of the project even after the project i s formally closed.

66.    On the political economy side, overall, there is strong political ownership and support
among the Government, the private sector, labor unions and Non Governmental Organizations
(NGOs) for the package of reforms supported by the project. These sentiments were gauged in a
consultation process with key stakeholders. The consultations, which took place in March 2006      '
was a key part of the pre-appraisal of the project. The majority of stakeholders agreed on the
need to systematically maintain the consultatiodcommunication process from the beginning and
throughout the implementation of the project, in a transparent and open fashion to ensure the
public and private endorsement and engagement, as well as the successful adoption of the
reforms.

67.    The implementation of the project is expected to generate more winners than losers and
hence the political incentives for sustainability would be high. The additional recurrent cost
implications for the project are expected to be minimal as the project has sought to make use of
existing institution and new institutions such as the regulatory commission are expected to be
financed from fees and levies after the first year. In fact, fiscal savings may be realized in some
areas owing to efficiency gains and rationalization of human resources.

6. Critical risksand possible controversial aspects
68.    The project focuses on building, strengthening or changing institutions to improve public
sector performance, enhance the investment climate, improve the regulation of the energy sector
and better provide social protection services. The related project risks and proposed mitigation
measuresare detailed inthe table below:

69.     Conditions of Disbursement

        Disbursement under sub-component 2.2.2 will be conditioned on the Borrower's
        establishment of a legal framework for the operation of a stand alone investment
        promotion agency;
        Disbursement under sub-component 3.1 will be conditioned on the passage into law of
        the new ElectricityAct to establish an Independent Regulatory Commission.

70.     Covenant related to EUparallelco-financing

        I t i s expected that the EU parallel co-financing for the project will be available by the
        mid-term review of the project (June 1, 2008). If the EUfinancing i s not available by this
        time, the borrower will identify alternative donor financing or restructure the project to
        reduce the scope to fit within the available financing envelope.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicandfinancial analyses
71.     The proposed project of US$2.6 million would have minimal direct impact in that it
would improve the delivery of services in key areas of the public sector, improve the regulatory
framework for energy, improve the investment climate and better target and administer the
delivery of social protection. However, the medium and longer term indirect impacts of the
project are expected to be considerable, including: improved capacity to plan and implement
public sector reform, reduced clearance time at customs, increased investments from
improvement in the investment climate, more competitive pricing of electricity and better
targeting and administration of social programs.

2. Technical
72.     The project poses no technical issues.

3. Fiduciary
73.     Fiduciary assessments have been carried out for the Reform Management Unit within
which the PCU will be integrated. The assessment found that with specific modification and
some strengthening, particularly in procurement, the PCU would be adequately prepared to
manage the proposed project's financial reporting and procurement processes. (See Annexes 7
and 8, respectively).

4. Social
74.    This Project currently triggers none of the Bank's social safeguardpolicies.

5. Environment

75.    This project currently triggers noneof the Bank's environmental policies.

7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness
76.       The proposed Project would not require any exception from Bank policy and would
comply with all applicable Bank policies. However, the proposed project required an exception
to the practice of not presenting IDA operations to the Board when a borrower is in breach of
financial covenants on its IBRD loans. Dominica i s in breach of the negative pledge covenant
under its existing loans from IBRD. The breach of the clause related to secured bonds of $29
million issued by Dominica in 1999 to a commercial bank based in Trinidad and Tobago. The
security of the bonds consisted of a security account funded out of the proceeds of the bonds as
well as taxes and dividends payable to Dominica by two local companies, and a pledge over the
Government's shares inone of the companies.

77.       The Government has since successfully restructured 72 percent of its commercial debt.
Unfortunately, the commercial bank with the security claim did not accept the Government's
debt restructuring offer. The Government then took exceptional measures to void some of the
security arrangements. Specifically, it repealed the existing legislation that provided for the
payment of taxes and dividends by the two local companies to the security trustee for the bonds.
As a result, no further payments were made to the security trustee. However, the security trustee
continued to hold a debt service reserve securing amounts owed to external creditors in
continued violation of IBRD's negative pledge clause. The amount in the debt service reserve
was approximately US$390,000inJune 2006.

78.       The Bank's Management has approved a further exception to Bank practice of not
presenting IDA operations to the Board when a borrower i s in breach of financial covenants on
its IBRD loans for the following reasons:

         IDAdoes not have anegative pledge clause, although Bank practice hasbeenfor IDAnot
         to proceed when IBRDloan covenants have been breached;




*By supporting theproposedproject, the Bank does not intend toprejudice thefinal determination of theparties` claims on the
disputed areas


                                                           17

The project i s important in meeting Dominica's immediate financing and development
needs and will facilitate an additional US$12 million in EU grant assistance, thereby
catalyzing a significant volume of donor resources at a critical period;

The Government continues to cooperate with the Bank and has taken extraordinary
measuresinan effort to resolve the issue.

                         Annex 1:CountryandProgramBackground
          DOMINICA: GrowthandSocialProtectionTechnicalAssistanceCredit

A. CountryBackground
1.      Dominica i s a small Caribbean island state, the most northerly and largest of the
Windward Islands with a population of 71,000 and a GNI per capita of US$3,650. The island i s
predominately a lush mountainous area with plentiful water resources, excellent for cultivating
bananas, which together with other agricultural products are the base of the economy and has
been its largest source of employment. The share of output in agriculture has declined steadily
over the last ten years, particularly following the reduction in preferential market access to UK
and Europe. The island also has a small export-oriented manufacturing sector and offshore and
tourism service activities are becoming more important. Mainstream tourism was never
developed due to the small number of white-sand beaches, highrainfall and poor air connections;
however, given its other natural characteristics, eco-tourism is beingpromoted.

2.      The unemployment rate i s estimated to be 15 percent (2004), and the poverty head count
index is 39 percent with 15 percent of the population being indigent. However, Dominica does
have good social indicators as a result of sustained investment in human development since
independence, and these indicators are not significantly different for the poor and non-poor, with
the exception of a small group of indigenous Caribs who make up 4 percent of the population but
7 percent of the poor. Also female headed households (making up 34 percent of the population
and 39 percent of the poor) are somewhat over-represented among poor households.The incident
of poverty and indigence i s much higher in the rural areas (33 percent and 13 percent,
respectively) than in the urban areas (19 percent and 6 percent, respectively). The primary cause
of poverty in Dominica i s unemployment and underemployment. In this context, reducing
poverty will require creating jobs through economic growth and better targeting of the social
protection programs.

3.     Dominica i s a member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) with which it shares a common monetary and
exchange rate policy administered by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The ECCB
manages a quasi-currency board arrangement supporting and exchange rate pegfixed to the U.S.
dollar since 1975 at EC$2.67.

EconomicContext:
4.     Following a contraction of the economy of 10 percent in 2001-02 and a fiscal crisis in
2003, Dominica has made significant progress at macroeconomic adjustment and fiscal
consolidation. Despite an earthquake that struck Dominica in late 2004, the real GDP growth
rate for 2004 was 3.1 percent, on the back of strong performance by the banana sector,
manufacturing and construction, and resumed market confidence. With resolute implementation
of the stabilization and structural adjustment program supported by the IMF under a three-year
SDR 7,7 million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, an IDA adjustment credit (a US$3
million Economic Governance Reform Credit disbursed as a single tranche in February 2004),
and other donors' technical and financial support, the fiscal position has strengthened
considerably.




                                                 19

 5.     The conduct of fiscal policy has been prudent, with large savings realized above
 programmed amounts on account of stronger than expected revenues. As a result, the primary
 balance improved from a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in FY2002-03 to a surplus of 5.6 percent
 in FY2003-04, and the overall fiscal balance improved from a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in
 FY2002-03 to a smaller deficit of 1.3 percent in FY2003-04, largely exceeding its deficit target
 of 4.2 percent of GDP.

 6.     In 2004, as part of its macroeconomic program, Dominica launched a comprehensive
debt restructuring exercise aimed at reducing its debt to a sustainable level. The debt exchange
 offer was closed in September 2004. Thus far, agreements (in principle) have been reached to
restructure about 70 percent of the eligible debt. For non-participating creditors, interest accrued
until June 2004 has been deposited into escrow accounts. The authorities plan to continue
making payments for non-participating creditors into such accounts, but under restructured
 terms. Under the IDA-financed Economic Governance Reform Credit, the Government
implemented actions to (i)  restore fiscal stability by improving financial and debt management,
 and (ii)encourage a resumption of growth by strengthening the financial sector and improving
the productivity of public investment.

7.      Dominica's economic recovery continued into 2005 with real GDP growing at an
estimated 3.5 percent as a result of robust growth in most sectors. However, agriculture and
tourism remain weak. The performance of the agriculture sector was adversely affected by the
performance of the banana sector which contracted by around 7 percent in 2005. The weakness
in the tourism sector reflected the fall-out incruise arrivals from the highlevels in 2004. At the
same time, inflation remained subdued. Despite increases in energy prices and the pass through
to electricity prices, consumer prices rose only by 2.7 percent in 2005. However, the external
position weakened as imports led by rising oil prices increased in the face of stagnant exports
leading to a deterioration of the current account balance from 17.2 percent of GDP in 2004 to
23.5 percent of GDPin 2005.

8.      A strong fiscal performance has been sustained in 200906 reflecting stronger than
expected revenue performance and current expenditure being kept below target. Capital
expenditures were also lower than expected due to delays in disbursements from donors. The
Government was successful in meeting all the performance criteria agreed under the PRGF.
However, closure on the debt restructuring i s being delayed by three large nonparticipating
creditors. New bonds have been issued to all participating creditors and these bonds are now
traded on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange (ECSE).

9.      The Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to the structural reform efforts
and has inMarch 2006 introduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) to cover goods and services, the
latter being previously outside the tax net. The challenges involved in the preparations for the
introduction of the VAT including the shortage of legal draftsmen, and delays i s finalizing the
computer software underscores some of the main challenges which the Government faces in
implementingthe key structural reform measures to which it i s committed.

 Reforms to improve growth and competitiveness
 10.    The recent World Bank study on Growth and Competitiveness in the OECS on the basis
 of comprehensive analysis sets out a proposal for some immediate priorities, which could be
 addressed over the short term for countries to improve growth and competitiveness. The very
 intense dialogue with the technocrats and political directorate in Dominica indicate that the
 following three medium-term priorities are relevant for Dominica:

        Fiscal and public sector reform
        Raise the skills base
        Improve the business environment

Fiscal and public sector reform
 11.    On fiscal and public sector reform, the Government has taken some initial steps. As
indicated above, fiscal management has improved under the IMF supported program and the
fiscal indicators are heading inthe right direction. InMarch 2006, the Government rolled out the
Value Added Tax (VAT). The authorities have also taken initial steps to improve the investment
regime by making fiscal incentives more transparent. There i s more to be done on this front
however.

 12.    The Government recognizes that public sector reform is a linchpin for the overall reform
program that i s so critical to Dominica's further development and has moved to implement
reforms. The Government has established a Reform Management Unit under the offices of the
Chief Personnel Officer, to oversee and coordinate the overall public sector reform program.
However, in spite of the strong political commitment to reform, progress has been slow, largely
due to the limited technical capacity within the reform unit. The Government has made some
progress in implementing measures to streamline public sector employment and reduce the wage
bill through outsourcing of some services which has resulted innot only areduction of their costs
but also an improvement in their quality. The Government also intends to move forward on the
merger of the port authorities.

13.     The Government has also made progress on the strengthening of public expenditure
including the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP), cash management, and in the
preparation of the amendments to the Finance Administration Act and related regulations.
Further, the Government i s proposing to implement a medium-term budgeting framework, with
technical assistance from CARTAC and the IMF. However, as indicated in the most recent
CFAA and CPAR done for Dominica, there is further work needed in the strengthening of the
fiduciary capacity in Dominica including improvements in the capacity within the Accountant
General's and Auditor Generals departments; implementation of the procurement action plan;
and taking measures to integrate where possible into the pooled procurement initiative being
piloted between Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

Raising the skills base
14.     Although it i s widely recognized that the lack of skilled workers is a major constraints to
growth in Dominica and that it i s necessary to raise the skills base, the pace of education and
training reforms has been slow. However, in the 2006/07 budget, the Government announced
new measures to address the quality of education including curriculum reform, training of
teachers, better regulation of early childhood education and the building of new schools. While


                                                 21

 the spending on education and secondary education enrollment i s above the average for the
 OECS sub-region, the poor education outcomes suggest that there could be a significant increase
 inefficiency inthe secondary education,system. There is currently ongoing dialogue between the
 Bank and sub-regional Governments regarding a possibly regional initiative focused on skills
 training. Work has already started on establishing a pilot in St. Lucia and then rolling out to the
 other countries inthe region.

 Improvingthe businessenvironment
 15.      The OECS sub-region, including Dominica has experienced a secular decline in private
 investment over the 1990s. This issue was analyzed extensively in the recent Bank's Growth and
 Competitiveness Study for the OECS. As the study pointed out, investment promotion i s weak.
 In Dominica, the current institutional framework for investment promotion is weak and lacks
 focus. The Growth and Social Protections Strategy states "The existing foreign investment
 approval process i s regarded as a deterrent rather than an encouragement to foreign investors. It
 i s time consuming, due to the number of agencies and government Ministries involved in the
 approval process, the lack of transparency, and the requirement of Cabinet approval in each
case." The GSPS also states that "The GoCD will establish a one-stop-shop in the NDC6 for
foreign investment that will reduce and specify the time for approval, improve the transparency
by establishing specific criteria to be met, and by vesting final approval to the NDC."

 16.     The Government of Dominica has made marked progress in improving the business
environment. With support from the World Bank, the Governments of the OECS, including
Dominica, have taken the major step to address the telecom monopoly in the region. The OECS
i s now benefitingfrom the liberalization of the telecommunications market which resulted in the
establishment of the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) a regional
regulatory      authority.     The     increased competition from           the    Liberalization of         the
telecommunications sector has resulted in not only lower prices but also increased investment
and employment inthe sector.

17.      Also, with support from the World Bank under the Economic Recovery Support
Operation (ERSO) in2003, the Government introduced a new mechanism for adjusting domestic
prices of petroleum products in line with international price movements, including regular price
adjustments. Reforms in port operations were also implemented which resulted in reductions of
stevedoring and long shoring charges (30%),cost of handing bulk cargo (40%) and a reduction
in the costs of container handling. These changes have resulted in a significant reduction in the
distortion inthe economy resultingfrom the previous ad hoc pricingmechanism.

18.      Two key remainingelements of improving the business environment are: (i)               modernizing
customs administration; and (ii)       improvingthe oversight of electricity utilities to reducecosts.

19.      According to the Recent OECS Growth and Competitiveness study, among all
government regulations that affect business operations, by far the most serious constraint is
custom regulations. Because of the reliance on imports in the production process the time
consuming and costly procedures involved in clearing customs i s a significant barrier to

6 The NDC can benefit from the experience of one-stop shops in other OECS countries such as Grenada, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines and St. Lucia that have benefited from this approach to facilitating foreign investment by
significantly reducing the time taken for approval.

 improved competitiveness. As Dominica shifts from its heavy reliance on trade taxes, the
 Customs department should focus more on trade facilitation. Greater reliance should be placed
 on technology and e-government to improve service and increase transparency. Automated
 Systems for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) or other systems have the potential to significantly
 speed up the Customs clearance process.

 20.     Inthe recent Bank study on Growth and Competitiveness inthe OECS, electricity supply
 and costs were identified as the number one infrastructure related constraint identifiedby firms.
 The study showed that Dominica has the highest electricity rate for both residential and
commercial users compared with the rest of the OECS sub-region at US$0.2l/kWh and
US$0.26/kWh, respectively. The study identified a number of factors which could be
contributing to the high cost including, (i)  inappropriate generators in terms of size or type of
fuel used; and (ii)   high operating inefficiency. The report concluded that "In general, weak
oversight and regulation of the electricity sector in the OECS has further exacerbated the
 situation, and not protected consumers-both         residential and commercial-from        either
excessively high costs andlor supply shortage. In Dominica, which has private operators in the
electricity sector, the current regulatory framework does not provide the necessary incentives for
efficiency. The higher cost in Dominica may also be due to full pass through of the cost of oil
and the absenceof subsidy to the sector.

21.      However, the Government i s moving to strengthen the regulatory oversight of the
operations, investment and pricing of electricity. As a first step, with support under a previous
Bank operation (ERSO) and the IMF's PRGF, the Government has drafted a new Electricity Act,
which along with the necessary regulation should provide the basis for the establishment of an
independent regulatory commission for the electricity sector.

ImprovingSocial Protection
22.      Dominica has made significant progress towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) and past investments in human and social development have resulted in strong
social indicators comparable with countries with much higher incomes. However, many
challenges remain. Dominica has most of the building blocks for an effective social protection
system. However, these consist of several programs which are uncoordinated and poorly
targeted. Weak information and monitoring systems and lack of documented policies and
procedures compound these problems. The Social Protection Review for Dominicacompleted in
2003 by the World Bank identified specific areas for improvement including: (i)      rationalizing
existing programs to eliminate duplication of efforts; (ii)   improving targeting of programs,
including household and geographic targeting;           and (iii)strengthening capacity for
implementation, monitoring and evaluation in ministries and agencies. The Government's
recently elaborated Growth and Social Protection Strategy details its social protection agenda for
the medium term. This agenda reflects the recommendations from the social protection review
done by the World Bank. In addition, this will also take into consideration the work done on
streamlining services in the social sector. The Government has already given the commitment to
undertake the necessaryreforms.

Arrangements for results monitoring

Institutional issues:
1.       The project steering committee will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of
the project, drawing on the reports provided by the PCU basedon data provided by the technical
working groups and the Reform Management Unit. The Project Coordinator will have direct
responsibility for coordinating the reports to the steering committee and for organizing the
regular monitoring and evaluation meetings throughout the implementation of the project. The
baseline and target values for intermediate outcome indicators will help provide a basis for
monitoring and evaluating the progress of the project as well as provide the basis for necessary
policy actions.

Data collection:
2.       The Project Coordinating Unit and the technical working groups will draw data from a
number of sources based on the indicators that have been established to monitor the
implementation progress of the particular sub-component of the project. These performance
indicators have been established on the basis of reliable benchmarks. The core statistics required
to monitor the performance will be generated within institutions which will be reformed,
strengthenedor modernized. The change processes are also focusing on the data and information
needed to improve the functioning of these institutions. The data and information for monitoring
and evaluation will be normal by-products of the reformprocess.

Capacitv:
3.       The project i s proposing to strengthen key institutions where it has been recognized that
limited capacity could affect the Government's ability to effectively implement, monitor and
evaluate the performance of the project and ensure its sustainability. Inthis regards, the Reform
Management Unit will be significantly strengthenedin terms of its planning and implementation
capacity as well as its capacity to garner and process critical data to judge the progress on public
sector reform. The Auditor General and Accountant General offices will also be strengthened.

                             Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
           DOMINICA: Growth and SocialProtectionTechnicalAssistance Credit

Background
 1.     The design of the operation reflects Dominica's potential sources of growth and the key
constraints to private sector-led growth. The operation i s designed to support the second stage of
Dominica's two stage strategy for re-establishing the basis for sustained growth and poverty
reduction. The first stage which focused on achieving macroeconomic stability has been largely
successful. The second stage i s aimed at implementing key structural reforms to establish the
basis for sustained private sector-led growth and poverty reduction.

2.      The government's structural reform agenda is relatively comprehensive covering reforms
inthe following areas: judicial, fiscal, financial sector, labor market, public sector, energy sector
regulation, investment climate and social protection reforms. The government i s already well
advance in implementing some of these structural reforms. On fiscal reforms, they have
implemented the Valued Added Tax (VAT), completed a comprehensive review of statutory
exemptions and repealed several concessions and work i s ongoing on the amendment to the
Finance Administration Act, the improvement of the PSIP and the institution of rolling three-
year expenditure plans in line ministries. On the financial sector reform agenda, the main
outstanding agenda item is the establishment of a legislative basis for the Financial Services Unit
(FSU) to supervise insurance companies and regulate all non-bank financial institutions. The
IMFis supporting the Government inthis area.

3.      Following extensive consultations with the government including at the Cabinet level, it
was agreed that U SAID would support targeted reforms, including in particular labor market
reforms, in coordination with the Bank's focus on four areas, namely, public sector reform,
energy sector regulatory reforms, investment climate reforms and social protection reforms.
Recent analytical work done by the World Bank and other donors, highlight that limited public
sector capacity, poor investment climate and the high cost of electricity are a drag on growth.
The 2003 Dominica Social Protection Review highlighted constraints in the delivery of safety
net programs. The recent Caribbean wide Social Protection Study also highlightedkey issuesthat
needto be addressedin Dominica.

4.      The multi-sector design of the operation reflects the Government's more holistic
approach to ensure the simultaneous targeting of the most bindingconstraint to growth as well as
strengthen the poverty impact of the increased growth through better targeting of social
protection programs. The specific components of the project are detailed below:

Component 1 US$1,240,000
               -
Makingthe Public Sector more efficient and effective
(48% of total project cost)
5.      This component will provide technical assistance to the Government to implement its
public sector modernization strategy focused on streamlining of the public sector to increase the
efficiency of service delivery whilst loweringcosts and strengthening control over public finance
and to increase the transparency and efficiency of public procurement.




                                                 32

6.       In 2003, the Government launched a public sector reform program including four
components: (a) modernizing public administration; (b) strengthening public expenditure
management and controls; (c) enhancing growth-supporting public services; and (d) rationalizing
the delivery of social services and improving their targeting. The 2005 PER for Dominica
pointed out, inter alia that the reform program need to address the issue of the existing
fragmentation and duplication of work among ministries, departments and agencies. It further
recommended that the reform program should be informed by a human resource management
strategy adaptedto the needs and challenges of a small-size administration.

7.      Under the first two components, (a) modernizing public administration and (b)
strengthening public expenditure management and controls, the authorities (with support from
DFID) have already taken action to strengthen policy formulation, reform the budget process
including strengthening of the cash management system and improvement of the Public Sector
Investment Program (PSIP). However, the pace of reform in modernizing public administration
in respect of manpower planning has slowed owing to the limited capacity within the Reform
Management Unit. On the third and fourth components; (c) enhancing growth-supporting public
services, and (d) rationalizing the delivery of social services and improving their targeting,
further work needs to be done.

8.      This component of the technical assistance project focuses on strengthening the Reform
Management Unit and on enhancing growth-supporting public services, particularly Customs
and the Registry, two of the areas that have been consistently identified by the private sector as
well as the recent Doing Business Survey (2007) as needing improvement. In addition, this
component will address outstanding fiduciary issues necessary to ensure effective project
implementation. The specific sub-components include:

I.1Strengtheningof theReformManagement Unit
9.      This sub-component will support the strengthening of the technical capacity within the
Reform Management Unit to plan and implement the public sector reform program. The
activities to be financed include manpower needs assessments in targeted ministries and
departments and mapping of the change management process to guide the re-
organizationhestructuring of these ministries and departments. This sub-component will also
support the improvement of the technological capability of the unit.

1.2 Strengthening of Customs
10.     This sub-component would provide support aimed at strengthening the Government's
capacity to implement institutional reforms to the existing ports management and customs
clearance systems. Activities to be supported include: (i)the implementation of a detailed action
plan for the Customs modernization programincluding staff training (ii)  the implementation of a
risk management system for customs inspection; and (iii) modernization and automation of
                                                            the
ports and customs information and payments systems, including the upgrade of ASYCUDA to
ASYCUDA World.

1.2.1 Customs modernization plan
11.     The implementation of the customs modernization plan based on a comprehensive
diagnostics on Customs procedures, staff capabilities and training needs.




                                               33

 1.2.2 Strengthening Customs control
 12.     The current system of inspecting nearly every shipment, lengthen clearance times and
increases the chances of damaged goods. To remove the responsibility of customs for inspecting
every shipment, inspection should be based on an analysis of the risk involved. The
subcomponent includes the implementation of risk management system in ASYCUDA World
and training for inspectors in physical inspection oriented to seize banned goods (drugs,
weapons, wildlife, etc.) valuation and post clearanceaudit.

1.2.3Information Technology to support Customsmodernization
 13.     This includes the upgrade of ASYCUDA to the ASYCUDA World version, the building
of Customs web site, with information to users and staff. The expected outcome i s a paper-less
operation on main procedures, as imports and exports, and an automated database on Dominica
international commerce.

 1.3 Modernization of Registry
 14.     The Registry in Dominica i s responsible for a total of 15 different registers including
business registration, registration of titles and registration of births and deaths. The Oxford
Policy Management          study of 2004 proposed (i)a short-term action plan focused on
improvement in customer service and some legislative changes and (ii)      a longer-term action to
address: (i)  the full scale computerization of companies' registration; (ii) up a new
                                                                                setting
Companies and Intellectual Property Registry and (iii)establishing the Registry as a self-
financing agency. Most of the reforms for the improvements in customer services and the
legislative reforms were completed in 2004/2005 fiscal year. This sub-component will therefore
finance: (i) the modernization of Registry including the full-scale computerization of Companies
and Trade Marks section to allow for on-line business registrations and searches and (ii)     the
improvement of the computer technology within the land titles section of the Registry to reduce
the turn-around time for registering properties; (iii) the improvement in the operations of the
Registry to allow it to evolve into a self-financing agency through a lowering of its operating
cost and an increasing of its fee-based revenues as a result of improved services.

1.4Strengthening of Fiduciary Capacitv
15.      This sub-component would support the strengthening of the fiduciary capacity within the
public sector in Dominica including (i)   strengthening of financial management capacity within
the Accountant General's and Auditor Generals departments; (ii)    implementation of procurement
action plan; and (iii)  taking measures to integrate where possible into the pooled procurement
initiative beingpiloted between Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines inthe context of the
ongoing public sector modernization project inGrenada.

Component2 US$252,000
                -
Improvingthe InvestmentClimate
(10% of totalprojectcost)
16.     The primary objective of this component i s to strengthen the policy, strategic and
institutional environment for attracting investment into Dominica. Specifically, the activities
under this component will seek first to develop a National Investment Strategy and Action Plan
which embodies the long-termsector policy and strategic focus of the agenda agreed between the
Government and the private sector. Second, on the basis of the strategy and action plan, there
will be activities to restructure the Dominica National Development Corporation (NDC) into an


                                                34

effective institution with a specific mandate to implement the strategy. This component will be
complementary to work to be undertaken by USAID to address deficiencies in the regulatory
framework for investment.

2.1 Development of a National Investment Stratem
 17.     This sub-component will provide support for activities to develop a National Investment
Strategy based on extensive consultations with key stakeholders and drawing on international
best practice. This investment strategy will help to focus the limited public resources in areas in
which Dominica could develop competitive advantage and where attracting Foreign Direct
investment (FDI) could contribute to the national objective of increasing private sector led
growth.

2.2 Development and Implementation of National Action Plan
 18.     This sub-component will support the development of a specific action plan for the
investment strategy as well as the implementation of the action plan including a restructuring the
currently unwieldy NDC (with both industrial and tourism departments), to function as a full
investment promotion agency (PA) charged with the mandate to implement the investment
promotion strategy.

 19.     The main bottlenecks which investors face in setting up a business in Dominica are
presented in detail in the Dominica Investor Roadmap7 (USAID, 2004). These include, among
others, strengthening the resources and capacity of the NDC so that it i s capable of performing
its investment support role, making investment incentives automatic and subject to approval by
the NDC for most cases, removing discretion in the granting of investment incentives, providing
adequate information and publishing guides on how the investment regime works (both on paper
and online). An overarching concern i s also the lack of a consistent long-term investment
strategy, which outlines the sectors and types of firms which Dominica would work to attract,
and the regions of the country which would be actively promoted abroad.

20.      In line with the above, the proposed component will finance the development of a
National Investment Strategy for Dominica covering 2006 to 2020. The Strategy will be
elaborated in consultation with all stakeholders including the Diaspora. It should clearly outline
the main sectors where investments are sought, their potential in Dominica, and the incentives to
be providedto investors inthese sectors.

2.2.1 Development of a National Action Plan
21.      The project will finance the preparation of a detailed action plan which will seek to
implement the National Investment Strategy including the restructuring of the NDC to meet the
mandate to implement the strategy. The restructuring of the NDC may involve a split into two
separate agencies; (i)  an investment promotion agency and (ii)Tourism Authority.
                                                                       a

 will, in addition, finance the purchase of office equipment, computers, publication of
promotional material, a new website, special software for access to foreign investors' databases
 as well as subscription to other relevant international business information databases and
 services.

                -
Reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector
 (27% of total project cost)
 23.    The objective of this component is to liberalize and regulate the production and
distribution of electricity to improve competitiveness and to support the government in
developing a framework for the development of alternative sources of energy. According to the
recent OECS Growth and Competitiveness Study', electricity supply and costs was the number
one infrastructure related constraint cited by firms. Although 45 percent of the electricity
produced in Dominica i s from hydro-power, the country has the highest cost of electricity in the
OECS. The report also pointed out that the operating inefficiency was high in Dominica with
transmission and distribution losses at 19 percent of total generation. Further, the report argued
that weak oversight and regulation of the electricity sector has exacerbated the situation and not
protectedresidential and commercial consumersfrom either excessively highcosts and/or supply
shortages.

24.     The OECS Growth and Competitiveness study suggests that increasedregulatory scrutiny
of capacity plans of both private and public utilities will be essential to reduce overall costs and
prices. In addition, the report suggests that the introduction of alternative energy sources such as
wind, geothermal and natural gas could provide some savings. Indeed, in the case of Dominica,
preliminary feasibility studies suggest that geothermal energy could provide the basis for
Dominica's export of electricity to neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe.

25.     The Government of Dominica has recently moved to enact a new Electricity Act which
will provide the basis for the strengthening of the regulatory oversight of the operations,
investments and pricing of electricity utilities. This component of the technical assistance
operation will provide support to the Government for the establishment of a modern, effective
regulatory framework for the energy sector. The specific sub-components include: (i)
establishment of a regulatory commission to provide regulatory oversight for the electricity
sector; and (ii) enactment of alternative energy legislation to provide the legal and regulatory
framework for the development of alternative energy technologies, including hydropower, wind
and geothermal energy.

3.1 Establishment of National Regulatory Commission
26.     This sub-component will finance the establishment of aregulatory commission to provide
regulatory oversight for the electricity sector including for the first 12 months; office, staffing,
training and economic and legal technical assistance to help establish an explicit road map for
both economic and quality of service regulation. The financing of activities under this sub-
component will be conditioned on the passage of the passage of the Electricity Act which will
provide the legal basis for the establishment and sustainability of an independent regulatory

 commission for the electricity sector in Dominica. The draft Electricity Act also makes provision
 for the commission to operate as part of a multi-jurisdictional regulatory body serving Dominica
 and one or more other jurisdictions in the region. This makes it possible for Dominica to benefit
from the regional regulatory framework that is currently under consideration.

3.2 Drafting of Alternative Energy Legislation
 27.     This sub-component will support the drafting of alternative energy legislation to provide
the legal and regulatory framework for the development of alternative energy technologies,
including hydropower, wind and geothermal energy. The potential for hydropower has been
demonstrated-approximately 40 percent of the electricity i s now produced from hydro. Recent'
feasibility studies have established the potential for geothermal to satisfy the demand in
Dominica and provide for exports to the neighboring islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe.

Improvingsocial protection
(9% of total project cost)
28.      The objective of the Social Protection Component of the Technical Assistance Project i s to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing social safety net programs, including inter
alia the Education Trust Fund and Public Assistance. The project will support activities to
develop beneficiary databases for program monito,ring; develop a central registry of
beneficiaries; design and implementan efficient and transparent targeting mechanism that would
be used for a number of safety net programs; establish and document all operating procedures for
Public Assistance and the Education Trust Fund; and implement a public information campaign
to inform the public about new approaches to the delivery of social safety net programs.

29.     These activities are intended to address constraints in the delivery of safety net programs
as identified in the 2003 Dominica Social Protection Review and the Government's Growth and
Social Protection Strategy (GSPS) which highlighted problems with respect to non-transparent
targeting of beneficiaries, weak capacity to monitor and evaluate programs and overlap lack of
established policies and procedures for implementation of social safety net programs, and
duplication of skills training and community based programs. The GSPS has been the impetus
for a number of activities intended to strengthen the system. A preliminary database of
beneficiaries for Public Assistance has been established and i s being used by the Ministry of
Community Development. A poverty map has been created and preliminary work on application
of the poverty map for specific programs has begun. Proposals for rationalization of skills
training and community basedare under review. There are three sub-componentsas follows:

4.I Beneficiary Selection System Modernization
30.     This sub-component will finance activities designed to modernize and streamline systems
for beneficiary selection and registration, including: (a) design and implementation of a
transparent and objective targeting mechanism for selection of beneficiaries for the Public
Assistance Program, the Education Trust Fund and other social assistance programs; (b)
development of a central beneficiary registry; and (c) application of the recently developed
poverty maps (which provide information on the spatial distribution of poverty) to community
based, school feeding and short-term employment programs.

4.2 Institution Strengthening
3 1.     This sub-component will support activities to strengthen the administrative capacity to
deliver social assistance through: (a) development of program databases to track beneficiaries
and expenditures for the Education Trust Fund and the School Feeding Program in the Ministry
of Education and further work on database development for the Public Assistance Program in the
ministry of community development; and (b) documentation of policies and procedures for the
public assistance program and for the Education Trust Fund; (c) establishing linkages and access
to the different databases to assist indecision makingat the sector level.

4.3 Public Information Campaign
32.      This sub-component will support the design and implementation of a public information
campaign to inform the public about new approaches to the delivery of social safety net
programs, including the new approaches to targeting and registration of beneficiaries and about
other social protection reforms.

Component 5 US$181,000
                -
Project Management
(7% of total project cost)
33.     This component will finance the operation of the small Project Coordinating Unit
integrated within the Establishment, Personnel and Training Department and employing
permanent government staff and where necessary contract staff. More specifically, this
component will finance: (a) the project coordinator, (b) the cost of the annual project audits,
computers for the PCU as well as the costs of staff assigned to the project and (c) the preparation
and implementation of a communication strategy to raise support for the proposed reforms as
well as address any resistance to the reforms. This communication strategy will build on the
institutional framework and experience which the Government has established from recent
consultations for the GSPS and implementation of the Value Added Tax (VAT). In addition, the
project will benefit from Grenada's successful experience in conducting public information
campaigns.

                            Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
           DOMINICA: Growth and Social Protection TechnicalAssistance Credit


 Fully Integrated PCU
 1.     The Project will be implementedby the Government over three years. There will be close
 coordination with the relevant ministries and departments. A small Project Coordinating Unit
 (PCU), fully integrated within the public sector in the Establishment, Personnel and Training
 Department will be responsible for the management of the project. The unit will be headedby a
 full-timeCoordinatorProcurement Officer and aproject accountant.

 2.     The Project Coordinator could be seconded or transferred from a current position within
 the public service or be selected on a competitive basis in accordance with Bank procedures if
 selected from outside of the current Government structure. The Project Coordinator will report to
 the Financial Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The PCU under the leadership
 of the Project Coordinator will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the project
 includingfinance, accounting, disbursement and procurement as well as the preparation of Terms
of Reference. The PCU will also be responsible for providing timely reports to the government
and to donors.

 3.     To provide fully integrated technical support, there will be four Working Groups (one
each for the first four components of the project) headed by technical champions or by the
relevant Permanent Secretaries. All four of the working groups have already been established.
The Working Groups will be responsible for providing technical inputinto or reviewing terms of
references, clearing procurement and disbursement request, overseeing selection of consultants
and monitoring their work to ensure the transfer of skill and the building of capacities in the
relevant ministries and departments. The working groups will meet "on demand" to respond to
the needs of the PCUfor technical support.

Project Steering Committee
4.      Given the multi-sectoral nature of the project, there i s need for a steering committee
which i s representative of the different sectors involved. The Government has already
established a steering committee for reforms headed by a champion appointed by the Cabinet.
Currently, this reform committee consists of the Financial Secretary, all Permanent Secretaries,
the Social Development Planner, a representative from the private sector, the Chief Personnel
Officer and a representative from the NGO sector. In order not to create a new institutional
structure but build on an existing one, it is proposed that this same steering committee have
oversight over the project based on the following terms of reference: The Terms of Reference of
the steering committee will be to: (i) provide overall policy guidance to the PCU through the
Ministry of Finance and Planning; (ii)  oversee the project implementation process; (iii) address
implementation bottlenecks; and (iv) monitor and evaluate implementation progress.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
           DOMINICA: Growth and SocialProtectionTechnicalAssistance Credit

 1.     A mission visited Dominica between March 6-9, 2006 to assess the Financial
 Management arrangements for the Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project
 (GSPTAP). The complete Financial Management Assessment Report is available in the Project
 Files.

 2.     The main findings of the missions were:

 (a)    The overall strategy for establishing the financial management systems for the GSPTAP
 would be to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, the existing country systems for financial
 accounting, documentation, and reporting aspects of the project, consistent with the Bank's
 fiduciary requirements. Given the findings of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment
 (CFAA) undertaken in 2004, reliance on country systems i s likely to increase slightly the
 implementation risk of the project. However, sufficient countervailing measures have been
 includedinthe project, to substantially mitigate the implementation risks.

 (b)    The Chart-of-Accounts of the Reform Management Unit (RMU) of the Establishment,
Training and Personnel Department (ETPD) would be changed to accommodate the GSPTAP.
This would enable the project to be integrated into the Governmental budgetary structure. Off-
the-shelf accounting software would be initially needed to record and report on project
transactions until the Smart stream accounting software i s reprogrammed to accommodate
accounts neededto prepareWorld Bank reports.

(c)     The Project Coordinating Unit within the Reform Management Unit, which will be
responsible for coordinating the project's activities, has agreed to hire a Project Accountant with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the World Bank.

(d)     The project would have severalimplementing entities as well as a relatively large number
of small value transactions. Furthermore, the fiduciary arrangements under the project would rely
on existing country systems. In order to enhance accountability under the project it has been
agreed that an internal audit would be undertaken by the Audit Office annually. The
Government's internal auditor would consult with the Bank by May 31 each year on the aspects
of the Project to be includedinthe internal auditor's work programfor the following year.

(e)     Given the planned reliance on country systems, it i s important that gaps in the public
financial management system be addressed under the project. The Smart stream Software i s
presently lacking a self-audit module and staff are not able generate a full range of reports, partly
due to limited skills of the staff utilizing the system. It i s unable to generate a report with
individual un-clearedbalances, which necessitates the Department of Audit to audit these classes
of transactions. It has been agreed that the self-audit module of Smart stream Software would be
bought and two staff would be sent for further Smart stream training, lasting about 3 months
each inBarbados, under the Project.




                                                 42

 Flow of Funds
 3.      The IDA Grant would be channeled to the project through a Designated Account
 denominated in U S Dollars to be established by the Ministry of Finance and Planning at a bank
 satisfactory to the World Bank ( possibly the National Bank of Dominica). If the Government
 has an agreement for overdraft facility with the Bank, then the provision of a comfort letter by
 the Bank holding the Designated Account would be required before the deposit of the initial
 deposit in the Designated Account. A local currency account would also be opened to cover
 local currency expenditures falling due. These expenditures would be financed via withdrawals
 from the Designated Account. An initial deposit out of the IDA Credit will be made to the
 Designated Account equivalent to US$145,000 until the World Bank determines, based on the
 amounts and frequency of withdrawal applications, that a higher balance i s necessary. Transfers
 from the Designated Account to the Local Currency Account would be based on projected
 expenditures for a period lasting no more than 30 days. Payments made from the Designated
 Account and related Local Currency Account would require two signatures, one by the Financial
 Secretary and the other by the Project Coordinator. The Designated Account and the Local
 Currency Account are expectedto be openedby the end of November, 2006.

 Accounting System
 4.      The Chart-of-Accounts of the Establishment, Training and PersonnelDepartment (ETPD)
 has been modified to accommodate the GSPTAP. This would enable the project to be integrated
 into the Governmental budget structure, The accounting and recording of expenditures would be
based on the Government's SIGFIS and Smart stream Accounting Software. All project
expenditures would be processedby the Office of the Chief Personnel Officer of the ETPD using
the Governments Smart Stream Accounting System, thereby integrating the project expenditures
directly into the Government's budgeting system. This payment procedure would enhance both
internal control and the reliance on country systems. If necessaryan additional Accounting Clerk
would be hired to handle the increased transactions volume necessitated by the Project.
Expenditures would be recorded at RMU to meet reporting requirements of the EU and the
World Bank. The PCU would utilize a cash basis of accounting for recording and reporting on
the transactions of the project and would utilize the QuickBooks to maintain the records of
transactions under the project. The line ministries would also utilize a cash basis of accounting,
but would have the option to use either Smart stream, a spread sheet such as Microsoft Excel or
QuickBooks to maintain their records. Administrative procedureswould be put inplace to ensure
that policies and procedures are complied with and that financial transactions would be made
with the     consideration to safeguarding assets and ensuring proper entry in the
accounting/monitoring system.

FinancialReporting
5.      In addition to the internal reports that the PCU would prepare, it has agreed to prepare
FinancialMonitoring Reports (FMRs) that would be submitted to the World Bank on a quarterly
basis. The basic format of the FMRs was confirmed during negotiations. The FMRs have been
designed to be as simple as possible. The FMRs would include financial, program progress and
procurement information. The financial monitoring reports would include a statement showing
for the period and cumulatively cash receipts by sources and expenditures by main expenditure
classifications. Program progress reports would include narrative information and output
indicators, if any, linking financial information with progress in implementing the Technical
Assistance Program. As part of the FMRs the PCU would prepare 6-month cash forecast


                                                43

statements, which would indicate the projected level of disbursements during the next 2 quarters
following the quarter covered inthe FMRs. The cash forecast would point in advance to potential
areas where procurement action could be expedited as well as indicate the major project
implementation activities falling due. The participating line Ministries would be provided with a
template for generating the project FMRs relating to their respective components. The format for
the FMRs and the reporting template for the line ministries were confirmed during negotiations.
The Project Coordinator would decide whether a separate software package (QuickBooks or M S
Excel) would be needed to prepare the FMRs. The PCU would also produce financial
disbursement reports for the EU and the World Bank, such as Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs). While, the basic reports would be produced directly from the system, donor reports
would be generally produced utilizing M S Excel (from the data obtained from the PCU and
Smart Stream).

InternalAudit
6.      The PCU would not have an internal auditor. However, because of the large number of
small value transactions that would be financed under the project and the decentralized approach
to project implementation, it has been agreed that the Government's internal auditor should
review the transactions under the project at least once a year. It was agreed that the
Government's internal auditor would consult with the Bank by May 31 each year on the aspects
of the Project to be included in the internal auditor's work program for the following year. The
internal audit is to be undertaken by December 31, of each year of project implementation and
submitted to the Bank no later than January 31of the following year.

ExternalAudit
7.      Under the technical assistance project, the PCU's financial statements would be audited
annually by an independent auditor satisfactory to the World Bank. The audit reports would be
prepared in accordance with International Standards on Auditing following Terms of Reference
(TORS) satisfactory to the World Bank. The audits would be prepared by private auditors under
the auspices of the Audit Office. The audit reports would include supporting schedules providing
sufficient information on the Sources and Uses of Funds, Statement of Expenditures (SOE) and
the Designated Account and related Local Currency Account pertaining to the IDA Credit. The
amounts in these financial statements would be required to be reconciled with the amounts in the
World Bank's disbursement records as contained in Client Connection. The annual audit reports
would be submittedto the World Bank no later than 4 months following the end of the fiscal year
(July 1-June 30).


DisbursementArrangements
8.      The disbursements under the project would be transactions based. Disbursements will be
made on the basis of full documentation, provided in advance, for all expenditures above the
prior review threshold. For all other eligible expenditures, goods costing less than US$50,000
contracts for consulting firms costing less than US$50,000 and for contracts for individual
consultants costing less than US$25,000 disbursement would be on the basis of SOEs. For
expenditures made on the basis of SOEs, the PCU would maintainthe supporting documentation
for the expenditures for review by visiting Bank supervision missions and by the independent
auditors. All direct contracting for goods and single source selection for consultants would be
subject to prior review regardless of amount. The authorized allocation would be deposited into

Follow-up & Supervision Plan
9.       A financial managementsupervision mission should visit Dominicaprior to effectiveness
in order to ensure that the financial management system of the project is in place. After
effectiveness, a FM Specialist would need to review the quarterly FMRs, including the cash
forecast, the annual internal and external audit reports and should perform one supervision
mission per year.

                              Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
            DOMINICA: Growth and Social ProtectionTechnical Assistance Credit

A. General
 1.     Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreedbetween
the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements
ininstitutionalcapacity.

2.      Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project will include: office
equipment and furniture, computer equipment and software. For proprietary software,
procurement through direct contracting i s envisioned. The procurement will be carried out using
the Bank's standard bidding documents (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD agreed with the
Bank for national competitive bidding (NCB) and shopping procedures.

3.      Procurement of non-consulting services:              will consist of printing services,
communication and internet services for the regulatory commission. Printing services will be
procured using shopping procedures and internet services will be procured through direct
contracting with the sole provider of internet services inDominica.

4.      Selection of Consultants: Consultant services will be required, inter alia, for change
management, manpower management, preparation of strategic documents, preparation of action
plans, specialized trainers, IT systems, legal drafting and legal opinion, economic analysis and
advice, strategic reviews and technical assistance for Customs and for the PSRU. Where teams
of consultants are not required, individual consultants will be hired to provide specialized
advisory seryices and services to support project implementation and monitoring.

5.      Training: The project will finance all costs associated with training, study tours and
workshops required for the implementation of the project.

6.      Recurrent Costs: Recurrent operating costs related to the first year of operation of the
regulatory commission, including the salaries for support staff will be covered by the project and
will be procuredusingprinciples and procedures that are acceptableto IDA.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement
7.      Institutional Arrangements: The Government has chosen to locate the implementation
unit for the Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project (GSPTAP) in the
Ministry of Finance and Planning in order to tap into their installed capacity. A procurement
specialist in the PCU will oversee all procurement, based on the procurement plan. However, as
currently organized, the Ministry of Finance and Planning i s severely understaffed, which may




                                                 47

constrain its ability to perform these functions. The core staff of the Ministry consists of 15
positions, 2 of which are vacant, with one person on extended study leave.

8.      InDominica only limited procurement activities are carried out by the public sector and
the majority i s executed by the donors' representatives following donor requirements. The
Administrator's office is charged in general with procurement for MoFP, while procurement of
computers and related equipment is carried out by the Computer center within the Ministry.
Stationary and other like items are procured by the clerk at the Prime Minister's office. However,
he only does this for the other public sector agencies upon request, and no attempt i s made to
consolidate like items. It i s also important to note that the Prime Minister's office/Ministry of
Finance acts as the Central Tenders Board for Dominica, as this regulatory agency was never
established. All these extra duties concentrated in MoFP limit the time they can devote to their
core mandate as policy makers.

9.      The GSPTAP presents an opportunity to createhtrengthen capacity in the GoCD, rather
than relying on PIUs/donor implementingunits staffed by consultants, which ensure only limited
transfer of knowledge to the institutions. However, for this to be accomplished it i s necessary to
identify the existing staff with potential to take on project managementresponsibilities, including
procurement and financial managementpersonnel. A procurement advisor financed by EUfunds
will be hired for the first 6 months of the GSPTAP to work step by step with the procurement
staff.

Procurement Environment
10.     The Commonwealth of Dominica Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR),
dated June 2003, prepared by the World Bank, provides a detailed Action Plan to bring public
procurement in line with international standards. The reason given by the government for not
following up on the recommendations of the CPAR i s that, in 2004 and 2005, their limited staff
resources were concentrated on the debt reduction strategy as a priority. A CPAR funded by the
IDB and implementedthrough CARICOM was also prepared in 2004. In addition, CIDA is
supporting the preparation of a draft Procurement Act in several of the OECS countries.

11.     The current procurement regulatory framework for Dominica i s contained in the
Financial and Stores Regulation Act of 1980. The Act i s outdated and establishes low thresholds
for contract review and approval that were appropriate to the size of Dominica's economy 25
years ago. The Central Tenders Board required by the Stores Regulation was never established.
The Prime Minister/Minister of Finance acts as the regulatory authority for public procurement
and in this capacity reviews the majority of contracts. Donor financed contracts and even
"change orders" must have MoFP approval although signature i s delegated to two budget
officers at MoFP. Intheir capacity as budget officers these Ministry staff cannot contribute in a
substantive way to any technical review, as their responsibility i s limited to confirming budget
allocations.

12.     Interms of code of ethics and anti-corruption legislation, Dominica issued the Integrity
Act in 2003. The Act is fairly comprehensive, but has not been fully disseminated, according to
reports prepared by consultants for the (CIDA-funded) Eastern Caribbean Economic
Management Project (ECEMP).




                                                  48

 13.     A major issue identified is the overall lack of procurement planning. Even the strongest
 ministries-such     as the Ministry of Public Works and Public Utilities-need                 further
 strengthening in forecasting and preparation of realistic schedules.         The position of Chief
Development Planner for the Planning and Public Investment Unit in MoFP has been vacant for
 some time and the staff charged with this responsibility lack not only the experience but the time
required to coordinate with all the line Ministries.

 14.     It is worth noting that some government agencies are very efficient at procurement, for
example the Central Medical Stores located in the Princess Margaret Hospital, which could be
replicated in other ministries and government agencies. The Central Medical Stores, with a
limited staff of nine, manages to identify and set deadlines for requests for drugs and minor
medical equipment from all health facilities in the country; and to prepare purchase orders and
submit them to the OECS Pharmaceutical Procurement Services (PPS) in order to receive the
goods in a timely manner.          They also carry out procurement outside of PPS for medical
equipment for the main hospitals and all clinics. OECS PPS considers the Central Medical Stores
of Dominica as one o f the most organized inthe OECS.

 15.     In order to address the institutional and staff capacity constraints to procurement, the
authorities have worked closely with Bank staff to prepare a Procurement Action Plan (which i s
also a condition for budgetary support from the EU). The implementation of the Procurement
Action Plan will also be a key element of the public sector reform supported by the GSPTAP.

16.      The overall project risk for procurement i s moderate given the limited demonstrated
experience in procurement. However, the implementation of the Procurement Action Plan as an
integral part o f the project i s not only a strong mitigation measure but also will ensure that future
projects will not be subject to this lack of capacity.

C. Procurement Plan
17.      The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team on October 10, 2006 and i s available at the PCU. It will also be
available in the project database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will
be updated inagreement with the Project team annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

D. Frequency ofProcurement Supervision
18.      In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended bi-annual supervision
missions to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions.

                             Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
           DOMINICA: Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Credit

1.       The proposed project will provide technical assistance to support the implementation of
key policy reforms to facilitate private sector ledgrowth for increasedemployment and reduction
of poverty. Inthe process, the project will also improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness
of the public sector inkey areas including procurement, investment promotion, trade facilitation,
registration of businesses, regulation of utilities and social protection.

2.       Although difficult to quantify, the fiscal, economic and social impacts from the project
are expected to be significant. These are summarized inthe table below:
