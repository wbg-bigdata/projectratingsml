MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE EBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A
PUBLIC lNVESTMENT STRENGTHENING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$16 million to help finance a
project for Public Investment Strengthening. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace.
2.       Background. Argentina is a country which has suffered from a prolonged political
and economic decline with a concomitant deterioration of its public institutions. When the
present Administration took office in July 1989, Argentina was in the throes of recession and
monthly inflation of up to 200 percent, labor productivity had fallen, social services and basic
infrastructure had deteriorated, and poverty had become a serious and growing problem. The
new Administration addressed these problems with a series of profound structural reforms,
which included decentralizing large portions of the economy (privatization of nearly all public
enterprises at the national level and transfers to the Provinces of a large number of functions,
especially in the areas of health and education), a 15% reduction in federal employment
(excluding privatizations and transfers), and strengthening of key institutions, in all of which
the Bank has played an important supportive role.
3.        The deterioration of the state resulted, among other impacts, in the complete
breakdown of the budgetary process. In the absence of the planning framework given by a
properly formulated budget, control and evaluation of expenditures has been very weak. In a
complex series of efforts, the Government of Argentina has addressed these issues with
resolve, and as a result, the National Budget has now been prepared on time three years in a
row, and the first tri-annual National Public Investment Plan will be presented to Congress
this year, after many years' absence. The new Integrated Financial Information System
(SIDIF) collects and consolidates all information on expenditures by the national government.
As of July 1995, the use of a single account for the Treasury permits more efficient
management of public monies, until then held in more than 4000 separate Bank accounts. A
new debt management system (SIGADE, developed by UNCTAD) is in operation in the
Public Credit Directorate at the ME. As a result, detailed accounting and budgeting
information can now be produced in a timely fashion. In addition, a modern Auditor
General's Office has been created and ex-ante control eliminated with a consequent increase
in efficiency and transparency. With the control of expenditures significantly improved in this
way, the next area which needs to be addressed is the efficiency and effectiveness of
expenditures.



2
4.       Argentinean public expenditures are roughly divided into two  categories:
operational expenditures (US$32 billion) 1, and investment expenditures (US$8 billion). The
latter is, in turn, divided into physical investment (US$4 billion) and an additional US$4 billion
of associated expenditures (e.g., planning and training), including projects cofmanced with the
provinces and municipalities. The Government proposes addressing the problem of the
efficiency and effectiveness in investment through training in project analysis and evaluation
which would create a culture of evaluation by results and impact to replace earlier
measurements by cost incurred. The Government strategy is to concentrate initially on real
capital investment (through the proposed project) and social investment (through the Social
Protection Project, in preparation, in cooperation with the proposed project). The results of
these efforts would be expanded to the provincial governments (Second Provincial
Development Project, 3877-AR). At a later stage it could be envisaged to expand results to
other areas of public expenditure.
5.       The Government's investment strategy has altered considerably. The change in the
role of the State from production to regulation has resulted in large-scale privatization of state-
owned enterprises and a considerable decrease in public investment requirements. Nevertheless,
significant investment remains: the Govemment's investment program  for 1995-19992
amounts to approximately US$86.8 billion, including national, provincial and municipal
governments as well as privatized and public enterprises. Of this amount, US$6 billion are
direct national government investments, and US$18 billion are national investments through
transfers and loans.
6.       The investment programming mechanism has never been strong in Argentina.
Information on the status of a sample of investment projects in the present pipeline has revealed
that no more than 10% of those projects could provide a detailed feasibility study to justify the
project and its design. Poor project preparation has resulted in a weak track record in obtaining
extemal financing, and substantial variation in the speed of project implementation, which in
some cases is as low as 14% of planned execution. Weak identification mechanisms, poor
physical and financial monitoring of execution, little if any consideration of environmental
issues and no evaluation of results or impact characterize public investment today.
7.       In 1993, to address these weaknesses, the Govemment created the National
Directorate for Public Investment and Project Financing (DNIP) within the Secretariat of
Economic Programming (SEP) in the Ministry of Economy. In August 1994 the National
System for Public Investment (SNIP) law was approved by Congress3. This law assigns to
DNIP the responsibility for putting together, with sectoral agencies, the tri-annual National
Public Investment Plan (the first year of which coincides with the Budget). These duties

include ensuring the quality of national and nationally-cofinanced real capital investment (both
ex-ante and ex-post), setting norms for project analysis and evaluation, maintaining an up-to-
date inventory of investment projects, identifying projects of national interest, assisting in their
preparation and helping find extemal financing. The responsibility for project identification,
preparation and evaluation remains with the investment agencies. This decentralization of
responsibility to the sectoral agencies is an important step away from the old paradigm of the
central planning ministry. Physical and financial monitoring of execution is being addressed by
the Secretariat of Finance in the same Ministry, through the Integrated Financial Information
System (see para. 3).
8.       For the National Public Investment System to function effectively, four areas need
to be addressed: (a) the lack of public and private sector awareness of the importance of
evaluation of results and impact as a measure of the effectiveness and efficiency of
expenditures; (b) training of selected management and staff in sectoral agencies in project
identification, analysis and preparation as well as the use of evaluation; (c) the lack of broad
national strategies in selected sectors; and (d) the relative lack of experience, given its recent
creation, of the central unit (DNIP) in guiding a process of this nature.
9.       Project Objectives. The project aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of
the government's public expenditure management by improving its investment process,
strengthening its project analysis capabilities and building up the project and program
evaluation capacity in Argentina. These goals would be achieved by: (i) building the
ownership/commitment of senior government officials to the application of good practice in the
formulation and implementation of strategic investment decision-making; (ii) building a
sustainable decentralized capacity to identify, prepare, select and evaluate investment by central
government agencies; (iii) carrying out basic studies in support of public investment strategies
in priority sectors; and (iv) supporting DNIP in the implementation of the National Investment
Plan System (SNIP).
10.       Project Description. The project would be implemented over a five-year period
starting in late 1995, and would finance high level workshops, training programs, technical
assistance and some equipment through five components, as follows (see Technical Annex for
more details):
Sectoral Investment Decision Making (US$1.2 million, or 5% of total project
cost). Actions would take the form of Senior Policy Interventions, a series of
high-level seminars with the objective of familiarizing decision-makers with best
practice in the areas of public investment and public expenditure management
from selected OECD countries and the concepts of public expenditure efficiency
and investment evaluation launched through the National Public Investment
System; and High Level Workshops, directed at senior officials/decision makers,
journalists as well as individuals and firms from the private sector.



4
Improvement of Agencies' Project Analysis and Evaluation Capacity (US$7.6
million, or 30% of total project cost). The objective of the component is to enhance
the effectiveness and sustainability of public investment and to create a culture of
analysis and evaluation of investments and public expenditures through training and
technical assistance to up to 100 national government investment agencies. It
consists of: (1) Main Capacity Strengthening Courses, in-depth courses in
investment decision-making (including environmental considerations), project
management, procurement and project cycle implementation, aimed at middle-
management and personnel of the investment agencies as well as individuals from
the private sector. These courses would be offered by a team composed of four
international facilitators/trainers and four trainers from a local training institute;
(2) Technical assistance to investment agencies in the application of project
analysis techniques learned. This subcomponent consists of assistance to the
agencies in the preparation of at least one project following approved guidelines,
preparation of an annual investment plan, and preparation of a five-year
investment program; and (3) technical assistance to investment agencies in the
application of impact evaluation techniques through the analysis of selected
existing projects. This subcomponent consists of approximately 30 evaluations.
* Basic Studies in Support of Sectoral Investment Strategies (US$8.6 million, or
35 % of total project cost), leading to project identification and the preparation of
sectoral strategies for selected agencies. These strategies would improve the
quality of investment by improving prioritization of efforts on a country-wide
basis. Indicative terms of reference for the environment, natural resources and
infrastructure sectors have been prepared (see Technical Supplement) by the
corresponding agencies in Argentina with assistance from the appropriate Bank
sectoral divisions, who will supervise their implementation.
* Support to the Preparation of the National Public Investment Plan (US$2.7
million, or 11% of total project cost). The quality of the National Public Investment
Plan (NPIP) directly depends on quality at entry, and therefore the bulk of the
strengthening effort is addressed to the investment agencies. Nevertheless,
strengthening of DNIP is required for this Directorate to put together the NPIP. To
this effect, DNIP will receive technical assistance in the preparation and application
of policy and project analysis methodologies and on-the-job training to prepare
medium-term expenditure and investment frameworks. In addition, this project will
help disseminate the SNIP Law and its application, notably through the setting up
of a help-desk for telephone assistance.
* Project Administration (US$2.5 million, or 10% of total project cost), consisting
of project administration, office equipment, yearly extemal audits and an agreement
with a procurement agency for procurement and administration services. Price

contingencies constitute an unallocated amount of US$2.3 million (9% of total
project costs). No physical contingencies are contemplated, because the scope of
all major studies and consultancies has already been well defined and is not
expected to change significantly.
11.       Project Financing. Total project costs are estimated at US$25 million. A Bank loan
of US$16 million (64% of total project costs) is proposed. The government would provide
counterpart funding of US$9 million (36% of total project costs), which would cover all taxes
and duties, equipment maintenance and office rental, as well as portions of project activities.
12.       Project Implementation. The Executing  Agency  will be the National
Directorate of Public Investment and Project Financing (DNIP) in the Secretariat of
Economic Programming (SEP) in the Ministry of Economy (ME). DNIP's Head will be
the National Project Director (NPD), who will ensure that the project is implemented
according to plan. The NPD will be assisted by a Project Administration Unit staffed with
DNTP personnel and consultants, and responsible for project processing, administration
and accounting.
13.       The completion date for the project would be December 31, 2000 and the closing
date June 30, 2001. Procurement of goods and consulting services would be carried out in a
manner consistent with Bank Guidelines (see Technical Annex). An Administrative Manual,
detailing steps to be followed in implementing and monitoring the project, would be prepared
by DNIP, discussed during negotiations and finalized before effectiveness. The government is
considering entering into an agreement with a UN agency for administration and procurement
services; procedures would follow the guidelines described in the Administrative Manual. The
use of an independent auditor was agreed at negotiations.
14. .     Project Sustainability. Commitment of the Government to a transparent and
efficient public investment system is shown by the approval of the SNIP Law in August 1994,
which defines the public sector's responsibilities in public investment. The accessibility for
consultation by both govemment and Congress to the project data bank and the quarterly
presentation to Congress increases the transparency of the process. To ensure the sustainability
of the public investment system, training will continue to be provided after the end of the
project. To this effect, cost-recovery measures will be introduced during the project.
15.       Lessons learned from Previous Bank Involvement. Previous efforts by the Bank
(and IDB) in other countries indicate that public investment strengthening efforts were not
fully successful because relevant literature4 shows: (i) these efforts were directed at creating

central planning ministries operating under a protective state umbrella; strengthening of the
central units usually precluded strengthening of the sectoral agencies; (ii) the efforts lacked
scope. and were inadequate in size as they were carried out through limited components within
larger projects; (iii) there was no strategic framework integrating public investment in the
broader scheme of public expenditure management and efforts were carried out in isolation
from mainstream resource allocation activities; and (iv) results of strengthening efforts were
not institutionalized. The above lessons have been taken into consideration as follows: (i) the
investment system is decentralized, and the bulk of the effort is directed towards strengthening
sectoral agencies; (ii) the proposed project is a stand-alone one; (iii) public investment will
form part of the budget preparation annual exercise within the framework of the SNIP and
Financial Administration Laws in Argentina; and (iv) all activities are line with DNIP's basic
functions, and it will therefore be implemented by DNIP's management and staff, with
minimal assistance from long-term consultants.
16.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. This project is fully consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on May 4, 1995' with the Provincial Bank
Privatization Project (Ln. 3878-AR), which focuses on: (i) consolidating structural reforms; (ii)
reducing poverty and developing human resources; and (iii) rebuilding infrastructure. This
project will contribute towards the first objective by improving fiscal management through a
more efficient use of scarce budgetary resources. The project will also help improve the
effectiveness of public investments which are complementary to private sector development.
The project will complement other Bank projects in the Public Sector Management area, which
have focused on strengthening greatly weakened institutions, in central, provincial and
municipal governments, with special emphasis on revenue-generating or expenditure-
controlling institutions. It is a first crucial step for improving the efficiency of the use of general
public investment in Argentina. It is also complemented by the Social Protection Project (in
preparation) which addresses the need to monitor social programs, and by the Second
Provincial Development Project (3877-AR) which addresses the need to strengthen public
investment units in provincial governments. With public investment expected to grow from its
depressed levels, while being concentrated on fewer activities, it is critical to improve the
government's institutional capacity to produce high quality project analysis, management and
evaluation6. The project would strengthen the agencies involved in the public investment
process through training and consulting assistance. The studies financed are in priority sectors
(Environment, Infrastructure, Natural Resources), and will help compensate for the expected
decline of formal Bank Economic and Sector Work in the next several years.
17.        Agreed Actions: One of the conditions for effective implementation of the project,
that the regulations for implementing the Public Investment Law (SNIP) be approved, was

fulfilled on May 22, 1995. At Negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on
the following: (i) use of the Special Account and Statement of Expenditures; terms and
conditions, accounting and auditing procedures; (ii) annual audit of the project special account
by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and submission of the audit statement to the Bank no later
than June 30 each year; (iii) the carrying out of the Project Implementation Plan in a timely
fashion; (iv) provision by Project Administrator of semiannual project implementation reports
in December and June each year including measure of quantitative and qualitative objectives
achieved, and review and updating of project implementation schedules; and (v) preparation
by the ME within six months of project completion, of an Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) to assess the success of the project. In addition, a draft Administrative Manual was
prepared.
18.       As Conditions of Effectiveness, (i) The project's Administrative Manual,
detailing administrative procedures and defining reports to be used by staff and the Bank for
project supervision would be completed and agreed with the Bank; and (ii) the Project
Administrator would be hired.
19.       Environmental Assessment. This project finances technical assistance in the area of
strategic decision-making and studies that will be key precursors to future infrastructure
investments. For that reason, the project is classified as category "B" and includes provisions to
ensure that environmental analysis is incorporated where appropriate.
20.       Program Objective Categories. The primary category is Public Sector Management
(PB).
21.       Participatory Approach. Terms of reference for all studies identified have been
prepared by the corresponding sectoral entities and are presented in the Technical Supplement.
The project is heavily oriented towards the decentralized investment units (activities totaling
73% of total project costs are aimed at these units). Provincial and municipal governments,
although not directly targeted or financed under this project, will be encouraged to join the
Public Investment System, by sending staff to the same training, using the same methodologies
as central government staff, and providing information to the central databank BAPIN. Several
provinces have already expressed a serious interest in participating. The project has been
prepared jointly by the staff of DNIP and consultants hired by ME, with assistance from the
Bank.
22.       Project Benefits. The main project benefit would be an increased awareness and
application by the government of evaluation of results and impacts to better measure the
effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures. This is expected to result in improved

agency for procurement and administrative services.

project analysis and preparation and a more rational allocation of resources, and help increase
the productivity of public investmnents.
23.       Project Risks. The major risks are (i) unsustained government commitment to
reform; and (ii) excessive politicization of the selection of projects resulting in improper use of
the investment system. These risks would be mitigated as follows: (i) high-level government
commitment is shown by the approval in August 1994 of the National Public Investment
System Law and in May 1995 of its regulation, and (ii) although the final selection of projects
is and should be a political decision, a properly working public investment system, such as the
one being implemented, will ensure that enough information on the pool of projects is available
to permit a technically sound decision, while access by Congress and government to this
information will enhance the transparency of the decision-making process.
24.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.    Argentina which has suffered from a prolonged political and economic decline with a
concomitant deterioration of its public institutions. Economic policy from the 1940s onward
tended to favor the interests of successive private groups with access to power: unionized labor
through implicit subsidies (high wages, guaranteed employment); industry, through various
subsidies embodied in highly protected markets, tax exemptions through special promotion
regimes, and subsidized credits and grants; and public enterprises, through subsidized inputs and
high, noncompetitive prices.'
2.    The unexpected rise in real intemational interest rates and the abrupt end to voluntary foreign
commercial bank credit in the early 1980s provoked a financial collapse, and placed additional
pressure on the economy, which was forced to direct domestic savings into foreign interest payments.
In the period 1980-1982 the public sector took over much of the private debt, exacerbating the
existing structural public deficit.
Macroeconomic Effects
3.    Economic Instabilitv. In the last forty years, economic policy has been characterized by
frequent changes of direction; unforseeable changes in exchange rates; modifications in the nature of
the exchange market, which oscillated between total restriction and absolute freedom; abrupt changes
in the commercial market, ranging from rigorous price control to total deregulation; short-term
subsidies for production; and fluctuations in tariffs on imported goods, among others.
4.    Inflation. Severe macroeconomic and institutional distortions manifested themselves in
chronic public sector deficits and endemic inflation. Public sector deficits in the late 1970s ranged
from 5 to 14 percent of GDP and in the early 1980s surpassed 15 percent of GDP. Central Bank
losses probably raised the combined deficit to over 20 percent of GDP. After the return to
constitutional democracy in 1983, public demands to control inflation were reflected in four major
stabilization programs, all of which failed to eradicate inflation, and indeed aggravated it. Inflation,
high and unpredictable, became the main impediment to the growth of private savings and
investmnents.
Inefficiency in the Use of Public Resources
5.    Lack of budgietarv planning. The deterioration of the state resulted in a complete breakdown
of the budgetary process. In the absence of a planning framework given by a properly formulated
budget, control and evaluation of expenditures can only be weak.

6.     The present administration has enacted a series of structural reforms to recast the foundations
of public finance and the insolvencv of the state. In a complex series of efforts, the Government of
Argentina (GOA) addressed these issues with resolve, and as a result, the National Budget has
now been prepared on time three years in a row, and the first tri-annual National Public
Investment Plan will be presented to Congress during 1995, after many years' absence. The new
Integrated Financial Information System (SIDIF) now collects and consolidates all information
on expenditures by the National Government. As of July 1995, the use of a single account for
Treasury permits the management of cash, which until then was held in more than 4000 separate
bank accounts. A new debt system (SIGADE, developed by UNCTAD) is in operation in the
Public Credit Directorate at the NE. As a result, detailed accounting and budgeting information
can now be produced in a timely fashion. In addition, a modem Auditor General's Office was
created and ex-ante control eliminated with the consequent increase in efficiency and
transparency. With the control of expenditures successfully addressed in this way, the next area
which would need to be addressed is the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures.
7.     Argentinean public expenditures are roughly divided into two categories: operational
expenditures (US$32 billion) 2, and investment expenditures (US$8 billion). The latter is, in turn,
divided into physical investment (US$4 billion, including projects co-financed with the Provinces and
Municipalities) and an additional US$4 billion of associated expenditures (e.g., planning and
training). A list of the major public investment entities (1994 budget) and a sample of large projects
(1995-1999 projections) is given below. Govemment proposes addressing the problem of the
effectiveness and efficiency of investment through training in project analysis and evaluation, creating
a culture of evaluation by results and impact to replace earlier measurements by cost incurred. The
GOA strategy is to concentrate initially on real capital investment (through the proposed project)
and social investment (through the Social Protection Project, in preparation, in cooperation with
the proposed project). The results of these efforts would be expanded to the Provincial
Governments (Second Provincial Development Project, Ln. 3877, approved on May 4, 1995)
and at a later stage results could be expanded to other areas of public expenditure, including
recurrent expenditures.
8.     GOA's investment strategy has altered considerably. The change in the role of the State
from production to regulation resulted in large-scale privatization of state-owned enterprises and
a considerable decrease in public investment requirements. Nevertheless, considerable
investment remains. GOA's investment program  for 1995-1999'  proposes investments of
approximately US$86.8 billion, including National, Provincial and Municipal Governments as
well as privatized and public enterprises. Of this amount, US$6 billion are direct National
Government investments, and US$18 billion are national investments through transferences and
loans ("soft" investments, such as those accompanying physical investments, investments in
human resources, management, etc. are not included at present).
9.    Inefficiency of public investment. As mentioned before, the erosion of the State has resulted
in a weakening of Government as an institution, with, among others, the practically total
21994 budget

disappearance of planning as a function. This has resulted in (i) a general absence of macroeconomic
sectoral strategies; (ii) absence of guidelines for the proper identification and preparation of projects
and the evaluation of their results and impacts, with a concomitant inefficient allocation of resources
and inadequate implementation of public investment projects.
10.     Information  recently  gathered  by
DNIP on the status of a sample of investment    JUDICLAL BRANCH                          ......
projects in the pipeline has revealed that no    MIN. OF JUSTICE
more than 10% of those projects could provide     bUN. OF HEALTH
a detailed feasibility study to justify the project  FOREIGN AFFAIRS
and its design. Data on the execution of         MIN. OF INTERFOR

planned as measured bv disbursements relative
0%   20%  40%  60%  80%  1 000
to authorized expenditures during the year
varied between 0% and 100%. Even when
these variations are averaged out within ministries, substantial variations are still evident across those
ministries. Average disbursement rates relative to budgeted rates ranged between 92.7% for the
Department of Defense to a low of 13.7% within the Judicial Branch.
H.      Many projects were funded that eventually became inoperative, wasting scarce resources.
Furthermore, the most significant part of the projects financed by the federal or the provincial
govemments show ex-ante analyses limited to technical feasibility or engineering studies. The lack of
deeper analysis related to cost efficiency and impact measurement precluded early assessments on
profitability or the suitability of chosen altematives.
12.     Different types of evidence support this claim. First and probably most telling, conversations
with officials in both core Govemment agencies, such as the Ministry of Economy, and line
Ministries, such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Social Action, reveal
consistent agreement that the existing capital budgeting practices fail to reliably sort out productive
from unproductive investment proposals. Second, and consistent with these observations, despite
determined efforts by DNIP to locate data on investment impacts, they have been unable to locate
data which would allow them to develop either an objective or a subjective assessment of the impacts
for public programs in Argentina. This absence of information on investment impacts underscores
one of the most telling failures of the existing patchwork of investment management practices within
the Govemment; namely, a systematic and widespread lack of concern with and attention to the
economic and social impacts of public investments.
13.     From a representative sample of 479 large investment projects, 200 in the pre-investment
phase were selected for quantitative validation. The analysis of the projects in the feasibility stage
demonstrates one of the key weaknesses of project preparation process: the lack of indicators for
project monitoring and further impact measurement. No measurement of the multiple variables to be
impacted by the project has so far been taken into account. Further analysis reveals a nearly total lack



17
of project monitoring and impact indicators; those few which do have impact indicators have only
one.
14.     Another indication of lack of adequate preparation is reflected in the disbursement
distribution. In the sample, 51 projects are multi-year projects in the feasibility stage. Of these, thirty-
two have a "flat" disbursement distribution, i.e. an equal level of investment for every year, a
probabilistically abnormal distribution which indicates weak expenditure planning. Furthermore, only
eight projects scheduled anv expenditures for the pre-investment phase. A consequence of this is a
weak track record in obtaining extemal financing, and a substantial variation across projects in the
speed of implementation.
Condusions
15.    In times of fiscal stress, govemments will emphasize expenditure control to the detriment of
planning and evaluation, i.e., expenditure efficiency, and this can clearly be seen in the case of
Argentina, where no budget and no investment plan were prepared in decades, with the consequent
fiscal lack of discipline. The 1989 reforms improved the transparency and control of financial
information, through decentralization and devolution of authority combined with increased central
monitoring. The new Integrated Financial Information System (see below), when replicated, will
provide accounting and budgetary monitoring information on some 100 expenditure agents in the
national government.
16.     This is thus an appropriate moment for Government to begin to search ways to improve the
efficiency of public expenditures, and it is doing so in several complementary efforts, through four
Bank-financed projects: the Public Sector Reform TA Loan (Ln. 3362-AR - addresses monitoring of
the results of public investment); the Social Protection Project (in preparation - addresses monitoring
as well as the ex-ante and ex-post analysis of social projects); and the Second Provincial Development
Project (Ln. 3877-AR, addresses project preparation for fully Province-financed projects). The
present project addresses evaluation as well as project preparation of non-social programs and
projects, both at the central levels and co-financed with the Provincial Governments, and thus
potentially affects all public expenditure units. Thus, the groundwork would be prepared for the next
reform steps, taking Argentina from public investment planning to planning all of public expenditure.

THE NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT (SNIP) AND NATIONAL
BUDGET FORMULATION
17.    The system for public investment fits well into the overall resource allocation system. The
management of public resources in Argentina is based on a National Budget System by program
backed by a National Accounting System of mixed nature (cash-based for revenues and accrual-based
for expenditures) and a Treasury System which, in the short term, will consist of a single account at
the National Bank ("Banco Naci6n"). All expenditure entities (about 100) in the central government
(including agencies) report detailed accounting transactions to a central system (SIDIF, see below)
which are checked for consistency against the budget. The three stages of an accounting movement
(budgeted, committed, and paid) are registered in the the central system. Eventually it is expected that
detailed data will be processed in a decentralized fashion by the expenditure entities, which would
send only aggregate data to the center.
18.    An overview of the Integrated Financial Information System (SIDIF) can be seen in the
drawing below. The four controlling offices of the system are: the National Budget Office (ONP),
National General Accounting Office (CGN), National Treasury (TGN) and the National Public Credit
Office (ONCP).
19.    In addition to financial data, the system requests performance data from projects; however,
the lack of a project evaluation-oriented culture in the expenditure entities is shown by the emphasis
on the measurement of inputs rather than results, which precludes the measurement of the efficiency
of investment and its impact. It is this next step which the proposed project will address.
The National Public Investment System
20.    Law 24354 of August 1994, created the National Public Investment System (Sistema
Nacional de Inversiones NPblicas, or SNIP), and assigned the responsibility for the coordination and
monitoring of the system to the Secretariat of Economic Programming (SEP) in the Ministry of
Economy and Works and Public Services (ME). Operational responsibility corresponds to the
National Directorate for Public Investment and Project Financing (DNIP), which depends upon the
SEP. This law gives a formal framework to public investment decision-making, concentrating
initially on capital expenditures but affecting potentially other public investment (i.e., social and
Provincial).
21.    Primary responsibility within the system rests with the executing agencies within the
National Public Sector. Each agency is in charge of the identification, preparation and
implementation of projects in its area financed totally or partially with funds from the National
Treasury. To this effect, the law requires the creation (if it does not already exist) within each
government agency of a unit to be responsible for such tasks.
22.    DNIP has primary responsibility to:
(i)    Establish norms governing the assignment of responsibilities for developing a
National Public Investment Plan and its constituent investrnent project proposals;



27
(ii)    Coordinate the formulation of the National Public Investment Plan, NPIP
(responsibility for this function is lodged in the Direcci6n de Inversi6n NPblica (DIP)
within DNIP);
(iii)   Organize and maintain an up-to-date inventory of investment projects (BAPIN); and
(iv)   Supervise the quality of ex-ante and ex-post project evaluations for projects that are
selected for inclusion in the National Public Investment Plan.
23.     Individual line agencies have primary responsibility for preparing investment project
proposals. This is required for all national government agencies and all projects receiving financial
aid from the national govemment. Provinces and the Municipality of Buenos Aires are encouraged to
adhere to the system standards. The responsibilities of the agencies are to:
(i)   identify, formulate and evaluate their project proposals following the guidelines and
methodologies established by DNIP;
(ii)   create and maintain up to date an inventory of their projects;
(iii)  supervise the physical and financial aspects of the execution of their projects;
(iv)   perform ex-post evaluation of their projects; and
(v)    maintain communication with and provide information required to DNIP.
24.     The Secretariat of Finance (Secretaria de Hacienda, including the National Budget Office
and the National Directorate of Projects with International Organizations) has primary responsibility
for coordinating the proposals for budget allocations to the projects that constitute the National Public
Investment Plan, including negotiations, administration and control of public credit (both internal and
extemal). Finance and DNIP exchange data on project status, accounting and financial information.
Organization of the DNIP
25.     DNIP is composed of three Directorates, one Databank Unit and a Pre-investment Unit (see
Chart below) with 55 staff, of which 14 are administrative personnel and 9 vacancies which will be
filled later as the National Investment System begins to operate in full. The organization into
Directorates is stated in the DNIP constituting Decree; the division into units is an internal measure.
26.     The Directorate of Project Analysis provides technical assistance to Government project
preparation units and to the other areas in DNIP. This directorate has three units whose
responsibilities include:
(i)   the development and updating of project preparation and evaluation methodologies
and the calculation of shadow prices (Methodologies Unit). This unit has two
professionals who have prepared basic guidelines using least cost criteria (for some
cases, such as transport, cost/benefit analysis is required). More complex
methodologies have not yet been developed, but it would have been premature to do



28
so unless accompanied by training and technical assistance. These staff will work
directly with the project in the development of the more detailed methodologies.
(ii)   the technical review of projects in prepation (Control Unit). In the future, about 50%
of projects recorded in BAPIN will be selected for a technical review to ensure that
guidelines for project preparation and analysis are followed. The depth of the review
will depend on the complexity and importance of the project, and also on the quality
of its preparation (for example, at present projects presented by Transport are
considered well prepared and therefore not reviewed in depth). Today, only one staff
has this responsibility, as only about 20% of the projects presented (about 80
annually) are accompanied by sufficient information to permit their revision. As
guidelines are disseminated and training given, all projects will eventually be properly
documented. In the medium term, one and possibly two staff members will be added.
In cases of overload or in cases requiring specific expertise, the review will be carried
out by consulting firms.
(iii)   evaluation of project impact (Evaluation Unit). This unit has not yet been formed
given the present absence of an evaluation culture in investments and expenditures.
One staff will be hired, to coordinate work on evaluation methodologies and efforts to
measure impact of on-going projects (see project description). Another staff may join
later depending on the workload.
(iv)   the organization, initiation, maintenance and administration of a permanent system for
training and information dissemination related to project preparation and evaluation
methodologies (Information Dissemination and Training Unit). Two staff work in this
unit; they will work full-time with the project, coordinating training and ensuring
quality. This unit is not expected to grow.
27.     The Directorate of Public Investment is in charge of liaison with other parts of government.
It has three units whose responsibilities include:
(i)   the support of the creation of and relationship with project execution units
(Institutional Relations Unit). At this initial stage in the implementation of the
Investment System, this task consists mostly of informing staff about the SNIP law
and the workings of DNIP and the investment system. Two staff work in this unit;
after three years the work is expected to decrease considerably as communications
with agencies will become more technical; one staff will be reassigned.
(ii)   support of projects of national interest (Project Unit). This unit assists agencies in
the identification and preparation of projects considered to be of national interest.
This unit has two staff working on 80-90 projects a year. About 20 projects
receive substantial inputs, with about 10 of these reaching the project stage. This
unit is not expected to grow.
(iii)  review of general, sectoral and regional medium and long term government strategies,
verifying that proposed investment projects are consistent with these strategies and



29
with national priorities (Strategy Unit). This unit has one staff; it is expected to grow
by two staff as sectoral analysis make more use of results from evaluation techniques.
28.      The Directorate of Financing and Cooperation's main responsibility is to assist and monitor
projects financed (partial or in full) by intemational credit institutions or other sources without
support from the National Budget. It has two units:
(i)    the Finance Unit, which inter alia coordinates extemal financing with  public
investment priorities and assists all project preparation units on external financing
altematives. This unit today is mostly concemed with IDB and World Bank projects;
it is expected to expand to include some bilateral financing. This unit has one staff; it
is expected to grow to two staff
(ii)    the Promotion Unit, which assists other government units in obtaining extemal
financing and/or technical assistance. This unit has one staff. As projects for extemal
financing are increasingly prepared locally, this unit's tasks will increase and another
staff may join the unit.
29.      The Project Data Bank (BAPIN) is concemed with the creation and maintenance of an up-
to-date inventory of all public projects with detailed information on projects including execution. The
pre-investment module is operational; the project execution monitoring module is designed but not
operational; and the evaluation module has yet not been established. It has six people; it is not
expected to grow. It is intended to communicate with the central SIDIF system to exchange
information on project execution.
30.      The Pre-Investment Unit is responsible for the implementation of the Multi-Sectoral Pre-
investment Program, carrying out or financing and supervising inter-sectoral, supra-regional or
national studies. This unit was created and financed through an IDB loan and has eight staff.
Role of the National Public Investment Plan within the Formulation of the National Budeet
31.      For a project to be incorporated into the National Public Investment Plan (NPIP), the
"owner" agencies must first send basic information to DNEP for the project to be inputted into the
project inventory (BAPIN). The information sent depends on the state of preparation of the project,
which starts as an "idea" and goes successively through "profile", "pre-feasibility" and "feasibility"
stages. Projects are checked against global, sectoral or regional policies, the availability of pre-
investment funds verified, and the technical quality of preparation reviewed. A positive evaluation
will result in the preliminary incorporation of the proposed project into the NPIP. Technically
unreliable projects are discarded or sent back to the originating agency for review.All such projects
must be presented before June 15 for incorporation into the following year's NPIP.
32.      Budget formulation starts in April each year with training of the personnel involved and the
constitution of the Budget Preparation Support Group (GAEP', see Budget Preparation Schedule
Subsecretary of Budget, Subsecretary of Macroeconomic Programming, Subsecretary of Financing, Director oftthe National Budget Office,
National Director of Research and Fiscal Analysis, National Director of Fiscal Coordination with the Provinces, National Director of
Employment and Public Sector Salaries. Director of the National Public Credit Oftice, National Director of Projects with International



30
below). The GAEP uses information such as last year's expenditures, national and sector policies, the
fiscal targets agreed with the IMF, the five-year investment plan, macroeconomic projections
prepared by the Macroeconomic Unit in the Secretariat of Economic Programming and the
investment proposals prepared by the different agencies and put together by DNIP.
33.      GAEP reviews the availability of resources and deternines the budget ceiling for each
agency, both for operational and investment resources. The draft proposal is submitted to each agency
and is discussed by the Cabinet. These discussions often involve the agency concemed and the
Budget Office, and at times the President. Once agreement has been reached, each agency prepare's
its detailed draft budget bill proposal. In discussions with DNIP, projects are prioritized and the
National Public Investment Plan prepared.
34.      These proposals are discussed and agreed with GAEP, which prepares the aggregate budget
bill which is presented by the President and the Minister of Economy to Congress. The various
Congressional Sectoral Commissions discuss their sector with the GAEP's technical support staff.
Commentaries are then put together for the Executive Branch. Congress approves the [modified]
Budget enacting it into Law. Only in the last three years has the Budget been prepared and presented
on time. The 1996 preparation and presentation schedule is attached below as an example.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
35.     The project aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the GOA's public
expenditure management by improving in a first phase its investment process, enhancing its project
analysis capabilities and building up project and program evaluation capacity. These goals would
be achieved by:
(i)   building the understanding and ownership of senior GOA officials of the application
of good practice in the formulation and implementation of strategic investment
decision-making through senior policy interventions;
(ii)   building a sustainable decentralized capacity to identify, prepare, select and evaluate
investment by Central Government agencies;
(iii)  carrying out basic studies in support of public investment strategies in priority
sectors; and
(iv)  supporting DNIP in the implementation of the National Investment Plan System
(SNIP).
36.     The project would finance high-level workshops, training programs, technical assistance
and some equipment through five components, as follows.
37.     Component A: Sectoral Investment Decision Making A  series of high level
interventions involving international expertise would be organized to provide a forum for the
exchange of ideas and experience in the area of investment decision-making. This component
would have three subcomponents:
(i)    Component Coordination would be carried out by the Institutional Relations Unit
in DNIP with the assistance in the initial stages of a foreign specialist to identify and
select appropriate speakers and put together the program, a local consultant to
organize the seminars, and counterpart personnel to support the effort. The cost of
Coordination is estimated at US$374,000.
(ii)   Senior Policy Interventions would consist of a series of high-level seminars with
the objective of familiarizing decision-makers with best practice in the areas of
public investment policies, programs and projects and public expenditure
management from selected OECD countries and the concepts of public expenditure
efficiency and investment evaluation launched through the National Public
Investment System. The total cost is estimated at US$500,000. The seminars
proposed are:
(1)   OECD innovations in Public Investment and Expenditure Management.
This seminar would be aimed at the Ministerial and Secretary level, and
would consist of 1.5 days of presentations from very high level staff from the



35
Ministries of Finance, National Budget Offices and Treasuries of selected
countries with successful experience in this area (New Zealand, Australia, the
UK and others) and consultants with recognized international experience.
(2)   Argentina in the Year 2000: Strategic Perspectives in Public Finance
Management. Similar to (1).
(3)   Public Investment: Role of the Parliamentarian in Investment Decision
Making. Similar to (1).
(4)   Public Investment in the Provinces and Municipalities: The Role of
Governors and Municipal Managers. A total of 75% of non-social public
investment consists of co-financed or subsidized projects with the Provincial
Governments. These seminars would take two days and would be offered
once a year over three years in three different Provincial capitals.
(iii)   High-Level Workshops are directed at senior officials/decision makers, journalists
and individuals and firms from the private sector. The cost of these workshops is
estimated at US$370,000; they would be:
(1)   Participatory Approaches to Investment Decision Making: High Level
Officials of Core and Sectoral Agencies. An in-depth seminar lasting three
days, offered once a year for two years, emphasizing policy formulation and
its implementation through programs and projects.
(2)   The Public Investment and Public Expenditure Management Process. A two-
day seminar aimed at improving the professionalism and analytical capacity
of journalists on issues of public investment and expenditures.
(3)   Building Evaluation Capacity to Strengthen Public Sector Management . A
seminar specifically aimed at evaluation capacity and its impact on the
investment/expenditure policy formulation and implementation process,
lasting one and a half days, addressed to the public and private sectors.
38.     Component B: Improvement of Agencies' Project Analysis and Evaluation Capacity.
The objective of the component is to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of public
investment and to create a culture of analysis and evaluation of investments and public expenditures
through training and technical assistance to up to one hundred national government expenditure
agencies. It has five subcomponents:
(i)    Coordination of the Component. The Coordination of this component will be
carried out by the Directorate of Public Investment in DNIP, with the assistance of
counterpart personnel and a specialist in training to complete the terms of reference,
evaluate local capacity to provide training, contact suitable foreign resources,
prepare the short list, and assist DNJP in negotiations. The cost of Coordination is
estimated at US$680,000.

(ii)   Main Capacity Strengthening Courses. In-depth courses in investment decision-
making, project management, procurement and project cycle implementation, aimed
at middle-management and personnel of the executing agencies as well as
individuals from the private sector. These courses would be offered by a team
composed of four international facilitators/trainers and four trainers from a local
training institute, the underlying principle of the technical assistance being to train
the local trainers, to ensure sustainability. Based on the description given below (see
below for further information), terms of reference would be prepared, and bids
would be sought from local and foreign institutions to prepare and provide training
of trainers and government staff. The cost of this training is estimated at US$3.2
million. These courses are:
(1)   Investment Decision Making and Project Management. The main objectives
of the course will be to:
.  introduce the participants to the concept and application of a strategic
framework for developing a country's/sector's investment decision making
system and the implementation of the framework through programs and
projects;
*  familiarize participants with the application of best practices in project
analysis and management, with the integral parts of the project life cycle, and
with the need for different approaches to analysis and management
depending on the sector concerned, and with environmental considerations in
policy and project formulation;
3  enable participants to account for the role of human and institutional factors
in project design and performance;
.  provide participants with the opportunity to understand and anticipate the
effect on project performance of risk and uncertainty; and
*  enable participants to carry out financial and economic calculations relating
to project analysis.
The course is aimed at approximately one hundred middle-level managers
and two hundred operational staff in the expenditure units; it is expected that
approximately fifty private sector individuals will want to attend the course
as well (training institutes, banks, consulting firms, etc.). The project would
finance two courses for forty people the first year, and one course a year for
the next four years. Public sector institutions would be expected to pay a
nominal US$100 per person per course; any private sector individuals
wishing to attend (up to the limit of forty people per course) would be
expected to pay the full base-cost price of US$2500. To encourage
participation and to ensure direct application of techniques and substance
learned, at the end of the course students from the public sector with an



37
attendance record of 90% or better would take back for use by their
institutions, the microcomputers and software they used during the course.
This expense would be borne by the project. Private sector individuals may
elect to purchase these machines, at approximately US$5000 each (with
software). The cost of these courses is estimated at US$2.2 million. Should
demand be sufficiently great, more courses would be offered, and charged at
full cost.
(2)   Project Cycle Management: Training of Trainers. The objective of the
program is to train local trainers in state-of-the-art principles and techniques
of project analysis and management and to assist in the development of an
Argentinean training methodology that can be applied in all sectors of the
economy. This course is aimed at professionals in the public or private sector
specializing in training, whose intention would be to offer courses in project
management and evaluation themselves. It would be offered once a year for
three years and be offered in conditions similar to the ones mentioned above.
At least twelve individuals per course must attend for the course to be given.
The cost of these courses is estimated at US$300,000.
(3)   Project Cycle Management: Training of Users. The objective of the program
is to train staff in state-of-the-art principles and techniques of project
analysis and management. The course would be offered twice a year for five
years. The cost of these courses is estimated at US$800,000.
(iii)   Technical assistance to investment agencies in the Application of Project Analysis
Techniques learned. This subcomponent consists of contracts with consulting firms
or institutes to assist the agencies in the preparation of at least one project following
approved guidelines, preparation of an annual investment plan, and preparation of a
five-year investment program. The cost of this assistance is estimated at US$2
million.
(iv)   Technical assistance to investment agencies in the Application  of Impact
Evaluation Techniques through the analysis of a selected existing project. This
subcomponent consists of contracts with consulting firms, institutes or individuals,
depending on size and complexity of the projects, for sixty evaluations. The cost of
this assistance is estimated at US$1.7 million.
39.     Component C: Basic studies in support of public investment strategies in priority
sectors. The objective of this component is to enhance decision-making in three priority sectors
through studies in support of project identification and the preparation of sectoral strategies for
selected agencies. The terms of reference for these studies have been prepared by the corresponding
agencies in Argentina with assistance from the appropriate Bank sectoral divisions, which will
supervise their implementation. This component would consist of:



SVI            h.L  I   C\ I
38
(i)    Component Coordination. This component would be coordinated by staff in DNLP
and in the executing agencies, with the assistance of one technical specialist.
Coordination would cost US$670,000.
(ii)   Environment Studies. The environmental studies included in the project will
provide a sound analytical basis for the evaluation of environmental costs and
benefits of public policy decisions and the investment projects which stem from
them. The studies focus on the most important information and analytical gaps in the
understanding of environmental pollution problems of the country. Four studies have
been identified (see Technical Supplement for draft Terms of Reference). Total
study costs are estimated at US$2.1 million and include:
(I)   Air Quality Management Programs in Buenos Aires and  Cordoba:
US$900,000.
(2)   Environmental Assessment and Site Ranking for Hazardous Waste Treatment
and Disposal Facility in the Greater Buenos Aires Area: US$1 million.
(3)   Public Service Provision in Irregular Settlements of the Metropolitan Areas:
US$100,000.
(4)   Evaluation of the Amenity Value of a Clean Environment in Argentina:
US$100,000.
(iii) Natural Resource Studies. Soil erosion has recently been identified as a primary
problem for Argentine agriculture; this is a recent phenomenon caused by the
intensification of agricultural activities. Although a few studies have been carried out
at the local and subnational level, there is need for a study at the national level which
would permit the comparability of issues and efforts from one region to another.
Terms of Reference for such a study have been defined (see Technical Supplement);
a series of specific studies have been identified and will be further defined during
implementation. Similarly, the increasing importance of international water issues
underlines the need for a comprehensive study which will help compare issues faced
by different regions and propose solutions to address them. The total cost of the
Natural Resource studies planned is US$1.95 million; the studies are:
(1)   National Plan for Soil Conservation: US$300,000
(2)   Detailed Evaluation of Soil Status of Specific Areas: US$300,000
(3)   National Plan for Integrated Management of Watersheds: US$450,000
(4)   Studies of Specific River Basins (e.g., the Santa Cruz, Uruguay and Chubut
rivers): US$900,000.
(iv)   Infrastructure Studies. Cross-regional infrastructure has been identified by
Argentina as one of its priority sectors. The Bank supports this view, through
projects and studies ("Transport Privatization and Regulation: The Next Wave of
Challenges", June 1995; "Utilities Privatization and Regulation", to come out in
March 1996); to be followed by a planned Infrastructure Conference, for 1996.
Furthermore, this subcomponent complements these efforts through a series of



39
studies which will help identify and compare issues faced nationally and propose
solutions to address them. These studies will provide basic information for the
preparation of public investment policies and strategies in this sector. Draft Terms
of Reference (see Technical Supplement) have been prepared with the sectoral
agencies responsible for their implementation, with assistance from the Bank, who
will supervise their implementation. The total estimated cost is US$3.9 million.
(1)   Infrastructure Census: US$1.5 million
(2)   Detailed evaluation of status of 6 specific areas: US$50,000 each =
US$300,000.
(3)   Southern Cone Infrastructure Links: US$1.5 million
(4)   Detailed evaluation of status of 6 (not necessarily the same) specific areas:
US$50,000 each = US$300,000.
(5)   Evaluation of Infrastructure Needs in the Private Sector (Terms of Reference
to be prepared during the second year): US$300,000.
40.     Component D: Preparation of the National Public Investment Plan. Although the
bulk of the strengthening effort is addressed to the investment agencies, a certain amount of
strengthening of DNIP is also required for this Directorate to fulfill the duties assigned to it by the
SNIP Law. This strengthening would consist of consulting assistance for five subcomponents:
(i)    Component Coordination This component would be coordinated jointly by
management and staff of the Public Investment and Project Analysis Directorates in
DNIP. Coordination is estimated to cost US$650,000.
(ii)   Application of Appropriate Methodologies. This subcomponent has five activities:
(1)   Review of Best Practices in Proiect Analysis and Evaluation. A study tour for
2 DNIP and 2 sectoral agency staff will be organized to review results,
methodologies and performance indicators in other countries (estimated cost:
US$50,000).
(2)   The selection of state-of-the-art methodologies and the elaboration of
relevant performance indicators. A consultant from one of these countries
will be invited to work with a local consultant to prepare guidelines and
performance indicators (estimated cost US$50,000).
(3)   Technical Assistance by external consultants in the use of the guidelines and
performance indicators (estimated cost US$150,000).
(4)   A critical review of existing studies complemented by surveys in various
regions of the country will be carried out to establish a structure of shadow
prices for goods, works and services (US$300,000).
(5)   Analysis of investment strategv options based on macro and sector policies
and programs, and the evaluation of alternative service delivery approaches



40
including privatization, contracting out, using various approaches according
to the sector and project such as cost/effectiveness, least cost, economic rate
of return, and the calculation of social and environmental costs. Adaptation
or development of methodologies and training courses on project preparation
for the public sector, including environmental impact assessments
(US$250,000).
(iii)   Assistance to DNIP to enable it to provide leadership and direction in the
implementation of the National Public Investment System. The subcomponent
has three activities:
(1)   On-job-training for DNIP staff in the preparation of a strategic medium term
expenditure and investment framework, and in the application of
methodologies appropriate for different sectors (US$100,000).
(2)   Training Quality Assurance and Supervision, reviewing results of training
and feeding these back into the training program to make it more flexible and
appropriate to the skill mix and workload of the participants; this would
include revision of the duration and contents of the courses. estimated cost:
US$270,000.
(3)   Preparation of information dissemination materials (videotapes, self-training
multimedia computer programs and printed matter). Estimated cost:
US$75,000.
(4)   Dissemination of information on the National Public Investment System.
Estimated cost: 410,000.
(5)   A "hot-line" or help desk will be implemented to provide limited-scope
immediate assistance to agencies working on project analysis and
management/monitoring. The "hot line" will seek to solve questions arising
out of project cycle management, and will be installed at the Methodologies
Unit of DNIP's Directorate for Project Analysis. Estimated cost:
US$400,000.
41.     Component E: Project Administration. Project administration, office equipment, yearly
external audits and an agreement with an agency for procurement and consultant administration
services would be covered under this component. Terms of Reference for Project Administration
are given in the Technical Supplement. The estimated cost of Project Administration, including
auditing and procurement agency fees is US$2.8 million.

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Agencies Involved
42.   The Ministry of Economy (ME) will be the executing agency for this project, through the
National Directorate of Public Investment and Project Financing in the Secretariat of Economic
Programming. The ME will also be responsible for providing counterpart funds.
Project Execution
43.   The proposed project would be completed in five years. The completion date is December 31,
2000; the closing date is June 30, 2001. To implement the project, the National Project Director will
be supported by a Project Administrator, and various assistants (see Technical Supplement). Hiring of
the Project Administrator is a condition of effectiveness. The ME will provide clerical, office and
related support to the Project Administration Unit (PAU). An administrative manual, describing the
organization of the PAU, functions and responsibilities as well as report formats and administrative
steps to follow in implementing and monitoring the project, will be prepared by the PAU. Preparation
of the first draft of this manual was a condition of negotiations; completion of the manual is a
condition of effectiveness.
44.   Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that within six months of project completion
the ME will prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to assess the success of the project,
including the achievement of institutional, administrative, operational, and financial objectives and
goals to be agreed, and general evaluation of the lessons learned from project experience.
Procurement
45.   Procurement of goods under the proposed project will be carried out in a manner consistent
with Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995) and the Bank-issued Standard Bidding
Documents. The bulk of the procurement of goods consists of workstations. personal computers,
peripherals and system software for an estimated US$500,000 equivalent which will be acquired in
packages of not less than US$ 100,000 equivalent each through Limited lntemational Competitive
Bidding (LIB). Supply contracts will include installation, maintenance and technical assistance; a
one-year warranty must be provided by the manufacturer. Miscellaneous off-the-shelf software,
pedagogical equipment, additional personal computers and peripherals, books and other local supplies
for an aggregate not to exceed US$300,000 equivalent will be acquired through local shopping by
comparison of at least three pro-forma offers, in contracts of no more than US$25,000 equivalent.
46.   Contracting of consulting services for an estimated US$20.2 million equivalent would be
carried out in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). All
consulting contracts for tasks estimated at US$100,000 or more would be carried out by qualified
consulting firms.
47.   Argentina's federal procurement regulations and procedures for goods have been reviewed by
Bank staff in the context of previous projects and have been found to be generally adequate. The
Governent may nevertheless elect to enter into an agreement with UN/OPS in New York for



48
procurement of goods, following procedures acceptable to the Bank. Likewise, the Govermnent may
enter into an agreement with a UN Agency to administrate consulting services and training
procurement, for purposes of expediency.
48.   Standard contracts, based on the Bank-issued Standard Form of Contracts, modified as
necessary for the purposes of the project, will be agreed with the Government (and the procurement
agency where appropriate), by effectiveness. Agreement will be sought on formats for the technical
specifications, in the case of goods; terms of reference (including objectives, activities, results,
performance indicators and estimated breakdown of costs) and the use of the Bank's model Letter of
Invitation, for consulting services, by effectiveness.
49.   An amount estimated at US$2.3 million equivalent represents price contingencies which
reflect intemational projected inflation for the next five years.
Bank Prior Review
50.   The Bank's prior review of procurement documentation will cover all major procurement
steps for goods (advertising, bidding documents, bidders list, evaluation methodologies, reports and
award recommendations) and would apply to all contracts over US$100,000 awarded through LIB.
51.   The Bank will also review all documentation (terms of reference, evaluation of proposals and
evaluation methodology, lists of proposed consulting firms, award recommendations and contracts)
for all consulting services included in the project above US$50,000 per contract for individual
consultants and US$100,000 per contract for consulting firms, as well as results of the studies. For
individual consultants up to US$50,000 equivalent each, or consulting firms up to US$100,000 each,
prior Bank review would be limited to terms of reference for such contracts.
52.   The limits established for prior Bank review of procurement decisions will result in a
coverage of 84% of Bank-financed project costs.

Disbursements and Special Account
53.     The Borrower's financial administration regulations have been reviewed in the context
of previous projects and have been found acceptable for use with a Special Account.
54.     Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against 76% of all expenditures for
goods, 68% of all expenditures for consulting services, and 82% of all expenditures for project
administration. A Special Account in US dollars with an authorized allocation of US$ 750,000,
equivalent to an estimated four months of average disbursements, would be established in a bank
acceptable to the Bank'. The National Directorate of Public Investments and Project Financing at
the ME would be entitled to make periodic withdrawals from the Special Account for eligible
expenditures upon request from the National Project Director at the exchange rate applicable on
the day such account is debited. The Bank would replenish the Special Account for the amount
of the withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower.
Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE) for goods,
office refurbishing and equipment contracts valued at less than US$ 100,000 equivalent, for
individual consulting services valued at less than US$50,000, for services by consulting firms
valued at less than US$100,000 and for minor miscellaneous expenditures such as travel and
subsistence costs. The documentation for these expenditures would be retained by the executing
agency, with copies in the PAU, and made available to Bank staff during supervision missions.
All other expenditures would be fully documented. Agreement on the use of the Special Account
and Statements of Expenditure was obtained at negotiations.
Accountine and Audits
55.     The PAU will maintain records for each project component, and consolidate them into
the project accounts and SOEs. Supporting documentation will be maintained by the PAU and
made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. Agreement on this was
obtained at negotiations.
56.     Project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, will be audited annually in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles applied by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank using terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank. Agreement on
this would be sought at negotiations. A total of US$ 200,000 equivalent through the life of the
project will be eligible for financing for audits under the loan, except for the last audit which
would be financed by GOA. Audit reports will be furnished to the Bank within six months after
close of the Government's fiscal year (no later than June 30). Agreement on this matter was
obtained at negotiations.
The Government is considering entering into a Management Service Agreement with a UN organization; depending on this, the status and
amount of the Special Account will be reviewed at negotiations.



52
Project Monitoring
57.     The National Project Director's primary responsibility will be the timely execution of
the Project Implementation Plan, through the Component Coordinators and the Project
Administrator. Project performance indicators will be monitored to track progress in project
execution. Overall monitoring and evaluation of the project will be the responsibility of the
PAU, which will be in charge of the physical and financial monitoring of project activities.
Specific tasks include: (a) preparing semiannual progress reports on project implementation,
which would be submitted to the Bank by December 31 and June 30 of each year; (b) measuring
quantitative and qualitative objectives achieved; (c) reviewing and updating project
implementation schedules and submitting them to the Bank for approval; (d) revising the annual
training program and submitting it to the Bank for approval; and (e) preparing the
Implementation Completion Report. These responsibilities and tasks will be agreed at
negotiations. To facilitate a quantitative assessment of partial objectives reached, critical
activities have been identified and milestones defined for each.
58.     Monitoring by the Bank will be carried out in semiannual visits (around January and
July) to review the progress in the implementation of the project, and discuss modifications to
the Action Plans, Training Programs and allocation of resources. An extensive Mid-Term review
will be carried out mid-way through the third year of execution of the project.

Training Plan
59.     In-depth courses in investment decision-making, project management, procurement
and project cycle implementation, would be aimed at middle-management and personnel of the
100 executing agencies as well as individuals from the private sector. These courses would be
offered by a team composed of four international facilitators/trainers and four trainers from a
local training institute. Based on the descriptions given below, Terms of Reference would be
prepared, and offers would be sought from local and foreign institutions to prepare and provide
the training. A specialist in training in these areas would be hired to complete the terms of
reference, evaluate local capacity to provide training, contact suitable foreign resources, prepare
the short list, assist DNIP in negotiations, provide quality assurance and review results, feeding
them back into an Annual Training Program. Changes to the training program will take into
account the skill mix and workload of the participants, and a revision of the content, duration
and frequency of the courses or seminars, to increase their effectiveness The cost of these
courses is estimated at US$3.2 million.
Investment Decision Making and Project Management
60.     The main objectives of the course will be to:
*  introduce the participants to the concept and application of a strategic framework for
developing a country's/sector's investment decision making system;
* familiarize participants with the application of best practice in project analysis and
management, with the integral parts of the project life cycle, and with the need for
different approaches to analysis and management depending on the sector concerned;
* enable participants to account for the role of human and institutional factors in
project design and performance;
* provide participants with the opportunity to understand and anticipate the effect on
project performance of risk and uncertainty; and
* enable participants to carry out financial and economic calculations relating to project
analysis.

61.     The course would take four weeks, and is aimed at approximately 100 middle-level
managers and 200 operational staff in the expenditure units. It is expected that approximately 50
private sector individuals will want to attend the course as well (training institutes, banks, and
consulting firms, for example). The project would finance two courses for 40 people the first
year, and one course a year for the next four years. Public sector institutions would be expected
to pay a nominal US$100 per person per course; private sector individuals will be encouraged to
attend to enhance training sustainability but would be expected to pay the full price of US$2500.
To encourage participation and to ensure direct application of techniques and substance learned,



57
at the end of the course students from the public sector with an attendance record of 90% or
better would take back to their institutions the microcomputers and software they used during the
course. This expense would be borne by the project. Private sector individuals may elect to
purchase these machines, at approximately US$5000 each (with software). Should demand be
sufficiently great, more courses would be offered, but charged at full cost.
Project Cycle Management: Traininz of Trainers
62.     The objective of the program is to expose Argentinean participants to state-of-the-art
principles and techniques of project analysis and management and to assist in the development of
an Argentinean training methodology that can be applied in all sectors of the economy.

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVtRONMENTAL STUDIES
15.   These terms of reference were jointly prepared by DNIP and the Secretariat of Agriculture,
Livestock and Fisheries (SAGyP), who with the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human
Environment, will ultimatelv implement them, with Bank assistance. The proposed studies are:
(a)    Air Quality Management Programs in Buenos Aires and Cordoba (US$900,000)
(b)    Environmental Assessment and Site Ranking for Hazardous Waste Treatment and
Disposal Facilities in the Greater Buenos Aires Area (US$1,000,000)
(c)    Public Service Provision in Irregular Settlements of the Metropolitan Areas
(US$100,000)
(d)    Evaluation of the Amenity Value of a Clean Environment in Argentina
(US$100,000)
Study: Air Qualitv Management Programs in Buenos Aires and Cordoba
Backzround
16.   There is little reliable, up-to-date, information on air quality in the main cities of Argentina,
and even in Greater Buenos Aires, a metropolis of 12 million people, current monitoring is
insufficient to determine the magnitude of air pollution problems resulting from motor vehicles and
industrial emissions. In the absence of monitoring, it is impossible to determine the damage of air
pollution and, thus, evaluate the desirability of measures to control air pollution.
17.   Due to favorable wind conditions, air pollution in Buenos Aires is believed to be less severe
than in other cities of similar size. However, there is little information available to substantiate this
assessment. Moreover, current localized pollution from traffic along major highways, in the
downtown area, and from industrial sources in several suburbs, is likely to be at levels which can
cause significant damage. Existing monitoring programs include a single monitoring station for
carbon monoxide (operated by a private foundation. Siglo X) and a single monitoring station for
NOx and SOx (operated in Palermo by the Municipality of Buenos Aires). Measurements from these
stations indicate that carbon monoxide and NOx concentrations frequently exceed recommended
ambient air quality standards.
18.   The increases in economic activities, including rising transport volumes, are likely to lead to
further deterioration in air quality unless efTective control measures are taken. Therefore, even if
global air pollution levels in Buenos Aires were not yet alarming, the early implementation of cost-
effective control programs would reduce the danger of increasing pollution damages in the future.
Moreover, since existing air pollution control regulation has rarely been enforced, there are still many
low-cost options for reducing air pollution available.



65
19.   In C6rdoba, air pollution problems are aggravated by the city's location. While the existence
of serious air pollution problems is generally acknowledged, detailed ambient air quality information
is not available, and a systematic analysis of the benefits of different control policies is not possible.
Obiective
20.          The objective of the program is the evaluation of options to control air pollution from
industrial sources and motor vehicles in the two cities. The program should also serve as a model for
potential air pollution control progzrams in other cities. The aim is to implement a program of air
pollution control measures based on an analysis of their costs and benefits. This prograrn will
generate the required data and analysis. The program should also establish the monitoring network
required for an ongoing evaluation of ambient air quality in both cities.
Scone of Work and Approach
21.   The program would determine the extent, the nature, the sources, and the impacts of air
pollution problems in the two cities and determine the immediate priorities for air pollution control
based on a simplified cost-benefit framework. The program would also establish the monitoring
network that will provide the basis for continuous monitoring of air pollution in both cities and more
detailed analysis in the future.
22.          The program should lead to the rapid assessment of priorities for air pollution control
and would encompass the following components:
Establishment of an Air Oualitv Monitoring Network
23.    Phase 1: Desiun. Development of an air emission inventory, for the main air pollutants
comprising mobile as well as fixed sources; screening level dispersion modeling. Design of a
monitoring system taking existing programs into account to avoid duplications; site selection.
24.    Phase 2: One-Year .Air Oualitv Assessment Studv This phase includes the analysis of
requirements for setting up a comprehensive system of air quality monitoring. Ambient air quality in
each city would be assessed bv measuring levels of air pollutants such as particulates (TSP, PM-10),
sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), and lead over a period of
12 months at 5-6 locations in central Buenos Aires and 3-4 locations in Cordoba. Depending on the
results of the design phase, mobile monitoring stations would be used in addition to monitoring at
fixed stations to determine local air pollution problems in both metropolitan areas.
25.   Phase 3: Comprehensive Core Monitoring Network and Evaluate First-Year Data. Evaluation
of data and adjustment of monitoring sites and monitoring parameters for the permanent monitoring
system; calibration of the dispersion model. Freed-up hardware could be used to initiate a program in
other cities.
26.   Phase. 4  Long-term  Operation of Comprehensive Air Quality Monitoringt Network.
Continued monitoring to evaluate seasonal and multi-year pattems and trends in air pollution.



66
Air Pollution Impact and Control Study
27.   This component would include:
(a)    Determination of exposure and pollution damages by using the results of evaluation
studies undertaken under separate terms of reference (including health damage,
material damage, loss of environmental amenities, and others).
(b)   Identification of control options for air pollution from mobile and fixed sources in the
two metropolitan areas and determination of their costs. The analysis should focus on
pollutants with ambient levels above recommended guidelines. Options to be
evaluated should include but not be limited to vehicle emission controls, industrial
emission controls, as well as zoning and urban land use policies.
(c)    Ranking of different control options with respect to their cost effectiveness of
improving ambient air qualitv in the two metropolitan areas.
(d)    Economic evaluation of different pollution control options.
28.   The program should also review the capacity of existing laboratories and other facilities to
undertake work on transport and industry related air pollution and prepare recommendations on
measures required to strengthen this capacitv including requirements for analytical equipment,
computers and training.
29.   The program team will include an environmental specialist, a transport engineer, an industrial
pollution control specialist and an environmental economist. The program team will work together
with the authorities responsible for air pollution control in the respective metropolitan area, which
will continue to operate the monitoring system after the rapid assessment prograrn has been
completed. The program will be coordinated with other efforts to improve air quality monitoring,
such as bilateral assistance from the Japanese Govemment and the activities of several non-
govemmental organizations in Buenos Aires and C6rdoba.

of the network.
Study: Environmental Assessment and Site Ranking for Hazardous Waste Treatment and
Disposal Facilities in the Greater Buenos Aires Area
Introduction
31.   National Law 24051 and its Decree 831 regulate gieneration, handling, transportation,
treatmnent and disposal of hazardous wastes in Argentina. As hazardous waste treatmnent and disposal
facilities are very small in number and those in existence are pnrvately owned and generally not
accessible for other generators, a very large portion of hazardous wastes generated in Argentina are
either stored or disposed of improperly.
32.   To address the need for hazardous waste treatment and disposal in the Greater Buenos Aires
area, the Secretaria de Recursos Naturales y Ambiente Humano (SRNyAH) has undertaken the
initiative for the selection, construction, and operation of one or more hazardous waste treatment and
disposal facilities. As the potential location for this facility, SRNvAH has identified six sites.
Objectives
33.   The project objectives are: (a) To conduct an environmental assessment (EA) for each of the
six sites identified by SRNyAH for the construction and operation of hazardous waste treatment and
disposal facility(ies) intended to serve the Greater Buenos Aires area; and (b) to rank a site(s) for
hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility(ies). The ranking will be based on the screening of
these sites according to selected criteria and using the results of the EA studies.
34.   During the EA and site ranking process, public participation will be sought by taking into
consideration the views of all relevant govemment agencies. NGOs, industrial and commercial
interests, and other segments of the public in Argentina affected bv the project.
Scope of Work
35.   The scope of work will consist of the following four tasks: (a) selection of hazardous waste
treatment and disposal technologies, (b) preparation of an EA for each of the six sites; (c) site
ranking for the hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility(ies). and (d) public participation.
a) Selection of Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal Technologies
36.   The objectives of this task are: (a) determine the optimum size(s) of the hazardous waste and
treatment facility(ies) that will serve the Greater Buenos Aires area: and (b) develop a "base" process
design for this facility.
37.   The consultant will review and evaluate the available literature on the types (e.g. solvents
from the chemical industry), characteristics (e.g. solid, liquid. sludge), and quantities (e.g. cubic
meters or tons for solids, liters for liquids) of hazardous wastes generated in the Greater Buenos Aires
area.  One important source of infornation is entitled "Estudio de Factibilidad de Residuos



68
Peligrosos, Provincia de Buenos Aires" by Dames & Moore. In addition, the available information
on generator locations will be identified and mapped. If necessary, the consultant will conduct
additional surveys to obtain supplementary data. From analysis of this information, the consultant
will determine the total quantities of hazardous wastes that need to be treated and disposed by
generator location, and waste type and characteristics. The consultant will then determine the
optimum size(s) for the hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility(ies).
38.    Based on waste-related information and regulatory requirements for hazardous waste
treatment and disposal, the consultant will identify the optimum treatment and disposal needs. The
consultant will then identify, screen, and select hazardous waste treatment and disposal technologies.
The physical, chemical, and biological treatment technologies will be considered for this purpose.
The screening process will consider such factors as the effectiveness, implementability, and cost of
these technologies. Some of the questions that need to be answered are as follows:
(a)    Effectiveness: Is the technology effective in reducing  pollutant concentrations to
desired levels? What are the toxicity, mobility, and volume of the wastes generated
from treatment bv each technology?
(b)    Implementabilitv: What is the status of development of the treatment technology?
What is the extent of its use in developed countries? Has it been widely used in
developing countries? What are the risks of using it in Argentina? Does it require a
special technology? Does it involve special personnel training? Does it involve
critical inputs (parts, chemicals) that require import to Argentina? What is its space
requirement?
(c)    Costs:  What are the expected capital and recurrent costs of the technology in
Argentina?
39.    Following the screening process, the consultant will select the optimum  treatment and
disposal technologies, and develop process flow diagram(s). The consultant will size each selected
technology based on waste volumes and estimate the capital and recurring costs for the hazardous
waste treatment and disposal facility(ies). The design(s) developed in Task I is(are) referred to as the
"base" design(s) for the treatment and disposal facility(ies). The designs will be used as the basis
(bases) for the evaluation of the six sites in Task 2.
40.    Based on the distribution of hazardous waste generators in the Greater Buenos Aires, the
consultant may recommend more than one treatment and disposal facility. In that case, the consultant
will specify the optimum size for each treatment and disposal facility. In doing this analysis, the
consultant will conduct a cost-savings analysis (e.g. incremental cost of treatment and incremental
cost of administrative costs for project design and approval versus the incremental savings of
transportation) to justify multiple facilities.  In case the consultant recommends more than one
facility, a "base" design for each of the treatment and disposal facility (with proper sizing and costing)
will be provided.



69
b) Preparation of an EA Study for each of the six sites
EA Requirements
41.   The EA will identify and meet all laws. regulations and guidelines which relate both to the
assessment process and the content of the EA Report. These include:
(a)    Argentinean national, provincial, and local laws, decrees, and regulations on
environmental impact assessment.
(b)   Intemational laws and regulations that Argentina has been a signatory.
(c)    The World Bank Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (O.D. 4.01).
Scope of Work
42.   For each of the six sites identifies bv SRNyAH for the construction and operation of the
hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilitv, the consultant will conduct an EA study. It is the
objective of the EA to identify the major environmental issues associated with the proposed project
during construction and operation of this facility, and to recommend the necessary measures to
mitigate the adverse environmental impacts.
43.   Each EA will evaluate conditions of the proiect's area of influence associated with each of the
identified sites, assess impacts of the technologies selected in Task I on population and environment,
analyze altematives to minimize or eliminate these impacts, and propose an environmental
management plan (EMP), which outlines in detail all the measures needed to minimize, mitigate, or
compensate for expected environmental damage from the project and develops an estimate of
investment and recurring costs along with an investment schedule. In conducting the EA, the
consultant will implement a public participation program as indicated in Task 4. Preparation of the
EA will consist of the following subtasks:
(a)    Subtask I - Legal and administrative framework
(b)    Subtask 2 - Description of the project and alternative designs.
(c)    Subtask 3 - Ecological and social environment
(d)    Subtask 4 - Environmental and social impacts
(e)    Subtask 5 - Evaluation of project alternatives
(f)    Subtask 6 - Environmental management plan.
44.   Subtask I - Legal and Administrative Framework: the consultant will review and include in
the EA:



*0
(a)    The pertinent national environmental laws, decrees, and regulations that have been
promulgated or in the draft form. These include, but not limited to, the laws, decrees,
and regulations governing the hazardous waste transportation, storage, treatment, and
disposal facilities as well as siting.
(b)    The pertinent intemational guidelines, regulations and standards. This includes inter
alia the World Bank's O.D. 4.01: Environmental Assessment, Environmental
Guidelines, and Occupational Health and Safetv Guidelines
45.    For each of the six sites, the consultant will review and include in the EA the pertinent
provincial and local environmental laws, decrees, and regulations that have been promulgated or in
the draft form. These include, but not limited to, the laws. decrees, and regulations governing the
hazardous waste transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities as well as siting.
46.    The administrative authorities in charge of implementing these laws, decrees, and regulations
for each of the six sites will also be identified.
47.    Subtask 2 - Description of the Proiect and Altemative Desigzns: For each of the six sites, the
consultant will define the project's area of influence that mav be affected through implementation of
this project. The consultant will indicate this area on a map. The consultant will describe the
roject's area of influence (which also includes the project site) in geographic, ecological, social, and
temporal context. The selected "base" project design (from Task 1) will be described along with the
identification and characteristics of discharges (e.g. flow rates, expected pollutants and their
concentrations and temperature). All necessary infrastructure works for this project (such as roads,
and water, gas, electricity, and communication lines) will also be described. The consultant will also
describe important altematives for project design. The altematives will include, at a minimum,
variations of the types of technologies selected in Task I.
48.    Subtask 3 - Ecolovical and Social Environment: For each of the six sites, the consultant will
develop the baseline environmental data on the relevant phvsical, biological, and socio-economic
features of the project's area of influence. The baseline data will provide a reference point for the
assessment of potential impacts during construction and operation of the proposed site. The consultant
will not duplicate any characterization effort undertaken in Task I of these Terms of Reference.
49.    Characterization of the project's area of influence in terms of physical and biological
conditions will include previous uses of the site, extent of past contamination (if any) and associated
remediation requirements (including cleanup levels, volumes. remediation techniques. waste disposal,
and related costs), climatic/topographic/geologic/hvdroloiic/ hydrogeologic characteristics and
conditions, and the flora and fauna (including existing communities and endangered species). The
consultant will conduct characterization of ambient air. surface water, groundwater, and soil
conditions (in terms of pollutant concentrations) through sampling and analysis. The assessment of
the social environment and infrastructure will include the demography, employment and economy,
land use around the project site, transportation, and utilities (e.g. water, sewerage, electricity, gas).
50.    Subtask 4 - Environmental and Social Impacts: For each of the six sites, considering the
technologies selected in Task 1, the consultant will identifv and, to the extent possible, quantify the



71
environmental and social impacts likely to result from the project in its area of influence. The
consultant will indicate how, and to what extent. the environmental baseline conditions would change
under each project altemative. All anticipated environmental impacts should be discussed in terms of
their (i) probability of occurrence, (ii) physical magnitude (high, low, medium), (iii) duration (short,
medium, long term), and (iv) reversibility (whether temporary or permanent). The possibilities of
avoidance, mitigation or compensation should be indicated. The following potential impacts would
receive special attention:
(a)    Potential impacts of air emissions from  the project site on nearby communities,
agriculture, and ecology (e.g. volatile organic chemicals from storage and treatment
units, air emissions from a hazardous waste incinerator, odor emissions from biologic
treatment units and dust emissions from hazardous waste storaae and landfill sites).
(b)    Potential impacts of water discharges from the project site to surface water and/or
sewer networks
(c)    Potential impacts of hazardous waste storage and disposal units on groundwater
quality (high level of groundwater table and its contamination from spills or from
inappropriate landfill design).
(d)    Potential impacts of industrial hazards (e.g. fire, explosion) on people and property
within the project's area of influence.
(e)    Potential impacts of transportation of hazardous wastes from generators to the project
site (road traffic, accidents, spills).
(f)    Potential impacts of system failures (e.g. electricity outages, water shutoffs, treatment
equipment failure) on nearby population and environment.
(g)    Social impacts during construction and operational phases of the project (e.g. on
employment levels, availability of specialty labor and training requirements).
51.    Subtask 5 - Evaluation of Proiect Alternatives: For each of the six sites, the consultant will
evaluate each of the various project design and operation altematives, in terms of investment and
recurrent costs, socio-cultural and other factors. Mitigation costs will be evaluated for all altematives.
Alternative technologies will be reconsidered in lieu of technologies that were selected in Task I and
that result in major environmentaUsocial impacts or mitigatory costs. In addition, in selecting project
alternatives, site-related limitations, technological complexities, skill requirements, institutional
demands, and public acceptance will be compared, as appropriate. Reasons for selection of the
preferred altemative will be clearly stated. Any deviation from selecting the least environmentally
and socially damaging altemative will be fully justified. The recommended altemative will be fully
compatible with the World Bank's environmental requirements.
52.    Subtask 6 - Environmental Manavement Plan: For each of the six sites. the consultant will
prepare an Environmental Mlanagement Plan (EMP) that will outline in detail all the measures needed



72
to minimize, mitigate, or compensate for expected environmental damage from this project. At a
minimum, this Plan will include:
(a)   Identification and summary of all the significant environmental impacts that are
anticipated.
(b)    A technically detailed description of each mitigation measure, including: (i) the type
of impact to which it relates, (ii) the conditions under which it is required (e.g.
continuously or in the event of contingencies), and (iii) its design, equipment needs,
and operating procedures (as appropriate).
(c)   Institutional arrangements.  This involves the assignment of responsibilities for
carrying out the mitigatory measures (e.g. responsibilities which involve operation,
supervision, enforcement, monitoring of implementation, remedial action, financing,
reporting, and staff training).
(d)    Monitoring and reporting procedures to ensure early detection of conditions that
necessitate particular mitigation measures and to provide information on the progress
and results of mitigation.
(e)    Manpower requirement in terms of number of employees, technical qualifications,
and training needs for effective Plan implementation.
(f)    A timetable (chronogram) of planned activities, which must be properly synchronized
with the project implementation schedule.
(g)   Integration into the total project cost tables of the cost estimates and sources of funds
for both the initial investment and the recurring expenses for implementing the
mitigation plan.
EA Report Format
53.   Each EA Report should be concise and limited to the inforrnation needed for proper
environmental and social impact evaluation, selection of alternatives, and mitigation planning. The
main text should focus on findings, conclusions, and recommended actions, supported by more
detailed information and analyses in annex form. The EA Report will include the following items:
(a)    Executive summary (maximum 10 pages)
(b)    Legal and administrative framework
(c)    Project description
(d)    Ecological and social environment
(e)    Environmental and social impacts



73
(f)    Evaluation of project alternatives
(g)    Environmental management plan
(h)    Appendices:
(i)    A list of references
(ii)    A list of EA preparers;
(iii)   Records of inter-agencv and public/NGO consultation and communication.
c) Site Ranking for the Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility(ies)
54.   The contractor will rank the site(s) for the hazardous waste facility(ies) among the six sites
identified by SRNyAH. The information presented in the EAs will be evaluated using a matrix
analvsis: this will involve identification of the elements of the screening criteria, specifving weights
for each of these elements, and determining a score for each element and for each site using the
information from the correspondin- EA. The total score for each site will be obtained by cumulating
the score for each criterion for that site. The site(s) with the highest score will be recommended.
Prior to conducting the matrix analvsis, the consultant will consult with the Project Officer on the
selected elements of the screening criteria and assignment of weights.
55.   If more than one site is recommended, full justification will be presented by the consultant.
d) Public Participation
56.   In preparing the EA for each of the six sites, the consultant will review and take into
consideration the views of anv relevant gTovemment agencies, NGOs, industrial and commercial
interests, and other segments of the public in Argentina affected by the project. This is important in
order to understand both the nature and extent of any social and environmental impacts of the project
and to improve decision mak-ing; to gauge acceptability of proposed mitigatory and compensatory
actions, particularlv to the affected groups: to increase community cooperation in implementing EA
recommendations; and not least to improve the design based on beneficiary comments.
57.   At a minimum, eight public meetings will be conducted by the consultant: the first meeting
to discuss the TOR of the EA, six subsequent meetings to discuss the Draft EA Reports (i.e. one
meeting for each of the six sites), and a final meeting to discuss the site ranking for the hazardous
waste facility(ies). Records of meetings and other activities, communications, and comments on the
project would be kept. These would be listed and summarized in the EA Report. Instances in which
recommendations were rejected as inappropriate should be justified.
58.   In addition, the consultant w-ill prepare a public relations program to inform and educate the
public on the project and the associated risks if this project is not implemented. The consultant will
present this program to the Project Officer and implement it upon approval.



74
Oualifications of the Consultant
59.   This project requires participation of an inter-disciplinary team with expertise in engineering,
ecological and social sciences. and institutional issues. If expatriate consultants are involved, they
should collaborate with local experts. The repetitive element involved would suggest that the use of a
single firm would be most cost effective, to avoid duplication of work.
Project Schedule And Deliverables
60.   The project would start in the latter part of 1995. Schedules and deliverables for the project
tasks are as follows:
(a)    Task 1: The Draft Report will be completed by Month 2. Following incorporation of
comments on the Draft Report, the consultant will prepare a Final Report by Month 3.
(b)    Task 2: The EAs for the six sites (Task 2) will be completed within six (6) months
from the project start date. Following incorporation of comments on the Draft EAs.
the consuitant will finalize all EAs by Month 7.
(c)    Task 3: The consultant will submit the Draft Public Relations Program to the Project
Officer bv Month I and implement this program following approval by the Project
Officer according to the agreed upon schedule. The initial public meeting on the
TOR of the EA will take place by Month 2. During Month 7, all the six public
meetings will take place. The public meeting on the selection of the site for the
hazardous waste facility will take place in Month 10.
(d)    Task 4  Work on Task will be initiated in Month 8. The draft report will be
completed by mid-Month 9 Following incorporation of comments on the Draft
Report, the consultant will prepare a Final Report by mid-Month 10.
61.          The consultant will compress this schedule. if possible. without sacrificing the quality
of information that might affect conclusions of the EAs and Task Reports.

Study: Public Service Provision in Irregular Settlements of the Metropolitan Areas
Background
62.   Considering Argentina's relatively high per-capita income level, the coverage of water and
sanitation infrastructure is alarmingly low. At the same time, surface water and near-surface
groundwater resources are thoroughly contaminated through domestic and industrial wastes, and a
large share of the unserved population has to rely on polluted water sources or needs to spend a large
share of their income to buy bottled water. Therefore, increasing the access to safe water and
sanitation services is one of the priority areas for infrastructure investments in Argentina. For the
expansion of services to the largest part of the population, which can afford to pay the full costs of
these services, the decentralization and commercialization program for water and sanitation services,
as well as the reform of tariffs, is creating the conditions required for service expansion..
63.   An important, but unknown, share of the population. however, would not be able to pay the
full costs of water and sanitation services. According to verv rough estimates, 18 percent of
households in Argentina have an income below the level at which 5 percent of total income would
have to be spent on the full cost of water and sanitation services. Many of the urban poor live in the
irregular settlements ("villas miserias") that surround the city of Buenos Aires and other larger cities
in Argentina. The Govemment pursues a two-pronged approach for addressing the situation of these
urban poor: (a) promotion of economic stability and the macroeconomic framework required for
economic growth that will lead to rising incomes and create employment such that the urban poor
can be absorbed by the formal labor markets and earn their way out of poverty; (b) direct
interventions and provision of services by the govemment to improve the living conditions and the
satisfaction of basic needs among these urban poor. The latter function is a critical task for the
Govemment within the country's overall policy for poverty alleviation.
64.   A related problem in several urban areas is the existence of open air garbage dumps side by
side with irregular settlements. Even though the use of open air dumps is formally illegal (at least in
Greater Buenos Aires), the persistent operation of these dumps is tolerated because: (a) these dumps
reduce the cost of regular garbage disposal that the municipalities would otherwise have to bear; and
(b) inhabitants of the irregular settlements receive an important share of their income from
scavenging in these open air dumps, generating political pressure to maintain them. At the same time,
the dumps pose a significant public health risk through the pollution of ground and surface waters and
the creation of breeding grounds for disease vectors.
Obiective
65.   The objective of this study is to identify policies for improving the delivery of water and
sanitation services in irregular settlements and eliminate the pollution problems emanating from open
air dumps in the neighborhood of irregular settlements.



16
Scope of Work and Anproach
66.   The scope of the study includes the evaluation of the problem, and the determination and
evaluation of possible solutions. Focusing on the metropolitan areas of Buenos Aires, C6rdoba,.
Rosario, and Mendoza, the evaluation of the problem should answer the following questions:
67.   How many people live in conditions, under which water and sanitation services cannot be
supplied commercially because of technical, legal, or economic constraints? What is the nature of
constraints on the provision of services to these people? For example, irregular settlements are often
located in flood prone areas, which limits technical infrastructure options.
68.   How many people live in the immediate environment of open air garbage dumps? What is the
economic importance of income generated by these dumps? What are the sanitary conditions in these
settlements?
69.   The next step is the identification and evaluation of technical and policy options for
addressing the identified problems. The focus of the analvsis should be on how markets can be used
to achieve an improvement in the delivery of services to irregular settlements. The study will
explicitly analyze the cost effectiveness of different options in improving service delivery. The
options to be analyzed should include but not be limited to the following:
70.   Establishing secure property rights is a crucial step if households in irregular settlements are
to be willing to undertake expenditures for environmental improvements such as the installation of
water and sewerage networks. However, the regularization of land tenure raises a variety of (poten-
tially) difficult issues ranging from questions of finance to the establishment of minimum lot sizes
and the treatment of settlements on land that is prone to flooding.  The study would collect
information by previous studies and examine the physical. legal, economic and financial barriers to
regularization and recommend a strategy for addressing this problem.
71.   Simpler low cost water and sanitation services can reduce the costs of water and sanitation
services and, therefore, make services affordable to a larger share of the population.
72.   Tariffs can be designed to take social factors into consideration. However, such social
subsidies should be well targeted and should not distort the economic incentives of consumers or
service suppliers.
73.   The rehabilitation of open air dumps could lead to a significant property appreciation in
neighboring areas. A betterment levy could be raised from property owners and could be used to find
altemative housing and income opportunities for those displaced by the dump closure.
74.   The program team should include a sanitary engineer, a financial analyst, an institutional
economist and a sociologist. The estimated budget for this study is $100,000.

Study: Evaluation of the Amenitv Value of a Clean Environment in Argentina
75.   At the per-capita income level of Argentina (US$8,060 per year for 1994), it can be expected
that many people living in polluted cities are willing to pay significant amounts of money for a
cleaner environment. In many instances, this willingness-to-pay may be sufficiently high to justify the
implementation of environmental control policies. However, since this amenitv value of
environmental qualitv in Argentina is not known. there is no guidance for the extent of environmental
regulation and environmental improvements that could be justified by this demand for a cleaner
environment.
76.   This study seeks to establish a better information base on the amenity value of a cleaner
environment in the metropolitan centers of Argentina. The study will determine the economic value
of improvements in urban environmental qualitv including (a) air quality; (b) surface water quality;
and (c) noise levels.
77.   The two main approaches employed by the study will be:
(a)    The evaluation of environmental improvements through the analysis of averting
behavior and hedonic markets. Averting behavior to be analyzed includes altemative
sources of drinking water (bottled water, trucks), altemative swimming opportunities
(pools, travel to locations with clean water), housing investments (commuting as a
defensive measure against downtown noise and pollution), and others. Hedonic
market analysis will be performed to infer the valuation of environmental quality
from housing prices (from cadastre data and other sources).
(b)    The analysis of averting behavior and hedonic markets will be complemented by
contingent valuation studies. The focus will be on the contingent valuation of
reductions in air pollution, water pollution, and noise. The analysis of contingent
valuation will be subsidiary to (i) in order to till the gaps and validate the findings of
(i).
78.   In addition to providing a sound basis for environmental decision making, the proposed study
will strengthen local capacity in environmental economics analysis.
79.   This study will be produced by a team of environmental economists. The cost of this study is
estimated at US$ 100.000.

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR NATURAL RESOURCE STUDIES
80.   Terms of reference for these studies were prepared by staff in the Secretariat of
Agriculture Natural Resources and Human Environment (SRNyAH), which will supervise these
and similar studies in this sector (to be defined later). The proposed studies are:
(a)    National Plan for Soil Conservation (US$300,000)
(b)   Detailed Evaluation of Soil Status of Specific Areas (US$300,000), for which
terms of reference will be prepared based on the previous study;
(c)    National Plan for the Integrated Management of Watersheds (US$450,000)
(d)   Studies of Specific River Basins, e.g., the Santa Cruz, Uruguay and Chubut rivers
(US$1,500,000) for which terms of reference will be prepared based on the
previous study.
Study: National Plan for Soil Conservation
Introduction
81.   Argentina suffers from soil degradation in about 30% of its territory (1.444 million km).
Estimates of economic losses from decreases in harvests due to water and wind erosion reach
US$700 million per year. According to the US National Service for Soil Conservation, this
damage is tripled when taking into account indirect losses.
82.   The main negative effects of these processes fall upon the agricultural sector, affecting
the economic feasibility of farms and contributing to rural-urban migration. Erosion also affects
the operation and conservation of basic infrastructure for the activities of the other economic
sectors and quality of life: roads, cities, ports, irrigation and drainage canals.
83.   The causes of this situation are not technological, but rather due to the lack, in both the
public and private sectors, of: (a) an adequate national legal framework; (b) effective co-
ordination among national and provincial public institutions and the private sector; (c) financial
resources, equitably distributed; (d) equipment and training in government institutions; (e) active
participation of the private sector in the programming, financing and implementation of
activities in this area; and (f) awareness by agricultural and livestock producers and the
population in general, of the causes and effects of soil erosion. To summarize, Argentina does
not have a national policy, a legal framework or a short- and medium-term action plan to address
soil conservation.



79
Lgal and Institutional Background
84.   Law 22.428 "Development of Soil Conservation", 1981, was the latest attempt by the
State to put in place a soil conservation policy. It was applied first in 1985 by the Secretariat of
Agriculture (SAGyP), and consisted basically of subsidies to consortia of agricultural producers
to finance totally or partially expenses and investments in conservation projects. The Law of
Economic Emergency of 1989 eliminated these subsidies, and Decree 177/92 transferred
responsibility for the implementation of the law to the Secretariat of Agriculture and Natural
Resources (SAHyRN), whose Soil Institute, which depends on the Research Centre for Natural
Resources, has for over 50 years carried out research, experimenting and analyses of soil. They
do not, however, provide services to producers.
85.   There are public institutions with responsibility in this area in the Provinces of Misiones,
Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, C6rdoba, La Pampa and Entre Rios. The last is the only one with a Soil
and Water Conservation and Use Plan, which started in 1993, and includes the creation of a Soil
and Water Conservation Service in 1995, supported by SAGyP, the World Bank and the IDB.
86.   The reasons for the paucity of concrete activities can be summarized as: (a) scarce
resource availability and bureaucratic difficulties in obtaining them; (b) lack of a central state
institution to control the correct use of the subsidies; (c) insufficiency of training and motivation
of the government technical staff involved; and (d) lack of a clear understanding, among
producers, of the need to conserve soil.
Objectives and Results of the Study
87.   The main objective of the study is the preparation of the National Soil Conservation Plan,
with the following results:
(a)    Diagnostic of soil erosion in the country, indicating geographic distribution and
soil gravity, economic and social ranking for each zone.
(b)   Diagnostic of the economic effects of erosion on farms, global agricultural and
livestock production and losses caused outside agricultural areas.
(c)    Diagnostic  of  existing  national  and  provincial  legislation,  indicating
responsibilities of the private sector and non-governmental organizations.
(d)   Preparation of a draft Proposal for a National Soil Conservation Law.
(e)    Diagnostic of the capacity of private and public sector institutions on soil
conservation (human resources, equipment, infrastructure, etc.).
(f)   Information gathering, analysis and evaluation of agricultural management
techniques for soil conservation.



80
(g)   Preparation of a proposal for a national policy for soil conservation, giving action
priorities, strategies and general guidelines for the country, provinces and
agricultural producers.
(h)    Proposed action plan for agrotechnical and infrastructure works, according to
identified erosion areas, including the setting up or strengthening of central and
provincial institutions and training to private sector consortia; identification of
staff training needs, both on-the-job and courses; identification of infrastructure
and equipment needs of the public institutes involved in the Plan, with
approximate costs for all activities, suggested sources of financing and resources,
and alternative means of private sector participation.
(i)    Proposal for information dissemination and education, both in general and
directed at the rural population.
Time for the Study and Profile of Consultants
88.   It is expected that the study will take six months to be carried out, by a team composed
of: an agronomist with soil conservation experience; a legal and institutional specialist; an
economist; a financial analyst; an ecologist; an expert on social communication; a specialist on
production and conservation; and a coordinator with ample experience in the subject. Activities
will be based on the detailed action plan presented by the consulting team; it is expected that
several trips to provinces will be necessary.
Reporting
89.   Progress reports will be presented to the Secretariat of Economic Programming 45, 60
and 120 days after starting the study.
Estimated Cost: US$300,000

Study: National Plan For Integrated Management Of Watersheds
Introduction
90.   Major cities and a large portion (2.9 million km) of agricultural land in Argentina are
affected by severe water problems, flooding, competition for the use of the resource,
contamination, erosion and salinization. These processes are more serious in the humid zones of
the country (1/3 of the surface) but also occur in the humid valleys and alluvial plains of rivers
in arid and semi-arid zones. This situation is due, not so much to the lack of techniques and
works to conduct and distribute water adequately throughout the land, but rather to deficiencies
in the public sector and in private initiative, as follows:
(a)    A legal framework for the conservation, use and final destination of water
resources.
(b)   Effective co-ordination  among national, provincial and  municipal public
institutions and associations of users of water.
(c)    Dissemination and application of the concept of integrated management of
watersheds, using such technical and administrative entities as watershed
committees.
(d)   Actual financial resources, equitably distributed, to support the necessary
activities and works.
(e)    Training of staff and equipment in the state institutions with these missions.
(f)    Mechanisms for the active participation of the urban and rural population as well
as producers in the programming, financing and execution of activities in this
area; and
(g)   Awareness by the population in general of the causes and effects of the incorrect
management of the water cycle and waters in the territory, in particular those
which generate flooding, contaminations and droughts.
91.   To summarize, Argentina lacks a defined national policy to solve the problem of use of
water resources, lacks appropriate federal and provincial legal frameworks, and short- and
medium-term action plans agreed with state institutions, farmers and the general rural
population.
Main River Basins with Water Problems
92.   The Salado river basin (Buenos Aires Province, 100,000 km) has undergone severe
flooding every two years since 1980, with substantial losses for the State and the private sector
(not counting the Provincial subsidies to producers which these floodings make necessary -
"Agricultural Emergency Law"). This situation is repeated in other areas of the country. It was



82
calculated that in 1993/94 the State lost US$700 million, although total costs are estimated to be
much higher.
93.   In the Lower Southern Plains (Provinces of Chaco and Santa Fe and the east of C6rdoba
and Santiago del Estero - 250,000 km) similar phenomena are found. In the 1980s, flooding of
about 60,000 km resulted in the loss of 50% of harvests, 22,000 cattle and serious damage to
100,000 inhabitants. In the "Zona de Invernada" (watershed to the north of the Province of
Buenos Aires which has been linked to the watershed of the Quinto River) considerable damage
has been produced over 50,000 km by catastrophic flooding which added to seasonal overflows
have resulted in salinization and the rising of the water table to the surface, with the consequent
loss of a large part of the land's agricultural and pasture capacity. Damage caused in 1985/85
was estimated at US$120 million.
94.   Inadequate management of the water cycle and use is particularly present in the majority
of watersheds with irrigation systems: 1.2 million hectares which generate approximately 25%
of all Argentinean agricultural production (in value), and which constitute important
development focal points for the regional economies (all Provinces in the Northeast, Patagonia
and Cuyo). The watersheds most affected are those of the Mendoza and Tunuyan Rivers, in the
Province of Mendoza, where water is scarce and there is much competition for it among
industrial, sanitary, agricultural and energy sectors. Salinization and shallow water tables (less
than one meter deep) affects fapproximately half the surface of irrigation systems in the country.
95.   Other watersheds with related problems are: Quinto River (San Luis and Cordoba),
Lagunas Encadenadas (Buenos Aires), Sali-Dulce Rivers (Tucuman, Santiago del Estero and
C6rdoba), and the Pilcomayo River (Formosa and the Republic of Paraguay). In several zones in
the Andes piedmonts there are strong and frequent courses during the thaw, with enormous
damage to the population, infrastructure and agriculture.
Legal and Institutional Background
96.   In Argentina, the use of water resources is legally within the jurisdiction of the Provincial
Governments, excepting navigation which falls under the Federal Government. All Provinces
have one or more entities related to water resources, their exact nature depending on the most
important uses in that Province. In 1969 the (federal) Secretariat of Water Resources was
created; in 1985 it was changed into the Department of Water Resources, with however little
planning and implementation capacity. In 1994, it became the Subsecretariat of Water Resources
in the Ministry of Economy. Other national entities in this area are the National Institute of
Water Technology and Science, the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, and the
Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources. In the 1980s ten Watershed committees
were formed, covering a surface of 65,000 km, but jurisdiction conflicts, financial restrictions
and the lack of a suitable legal framework led to the disappearance of most of them.
97.   Today there are three active entities in watershed administration: (a) COREBE, the
"Comisi6n Regional del Rio Bermejo", comprising the Provinces of Chaco, Formosa, Jujuy,
Salta, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero and the National Government, which operates as a
development entity, carrying out joint activities with Bolivia; (b) COIRCO, the "Comisi6n



83
Interprovincial del Rio Colorado", comprising the Provinces of La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Rio
Negro, Neuquen, Mendoza and the National Government, which regulates the use of the
denominated "Programa Unico Acordado"; and (c) the Interjurisdictional Authority of the Rivers
Limay, Neuquen and Negro, comprising by the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Neuquen and Rio
Negro, with similar activities.
Objectives and Expected Results
98.   The main objective of the study is the preparation of the National Plan for Integrated
Management of Watersheds. The plan should be accompanied by:
(a)    Diagnostic of the use of water resources in Argentina, identifying the principal
natural, infrastructure, financial, technical, legal and administrative problems, and
their economic, social and environmental effects, quantifying relevant damages,
benefits and losses for the State and the private sector.
(b)   Diagnostic of the national, provincial and municipal legislation concerning water
resources, and the administration of implementing entities, including the role of
the private sector and non-governmental organizations.
(c)    Evaluation of economic, technical and environmental requirements and the
viability, from a policy and institutional aspect, of the formulation of a national
law on the use of water resources.
(d)   Diagnostic on the capability of public and private institutions to implement
watershed management activities, identifying deficiencies in human resources,
equipment, infrastructure and geographic distribution.
(e)    Proposal for a water resource national policy, with corresponding priorities for
environmentally sound watersheds, strategies and general guidelines for National
and Provincial Government intervention, including possible participation of the
urban and rural private sector.
(f)    Proposal for the institutional organization of the Plan, involving a central state
institution and provincial levels for the support, supervision and control, and the
consolidation or creation of watershed committees, according to the institutional
characteristics of each Province.
(g)   Identification of the requirements for human resource training, including the
preparation of terms of reference for courses and training for state and private
sector entities involved.
(h)   Identification of infrastructure and equipment requirements of the public sector
institutions involved in the Plan, and approximate costs.



,94
(i)    Definition of all costs of the Plan with details for each type of activity, entity,
investment or expenditure, watershed, etc. Proposal for financing of the Plan,
identifying sources of funding and alternative participation for user organizations.
Time for the Study and Profile of Consultants
99.   It is expected that the study will take six months to be carried out, by a team composed
of: two hydrologists, 2 hydrological engineers, a climatologist, one geomorphologist, one
agronomist, a specialist in water resource legal and institutional aspects; an economist; a
financial analyst; an ecologist; an expert on social communication; a specialist on water use,
production and conservation association; and a coordinator with ample experience in the subject.
Activities will be based on the detailed action plan presented by the consulting team. It is
expected that several trips to Provinces will be necessary.
Reporting
100.  Progress reports will be presented to the Secretariat of Economic Programming 45, 60
and 120 days after starting the study.

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE STUDIES
101.  Terms of reference for these studies were prepared in co-operation with the Secretariat of
Transport and the Secretariat of Public Works, which will supervise these and similar studies in
this sector (to be defined later). The proposed studies are:
(i)    Infrastructure Census: US$1.5 million
(ii)    Detailed evaluation of status of 6 specific areas: US$50,000 ea =
US$300,000.
(iii)   Southern Cone Infrastructure Links: US$1.5 million
(iv)   Detailed evaluation of status of 6 specific areas: US$50,000 ea =
US$300,000.
(v)    Evaluation of Infrastructure Needs in the Private Sector (Terms of
Reference to be prepared during the second year): US$300,000.
Infrastructure Censtis
Introduction
102.  In Argentinean Public Sector there cannot be found, today, one single body of
information with an inventory of infrastructure works, which reflect the investments which the
country has carried out in all its jurisdictions. As a corollary, it is impossible as well to find the
state of use of these infrastructure works, their maintenance and rehabilitation requirements,
their adequacy to the country's present and near future needs. This lack precludes in most cases
adequate planning and effective coordination among the different jurisdictions, leading to a lack
of rationalization of the investment process, in the Public or the Private Sectors.
103.  The Argentinean State, in its new role of "guide" rather than "executor" of infrastructure
investments, needs to provide basic information to be used by the private and public sector, to
orient their investment resources to fill needs, eliminate duplication and coordinate activities.
Such information is also needed to increase the economic rate of return of all future
infrastructure investments.
Objective of the Study
104.  The overall purpose of the study is to provide the proper national, provincial and
municipal authorities with relevant information regarding current investments in infrastructure in
their jurisdictions, leading to a better administration and conservation of already invested
resources and to a better planning of future investments.



86
105.  There is therefore a need for an infrastructure census, carried out by an experienced
consulting firm which would detine the survev methodology to be used, test it, and carry out the
actual census.
Framework of the Study
106.  The consulting firm wvouid take into consideration the fact that the final studv will have
the following components:
(a)    A  census  of national, provincial  and  municipal  existing  infrastructure
investments. resulting in an Inventory of Infrastructure works in the Public
Sector.
(b)    Evaluation of the general preservation status of the surveyed works, their
monetary value. utilization and adequacv to their objectives and impact on the
environment. measured in accordance with the methodology previouslv agreed
upon.
(c)    Development of norms and procedures for annual and bi-annual supervision of
works in the inventory, and for the update of the monetary value of the
inventoried works.
(d)    Development of the norms and procedures for adding new infrastructure works to
the inventorv
(e)    Design a svstem  for automating the inventory, recommending an entity to be
responsible for the maintenance and update of the information
107.  The sectors to be covered bv the survev are:
(a)    Infrastructure in the Transport sector. including roads, bridges, tunnels. railways,
airports, ports and complementary works;
(b)    Infrastructure in the Energy sector: Power Plants (hydraulic, thermal and
nuclear), transmission and electric power networks, general installations, and
pipelines for the transportation of hydrocarbons.
(c)    Infrastructure in the Water sector, including canals or waterwavs, irrigation
systems and flood prevention (or contention) works.
(d)    Infrastructure in the Sanitation sector: \Vater supply (production. transmission,
treatment and distribution), sewerage (collection, transmission, treatment and
availability)
(e)    Infrastructure in the Education sector: buildings and equipment for schools,
universities, workshops and self improvement centers.



67
(f)   Infrastructure in the Public Health sector: buildings and equipment for hospitals,
clinics and health centers.
(g)   Infrastructure in the Agriculture sector:  Marketplaces, warehouses, storage
centers, silos and other general installations.
(h)   Infrastructure in the Government sector:  Buildings and facilities used in the
performance of the activities of each jurisdiction and branch.
(i)    Other investments: Miscellaneous buildings, land and works not included above.
Scope of the Study
108.  The consulting firm would focus on the following:
(a)    Global diagnosis of the infrastructure sector, analyzing the sector's problems, its
development and restrictions, giving a global evaluation of its conservation status
and current and the immediate future needs of the country.
(b)    Compilation of information on similar studies in other countries and presentation
of their most important conclusions.
(c)    The recommended methodology for carrying out the census (review of the scope
of the studv, pilot tests and survey analysis) and identification of the resources
needed to analvze each sector.
(d)    Testing of the recommended survey questionnaire and methodology in one of the
previously-mentioned economic sectors, in one jurisdiction (national, provincial
or municipal).
(e)    Preparation of a work plan for the census.
Profile of Consulting Firm
109.  The consulting firm to be selected should be marketing/survey oriented, with knowledge
of engineering and experience in infrastructure works. Activities will be based on the detailed
action plan presented by the consulting firm.
Reporting
110.  Progress reports will be presented to the Secretariat of Economic Programming every
two months. The first report will contain a schedule of proposed activities. Later reports would
contain explanations for deviations from this plan. and an updated action plan, to be agreed with
SPE. A final report would be presented containing all partial reports.

Southern Cone Infrastructtire Links
Introduction
111.  In the recent past, the Southern Cone countries have become much closer, socially as
well as economicallv. The opening of the national economies, the consolidation of the
democratic governments, and more importantly, the awareness of common interests are some of
the reasons which impulsed this process. which was given form by the MERCOSUR treaty
among Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. which became effective on January 1, 1995. It
is expected that in the near future other countries in the region. such as Chile and Bolivia, may
join the treaty.
112.  This new relationship has resulted in an increase in travel by nationals of these countries,
not only for commercial reasons but also for tourism; this increase leads the countries involved
to consider the need for improvement of the infrastructure linking these countries, to encourage
integration and economic development. Larger and better links will permit an efficient and
secure traffic with the consequent reduction in costs, in the case of transport infrastructure, and
a better integration, in the case of communications works. In the case of the water and energy
sectors, better coordination of new works will help avoid duplication of efforts and a better use
of existing works will encourage a more flexible relationship in their common use. In the area of
services, the improvement of the tourist infrastructure will permit an increase in the number of
people visiting the countries.
113.  Another consideration, of no less importance. is the impact of such activities in poor
border areas, as joint regional development might be possible, to accelerate their economic
development, contributing as well to lessening disparities in development. Additionally,
common policies for the protection of the environment would be possible (as well as necessary),
to lessen the impact of infrastructure works in these border areas.
114.  These considerations underline the need for a studv which will analvze the common
interests of the MERCOSUR countries and propose a strategy for the best use of existing
infrastructure links and the development of new works.
Objective of the Studv
115.  The objective of this study is to design a linking strategy among Southern Cone countries
in the common infrastructure and eventuallv service sectors (e.g., improvement of tourist
infrastructure), to increase the economic benefit to be obtained from projects with a purely
national perspective, and recommend a general development plan for works, keeping in mind
existing works, the need for a better reszional communication, for improved development of the
poorer areas, and for the protection of the environment in these areas.
Scope of the Study
116.  The proposed studv will encompass:



,89
(a)    A  general evaluation of the existing infrastructure links in Southern Cone
countries.
(b)    The  development of strategic  linking  alternatives  which  will orient the
development of the civil works regional infrastructure in the Southern Cone.
(c)    The proposal of negotiation alternatives to interest other countries in carrying out
joint studies that: (a) maximize the economic benefits of the regions compared
with purely national infrastructure projects: and (b) optimize the management of
the shared natural resources.
(d)    A first identification of the possible economic or other benefits to be obtained in
the peripheric areas of the Republic of Argentina as a result of regional
infrastructure proj ects.
(e)    The identification of new linking infrastructure projects, between Argentina and
the other Southern Cone countries.
117.  The infrasctructure sectors envisaged are basicallv the following:
(a)    Transport sector:  roads,  bridges,  tunnels,  railways,  airports,  ports  and
complementary works.
(b)    Energy sector: Power Plants (hydraulic, thermal and nuclear), transmission and
electric power networks, general installations and ducts for the transportation of
hydrocarbons.
(c)    Water sector: Canals or waterways, irrigation systems and flood prevention (or
contention) works.
(d)    Service sector: Tourism infrastructure. others.
DescripRtion of Activities
118.  The activities to be carried out are the following:
(a)    A general evaluation, through existing documentation, of infrastructure works in
existance or under preparation or construction.
(b)    Identifv the benefits to be obtained bv Argentina through a program  of project
execution of additional infrastructure links. and design a strategy to direct this
program.
(c)    Carry out a studv of the potential economic benefits to be obtained in peripheral
areas of the Argentine Republic as a result of new regional infrastructure projects.



90
(d)    Analysis of the possible obstacles, economic and environmental impacts in the
common regions as a result of the civil works contemplated; present alternatives
to deal with identified difficulties.
(e)    Present negotiation alternatives to interest the other countries in the preparation of
joint studies which: (a) maximize the economic benefits of the regions compared
with purelv national infrastructure projects; and (b) optimize the management of
