MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ZAMBIA
FOR A SOCIAL RECOVERY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation of a proposed credit to Zambia for the equivalent of
US$20.0 million. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity, including 10 years of grace, and would help
finance a Social Recovery Project. The Project would be cofinanced by
the European Community (EC) for US$15.0 million equivalent (parallel
cofinancing), and the Government of Norway for US$2.2 million equivalent
(joint cofinancing).
2.    Countrv/Sector Background. After a three year hiatus, Zambia has
normalized its relations with the World Bank Group. It has followed a
Fund-monitored adjustment program since September 1988 and cleared its
arrears to the World Bank Group on March 13, 1991. IDA has recently
approved an Economic Recovery Credit to support the program. As part of
the adjustment program, the Government has developed a Social Action
Program (SAP) designed to assist the poor until they begin to feel the
positive effects of the adjustment program. Further, it has mobilized
the donor community to support the SAP. Specifically, in each sector of
the SAP, it has identified lead donors to coordinate assistance. The
lead donors are the governments of the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway,
Germany and EC.
3.    Immediate action under the SAP is necessary because of the severe
deterioration of public services and social indicators over the past de-
cade. Schools, in dire need of rehabilitation after years of no
maintenance, are overcrowded and under-equipped: class sizes in primary
schools are over 75 in rural areas and 120 in urban areas, and textbook
supplies are so limited that the best-supplied schools have only 1 book
for every 6 students. Health services are barely functioning. Lack of
adequate supplies and maintenance has severely reduced effectiveness--at
a time when health problems are worsening with rampant childhood
diseases compounded by epidemics of cholera and other water-borne
diseases.  Malnutrition is widespread.  More than 40 percent of hospital
deaths among children are from malnutrition (up from 13 percent in
1980), and the majority of households are unable to produce, store or
purchase sufficient amounts of food.  Deteriorating feeder roads and
poor water supply and sanitation are significant obstacles to social and
economic development, especially to improving nutrition and food
security.
4.    To facilitate immediate interventions to address these urgent
problems, the Government has requested IDA's support for
small-scale, labor-intensive, community-based initiatives under the
framework of the SAP. Such support will build on the successful
experience of the EC-funded Microprojects Programme and be administered
by the Microprojects Unit (MPU) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
S.    Project Oblectives.  The primary project objective is to finance
community initiatives to protect the poor during the structural



2
adjustment program. To this end, the Project would support the rehabil-
itation and improvement of existing infrastructure and service delivery
through the SRF. This would strengthen caomunities' ability to address
their own needs and support a revival of a spirit of self-help. Further,
the Project would improve the information base and provide analyses to
enhance the Government's planning and policy making in the social
sectors.
6.    Program Objective Categories.  The Project is a key element in
Zambia's anti-poverty efforts. By directly involving poor
beneficiaries, it addresses poor's needs in a manner which complements
their own survival strategies. The Project also supports human resource
development through the rehabilitation of education and health
facilities. Finally, the Project supports the devolutior. of social
services away from central government, a key component of the
Government's public sector manaaement strategy.
7.    Proiect Desi8n.  The Project will achieve its objectives by
working with and building on an effective program already being
implemented by the MPU in the MOF that allows communities and NGOs to
implement sub-projects. This arrangement helps to insure its
institutional sustainability.
8.    Project Description.  The Project will support the following
components:
(a) Community Initiatives. (89 percent of project cost) Through
the MPU the Project would finance a series of small, simple and
locally-generated sub-projects in health, nutrition, education and
economic infrastructure. To ensure the sub-projects'
sustainability and community involvement, communities would be
required to contribute to sub-project cost in the form of labor,
materials or cash.
(b) Institutional Support (6 percent of project cost) for the MPU.
(c) Analysis and Monitoring. (5 percent of project cost) This
includes support for national statistical surveys, a benefici3ry
assessment and a studies fund that would finance a series of local
studies related to poverty.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Zambia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9471-ZAM, is also attached.
9.    Proiect Implementation. The MPU in the MOP will Implement the
Community Initiatives Component of the Project. In this capacity it
will collect sub-project proposals that communities and Non-governmental
Organizations (NGOs) have identified and local governments have
approved, will appraise these sub-projects, and will supervise their



3
implementation by communities and NGOs. The Institutional Support
component will provide. resources that will bolster the MPU's ability to
handle the expanded responsibilites that the Project will entail.
Because of its demonstrated capacity to collect survey data, the Central
Statistical Office will implement the survey sub-component of the
Analysis and Monitoring component. The studies that constitute the
studies sub-component will be undertaken by research and other
institutions within the country. The MPU will coordinate these studies.
10.     Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group and EC Involvement.
The Bank Group's support to the social sectors in Zambia is limited to
five education projects, the last one signed in 1982. Because these
were all designed when copper revenues were high, they reflect the
Government's earlier norms for education facilities in particular and
infrastructure in general. These projects financed complex facilities
that no longer fulfill high-priority needs. In contrast, this Project
will focus on simple facilities and infrastructure. A project that
takes a similar approach to supporting community initiatives was
implemented in Bolivia (Emergency Social Fund Project). The lessons
from the Project Performance Audit Report have been incorporated in the
design of the Project. These lessons include: (a) desirability of
financing small, technologically simple projects with a substantial
community involvement, (b) the need to involve Government, NGOs, and
communities in sub-project implementation, and (c) the need to attract
high caliber staff for the central implementing agency (the MPU in this
case). Finally, the Project is based on the successful experience of
the EC-funded Microprojects Programme. In an interim evaluation, the EC
suggested that its program use more refined evaluation criteria, install
a computer-based accounting system, and improve procurement procedures
to allow for more large supply contracts. The Project takes these
suggestions fully into account.
11.     Rationale for Bank Involvement.  IDA's involvement is important
because (a) the Government has asked for IDA to support small-scale,
immediate impact projects as these are seen as quick and efficient ways
of responding to the needs of the poor and vulnerable; (b) other donors
presently have a comparative advantage in more traditional social sector
projects and are looking to IDA for leadership and coordination on the
small projects side; (c) IDA has experience in such interventions from
other countries (it has completed two such projects in Bolivia and is
beginning to implement others in several other African countries); and
(d) in the production and analysis of data the lessons learned from
these small projects could provide important guidance to future
interventions in the social sectors.
12.     Actions to be Aareed.  During appraisal, agreement was reached
on the operating procedures of the MPU, including appraisal and
accounting systems, and staffing requirements. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Government on the conditions of
effectiveness and dated covenants. As conditions for effectiveness: (a)
the MPU would present a finalized appraisal guide, acceptable to IDA;
(b) the MPU would present final terms of reference for MPU staff and an
action plan for hiring staff; and (c) the MPU would demonstrate that a
sufficient pipeline of sub-proiect proposals are available to cover the



4
activities of the first quarter of operations. As dated covenants, b
January 1992 and every year thereafter the Government would show that
there has been an increase in real terms in the budget for non-
remuneration recurrent costs for health and education.
13.     Environmental Aspects.  The Project has an only minor impact on
the environment due to its focus on rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure in education and health. Sub-project appraisal criteria
include an assessment of environmental effects.
14.     Project Benefits.  The direct benefits of the proposed project
would be the physical and human capital improvements generated by the
sub-projects. The indirect benefits fall in three categories. First,
concerted donor support would help sustain Zambia's overall adjustment
efforts. Second, as the Project supports local self-help activities, it
would help to promote decentralized initiatives and devolve respon-
sibility for providing services and maintaining infrastructure away from
the central government. Third, the Analysis and Monitoring Component
would provide a means to collect information and conduct analysis that
would inform the Government's efforts to design social policies.
15.     Risks.  The main risk is that the Project could be hampered by
the Government's limited implementation capacity. This risk would be
minimized by encouraging simplicity in sub-project design, building on
local and regional initiatives, providing institutional support for the
Microprojects Unit, and basing the Project on the EC's succesful
experience.
16.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
