A. Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
1. Program purpose and program phasing:
As Turkey prepares for full participation in the global economy, the Government and the public
recognize the need to raise the educational qualifications of the population (described in Section B.2,
below). They also recognize that the most urgent priority is to increase the coverage of education at the
base of the education pyramid. After several attempts to address this need earlier in the 1990s, in August
1997 Parliament approved a new Basic Education Law which extends the duration of compulsory
schooling from five years to eight years and mandates improved quality and relevance of basic education.
The law also mobilizes major new financing for the necessary investments to achieve these objectives.
There has also been an outpouring of voluntary private donations of over US$350 million to support the
Government Program. To support this initiative further, the Government requested large-scale support
from the World Bank in November 1997. In June 1998, the Bank's Board approved the first phase of the
US$600 million Adaptable Program Loan (Loan No. 4355-TU) to support the implementation of the
Government's Basic Education Program.
This Project Appraisal Document describes the World Bank's second phase of the APL for
US$300 million. However, because the project is intended to be part of the Government's overall program
of support for basic education over the next three years, that program is also described briefly here for
context. In addition, because this project and the Government's program are each based on work cail-ed
out over the past four years, the document also provides a summary of the Govemment's prograr oGf
support for basic education to date and a description of the first Bank APL in support of that program.
Basic Education Program: Progress to date. The Basic Education Program comprises a broad
range of actions, financed largely by the Government, but also by major private contributions. The
Government-financed portion of the Program involves expenditures of over US$2 billion per year,
including both actions financed under the investment budget (such as construction of new schools,
refurbishment of existing schools, and provision of improved educational equipment and materials), and
actions financed under the recurrent budget (largely comprised of payment of salaries of teachers and other
educational staff, and recruitment and training of additional teachers and educational staff to expand
school capacity). Total annual expenditures for the Basic Education Program to date -- including all
investment and recurrent costs which directly support basic education - are estimated at over US$3 billion
annually.
There has been major progress in implementing the Basic Education Program and achieving its
objectives. Although total basic education enrollments had declined during the six years prior to the
Program, enrollments in basic education have increased by 1.5 million since the start of the Program,
raising the net enrollment ratio for eight-year basic education from 75.8 percent to 95 percent. Girls'
enrollments in rural areas made the most rapid progress. Girls' enrollments in grade six in rural areas
increased by 162 percent in the first year of the Program, and have continued to make sharp gains since.
There are few cases in the history of any national education system which can compare with these initial
achievements of the Basic Education Program.
Other actions implemented to date under the Basic Education Program include the following:
School Construction and Rehabilitation. Through a combination of Government resources and
private contributions, the Ministry of National Education (MONE) constructed 103,983 new basic
education classrooms during the five years 1997 - 2001, bringing the total stock to 264,776 basic
education classrooms. These actions created additional capacity for more than 3 million basic
education students. Enhanced allocation of flmds for capital investment in combination with new
-3 -



contracting procedures made this vastly scaled-up school building program possible. In addition,
the Program has supported the renovation of 300 large rural and central village schools, 1,300
small rural schools, 13 regional boarding and pension schools, and is funding the rehabilitation and
extension of 44 schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas).
Support to Students from low-income families. The Program has provided a complete set of free
textbooks to 796,000 needy basic education students in 36 provinces. Free school meals are being
provided to 635,000 basic education students in the school bussing program, to over 80,000 basic
education students in boarding schools, and to 100,000 students in the Marmara earthquake area.
In addition, the Program is supporting daily bussing for 600,000 students from villages without a
school offering grades 6 to 8 to larger population centers which have such a school.
Teacher Recruitment and Training. Over 50,000 additional basic education teachers have been
recruited. In addition, four annual cycles of in-service training have been provided to basic
education teachers, principals, inspectors, and provincial education staff.
Introducing Information and Communication Technologies aCT). The Ministry introduced
computers in secondary schooling under the earlier Bank-financed National Education
Development Project (Loan 3192-TU). The Basic Education Program is extending this initiative to
basic education, starting with grade four. In addition to developing teacher and student computer
literacy, it is integrating ICT into other subjects in basic education, starting with grade four.
The First Phase of the APL. The first phase of the APL (Basic Education Project, Loan
4355-TU) financed a subset of the Government's Basic Education Program. The US$300 million provided
under the first APL is supporting the following activities: a) refurbishment and enlargement of 300 rural
basic education schools; b) provision of educational materials to all 22,268 rural schools in Turkey; c)
introduction of ICT classes in almost 3,000 basic education schools throughout the country; d) in-service
training for basic education teachers and school inspectors; e) monitoring and evaluation, and f)
reconstruction of earthquake-damaged schools and other earthquake recovery actions. Project activities a
and c, above, are completed. Activities b, e, and f are in progress. Following the August, 1999 Marmara
earthquake, the first phase of the APL was amended at the Government's request to incorporate school
reconstruction and other actions to support the resumption of education in the earthquake area. The
project was further amended in November, 2000 to remove some earthquake activities that were financed
by other sources, and to enlarge and refurbish 44 schools in Ankara province. The first phase of the APL
was scheduled to close at the end of the 2000/01 school year, in June, 2001 but has been extended and is
now expected to close in June 2003.
Refurbishment of Rural Schools. Loan funds financed the refurbishment of 199 small rural basic
education schools and teacher housing in five provinces in the East and Southeast with the lowest
school attendance and educational performance. Those schools are back in operation, under vastly
improved teaching and learning conditions. In addition, 121 central village schools and 13 regional
boarding schools were rehabilitated. The loan also financed the civil and installation works for
ICT classrooms at 2,802 schools. The rehabilitation of 1,300 small rural schools is well
underway. The loan is further financing the ongoing rehabilitation and extensions of 44 schools in
low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas), and 28 additional regional boarding and
pension schools. Finally, the loan is funding the reconstruction and upgrading of 4 earthquake
damaged schools. All ongoing civil works under funding from the first APL is expected to be
completed before December 2002.

Providing Educational Materials to Rural Schools. Procurement is in progress for educational
materials which are being provided to all 22,268 rural basic education schools, and to 3 million
children in those schools. This action will make a major contribution to reducing the educational
handicap of rural schools. Together with the preceding activity, it is also expected to improve
school attendance, since feedback from monitoring and evaluation indicates that the cost of
providing educational materials, student uniforms, and school lunches is a key factor that prevents
some parents from sending their children to school.
Introducing ICT. The first phase of the APL is financing the establishment of ICT classrooms in
2,802 existing basic education schools throughout the country - at least two schools in each of the
921 subprovinces of Turkey. All of these schools have been prepared and equipped, and are now
in operation.
In-service teacher education. The first phase of the APL financed training for 330,000 basic
education teachers and 2,850 basic education inspectors in improved pedagogical matters.
Additionally, 2,250 ICT classroom coordinators and 35,000 basic education teachers received
training in the use of computers in basic education.
Basic Education Program: the next three years. Despite the major progress achieved in meeting
the objectives of the Basic Education Program to date, there are still about half a million children of basic
education age who are not in school. For the most part, these children live in rural areas, where there is
generally sufficient school capacity in grades one through five. But many village primary schools require
investments to upgrade facilities, provide better educational materials, and train teachers in order to become
fully effective and to attract children who are not currently attending school. For grades six through eight,
the situation is different. At this level, there are important remaining investment needs throughout the
country for expanded capacity. In view of the dispersion of the rural population, there are also recurrent
budget needs to bus students to central schools in the upper grades of basic education and to operate
boarding schools for students from very remote villages. Some urban basic education schools and few
rural schools are severely overcrowded, and investments in expanded capacity are needed in order to reduce
crowding. Further investments are also needed to extend the effort of equipping all basic education schools
with facilities for ICT. Over the three years, 2002/03 - 2004/05 inclusive, the Basic Education Program
will address these needs by continuing the efforts to expand basic education school capacity, to improve the
quality of basic education, and to make rural schools and schools in low-income areas around large cities (
gecekondu areas) more attractive to the populations they are meant to serve. The overall level of financing
needs for implementation of the Program during these three years is projected to be US$11.2 billion.
While, the economic crisis of late:2000 resulted in an 9.4 percent reduction in GNP, and this affected
Government's ability to finance all of the expenditures needed, Government's commitment to maintaining
the share of education at 4.25 percent of GNP will protect the education budget.
The second phase of the APL. This proposed Project -- financed by a second phase of the APL
of US$300 million - will support implementation of the Government's Basic Education Program over the
three years 2002/03 - 2004/05 inclusive by extending the actions supported under the first APL, by
supporting the development of preschool education as an integral part of basic education, and special needs
education. As it was during the first APL, new basic school construction will be financed entirely by
Government budget resources and private donations. The second phase of the APL will help finance the
following subset of the Government's Program: a) ICT hardware, software for approximately 3,000
additional basic education schools throughout Turkey and the establishment of an education portal; b)
refurbishment of about 550 rural schools, bussing schools and regional boarding and part-time boarding
schools, as well as renovation and extension of 550 bussing schools and schools in low-income areas
-5 -



around large cities (gecekondu areas), which is a key requirement for closing the enrollment gap; c)
provision of educational materials to about 4,000 additional basic education schools; d) further in-service
training of basic education teachers and inspectors; e) construction and furniture for 300 new preschool
classrooms at existing basic education schools, educational materials and training to develop preschool
education as an integral part of basic education, as well as training and educational materials to support
nonformal education for mothers of young children; f) rehabilitation, extension and furnishing of 60 schools
for children with special needs, as well as educational materials and training to develop education for
children with special needs;and to integrate it more within basic education; g) continued support for
Program implementation and h) continued monitoring and evaluation of the Program. These activities are
described more fully in Section C, below.
By the end of 2004/05, the Government's.Basic Education Program is expected to,have: a) created
additional capacity for two million basic education students - enough to accommodate the entire basic
education age group and to reduce the most severe cases of classroom overcrowding; b) made a very
important contribution to filling the enrollment gap in rural areas by upgrading and expanding school
facilities, by providing better teaching and learning materials to all rural schools, and by supporting
community partnerships with basic education schools; and c) made a major contribution to improved basic
education quality by providing six annual cycles of training to teachers, principals, and school inspectors,
by providing a basic set of educational materials to all rural schools and to needy urban schools, and by
introducing ICT in approximately 6,000 basic education schools throughout the country. Although the
Basic Education Program is making very good progress toward its primary goal of universal coverage in
basic education, full achievement of this and other Program objectives - including equipping all basic
education schools with ICT classrooms, reducing classroom overcrowding, and eliminating the
multiple-shift use of schools -- will take at least a decade to achieve. Program implementation beyond
2004/05 will be financed largely by the Govermment and by continued private contributions. The
Government has requested further Bank financing for implementation of the Program beyond 2004/05.
Further Bank financing for subsequent stages of imnplementation could be considered in the future,
depending upon Government priorities, available fiscal resources, and the implementation experience of the
second phase of the APL.
2. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The objective of the second phase of the APL is very similar to the objective of the first phase of
the APL: to promote progress in coverage of eight-year basic education and improved basic education
quality by supporting the implementation of the Basic Education Program. The second phase of the APL
will support the Basic Education Program during the three-year period 2002/03 - 2004/05. In particular,
activities supported through the second phase of the APL will concentrate on increasing coverage and
improving quality among the children of low-income families and children with special needs. The project
will also continue to extend opportuniity to a greater number of children to have access to ICT in basic
education schools across the country. The project will comprise the same actions that were supported
under the first APL, as well as the development of nonfonnal early childhood programs and the
development of preschool education and education of children with special needs as integral parts of basic
education.
3. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)

Government Goals for the Basic Education Program
The Government of Turkey has adopted the following main goals for its Basic Education Program and is
establishing an annual review to look at progress on the quantitative aspects. They will conduct a separate
annual review to look at selected qualitative aspects of these goals:
* All eligible children (including educable children with special needs) enrolled in and completing
basic education
* School enrollment for eligible children at the age of pre-school education approaches 25 percent
* Student performance for all students in basic education improves
* 40 percent of all children in basic education utilize ICT for learning
Key performance indicators for the Second Basic Education Project (Second Phase of the
APL)
The Second Basic Education Project (Second phase of APL) is supporting the achievement of these
Govermment Goals and has based it's Project Goals and performance indicators on the goals for the Basic
Education Program. Accordingly, the Project has established the following perfornance indicators for
measuring progress on the project:
*  More than 350,000 students benefit as a result of renovated or new education facilities:
-      9,800 students in rural schools
-      185,300 students in schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu
areas)
-      83,200 students in regional Basic Education Boarding Schools
and Part-boarding Schools
-      70,800 students in Bussing schools
-      12,000 students in pre-schooling
-      4,800 students with special needs
* More than 3.5 million students enabled to improve their performance as a result of provision of
new educational materials provided to:
-      3,430,000 students in schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu
areas)
-      32,000 students in pre-schooling
-      36,000 students with special needs
*  More that 35,000 students with special needs improve their performance as a result of 4,225
teachers and administrators attending special needs in-service training
*  Over 150,000 pre-school students improve their school readiness as a result of 4,500 teachers
attending pre-school in-service training
•  Children in more than 50,000 families improve their school readiness as a result of direct training
of mothers and their children
*  More than 2 million students utilize ICT for leaming as a result of installation of ICT classrooms
(interventions in the first phase and second phase of the Program), teacher training and the
education portal

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: R2001-0113/1/IFC/R2001-0134/1  Date of latest CAS discussion: 07/12/2001
The proposed second phase of the APL in support of the Basic Education Program would support
the central CAS objective: "to help Turkey meet its goals of irnproving living standards and reducing
economic vulnerability and poverty" (para. 36). Financing under the second phase of the APL would do so
by supporting two of the five themes of the current CAS: it would support the first of these, "to expand
social services and social protection", by supporting improved coverage of basic education throughout the
country. It would support the second theme, "to accelerate connectivity and technological capabilities", by
financing the second phase of the Government's expansion of computer education in basic education
schools. This initiative - one of the most ambitious and far-reaching investments in ICT ever undertaken
in a national education system - is expected to make a quantum improvement in the technological skills of
Turkey's population. The importance of the project was again confirmed in the CAS Progress Report,
discussed at the Board on July 12, 2001.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Educational attainment of Turkey's population and labor force is by far the lowest of all the
OECD countries. In 1997, before the Basic Education Program began, virtually all children in other
OECD countries completed at least eight years of schooling, but in Turkey, fewer than 90 percent of
children completed the first five years of schooling. Of those students who did complete the first five years,
45 percent - mostly girls - did not pursue further education. Only 53 percent of the 6-8 grade age group
attended school. Just 17 percent of Turkey's labor force had at least a secondary education, versus an
average of 60 percent across all the OECD countries. Fully 70 percent of the labor force had only a
five-year primary education or less. Ten percent of the labor force was illiterate. The East and Southeast
lagged far behind the rest of the country in educational attainment, with almost half of girls dropping out
before completion of fifth grade in some provinces. In particular rural schools had problems with high
turnover of teachers, availibility of educational materials, school attendance, and educational performance.
Raising the educational qualifications of the population is a crucial requirement for national
integration and for improved labor productivity and employment growth in Turkey. It is also crucial for
making the Turkish economy more competitive with the European Union, with the other OECD countries,
and with Turkey's global trading partners.
Turkey is in the midst of a national mobilization to improve the educational qualifications of its
population - starting at the base of the education pyramid. The Basic Education Law (No. 4306) which
was adopted by Turkey's Parliament in August, 1997 extends the period of compulsory basic education
from five years to eight years, and raises new tax revenues to finance a vast expansion of education
infrastructure to accommodate the expected increase in basic education enrollments. Prior to adoption of
the new Law, most children started school and completed five years of schooling, but 45 percent of students
dropped out at the completion of grade five. Part of the reason for the high drop-out rate at this level was
that village schools typically provide for only the first five grades of schooling. In order to continue
schooling beyond grade five, most rural children either had to commute to a middle school (grades 6
through 8) in a nearby town, or attend a boarding school. The compulsory extension of basic education
-8 -



began to take effect in September, 1998, when all children who had completed grade five in the prior school
year were required to enroll in grade six. In the following two years, progression from grade six to grade
seven, and from grade seven to grade eight became compulsory, and dropouts within the eight-year basic
education cycle were also proscribed.
The passage of the new Basic Education Law ended a period of stagnation in basic education
enrollments which started in 1991. In 1998, the first year that the compulsory nature of the new law took
effect, total enrollments increased sharply - by 4.4 percent. Enrollments in grade 6, which became
mandatory for the first time in that year, increased from 866,000 in September, 1997 to 1,127,000 in
September, 1998 - an increase of over 30 percent. In rural areas, the gains were dramatic: boys'
enrollments in grade six increased by 62 percent; girls' enrollments increased by 162 percent. The rate of
enrollment growth for girls was at least 50 percent greater than for boys in each of the years since the
passage of the Law. The overall progress in basic education enrollments following the passage of the Basic
Education Law is best summarized by the net enrollment ratio, which is the proportion of the basic
education age group which is currently enrolled in school. The net enrollment ratio increased very sharply
following passage of the Law, from 75.8 percent in 1996/97 to 95 percent in 2001/02. There are few cases
of such rapid enrollment gains in the history of any national education system.
This enrollment expansion is a very impressive achievement of the Basic Education Program, yet
there are no grounds for complacency. There are still more than half a rnillion children of basic education
school age who are not attending school and the gender gap remains: 46 percent of the basic education
pupils are girls. Non-attendance in basic education is concentrated largely in rural areas of the East and
Southeast, and in gecekondu areas of the largest cities. Under the Basic Education Program, the Ministry
is continuing to make a major effort to improve school attendance by improving school facilities and
teaching materials in rural areas.
As part of the current ICT policy, Government aims to provide computer classrooms in all basic
education schools within the next three years. A start has been made with support from the first phase of
the APL and more than 3,000 classrooms in all the regions of the country have computers and software.
Available evidence indicates that the computers are being utilized by children and teachers to gain skills in
computer use and in some applications. In addition, to give all students from 5th grade on basic computer
skills, one major challenge is still remaining: to utilize the technology for educational purposes.
Government is currently revising its policy on the use of ICT in education. This will specify the plan to
integrate ICT into the curriculum and provide recommendations for community use of ICT classrooms as
well as indicate important new directions through e-learning and life-long learning programs.
-9-



3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The success of the Basic Education Program in raising enrollments has led to a sharp increase in
the number of students entering secondary education (grades 9 through 12). Secondary enrollments are
projected to increase by more than 100 percent of their current level (2 million) by 2005 and the transition
rate from Grade 8 to Grade 9 is already approaching 100 percent. Major investments in secondary school
capacity are needed to accommodate this increase and to upgrade teaching quality in secondary education.
While Government has committed itself to maintaining education expenditures at 4.25 percent of GNP, the
economic crisis of late 2000 resulted in a 3 percent drop in MONE's budget in 2001. While the economy is
expected to recover and growth to resume, resources will be somewhat constrained and the Government
faces a difficult strategic choice between the investment needs of basic education and the investment needs
of secondary education. Moving ahead more rapidly with investments to reduce class size and
double-shifting in basic education schools would claim budget resources that are urgently needed for
secondary education expansion and upgrading. In order to allow the urgent investments in expanded
secondary schooling to proceed, it will be necessary to pursue the objectives of reduced class size and
double-shifting in basic education schools more gradually than the Ministry of National Education had
initially planned.
Reaching those children not currently in school, will require additional effort on the part of
Government. The second phase of the APL aims to support Government's efforts to increase enrollments in
areas with significant dropouts by supporting further improvements to schools, further provision of
educational materials, further teacher training to equip basic education teachers to deal with the teaching
challenges of rural schools, and efforts to reduce teachers' sense of isolation in remote, rural schools. In
addition, the project will support preschool education and early childhood development for children from
low-income families and education for students with special needs..
The first phase of the APL provided support to install 3,188 ICT classrooms in 2,802 basic
education schools around the country and MONE supported training for 13,143 teachers. A formal
evaluation of the use of ICT in classrooms is currently underway and the Bank has assisted MONE to
develop the terms of reference for this. The second phase of the APL will extend ICT classrooms to
another 3,000 schools and assist MONE to develop and implement a strategy for utilizing ICT for
educational purposes. In particular, technical assistance will be provided to assist the development of an
education portal and to revise modalities for ICT teacher training including e-learning.
4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans:
The main elements of the Government's Basic Education Program in the period 2002/03 to
2004/05 inclusive, include construction of new basic education schools, refurbishment of existing basic
education schools and associated sanitary toilet facilities and teacher housing units; provision of
educational equipment and materials to basic education schools in urban and rural areas of the country;
equipping of additional classrooms in basic education schools for ICT; recruitment and deployment of new
basic education teachers to meet the need for additional teachers, plus attrition of basic education teachers;
provision of in-service training in effective teaching methods to basic education teachers, school principals,
and school inspectors; expansion of preschool education and nonformal education for mothers of young
children; and bussing of students from remote areas to centralized bussing schools.
The second phase of the APL would help finance school refurbishment, provision of educational
materials, ICT classrooms, in-service teacher training, school improvement, early childhood development,
including preschool, and education of children with special needs. A summary of the Program's major
expenditure items is presented in Section C. 1, below, together with an indication of which activities are
- 10 -



proposed for financing under the second phase of the APL.
Further APL financing for basic education beyond this second phase of the APL is not considered
at this stage. This is true for two reasons:
The first is that the initial two phases of the Program will have largely met the main Program
objectives:
*      The Government will have created additional capacity for about four million basic education
students - enough to accommodate the entire basic education age group and to reduce the most severe
cases of classroom overcrowding. Thereafter, a longer-term program of school construction and other
initiatives will be necessary in order to meet the objectives of universal coverage of eight-year basic
education, reducing average class size to 30 students and gradually eliminating double-shift operation of
schools.
*      The Government will have made a very important contribution to filling the enrollnent gap in rural
areas by upgrading and expanding school facilities and providing better teaching and learning materials to
all rural schools. There will still be some children who do not attend school, but not caused by a lack of
school places. The Basic Education Program has made substantial progress in overcoming the traditional
reluctance of parents in some regions of the country to send their daughters to school beyond the age of
puberty. Still some resistance remains, and some will remain even after the second phase of the Program.
Progress in overcoming this residual resistance to eight-year basic education will require progress in other
domains of economic and social development, as well as continued advocacy by the Government for the
importance of education.
*      The Government will also have made a major contribution to improved basic education quality by
providing annual cycles of training to teachers, principals, and school inspectors, by providing a basic set
of educational materials to all rural schools and to needy urban schools, and by developing computer
education in approximately 6,000 basic education schools throughout the country. Here, too, full
realization of these benefits will require longer-term efforts.
The second reason is that the actions supported under the first and second phase of the APLs
should be sustainable thereafter under the Government's own resources, whereas there is an urgent need to
mobilize additional resources in order to accommodate the more-than-doubling of demand for secondary
enrollments that is expected in the next five years.

(2) Private Donations assume that 2800 new classrooms/year are financed by private sector
(3) Contribution of Local Government (II Ozel Idaresi) is not included, as it is not known what share of those go to
maintenance and what share to go investment financing.
(4) Dollar values based on IMF exchange rate projections. Dollar unit costs for salaries etc are based on current
TL amounts converted at the IMF projected average exchange rate for 2002.
(5) It is assumed that all resources from 4306 funds will be used for Basic and Preschool Education
Project Components. The second phase of the Basic Education Project would support a
continuation and extension of the activities supported under the first phase of the APL. In addition, it
- 12-



would support an expansion of formal preschool education and nonformal mother and child education
which is designed to help children from educationally deprived households succeed in basic education as
well as providing support for the education of children with special needs. Annex 2 provides a detailed
description of project components; Annex 3 provides a detailed cost breakdown. The project comprises
five components:
* Extending Basic Education Coverage (loan financing US$112.37 million) would support
continued rehabilitation and extension of rural and schools in low-income areas around large cities (
gecekondu areas) to improve school attendance, would finance the construction of new preschool
classrooms in existing basic education schools, and would support the renovation and extension of
schools for children with special needs.
* Improved Basic Education Quality (loan financing US$165.45 million) would support continued
investments to equip basic education schools with ICT classrooms, to equip remote rural schools with
modest computer facilities, to develop an online education portal website, and to provide educational
materials to schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas). It would also initiate
support for expanded formal preschool education and education of children with special needs. In
addition, nonformal education in early childhood development for mothers will provide better chances
of success in basic education for children from educationally deprived households.
* Delivery of Basic Education Program (loan financing US$16.05 million) would provide ICT
inservice training to teachers to provide them with basic computer skills and to assist them to utilize
ICT to improve instruction, to inspectors to assist them provide pedagogical ICT support to schools,
and to assist computer instructors to utilize the existing ICT classrooms to their full potential. In
addition, specially designed in-service training courses would be delivered to teachers of children with
special needs and to preschool teachers and trainers of mothers in early childhood development.
* Project Implementation Support (loan financing, US$1.43 million) would finance consultant
services (particularly in the areas of project management, procurement management, financial
management, reporting and communication, ICT and construction) and provision of office equipment,
training and incremental operating costs to upgrade implementation capacity.
* Monitoring and Evaluation (loan financing, US$1.70 million) would support studies and other
actions to assess the outcomes of the Program against several categories of performance indicators, and
provide continuous feedback to Program management to improve the effectiveness of the Program. In
particular, the loan will support semi-annual reviews of the Basic Education Program and the second
phase of the APL by Government and the World Bank.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The recent Turkey Living Standards Study (Report No. 20029-TU) identifies the absence of basic
education as the single characteristic with the strongest correlation to poverty risk. The Government's
adoption of the Basic Education Program, which expands education opporunities at the base of the
education pyramid, is itself a major policy reform. It makes a particular effort to make up the deficiencies
of regions with lagging enrollments and educational performance. The additional resources which the
Government and the public have committed to this effort have addressed the former budgetary constraint
and stagnation of enrollments and programs in basic education. The second phase of the APL will continue
to support this emphasis on expansion and improvement of basic education.

3. Benefits and target population:
The direct beneficiaries are expected to be the young people who will attend basic education under
the Project, and the basic education students who will benefit from better educational materials (including
access to ICT for many children and communities), more motivated and better qualified teachers, and less
crowded classrooms. Teachers will also benefit from the improved training and incentives. Other direct
beneficiaries of the Project include the mothers of children who are better equipped to provide for their
children's health, education, and nutritional needs because of the Project. The Project is targeting the
regions and families with the lowest school attendance and educational performance in basic education - in
particular, girls in the East and Southeast, and children from households in low-income areas around large
cities (gecekondu areas). Provincial education administrations are also benefitting from strengthened
capacity to diagnose, implement and manage programs to meet their needs. The long-term benefits are
expected to include a stronger human resource base underpinning a more competitive economy and a
reduction in poverty levels as well as improvement in health indicators.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The Project is to be implemented over a three-year period, beginning in September, 2002. The
proposed completion date is August 31, 2005. Because the Govermment sees basic education as a
fundamental public service, guaranteed under the Constitution, it prefers to implement the Project as much
as possible within the existing public administrative structure. Under the first phase, implementation
responsibility is bome by MONE central line units shared with 81 provincial directorates.
The second phase of the Project will also be implemented by the central MONE line units and
MONE's provincial national education directorates. Central MONE line units responsible for the
implementation of the Project are: Basic Education General Directorate, Preschool Education General
Directorate, Special Education, Guidance and Counseling Services General Directorate, Education
Technologies General Directorate, Apprenticeship and Non-formal Training General Directorate,
Education Research and Development Department, In-service Training Department, Board of Education,
and Research, Planning and Coordination Council.
Overall project coordination at the central level is being carried out by the Project Coordination
Center (PCC) under direct responsibility of the Deputy Undersecretary responsible for the PCC. MONE
plans to maintain this approach under the second phase of the APL, but with the restructuring efforts of the
PCC and the new PCC Services Directive drafted, it is expected that the project finances will be managed
more efficiently and effectively. PCC was restructured in 2000 to comprise I 1 units: project management
unit, project research and development unit, education, training and documentation unit, information
technologies unit, procurement unit, import and customs unit, construction unit, financial management unit,
monitoring and evaluation unit and personnel and administrative affairs unit.
Regarding the disbursements from the Bank Loan, there will be one special account for the project
in US Dollars and it will be held at the Central Bank of Turkey. Payments to the contractors, suppliers and
consultants, under all project components will be made from the special account with the authorization of
the PCC. Payments will be made directly from the loan account for amounts over 20 percent of the
authorized special account allocation.
Regarding the counterpart funds, the PCC wifl inform the General Directorate of Basic Education
(GDBE) to initiate the payment of the counterpart contribution. MONE will submit the payment
documents to the Ministry of Finance representative (Budget Department and Payment Office) in the
Ministry of Education. The payment to the contractors, suppliers and the consultants will be made directly
- 15-



to them by the Ministry of Finance Budget Department. The Ministry of Finance Budget Department will
provide monthly payment information to the PCC on a transaction basis.
The loan will be disbursed over a period of three years, under the Bank's traditional procedures
including SOEs, direct payments and special commitments. Financial statements will be prepared for the
project by the PCC. The FMRs will be prepared semi-annually and will be submitted to the Bank no later
than 45 days after the end of the quarterly period. The project financial statements will be audited by the
Treasury Controllers in accordance with Intemational Standards on Auditing (ISA) and under terms of
reference already cleared by the Bank.
Implementation follow-up will be carried out by the PCC and annual project implementation plans
and procurement and financial projections will be prepared based on the project implementation plan.
Semi-annual project progress reports will be prepared by the PCC with an input from implementing units
and submitted to the Bank. Regular monthly project implementation status meetings will be held and all
project implementation units of MONE and Bank staff will participate in the meetings. Minutes of the
meetings will be prepared by the PCC and circulated in the MONE and to the Bank's project team.
Semi-annual Financial Management Reports (FMR) will also be prepared by the PCC and submitted to the
Bank.
Provincial Project Management Services (PPMS) Units will be established in every province. The
PPMS Unit will be responsible for effective project implementation at the provincial level under the
authority of the provincial Govemor and Kaymakams (sub-provincial govemors) and the Provincial
education director regarding education matters. Policy Guidance to the PCC and the PPMS Units will be
provided by a Project Steering and Executing Committee (PSEC) comprising heads of relevant MONE
Directorates. The PSEC will meet every two months to discuss project progress.
Extending Basic Education Coverage. The provinces are responsible for identifying their
infrastructure needs, and prepare initial proposals for school construction, rehabilitation and extension
according to the criteria established by the Ministry and agreed mutually with the Bank. The responsibility
for implementation will continue to be with the provincial directorates, strengthened by PCC's continuous
support for training on technical and procurement related administrative issues. PCC's distant and on-site
monitoring of quality and progress of construction and rehabilitation activities will be strengthened through
the engagement of supervision and construction management consultancy firms. Consultancy services will
be provided to their full extent, including in-service training of provincial supervisory staff, for construction
in provinces with inadequate supervision capacity, while in the provinces with adequate capacity and
commitment, the consultancy services will be for monitoring only. These consultancy services will also
include inspection visits during the defects liability period. MONE will participate in the final site
inspection and handing-over of completed activities, but will not have responsibility for the inspections and
the issuing of instructions for making good any defects. The consultants will be directly answerable to
PCC, but collaborate closely with the provincial education directorates. A three-level indicator-based
reporting structure (supervisors to construction management, construction management to PCC, and PCC
to MONE and the provincial education directorates) will be developed and adopted. PCC will provide
quarterly (interim) indicator-only reports to the Bank.
*      Improved Basic Education Quality. The ICT component of the Basic Education Project will be
implemented by the Ministry's General Directorate for Educational Technologies (EGITEK), with support
of consultants. New ICT activities and the continued ICT activities from the first phase of the APL will
also be implemented by EGITEK under the second phase of the APL with support from consultants.
- 16 -



*      Delivery of Basic Education Programn  The training component under the Project will be
implemented by the respective line units of the Ministry - basic education, teacher training, preschool
education and special needs education, etc.- and for nonformal education of mothers in early childhood
development, by the Mother and Child Foundation, and all activities financed by the second phase of the
APL will be under the coordination of the PCC.
*      Project Implementation Support. Diring the first phase of the APL, project management,
financial management, procurement and preparation of withdrawal applications for the Project were carried
out by the PCC, based upon inputs from the respective line units of the MONE and the provinces. Since
the Project had some problems in these areas, the World Bank advised MONE that some technical
assistance in procurement, financial management and project management was needed in the PCC for
improving performance and timeliness for the second phase of the APL. Agreement has been reached that
additional expertise will be in place in the PCC before commencement of implementation of the second
phase of the APL. Further technical assistance will be provided regarding ICT, Reporting and
Communication, Construction Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).
*      Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation of the Monitoring and Evaluation component of the
Project will be coordinated with the participating line units (Education Research and Development
Departmeht (ERDD) and the Ministry's Planning, Research, and Coordination Council (APK)) by the
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the PCC. Evaluation studies for the second phase of the APL will be
carried out under competitive contracts, and PCC will report the results of the evaluations and assessments
to the World Bank. Two annual reviews (one based on annual stalistics and another based on evaluation
studies) will be presented and discussed involving both the MONE's senior staff and the World Bank.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
As earlier agreed, this operation is proposed as an APL, owing to the scale of the Project and its
evolutionary nature. The PAD for the first phase of the APL had stated that "the second phase of the APL
is expected to finance the provision of textbooks to schools in low-income areas around large cities (
gecekondu areas), school construction and upgrading, the expansion of computer literacy instruction, and
further training of basic education personnel." The construction of new basic schools under the special,
streamlined procedures that were allowed under the 1997 Basic Education Law is producing impressive
results. Under the first phase of the Program, the Ministry, using budget resources, provided 796,000
complete sets of textbooks to basic education students in 36 provinces of the countly. It will continue to
provide textbooks to children in need under the second phase of the Program. The second phase of the APL
will also finance formal preschool education, nonfonnal education of mothers in early childhood
development and the education of children with special needs. While preschool education was planned to
be financed, the education of children with special needs is a new area of activity. However, given the 268
special education schools, the special education classes, inclusive education and guidance services, serving
36,000 students around the country, the Bank considers this an important area to support.
Given the impressive achievements under the Basic Education Program; the problems with
implementation using Bank guidelines; the changes in the new procurement law in Turkey moving this
closer to the Bank's procurement standards; the conmmitment of Government to maintaining education's
share of GNP at 4.25 percent; and the fact that the Government has managed to protect MONE's share
- 17 -



during the recent economic crises; the monitoring and evaluation instruments in place now in Turkey; and
the desirability of establishing a dialogue bringing global lessons to bear on Turkey's educational problems
rather than a dialogue on procurement and administration issues; the Bank team considered and explored
the possibility of providing direct budget support to assist implementation of the Basic Education Program.
However, it was considered that a mid-stream redesign was likely to delay the project further.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
During the first phase of the APL, there were a number of delays in the procurement of ICT
hardware and software, attributable both to the MONE and to inadequate post-review by the Bank.
However, once contracts were signed, delivery and installation of ICT hardware and software progressed
rapidly, such that almost all of the first-phase ICT classrooms were equipped and in operation by the end of
the 1999/2000 school year. The care which went into preparation and review of the ICT hardware and
software technical specifications and bidding documents during the first phase of the APL is expected to
lead to much smoother and faster procurement of ICT hardware and software during the second phase of
the APL.
Procurements of other items, particularly International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for educational
materials for rural schools, took a long time. This experience has provided lessons for both the Bank and
the Government's PCC. In particular, items to be procured under ICB for the second phase of the APL are
the subject of considerable discussion in regard to the importance of the items, the suitability of the items
for ICB and the likely outcomes. In addition, the PCC is being strengthened with technical assistance in
- 18 -



procurement by hiring two procurement specialists (and also financial management and project
management specialists).
MONE carried out monitoring and evaluation of the first phase of the APL effectively, but under a
quite different arrangement than that foreseen at appraisal. It involved limited use of consultants, and
relied upon documentation of quantitative results generated through the MONE's pernanent documentation
system, and a consultative process with provinces in addition to feedback through formal survey
instruments. This approach will be developed and fine-tuned for this second phase of the APL.
The experience in implementing the Monitoring Response Facility under the first phase of the APL
showed that the communities and schools with the greatest educational needs tend to need close assistance
in identifying their needs and in developing proposals that are feasible and responsive to their needs. Rather
than having an unconstrained solicitation of proposals, the implementation tearn found that it is preferable
to pre-identify target areas on the basis of objective indicators of educational needs, and then to work
intensively with communities and schools in the targeted areas to develop viable subprojects which can be
supported under the fund. Once the concept and process are well understood, the schools which are
successfully implementing subprojects can help other schools in the target area to develop proposals
through a similar process. This approach has been used to develop new subprojects under the first phase of
the APL and is yielding good results. However, owing to the lack of sound entities .to receive and manage
Government funds at the local level, MONE decided not to include sitnilar subcomponents in the second
phase of the APL.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Ministry, the Govemrnent, and the public remain strongly committed to the Basic Education
Program, as evidenced by the continued heavy commitment of public resources and private, voluntary
contributions to the Program, and the prominent role of the Program in the Government's overall
development strategy. In 2002, for example, the Istanbul Stock Exchange is funding construction of 87
basic education schools. In addition, Government has committed itself to maintaining education's share of
GNP at 4.25 percent and has managed to protect education during the recent economic crisis. In
preparation for the second phase of the APL, Government established a coordination group under a Deputy
Undersecretary to prepare the plans and identified a small team of people to work full time on the
preparation together with the PCC. In addition, MONE convened a four-day workshop on project
management and LogFrame issues. MONE is also planning to organize training to enhance planning and
implementation capacity.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
MONE's very large school construction program -- involving expenditures of well over US$1
billion since 1998 - incorporated the improved school construction norms developed with Bank support
under the Basic Education Pilot Project. The Bank's involvement in the first phase of the APL in support
of the Basic Education Program helped ensure that the Program benefited from international experience --
particularly, in the computer education activities and the development of technical specifications for
educational materials for rural schools. It also helped ensure that the needs of the most educationally
deprived areas received the special attention that they need. The same benefits of Bank involvement will
apply during the second phase of the Project. In addition, the Bank's work on early childhood development
is expected to provide insights which will guide MONE's work in preschool and for Mother and Child
interventions to be supported under the second phase of the APL.
Separately, the World Bank Institute tailored its flagship Educational Reform Course for Turkey
- 19 -



and delivered two modules in Ankara. This was very well received. Bank staff have also assisted in
identifying international experience relevant to Turkey and assisted MONE to gain from these experiences
through study visits and through bringing in technical assistance to Turkey.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
* Other (specify)
The actions to improve the quality and relevance of basic education under the Basic Education
Program are a crucial part of the Government's strategy to raise the qualifications and competitiveness of
Turkey's labor force. The research evidence based on both macro- and micro-level data in Turkey confirms
the major contribution of expanded basic education to aggregate economic performance and personal
earnings. The importance of expanded basic education coverage as an instrument of poverty alleviation in
Turkey has been documented in the recent Living Standards Study (Report No. 20029-TU). Rates of
return for education quality improvement are intrinsically more difficult to estimate than for expansion of
enrollments. Nevertheless, there is evidence of significant gains to improved quality of basic education. A
recent analysis of the benefits of computer literacy training, based on observed eamings differentials for
computer-literate and non-computer-literate workers and on the cost of employer-provided training,
estimates a very high benefit/cost ratio for the computer literacy investments under the Program.
Evaluations of home-based preschool education programs in Turkey have documented significant and
enduring benefits in terms of improved school attendance and school performance.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
Fiscal Impact:
The economic crisis which hit Turkey in late 2000 and intensified following a further shock in
February 2001, resulted in a 9.4 percent drop in GNP and continued high inflation of 68 percent in 2001.
Despite a commitment by the Government to keep education expenditures at 4.25 percent of GNP under the
ongoing adjustment program, the economic downturn of 2001 resulted in a 3 percent drop in the Ministry
of Education's overall budget in real terms and in a drop in basic education expenditures of almost 15
percent in 2001. Similarly, revenue collection from taxes (Law 4306) earmarked to fund the basic
education expansion program dropped by about 40 percent in real terms in 2001 and may drop further in
2002. As a result, the Government had to significantly curtail its classroom expansion program, with the
result that only an estimated 10,000 additional classrooms will be built during the ongoing school year,
compared to annual construction of between 20,000 to 26,000 new classrooms prior to the crisis.
The economy is, however, expected to recover under the IMF and World Bank supported
programs. GNP is projected to grow at 3 percent in 2002, followed by a 5 percent increase in the two
following years. As a result of the Government's commitment to keep education expenditures at 4.25
percent of GNP, the Ministry of Education's budget for 2002 foresees an increase of 12 percent in real
terms, with a substantial increase in the budget for basic education. In tandem with recovery in economic
production and a substantial reduction in inflation, revenues from taxes earmarked for education are
- 20 -



expected to increase by over 15 percent. However, a further substantial increase in the number of students
to be enrolled in basic education over the next few years, the Government's ambitious plan to substantially
reduce the number of students per class in the coming three years, and the increased emphasis to be placed
on pre-school education will require substantial additional resources. Government funds alone will not
suffice to finance this program, even under the most optimistic projection scenarios. A substantial financing
gap is expected to occur, particularly in the ongoing and the following two school years. The Government
plans to finance this gap with the help of external sources and private donations.
3. Technical:
In approving the first phase of the APL, the Board also delegated to Regional management the
responsibility for approving a second phase of the APL in support of the Basic Education Program, upon
confirmation that the first phase of the Government's Program as implemented is consistent with the
Program as agreed by the Board, and upon substantial fulfillment of seven trigger actions:
*   Sign contracts or otherwise arrange for the provision of a basic package of educational materials,
satisfactory to the Bank, to all rural schools.
*   Contract for and achieve approximately 30 percent completion of facilities upgrading for about
200 village schools in five designated provinces.
*   Implement the agreed program of in-service training for teachers, school principals, and inspectors.
*   Carry out the agreed monitoring and social assessment program, including the basic education
public information campaign.
*   Develop the school infrastructure program for the second phase of the Program according to
criteria satisfactory to the Bank.
*   Finalize specifications and bidding documents for the second phase of information technology
procurement, as agreed with the Bank.
*   Disburse or commit at least 60 percent of the first phase of the APL.
A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) team first met on December 5 and 6, 2000. The Review
Panel found that the Project is being implemented in a manner that is consistent with the Ministry's
statement of intent at the outset of the Project. The Review Panel's overall conclusion was "that the spirit,
if not the letter, of the triggers has for the most part been met and that the project should move to Phase II,
principally because of the progress in meeting the basic goals of the Project." Subsequently, following a
full supervision mission in January and February 2002, the QER team confirmed that six of the seven
triggers were met: the seventh, sign contracts or otherwise arrange for the provision of a basic package of
educational materials, satisfactory to the Bank, to all rural schools, was not fully met. Subsequently, the
Regional Operations Committee approved appraisal and negotiations based on the progress towards
meeting this trigger and a Government action plan to meet it fully. The QER Panel also recommended that
the second phase of the APL include several actions to provide for more satisfactory monitoring and
evaluation of Project outcomes during the second phase. These recommended actions have been
summarized in a QER Follow-Up Action Plan, which has been discussed and agreed with the MONE.
- 21 -



These actions are included in the Key Performance Indicators (Annex 1).
4. Institutional:
Implementation arrangements for the second phase of the APL will involve the same institutional roles for
the implementing entities that they are performing currently under the first phase of the APL. PCC, guided
by the new Service Directives, will work more collaboratively with the MONE central line units, provincial
directorates, Project Steering and Executing Committee (PSEC) and Provincial Project Management
Services (PPMS) Units. Currently, PCC is being strengthened by recruiting four long-term national
consultants in Project Management, Financial Management and Procurement Management(2). Other
consultants will be hired as needed for specific tasks. Reporting and communication capacity of the PCC
and other related line units and provincial directorates of the Ministry will be increased to enable
preparation and submission of quarterly and/or semi-annual reports, holding regular monthly progress
meetings with the related units involving in implementation, coordination and decision making.
4.1 Executing agencies:
MONE's related central line units (Primary Education General Directorate, Preschool Education General
Directorate, Special Education, Guidance and Counseling Services General Directorate, Education
Technologies General Directorate, Apprenticeship and Non-formal Training General Directorntc
Education Research and Development Department, In-service Training Department, Board of Education,
and Research, Planning and Coordination Council) and provincial directorates will execute the project with
the help of the PCC and responsible Deputy Undersecretary and other high level management.
4.2 Project management:
PCC will be responsible for coordinating the Project activities between related central Ministry units and
provincial directorates. Implementation arrangements for the second phase of the APL will involve the
same institutional roles for the implementing entities that they are performing currently under the first
phase of the APL. Although there were initial delays in implementing the first phase of the APL,
implementation performance has improved and is now satisfactory.
4.3 Procurement issues:
MONE has been involved in managing four World Bank projects and the PCC was established during
implementation of first phase of the APL to coordinate and support implementation of all activities. PCC
has six procurement specialists and these manage all procurement on behalf of the World Bank. General
Directorates and Departments within MONE prepare technical specifications, terms of reference etc and
evaluate technical aspects of proposals within their field of activity. In an effort to address some of the
procurement problems under the first phase of the APL, PCC is hiring two experts in procurement to guide
the procurement work and additional training is being provided for all procurement staff as part of the
second phase of the APL. In addition, PCC has developed a detailed procurement plan in consultation with
line units and Bank staff and this document reflects the lessons leamed during the first phase of the APL,
particularly in regard to procurement of educational materials, in-service training, and ICT equipment.
4.4 Financial management issues:
An assessment of the financial management arrangements for the Project was undertaken between
- 22 -



December 1-8, 2000 and the assessment was updated during appraisal to determine whether the financial
management arrangements for the project are acceptable to the Bank. It was concluded that the financial
management arrangements for the Project satisfy the Bank's minimum requirements. The detailed financial
management assessment include Annex 6b of this PAD. The identified financial risks for this Project are
the following:
Country financial management risk - the draft CFAA identified major weaknesses in the Turkish public
and private financial accountability. To strengthen accountability, the Project will be controlled and
accounted for by the PCC.
Project financial management risk - this Project will involve a large number of transactions. It is essential
that the PCC financial management staff have experience both in financial management and World Bank
procedures as they are currently implementing the first phase of the APL. Also the staffing level of the
Financial management unit will be further strengthened with the recruitment of a financial management
expert.
Counterpart funds availability risk - the Project will support the Governments overall Basic Education
Program. Law No. 4306 of August 18,1998 on "Primary Education, National Education, Apprenticeship
and Vocational Training, Organization and Duties of Ministry of National Education" gives the Ministry of
National Education the right to increase parts of the value addedd tax (VAT) as a contribution from the
population to support the Basic Education Program. The counterpart funds will be made available from the
funds accumulated from these contributions. For the whole Program the total projected domestic financing
will be US$12.86 billion for the period between 2001-2005. The counterpart funding for this Project is
estimated to be about US$57 million. Allocation of these counterpart funds will be made annually within
the Ministry's budget.
5. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
Although the Project is very large, no significant environmental risks are foreseen, in view of the highly
dispersed nature of the Project. Environmental standards for safety, waste disposal, use of hazardous
materials, esthetics and other aspects of the school construction program are codified in a Handbookfor
Basic Education School Buildings which was developed with Bank assistance in preparation for the
Program. These standards have been reviewed by the Bank team, and found satisfactory. MONE has
confirmed that no involuntary resettlement will occur under the Project, and has instructed all of the
provincial administrations, in identifying sites for new schools under the Project, to select only sites which
are vacant public lands owned by the Ministry or the Treasury. Given the urgency with which the
Govemment aims to complete the physical infrastructure for the Program, the Ministry is committed to
avoiding land acquisition as this would require extensive time for legally required consultations and court
decisions. Where private contributions are made for school buildings, MONE, from its own funds, will pay
private individuals who will contribute their vacant land for school building purposes, in accordance with
the laws of Turkey. With regard to the refurbishment and renovations of the schools and other learning
facilities, the govemment has prepared an Environmental Management Plan, which the PCC will ensure is
carried out.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
- 23 -



The rehabilitation of schools could result in significant levels of construction waste. The Ministry of Labor
and Social Security provides standards for construction materials and workers' health and safety. Solid
waste must be disposed in accordance with Turkish Solid Waste Control Regulations of the Ministry of
Enviromnent. There will also be an increase in demand for drinking water. Drinldng water supplied at the
refurbished schools financed under the Bank project should meet the standards laid down by the Turkish
Standards Institution. The Ministry of National Education will collaborate with other government agencies
to conduct the monitoring and evaluation work.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: Sent to Infoshop - March 29, 2002
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
The Ministry of National Education has and will work with other government agencies, school authorities,
local communities to ensure full understanding of the Project and the environmental impact on the
cormmunities. The affected communities will be informed about the schedule, including the details of
quantities of waste.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
The Ministry of National Education will ensure the Environmental Management Plan is carried out fully.
Together with other govenmment agencies, the PCC will conduct regular monitoring visits to the areas that
are affected by the refurbishment and renovations.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The Government's Program explicitly aims at enrolling all eligible children, thereby improving the access of
low-income households to eight-year basic education. To the extent that low household income is a
constraint to school attendance, the Govermnents Program also aims to improve school attendance by
providing free textbooks and school uniforms to children from these households. Because of the link
between perceived school quality and school attendance, the various initiatives under the Bank's Project to
improve the quality of basic education - including rural school rehabilitation and the provision of
educational materials to poorly equipped schools -- are also expected to contribute to improved school
attendance. The gains which the Program is achieving in school attendance have particularly benefited
girls and the children of low-income households, because it is girls and children from low-income
households who are most likely not to attend school. The Ministry is carrying out and will continue to
carry out promotional activities which help maintain public support for and compliance with the Program.
In addition, the Social Risk Mitigation Project is providing education grants to mothers from low-income
households with children enrolled in basic education. Up to US$8 a month is provided for enrolled children
who attend school regularly and do not repeat a grade more than once.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
- 24 -



Social assessment contributed to the design of the Basic Education Program. It is playing an important role
in implementation of the Program and in the design of the second phase of the Program. A beneficiary
assessment commissioned by the Bank helped document the constraints to girls' school attendance, and
influenced the design of the Basic Education Pilot Project which was carried out under the National
Education Development Project, as well as of the Basic Education Program. During the preparation of the
Program, the Ministry, the Bank, and other donors consulted widely with a range of education stakeholders,
including school administrators, teachers, students, local governments, local representatives of central
government as well as the media. The Ministry maintained these consultations under the implementation of
the first phase of the Program, and will continue to do so under the second phase. Late in 1999 and early in
2000, the Ministry carried out a series of regional meetings to assess public views of centralized bussing
schools and to solicit recommendations to make boarding schools more effective. The findings and
recommendations of these consultations have influenced the design of the second phase of the Program -
including the decision to carry out rural school rehabilitation on a larger scale. The evaluations which the
Ministry has commissioned under the first phase of the APL will add further valuable information on how
the Program is affecting and is perceived by stakeholders.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
The Ministry has requested NGO involvement in the implementation of the nonformal early child
development component of the second phase of the APL. lhe project design is expected to support NGO
partnerships through contracting the Mother and Child Foundation to implement the nonformal education
of mothers in early childhood development. During the second phase of the APL they will extend their
activities to all provinces in Turkey.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The Monitoring and Evaluation component and the Ministry's ongoing management information system
will continue to monitor social development outcomes of the Program during the second phase, and to
provide feedback to help fine-tune the Program as implementation progresses.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The Monitoring and Evaluation component and the Ministry's ongoing management infonnation system
will continue to monitor social development outcomes of the Project/Program during the second phase,
including participation of girls, children from low-income families, and by region, and to provide feedback
to help fine-tune the Project/Program implementation.

and vegetation, and heating systems.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Among the critical risks for continuing successful implementation of the Basic Education Program,
the most important sustainability risk results from the need for continued budget support to maintain
implementation of Program interventions at the intended levels. As shown in the expenditure projection in
Section C, above, total investment and recurrent budget needs for the Program -- including teacher salary
costs, by far the largest single item -- amount to over US$10 billion over the next three years. The US$300
million resources from the second phase of the APL will make only a very modest contribution to these
total financing needs. Government has provided assurances that it will provide the necessary budget
resources - 4.25 percent of GNP - to implement the program effectively.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting the failure of critical assumptions found in the fourth column of Annex 1):

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
TURKEY: Second Basic Education Project
By Component:
Project Component 1 - US$133.09 million
Bank financing US$11237 million
Improved Basic Education Coverage
Basic School Renovation is included under the Improved Basic Education Coverage component because
more attractive and more functional rural schools and teacher housing units have been found to be an
important factor in inducing better school attendance and better teacher retention. In addition, provision of
better facilities for preschool education for children from low-income families will encourage these families
to send their children to basic education schools. This component includes, in addition to basic school
renovation and extension, preschool classroom construction in existing basic schools as well as
rehabilitation and extension of schools for children with special needs.
Basic School Renovation and Extension (Estimated loan financing US$ 98.85 million)
The second phase of the APL will rehabilitate and extend about 1,100 basic education schools in
rural and low-income urban areas. Many of the schools to bc renovated during Phase II will be
rural five-year basic education schools. (The estimated average costs at appraisal of small rural
schools was US$15,000 and of 'bussing' schools US$30,000.) This activity will also include the
general renovation and construction of new dining hall facilities at larger 'bussing' schools
(estimated at US$65,000 per school), and rehabilitation of eight-year regional boarding schools
and part-time boarding schools (estimated at US$200,000 average cost per school). On average 6
rural schools will be selected for renovation in each of the 81 provinces. In the metropolitan
provinces, five-year basic education schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu
areas), will be selected for rehabilitation, with prior approval from the Bank. The actual number
of schools selected in each province will vary in direct proportion to the level of poverty of each
province, as identified by the State Planning Organization. Rehabilitation and extension will be
carried out to the school facility standards that were agreed and applied for similar activities under
Phase I.
Preschool Classroom Construction (Estimated loan financing US$6.56 million) In addition, 300
preschool classrooms will be constructed at existing basic education schools (at an average
estimate cost at appraisal of US$ 21,000 per classroom).
Rehabilitation and Extension of Schools for Children with Special Needs (Estimated loan
financing US$4.64 million) Forty schools for children with special needs will be renovated
(estimated at US$ 45,000 each) and additional facilities will be constructed at 20 existing schools
(estimated at US$135,000 each).
Finally, Consultancy services (Estimated loan financing US$2.81 million) for supervision and
management of renovation and new construction works will be used to support PCC and the
provincial education directorates to ensure quality and progress of implementation.
Project Component 2 - US$196.31 million
Bank financing US$165.45 million

Improved Basic Education Quality
This component comprises four sub-components: ICT, Educational Materials Provision, Preschool
Education and Special Needs Education. These sub-components are described below:
ICT. (Estimated loan financing, US$154.60 million) USS93.84 million for ICT classrooms;
US$38 million for instructional software; US$20 million for civil works, and US$7 million for
an educational portal and decision support system, and US$200,000 for continuation of the
ICT monitoring and evaluation study). This subcomponent extends the Ministry's ongoing
effort to equip ICT classrooms in large, eight-year basic education schools based upon a policy
objective to provide computer literacy to all teachers and students. ICT classrooms are now
installed in 2,802 basic education schools under the first phase of the APL. The second phase
of the APL will provide ICT classrooms in an additional 3,000 schools (4,002 classrooms).
Activities under the program include: countrywide provision of ICT classrooms to ensure equal
access to technological capabilities and connectivity regardless of geography (65 percent of the
3000 basic education schools are in sub-provinces and rural areas); expanding access and use
of the Internet, and improved monitoring and evaluation of computer literacy achievements.
While attitude surveys of parents, teachers, and administrators were conducted under the first
phase of the APL on the use of the ICT classrooms, a formal evaluation on the use of ICT in
the schools is being implemented. It will examine five key areas of ICT use: in-service teacher
training;formator selection, training and operational duties; ICT classroom utilization by
formators and classroom teachers; classroom teacher ICT usage; role of the principal in
encouraging ICT usage; and ICT basic skills audit of teachers and students. The results of this
evaluation will be used in fine-tuning ICT activities during the Program. Also, the evaluation
will be conducted regularly in the second phase of the APL. In addition a consultancy
assignment will be undertaken to integrate ICT more effectively into classroom teaching and
learning.
Under the first phase of the APL, MONE finalized bidding documents for equipping the ICT
classrooms, and for procurement of off-the-shelf instructional and office software for the ICT
classrooms (including some instructional software that was unavailable for the 2,802 schools
in the first project). This was a trigger for moving to the second phase of the APL. The ICT
classrooms are now equipped with servers, personal computers, multimedia instructional
software, Internet access, and overhead projectors. The configuration and amount of
equipment varies depending on the size of the school. Under the first phase of the APL, three
types of schools have been configured with ICT classrooms, and this will continue under the
second phase of the APL. As with the first phase of the APL, administrative offices and
teachers' rooms will also be equipped. The selection of basic education schools to be equipped
with ICT classrooms under the second phase of the APL has followed the same process and
criteria as in the fist phase of the APL. The list of schools has been agreed with the Ministry.
Implementation of the classrooms is planned during the 2003-2004 school year.
The first phase of the APL provided training to students and in-service training for teachers
andformators in ICT use and applications, aimned at computer literacy only. The second phase
of the APL will include this objective in the next 3,000 schools, and attempt to measure it, as
well as look at the Intemet as an alternative way of individualized learning, distributing both
curricula and extra-curricula content, and allowing for interaction through e-mail between
teachers and pupils and between pupils. A key feature of this approach will be to develop a
Web-based portal as on online entry point to a comprehensive array of information and
-41 -



services for teachers,formators, administrators, students and the wider commnunity associated
with the Basic Education Program. The portal will contain educational content such as lesson
plans, online interactive curriculum content, an archive of past examinations and a wide range
of e-learning content. It will provide a range of communication services to teachers and
students to allow them to share infornation and to discuss topics of interest in a secure and
supportive environment. The portal will also contain materials of relevance to adult learners,
particularly those participating in after-school computer literacy activities. It is envisaged that
the portal will be developed in such a way as to facilitate its expansion after the completion of
the second phase of the APL. Consulting services for the portal will be initiated by EGITEK
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
MONE is a very large organization with a variety of information systems and it needs to
strengthen educational management information and analysis for this and subsequent phases of
the Basic Education Program. In order to improve MONE's information management capacity
and support ongoing educational management information system development, the project will
support an investigative study for a Decision Support System (DSS).
One lesson of the first phase of the APL was that greater integration and coordination needs to
take place between civil works contractors and computer equipment suppliers. Many hardware
suppliers ended up carrying out additional civil works, such as repairing furniture and moving
power sockets in order to install the computers. The fact that multiple contractors were
involved in preparing the ICT classrooms under the first phase of the APL led to confusion
within the school as to who was responsible when problems arose with power and wiring,
preparation of the ICT classroom (floors, painting etc.), furniture installation, air conditioning
and additional security features. During the second phase of the APL, civil works to ICT
classrooms will be part of the ICT supply and installation contract. This consultancy will
comprise two components, first supervision of civil works and second supervision of goods and
their installation. The quality of the civil works will be checked, where necessary corrected,
and approved before the equipment will be delivered and installed. Subsequently, the quantity
and quality of installed equipment will be checked in addition to their correct configuration.
The second phase of the APL will begin to engage students and teachers more fully with use of
the Intemet for pedagogical purposes. Under the first phase of the APL, 2,802 Basic Education
schools were provided with Intemet connectivity via dial-up modem for one year. Once
provision of Internet services to the schools--both Intemet Service Provider (ISP) and dial-up
costs--expired, the schools had to pay the annual ISP charges and ongoing call charges if they
wished to use the Internet in the ICT classroom. The majority of schools did not re-sign a
contract with their ISP. Many schools have had problems paying recurrent telephone costs.
Connectivity, via normal dial-up, is slow. Under APL II Intemet connectivity will be provided
for three years to the schools. At the same time, MONE is looking into options for higher
bandwidth connectivity such as leased line or satellite connections. MONE is keenly aware of
the situation in which most schools cannot use the Internet because they cannot afford the
telephone bill and that more robust connectivity is required for pedagogical uses. For FY03,
MONE will deploy its best resources to include resources for recurrent Intemet costs for the
7,000 ICT classroom schools and the 22,854 rural schools under the first phase of the APL.
And a Joint Working Group of the Ministries of National Education and of Transportation is
examining the costs and feasibility of other telecommunications infrastructure for all schools.
If then all savings in the procurement of ICT hardware and software for 3,000 BEP schools
- 42 -



during the second phase of the APL, these could be used to support broadband Internet
connectivity. The Bank will be willing to consider utilizing any savings to support MONE's
efforts to provide affordable and stable Internet access under the Project.
Educational Materials Provision. (Estimated loan financing US$3.62 million) The first
phase of the APL is financing the provision of a simple package of educational materials to all
30,000 rural basic education schools. The second phase of the APL will extend that initiative
to 4,000 schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas), 800 pre-school
classes and 1,340 schools serving children with special needs. The materials to be provided for
each rural and schools in gecekondu areas have been determined by MONE and the PCC
based on deficiencies in educational materials in relation to Ministry norms for reading books,
reference books, maps, and other basic educational materials. The materials have also been
deternined on the basis of procurement problems identified in the first phase of the APL This
activity is progranmmed for implementation during the initial year of Phase II implementation,
and will provide basic educational materials in accordance with the available resources.
Materials for preschools have been determined by MONE and a final list is being agreed with
the World Bank. Again, this list will be based on educational needs and ease of procurement.
Finally, the identification of education materials for the education of children with special
needs is a highly specialized and technical undertaking. MONE is developing its list in
consultation with World Bank experts and will utilize international shopping to procure these
materials.
Preschool Education and Nonformal Early Childhood Program. (Estimnated loan financing,
US$3.67 million) This activity will support both formal preschool education and nonformal
outreach programs supporting early childhood education for mothers of young children to help
expand coverage from the current low level of 11 percent of the 48-72 months cohort. The
main aim of this component is to develop preschool education to imnprove childrens'
performance in basic education. Priority will be given to parents and children in provinces
with low schooling rates and high imrnmigration. The formal preschool portion will include
facilities construction and furnishing, provision of educational materials, and preschool teacher
training in order to expand and upgrade the preschool education programs that are offered
within basic education schools or in free-standing public preschools. The outreach portion
will support an' NGO partnership in implementing nonformal early childhood education which
will extend these programs throughout the country.
Special Needs Education (Estimated loan financing, US$3.79 million). Special education in
Turkey is intended to integrate students with special needs into society and to provide them
with an occupation by meeting their education needs in the best way. Turkey provides special
education to children and young people in five groups: the sight impaired, the hearing impaired,
the physically impaired, the mentally impaired and children with long-term illnesses. Children
and young people with multihandicap or emotional/behavioral problems do not get the same
support, and there is no training for teachers to deal with their problems. The capacity of the
special needs education in Turkey is limited and too few students get access to professional
help.
This activity will support the development of a comprehensive policy paper for special needs
education, including development of facilities, ICT equipment, educational materials and of
in-service training. Forty special schools will be renovated and additional buildings will be
constructed in 20 of the special schools for the mentally retarded.
- 43 -



Seventy special schools for those mentally retarded children capable of being educated and for
the hearing disabled will be equipped with 770 computers (11 per school) and the necessary
software to assist student learning. Half of the schools for the hearing disabled will organize
the computers in ICT classrooms, and the other special schools will place their computers in
regular classrooms, clusters of 2-3 in each room. Forty primary schools within hospitals will
be equipped with computers and printers.
All the schools for the visually impaired will be equipped with 900 Braille Typewriters and all
the schools for the hearing disabled will be equipped with a total of 65 group hearing devices.
One thousand three hundred and forty (1,340) classrooms, will be provided with educational
materials; 700 in special educational classes in regular primary schools and 640 in preschool
and primary classrooms in the special schools for the mentally retarded and in the schools for
the hearing disabled students.
In addition priority will be given to pilot interventions integrating students with special needs
into ordinary education. This in-school portion will include facilities, rehabilitation provision
of educational materials and training of teachers in classrooms receiving the integrated
students.
The evaluation of this component will involve assessing the utilization of the ICT and the
educational materials and an assessment of the in-service training. The evaluation of the ICT
and the educational materials will assess the number of users, the time spent, and the quality of
the use. This evaluation will also include the teachers skill and competence in using the ICT
for special educational purpose. The in-service training will be evaluated on the results of the
content-development of the different courses and how the training was delivered. This
evaluation will put emphasize on the uses made by participants of the training provided.
Project Component 3 - US$ 20.58 million
Bank Financing US$16.05 million
Delivery of Basic Education Program
This component comprises four subcomponents: In-service training for ICT; in-service training in
preschool education; inservice training in special needs education and mother and child education.
In-service Training for ICT (Estimated loan financing US$13.57 million) Under the second
phase of the APL, there will be a more structured approach to ICT in-service teacher training.
The revised program will focus on two areas--computer literacy and on integrating the existing
software and hardware into classroom teaching and learning activities. Terms of reference
have been finalized for a Turkish University or a private consultancy firm to work with the
appropriate MONE line units to design and deliver a set of ICT training materials to improve
ICT utilization. They will develop a range of inservice courses and accompanying materials to
improve the utilization of the existing ICT resources, such as educational and Office software,
the Intemet and hardware devices byformators and classroom teachers. This consultancy will
identify and develop online and offline materials for use for teachers, administrators and
formators.
- 44 -



The ICT training consultants (to be paid under the first phase of the APL), working with
EGITEK and the In-Service Training Department, will develop a range of materials including
printed teachers' manuals, CDs, television programs, and other online training materials. In
addition to developing the materials the consultants will deliver the in-service training to
teachers from ICT classroom schools (31,500), teachers from rural schools with ICT (22,280),
inspectors (3,000), school administrators (5,800), school formators (7,000) and master
formators (250). The consultants will develop customized courses for each group to meet their
varied needs.
In addition, to the ICT training provided by the consultants, MONE will continue to deliver
ICT in-service. Under first phase of the APL, MONE identified 250 master teachers, or
formators, to deliver in-service training to school basedformators, who in turn trained staff
within their own school. During the first phase of the APL master trainers were located in
their schools and could only offer training outside of school hours. Under second phase of the
APL, they will be located in in-service training centers at the provincial and sub-provincial
level. These master trainers will act as representatives of MONE and EGITEK in the local
regions by providing both pedagogical and technical assistance to schools with ICT
classrooms. With regard to in-service, the master trainers will coordinate and deliver local
ICT training to teachers in their region. Where possible, teachers will receive this training in
their own ICT classroom. Teachers from village schools, where the numbers of teachers is too
small to conduct cost-effective training, will also receive ICT training and it will be delivered
in teachers' guest houses by the master trainers.
A key component of MONE's in-service strategy will be the development of an e-leaming
portal (see Project Component 2). This portal will contain both pedagogical content and
e-learning training materials. The online training materials will include a range of courses for
master trainers, school based trainers, teachers and students, which can be completed in their
own time, either in school or at home. The portal will also facilitate the exchange of additional
training materials, such as Power Point presentations and training notes among trainers, while
also providing them with an effective communication platform for sharing ideas and resources.
Master trainers will receive annual intensive in-service training aimed at maximizing the use of
the ICT classrooms in the second phase. To help maintain incentives and to expose master
trainers to international best practice, MONE will offer study trips to the most dynamic and
competent master trainers. These study trips will allow Turkish teachers to observe best
practice in the area of ICT utilization so that they can bring these ideas home and apply them
in their own schools.
In-service training in preschool education (Estimated loan financing US$1.58 million) will
be provided for training of 4,500 pre-school teachers in order to expand and upgrade the
pre-school education programs that are offered within basic education schools or in
free-standing public preschools.
In-service training in special needs education (Estimated loan financing US$0.90 million)
will be provided for 7 days to regular teachers, teachers in special needs education, counselors,
administrators, inspectors, instructors and principals. This training will include different
topics for the different groups of professionals: information about students with different kind
of disabilities, teaching special education to these groups of students with special needs, use of
-45 -



measurement materials, innovation and management in special education.
Mother and Child Education - this activity will support outreach programs to help expand
nonformal early childhobd programs. The main aim of this component is to expand a network
of mother and child education programs in current 59 provinces to all (81) provinces of
Turkey. The main aim is to improve children's readiness at school entry. It is to be targeted to
rural areas and low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas) with low preschool
education coverage, high proportion of children from educationally deprived households -e.g.
households with illiterate parents and areas where children typically start school with little
proficiency in the Turkish language. A set of educational materials will be provided to
mother-child instructors and mothers. Information Education and Communication (IEC)
pamphlets, posters, and videos will be produced for dissemination to increase demand for these
services. The Ministry will collaborate with NGOs, such as MOCEF - in implementing the
mother and child education program throughout the country.
Project Component 4 - US$1.75 million
Bank financing US$1.43 million
Project Implementation Support
This component provides support to continue strengthening the Ministry's project implementation capacity
- particularly in the areas of project management, reporting and communication, procurement management
and financial management by the PCC. Under the first phase of the APL the Ministry elected not to use all
the resources that were initially provided for consultant implementation support, on the grounds that the
PCC had the capacity to implement the Project on a timely basis. However, in the course of implementing
the first phase of the APL, the Ministry agreed that there was a need to firther strengthen the PCC's
project management, procurement management and financial management and reporting and
communication capacity. Under the first phase of the APL four consultants in the areas of: project
management, procurement management (2) and financial management are being hired to support the PCC
during the last year of project implementation. The second phase of the APL provides for further
professional consultant support to complete the upgrading of the PCC's management capacity in the project
management, procurement, financial management and reporting and communication areas. Additionally,
under the second phase of the APL a budget for "Incremental Recurrent Expenditures" will be provided for
the PCC, to enable the PCC to implement its activities in a timely and efficient manner.
Project Component 5 - US$2.13 million
Bank financing US$1.70 million
Monitoring, Evaluation and Review
Under the first phase of the APL, the Ministry carried out monitoring and evaluation of the various
activities under the Basic Education Program through use of information from various sources. These
included: a) data from the State Institute of Statistics and the Council for Research, Planning and
Coordination; b) data from the Ministry's MIS system; c) results of student achievement testing; d)
systematic and consultative meetings with inspectors, provincial and sub-provincial directors of education;
and e) results from evaluation studies and feedback from surveys covering critical Program areas. In a
number of important areas, the Ministry used this feedback to refine the design of the Basic Education
Program as implementation progressed. Under the second phase of the APL, the Ministry will expand and
improve this monitoring and evaluation model. It will also disseminate the findings of monitoring and
evaluation more actively and make the information from the different monitoring, evaluation and review
activities accessible to all stakeholders in the education system (students, teachers, parents, inspectors and
-46 -



administrators from all levels, politicians, university staff involved in education, etc.).
Among other improvements, information on Program activities and outcomes will be publicized on the
Ministry's webpage. In addition, MONE will conduct regular dialogue between the levels of the system
(Ministry and the provinces, provinces and subprovinces, subprovinces and schools, principals and
teachers) and develop materials and measures to help teachers and administrative staff improve the quality
of education based on the monitoring, the student achievement testing and results of the evaluation studies.
Student achievement testing will be expanded and strengthened under the second phase of the APL, and the
results of these tests will be made available to the public on the Ministry's webpage. Using the Ministry's
own budget resources, the Education Research and Development Department (ERDD) will continue student
achievement testing in science, mathematics, social science and Turkish language in grades 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
By November 2002, the Ministry of National Education will have established a baseline for student
performance in these subject areas and for these grades. In 2002/2003, ERDD will extend the number of
achievement tests and pilot-test performance in computer literacy/e-learning and English language for the
same grade. ERDD will then organize an intemational symposium to evaluate the quality of their
achievement testing and evaluation studies. In order to strengthen the ERDD's capacity to carry out the
activities on student achievements, the second phase of the APL will finance equipment, training, study
tours and consultant services. In addition, Turkey, represented by ERDD, is participating in PISA - an
interational comparative study on student literacy in reading, mathematics and science conducted and
reported on every third year by OECD.
Under the first phase of the APL, the Ministry has carried out social, institutional, and economic evaluation
studies of basic education schools. The second phase of the APL will support an updating of these studies,
as well as specific studies on: a) the impact of expanded basic education school capacity on enrollments,
classroom crowding, and multiple-shift use of classrooms; b) the impact and effectiveness of ICT
integration in basic education; c) the impact of preschool education on basic education participation and
performance; d) evaluation/impact studies on efficiency of special needs education initiatives; e) impact
studies on in-service training activities that are to be implemented under Phase H; and f) OECD evaluation
of Basic Education in Turkey. The Ministry is committed to publicize the results of the evaluation studies
on their web site. Altogether, the informnation from the Project's monitoring indicators, results from the
national and international student achievement tests and the evaluation studies (Annex I), will provide
important feedback on the learning impacts of the sizeable investments under the Program.
Finally, MONE will organize two reviews of progress on implementation of basic education each year.
One of these reviews will examine achievements on a number of indicators of progress (to be selected).
The second will examine progress on one identified area of interest and on budget performance and plans.

Annex 4 Economic Analysis Update
TURKEY: Second Basic Education Project
Turkey's investment in its people through the provision of eight years of basic education instead of
five is likely to continue to benefit the country in a number of ways. Clearly, there will be benefits to the
economy. For example, a one-year increase in the average educational attainment of the labor force was
reported to be associated with a 0.21 percent increase in GDP. Clearly, also, Turkey's economic growth
within the broader European community is more likely to be achieved with a well-educated labor force.
There are also benefits to female basic education including lower fertility, and better nutrition and child
health. There are also significant social benefits such as improved social cohesion, a more informed
electorate and a broader appreciation of Turkey's position in a global economy. These benefits are likely to
be accelerated through the investment in computer education for basic education. In order to compete in
the global economy, it will be critical for Turkey's young people to have access to computer literacy and the
ability to utilize global information through the internet.
The economic analysis conducted for the first APL justified the investment in expanded basic
education on a number of grounds. First, cost-effectiveness analysis calculated the annual cost of a student
in different basic education schools, including the annualized costs of investment expenditures, salaries,
bussing maintenance and other costs and concluded that, while large schools were less costly, small schools
wete appropriate in some areas to encourage children's participation. The analysis conducted for the first
APL also examined the Benefit/cost ratios and concluded that there are continuing high rates of return to
basic education at the micro- and macro-levels. At the same time earnings of women who have completed
basic education were reported to be 52 percent higher than those who had not.
The analysis also examined the benefits of introducing computer literacy and concluded that the
estimated benefit/cost ratio was between 10.5 and 26.5 and the present net value of investment in ICT
education ranged from US$6.6 billion to US$16.6 billion. These benefits are unlikely to have changed over
the four years of implementation of the basic education program.
Finally, the analysis conducted for the first phase of the APL also examined the fiscal impact of the
investment in basic education (including the Bank's loan) and concluded that the additional incremental
costs would be over $200 million annually against the annual aggregate incremental recurrent costs of the
entire program of over US$1 billion annually. The analysts concluded that continued broad public support
for the program would be necessary in order to mobilize and sustain these additional resources. The
extension of the basic education law (4306) and the associated additional financing from 2000 to 2010 is
one indication of this support. Fiscal analysis conducted for the second APL (and reported on in the body
of the PAD) shows that the Government is committed to financing basic education and has the resources to
meet most of its needs. However, there is a financing gap which the loan and support from other external
financing agencies (including the EU) is expected to fill.
In conclusion, there continue to be compelling economic and social arguments for investing in basic
education in Turkey at this time.

- 56 -



(b) Post Review: The procurement documents for all other contracts will be subject to the Bank's post
review on a random basis, one in five contracts. Post review of the procurement documents will normally
be undertaken during the Bank supervision mission or as the Bank may request to review any particular
contracts at any time. In such cases, the PCC will provide the Bank for its review the relevant
documentation including bidding documents issued to the bidders, letter of invitation to quote, minutes of
bid opening, bid evaluation reports, copies of bid proposals, signed contracts etc. The post review will be
conducted by the Bank's Procurement Specialist. The outcome of the post review will be communicated by
the Bank to the PCC expeditiously.
V. Procurement Monitoring and Reporting:
The PCC will keep a complete and up-to-date record of all procurement documentation and relevant
correspondence in its files, which will be reviewed by the Bank staff during supervision missions. The
Procurement Plan for the Project will be prepared by the PCC and furnished to the Bank for its review and
approval in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The Procurement Plan,
which indicates the procurement arrangements, contract 'packaging, applicable procurement method,
scheduling of procurement process, estimated cost etc, will be updated annually by the PCC. All
procurements will be undertaken in accordance with the Procurement Plan and is attached this annex.
Monitoring reports on procurement progress will be submitted as part of progress reports on program
implementation. The report will include all information related with the completed, on-going and planned
contracts.
VI. Action Plan To Build Up The Agency's Capacity:
The following actions need to be taken in the order below:
- The procurement file containing the up to date procurement documents such as guidelines, templates of
procurement notices, standard bidding documents for the procurement of works and goods under ICB,
NCB, MW and IS/NS methods, standard request for proposal document for the consultants services,
standard consultants contracts for large and small assignments and for time based and lumps-sum
payments, evaluation report formats are prepared in hard copy and in electronic version on diskettes and
provided to the PCC staff during this capacity assessment. Although PCC are familiar with the Bank's
documents, the latest versions of the documents will be used in the new Project and PCC need to use these
versions for the preparation of procurement documents to be carried in the first year of the new Project.
The PCC will translate into Turkish the related procurement documents such as National Competitive
Bidding and Minor Works procurement documents and provide the translations to the provincial
directorates.
- PAS will organize a procurement familiarization seminar for the Project related staff including new PCC
staff and the staff from other related departments of the Ministry who will be potentially involved in
different aspects such as technical, financial, legal aspects of the Project. This seminar will serve to both
introduction of Bank's procurement procedures and updating their previous knowledge. The seminar will
be scheduled during the Project Launch Workshop to be held on September 2002.
- MONE will hire two experienced procurement consultant before loan implementation of the second phase
of APL. These two positions were advertised in March 2002 and it is expected to get these consultants in
place by May 2002. The procurement consultants will have at least 3 years experience in Bank financed
projects and will work very closely with the procurement staff of the PCC mainly for the preparation of
- 57 -



bidding documents for the large procurements. The CVs of the procurement consultants will be reviewed
and approved by the Bank.
- The Ministry and the Bank will create incentives for the procurement staff to encourage them to work
effectively and efficiently for the Project. In addition to the procurement training, the PCC staff will be
trained to improve their English speaking, reading and writing skills, since almost all of the large
procurements are carried out under ICB and all documentation and communications will be done in
English.
- In order to overcome the problems faced at the bid evaluation stage; qualified and experienced staff of the
Ministry, especially those who have some knowledge of the Bank's procurement and evaluation procedures
will be appointed as evaluation committee members. At the beginning of each procurement, evaluation
committee members will be appointed by the finalization of the bidding documents and they will start
reviewing and becoming familiar with the bidding document and evaluation methodology stipulated in the
bidding document Then, before the receipt of bids, PCC staff will meet with the evaluation committee
members to explain the Bank's evaluation methodology in detail.
- To avoid long delays the Ministry's intemal approval procedures will be reviewed and delegation of
approval authority up to certain amount will be considered.
- fhe existing electronic filing and electronic communication capacity of the PCC should be improved.

than US$400,000 equivalent per contract; (c) consulting contracts with firms, costing less than
US$100,000 equivalent each; (d) consulting contracts with individual costing less than US$50,000
equivalent each; (e) staff training costing less than US$15,000 each; and (f) incremental operating costs.
Full documentation in support of SOEs would be retained by the PCC for at least one year after the Bank
has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account was
made. This information will be made available for review during supervision by Bank staff and for annual
audits which will be required to specifically comment on the propriety of SOE disbursements and the
quality of the associated record-keeping.

Special Account. The GoT will open and maintain a Special Account in US dollars at the Central Bank
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The Special Account will be used following
procedures to be agreed with the Bank, and will have an authorized allocation of US$20.0 million.
Both the Deputy Undersecretary of MONE and the PCC Director are authorized to sign withdrawal
applications, with only one signature required. At the start of the Project, the initial deposit will be
limited to US$10.0 million, and the remaining portion of the authorized allocation will be requested

only after cumulative disbursements from the loan reach a level of US$60.0 million. The minimum
application size for payments directly from the Loan Account for issuance of Special Commitments is
20 percent of the Special Account authorized allocation.
During the first year of the Project, applications for replenishment of the Special Account will be
submitted to the Bank on a monthly basis, or when the balance of the Special Account is equal to about
half of the initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever comes first, and will include a
reconciled bank statement as well as other appropriate supporting documents. During the second and
third year, funds sufficient to cover the Project's needs for six months will be advanced to the Special
Account, provided the PCC has established the requisite financial management system and prepares
and submits to the Bank the appropriate PMRs.
Financial Manaeement
1.     Executive Summary and Conclusion
An assessment of the financial management arrangements for the Project was undertaken between
December 1-8, 2000 and the assessment was updated during appraisal to determine whether the financial
management arrangements for the Project are acceptable to the Bank.
Detailed financial management questionnaire is included in the Project files. A summary of the conclusions
are as follows:

2.     Summary Project Description
The second phase of the Basic Education Project, to be financed under the second APL would support a
continuation and extension of the activities supported under the first APL which promotes the objectives of
improved coverage, quality and relevance of basic education and the role of basic schools as a learning
resource for the community. In addition the second APL would support an expansion of preschool
education which is designed to help children from educationally deprived households succeed in basic

education as well as providing support to Special Needs Education.
3.     Country Issues
A country Financial Accountability Assessment for Turkey was carried out in 2001. The draft CFAA
report identified major weaknesses in the Turkish financial accountability, in both the public and the
private sector.
In view of this the draft CFAA concludes that to ensure Bank funds are used for purposes intended, ring
fenced financial management arrangements are more appropriate for the implementation of Bank- financed
investment projects, rather than relying upon government systems.

Risk mitigation strategy
Country financial management risk - the draft CFAA identified major weaknesses in the Turkish financial
accountability, in both the public and the private sector. To compensate for this all expenditures for the
Project will be controlled and accounted for by a separate unit within MONE (the Project Coordination
Center formed by the approval of the Minister of Education).
Project financial management issues are considered substantial as this Project will involve numerous
transactions. However all payment and accounting is centralized at the PCC. The PCC financial
management staff have experience both in financial management and in World Bank procedures as they are
currently implementing the first phase of the APL. Also the staffing level of the Financial management unit
will be further strengthened with the recruitment of a financial management expert.
Counterpart funds- the Project will support the Governments overall basic education program. There is a
special Law No. 4306 of August 18,1998 on the amendment of Primary Education, National Education,
Apprenticeship and Vocational Training, Organization and Duties of Ministry of National Education Laws
to increase the period of compulsory basic.education to 8 years. The law specifies collecting shares of
contribution to education in order to finance the Basic Education Program, which is a national program.
The counterpart funds will be made available from the funds accumulated from these contributions. Total
projected domestic financing will be US$12,867,306,271 for the period between 2001-2005 for the whole
program and the counterpart funds will be financed from this amount. The counterpart funding for this
project is mainly for value added tax and other local taxes and the total amount is about 57 Million USD.
Allocation of these counterpart funds will be made annually within the Ministry' s budget.
5.     Strengths and Weaknesses
The significant strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial management system
include: (i) the experience of the PCC and its Financial management unit of implementing Bank-financed
projects and satisfying Bank financial management requirements; and (ii) the unqualified audit reports and
positive management letters issued by project auditors (iii) the centralization of all payment and accounting
at the PCC in the project design.
There are no significant weaknesses of the Project financial management system.
6.    Implementing Entity
The implementation of the Project will be carried out by the Ministry of National Education central units
and provincial directories. Overall project coordination at the Central level will be carried out by the
Project Coordination Center (PCC) under direct responsibility of the Deputy Undersecretary responsible
for the PCC. Implementation follow up will be carried out by the PCC and annual project implementation
plans and procurement and financial projections will be prepared based on the implementation plan.
- 74 -



7.    Funds Flow
Regarding the disbursements from the Bank Loan, there will be one special account for the Project in US
Dollars and it will be held at the Central Bank of Turkey. Payments to the contractors, suppliers and
consultants , under all project components will be made from the special account with the authorization of
the PCC. Payments will be made directly from the loan account for amounts over 20 percent of the
authorized special account allocation.
Regarding the counterpart funds, the PCC will inform the General Directorate of Basic Education (GDBE)
to initiate payment of the counterpart contribution. The MONE GDBE will submit the payment
documents to the Ministry of Finance representative (Budget Department and Payment Office) in the
Ministry of Education. The payment to the contractors, suppliers and the consultants will be made directly
to them by the Ministry of Finance Payment Office. The MOF Payment office will provide monthly
payment information to the PCC.
The diagram presented below summarizes the flow of funds, relating supporting documentation and
reporting lines for BEPII.

8.     Staffing
The PCC comprises of 11 units, project management unit, project research and development unit,
education, training and documentation unit, information technologies unit, procurement unit, import and
customs unit, construction unit, financial management unit, monitoring and evaluation unit, monitoring
response facility unit and personnel and administrative affairs unit.
The PCC is led by the Project Director who has overall responsibility for the day to day implementation.
The PCC has a Financial Manager, who is responsible for the overall project financial management
maintenance of books of accounts for the Project, preparation and dissemination of financial statements and
FMRs and ensuring the timely audit of the Project. There are also three more staff working in the financial
management unit dealing with accounting and disbursement. The qualifications of the financial
management unit of the PCC are satisfactory for the implementation of the Project. However, considering
the additional workload from the new Project an additional financial management specialist will be
recruited to the PCC. This staff member will work together with the head of financial management unit in
coordinating work with the other units within the PCC as well as MONE departments, preparation of
annual budgets, preparation of the FMRs by using the software (therefore organizing the necessary
customization work) as well as other project related assignments. The existing financial management staff
will also get appropriate training in project financial management to enhance their skills. These training
programs will include attending courses about World Bank financial Management procedures both within
Turkey (the project launch workshop will include a session on financial management and will be given by
the FMS for the project) and overseas (like financial management courses conducted in ILO - ITC).
9.     Accounting Policies and Procedures
The project accounting will be maintained separately within the PCC and will comply with Intemational
Accounting Standards. The PCC has a computerized financial management information system used
currently for the first phase of the APL. The FMIS is capable of recording the project transaction in
accordance with respective components as well as disbursement categories and sources of funds. The chart
of accounts used for the first APL is adequate to properly account for and report on project activities and
disbursement categories. The FMIS facilitates using different modules for accounting of more than one
project, and the same FMIS will be used for the second phase of the APL. The system is also capable of
producing Financial Monitoring Reports. Customization of the existing software for the second phase of
the APL will be finalized by loan effectiveness.
The financing plan of the first phase of the APL included sources from the Government, Provincial
Administrations, IBRD and national donors. The Government contribution was the projected spending on
the whole Basic Education Program and APK (a unit of MONE) was in charge of reporting for counterpart
funds and PCC was in charge of accounting for loan funds. The communication between them was very
limited and that resulted in lack of financial statements for the whole program at the beginning. This has
improved during the life of the project and the PCC now obtains information on an annual basis. However
the information is not on a transactional basis.
The financing plan of the second phase of the APL is for the activities that will be financed under the
World bank loan and the government contribution is mainly taxes. The payment information for the
government contribution will be made available to the PCC every month on a transaction basis. It should
be made available to the PCC on a diskette to facilitate easy uploading to the FMS.
Accounting procedures are set out in detail in the Financial Management Manual for the Project. The
- 76 -



Financial Management Manual covers: (a) the financial management system of the Project including the
accounting and auditing policies; (b) the role of the financial management systems in the Project
implementation; (c) the accounting arrangements for the Project including the format and contents of the
project reporting; (d) the auditing arrangements; and (e) budgeting and planning.
10.    InternalAudit
The Ministry of National Education has an Internal Control department. The department generally carries
out investigations where irregularities are reported within any of the departments of the Ministry. Therefore
the PCC is not subject to regular internal audits.
11.    ExternalAudit
No significant issues have arisen in the audit of previous Bank-financed project implemented by MONE -
PCC.
The previous and current auditing arrangements and findings for the first phase of the APL are satisfactory
to the Bank and it has thus been agreed that similar audit arrangements will be adopted for BEP H. Annual
audits for the project accounts will be carried out in accordance with the "Guidelines for Financial
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World laDali". The audit reports will be in a format in
accordance with the "International Standards on Auditing". The audit reports will include a separate
opinion on the operation of the Special Account and on disbursements made on the basis of SOEs. The
audited financial statements including the audit of the special account and the SOEs will be sent to the
Bank within six months of the end of the Government's financial year.
The Project's financial statements will be audited by the Treasury Controllers in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and under TOR already cleared by the Bank.
12.    Reporting and Monitoring
The PCC will maintain records and will ensure appropriate accounting for the funds provided. Financial
statements will be prepared for the Project by the PCC. The FMRs will be prepared semi annually and will
be submitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end of the semester. The FMRs will be submitted
with a cover letter explaining the activities of the quarter and will include the following tables;
*      Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds by categories
*      Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds by Project Components
*      Special Account Statement
*      A detailed schedule for tracking disbursements against specific contracts for civil works, goods and
consultants services (The format of this report will cover construction progress by province with respect to
payments. This will require coordination between the construction supervisors, PCC construction unit and
the financial management unit. The data to be included in this report will be agreed during negotiations, the
format and integration of this to the financial management system will be dealt after negotiations)
*      Procurement reports
13.   Information Systems
The PCC has been using an accounting software for the second phase of the APL since November 2000
which is also used successfully by other PIUs in Turkey. All the staff in the Financial management unit
- 77 -



have been trained on the software. The system is capable of producing FMRs. The PCC has a maintenance
contract with the supplier firm till November 2001 and will work together with the supplier for the
customization work required to record the transactions under APL II as well as the preparation of FMRs
for the second phase of the APL.
14.    Impact of Procurement Arrangements
A procurement assessment of BEP II dated March 29, 2002 was performed by a Bank Procurement
Specialist and contained the following risk analysis: "Although the MONE has some experience in
managing and implementing Bank financed projects, they are not good at applying the Bank's procedures in
procurement yet, therefore the new Project is put in the high-risk category"
The impact of this procurement assessment is to increase the perceived risk associated with the Project's
financial management arrangements and therefore will be mitigated by an increased level of Bank
supervision.
15.    Action Plan
It is concluded that the financial management arrangements for the Project satisfied the Bank's minimum
requirements. There are however a number of actions needed to improve the processes:
Action                                    Deadline
1. Customization of the existing accounting  Effectiveness
software for APL H
2. Hiring of the FMS                      Effectiveness
16.    Supervision Plan
The customization of the financial management system for second phase of the APL will be monitored in
detail until loan effectiveness by the FMS. The FMRs for the Project will be reviewed on a regular basis
by the Project FMS and the results or issues will be followed up during the supervision missions. Financial
audit reports will be reviewed and issues identified will be followed up by the FMS. During the Bank's
supervision missions the Project's financial management and disbursement arrangements (including a
review of a sample of SOEs and movements on the Special Account) will be reviewed to ensure compliance
with the Bank's minimum requirements. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist
will assist in the supervision process.

Additional Annex 11: [Lefter of Sector Policy]
TURKEY: Second Basic Education Project
THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION
PRIVATE
April 10, 2002
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President,
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington D.C., 20433 U.S.A.
Letter of Sector Policy
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
This Letter of Sector Policy sets out the main features of the Government of Turkey's ongoing Basic
Education Program (BEP), gives information on our priorities and on the Basic Education Project
supported by the World Bank.
A comprehensive Education Reform, unprecedented in Turkish history, has been accomplished with the
Basic Education Program which went into effect in the educational year 1997-1998. My government is
deternined to continue the implementation of the Education Reform which aims to establish a
student-oriented education at all levels and in all types of education in compliance with the requirements of
our age and the society we live in, to prevent the exclusion of all individuals from the education process and
to improve the quality of vocational training for teachers and their employment conditions in the 21st
century.
Within the framework of the Education Reform, with the approval in August 1997 of the Basic Education
Law no. 4306, compulsory basic education was extended from 5 years to 8 years. The progress made in the
efforts to implement uninterupted eight year basic education, our achievements and the solid foundations
we have built, following the approval of the Basic Education Law have established a sound basis for
restructuring the secondary education system in Turkey.
Law no 4306 has not only extended compulsory basic education to eight years, but it has also mobilized
significant new resources to finance the investments needed in the field of education as a result of this
extension. The law also established a time-table for the application of the Program and streamlined
procedures to allow for swift action and implementation. Law no 4306, both reflected the determination of
the government in the field of education, and has received wide support from the public, because it has
realized the expectations of all segments of the Turkish society in the field of education. As a result of this
support, there has been an unprecedented outpouring of voluntary private cash and in-kind contributions
from the public and these contributions have been a considerable source for the investments envisaged
during the implementation of the Basic Education Program.
- 86 -



The Ministry of National Education aims to achieve the following objectives in basic education.
-  Increase school enrollnents to 100 %.
-  Irnprove quality of education
-  Bringing down the number of students per classroom to 30
-  Eliminate gradually the practice of combining classes in rural schools
-  To end double-shift teaching
The Need for Additional Financing
The Government has requested the World Bank's assistance in the form of an Adjustable Program Loan,
with a commitment of US$ 600 million in two phases, to support the Basic Education Program and this
request has been approved by the Bank's Board. Considerable progress has been accomplished in the
implementation of the first APL of US$ 300 million, launched in 1998 and named "the Bask Education
Project". Preparations have been largely completed to move to the second APL amounting to USS 300
millions.
The success of Turkey's Basic Education Reform has created an increasing interest in the international
arena. Over time, apart from the World Bank, other international institutions have also decided to provide
financial support to the implementation of the Basic Education Program. The European Union has decided
to finance a program in support of the Basic Education with a grant of 100 million Euro's. The
implementation of this program has started in 2002, and program implementation period will be 6 years.
The European Investnent Bank has also recently commnunicated its intention to provide loans to support
education programs in Turkey. Negotiations on these loans are at the initial stage.
implementation of the Basic Education Program
Since Basic Education Law No. 4306 has entered into force in August 1997, considerable progress has
been made towards the implementation of the objectives set out in the field of basic education, I have
referred to above. The Ministry of National Education has carried out a numnber of feasibility studies
during the preparation of the Program to define objectives and select activities, within this framework, key
stakeholders were consulted. In December 1997, a technical team was appointed for program preparation
and to coordinate the overall preparation of the Program in close collaboration with relevant line units and
provincial offices of the Ministry of National Education.
The shift to eight year compulsory basic education has required considerable investments for key inputs
such as schools, educational materials and teachers. Our priorities under the Program have been capacity
expansion to bring all children of school age into the system and to eliminate overcrowded classrooms.
Activities to Extend Basic Education
When Program activities started in 1997, largely due to economic reasons, participation of school age
children in mrual areas and in urban shanty-towns were not at the desired level. Furthermore, in rural areas
the enrollment rates for girls were much lower than those for boys, and the school attendance rate for girls
after the 5th grade was not satisfactory. The number of primaTy education schools available in these areas
were adequate, but high teacher turn-over due to difficult living conditions and, in some cases, security
concerns caused shortage in teachers. There was also a shortage of basic school capacity for 6-8 grades.
It was necessary to find a solution to this shortage and the solution to provide basic education to a large
- 87 -



number of students was sought through bussing or regional boarding primary education schools.
Construction of Classrooms.
Our first priority was to provide sitfficient capacity for the students who were not included in the basic
education system, and to reduce the number of overcrowded classrooms in rural and urban areas. We
addressed the need for additional capacity in two ways; through new constructions and the renovation of
existing schools.
To this end, we focused on investments for the construction of new classrooms and the renovation of the
existing schools and made a determined effort to realize these investments. While 7,000 classrooms were
being built per year in basic education until 1997, this number increased to 12,103 in 1997, to 21,620 in
1998 and to 26,745 in 1999. In 2000, 23,375 and in 2001, 20,140 classrooms were added. Thus, 103.983
new classrooms were built in the last five years. In order to realize this rapid pace of construction, apart
from the resources provided through Basic Education Law No. 4306 and voluntary contributions, starting
from 1997, a significant share of the funds in the investment budget of the state budget were allocated for
investments in the education sector.
As a result of the resolute implementation, the average number of pupils per classroom in Turkey was
reduced from 43 in 1997/1998 to 39 in 2001/2002. In the same period, in urban areas, this number
decreased from 61 to 48. Considering that 1.3 million new students enter primary educations every year in
Turkey, the relative amelioration achieved in the number of pupils per classroom is an indicator of the
resolve and determination in our efforts.
School Bussing Program and Regional Primary Education Boarding Schools
Another priority objective was the transportation of students from small rural schools with the School
Bussing Program, to larger and better equipped schools, to extend the coverage and quality of basic
education. In areas, where difficult climate conditions do not favor the School Bussing Program we have
constructed Regional Primary Education Boarding Schools or Pensioned Primary Education Schools.
Figures on the School Bussing Program reflects the importance my Government attaches to this issue.
While the number of the students transported to better and larger schools were 120,998 in 1997, this
number has increased 253 % to 630,000 in 2001/2002. Transportation costs of the students in the School
Bussing Program are covered by my Ministry and the Government also provides free lunches for these
students.
Construction of Regional Primary Education Boarding Schools (YIBO) and Pensioned Primary Education
Schools (PIO) has been a part of our policy, and the number of students in YIBOs has increased by 86 %
from 73,079 in 1997 to 137,294 in 2001. At the same period, the number of students in PIOs have
increased by 797.8 % from 15,723 to 141,431.
Efforts to Improve Quality in Primary Education
In the imnplementation of the first APL, our aim has been to expand access to basic education rapidly, while
simultaneously improving education quality to improve learning achievements and prepare our children for
the challenges of the 21st century. The revised basic education curriculum includes elements, including
foreign language and computer literacy training, which are specifically directed at enabling students to
compete more effectively in the global marketplace and to further contribute to the social and economic
- 88 -



progress of Turkey.
Quality improvements are inextricably linked to our objective of reaching universal participation in basic
education. High quality schools, the School Bussing Program and YlBOs are essential to improve the
overall value and attractiveness of education to families, but at the same time they are essential for
improving quality of education. Similarly, targeted programs for low income families, including free
school meals, books and educational materials serve both to increase attendance and improve student
performance.
In the Program of the Government, quality improvement activities include, increases in the quality of
teachers through in-service training, curriculum improvements, distribution of textbooks and providing
Information Communication Technology (ICT) classes.
Increasing the Number of Teachers and In-service Training
One subject we attached importance in increasing the quality of primary education was the availability of
qualified and motivated teachers In order to staff rapidly increasing number of schools and classrooms, and
to improve the overall efficiency of teacher allocations across Turkey, we bad to take a number of
important measures. Within this context:
(i)  Systematic reforms have been made in the pre-service training of teachers,
(ii) Temporary measures, including the use of volunteer retired teachers to increase teacher
supply, and
(iii) Changes in regulations on teacher assignments and compensations were put into effect.
188,544 additionalteachers were recruited between the years 1997-2001. 583,000 teachers (school directors
are not included in this figure) are in service at the being of the 2001/2002 educational year.
Approximately 272,388 teachers received in-service training during 2001. This figure was 213,444 for the
year 2000.
Curriculum improvement
Following the adoption of uninterrupted compulsory eight-year primary education throughout the country,
the education system has been restructured, in areas where it was deemed necessary, programs have been
revised. Within this framework, in the last five years, 184 education programs have been prepared and
have been integrated into the curriculum. One subject we attach importance is the revision of the
curriculum to allow the best use of the possibilities offered by ICT classes.
Purchase of Basic Education Materials
Our aim is to increase the quality of education, particularly to students from very-low-income families,
through provision of basic education materials. 10.2 million school books prepared by the Ministry of
National Education have been distributed free of charge to primary education students in rural areas, to
children of low-income families and to students in the earthquake zone at the beginning of the 2001/2002
school year.

Computer Education
Building an information workforce is an important challenge for us as we implement our strategy for
economic development based on open competitive markets. In light of the increasing demand for
information-oriented jobs that require basic infornatics skills, and the technological shift towards personal
computing and distributed applications we recognize the need for a strategy to broaden the diffusion of
computer literacy. From an equity as well as an efficiency perspective, informatics literacy can play a
pivotal role in our economic and social development by adding a greater technological element to the
service and manufacturing sectors. Within the framework of the BEP, the Ministry of National Education
aims to broaden computer literacy, revise and enhance the existing curricula so that maximum benefit can
be derived from ICT classes and open computer laboratories to the local community as
technology-intensive leaming environments.
Positive Developments Achieved at the Implementation of the Basic Education Program
The efforts I have outlined have produced excellent results. The number of students in primary education
has increased by 1.5 million after 1997 and the enrollment rate, which was 75.8 % in the 1996/1997
educational year has exceeded 95 % in 2001/2002. Until 1997, only 90 % of children at school age
completed five-year basic education and just 53 % of the student who had completed five-year basic
education (mostly boys) used to continue their studies.
Girls' enrollments in rural areas made the most rapid progress. Girls' enrollments in grade six in rural
areas increased by 162 % in the first year of the Program, and have continued to make sharp gains ever
since.
Furthermore, quality of the education in rural schools has been improved as a result of the School Bussing
Program and the intensive in-service training for teachers.
The progress made in the efforts to implement uninterrupted eight year basic education, has led to our
achievements and the solid foundations we have built, following the approval of the Basic Education Law
has established a sound basis for restructuring the secondary education system in Turkey.
The successes achieved in the implementation of the Basic Education Program has led to a striking increase
in the number of the students enrolling in secondary education, preparing the way for extension of
compulsory education to 12 years.
Our Targets
Despite the major progress achieved in meeting the objectives of the Basic Education Program to date,
there is still important work to be done both to extend coverage and to improve quality in Basic Education.
Priority areas for our activities are indicated below:
- Extending enrollments in basic education to 100 %, and bringing in all students of school age
into the system.
- Efforts to improve the quality of basic education will continue. In this framework:
* The construction of new classrooms will continue to bringing down the number of students
per classroom to 30 and to eliminate gradually the practice of combining classes in rural
- 90 -



schools
*  In-service training for teachers must continue and they must acquire the skills to teach
computer literacy and to use fully computers as an educational tool.
* Curriculum revision will continue to improve quality of education.
The main difficulties we encountered in achieving our targets were rapid population increase that makes
new investments in education essential, and the difficulties in planning new school construction and
renovation programs due to internal migration from rural areas to population centers. In addition to these
two main problems, the economic crisis Turkey is going through has necessitated savings in the resources
allocated to education, just as in every field, and revision of planned investments in education. For
instance, while we need to construct 91,738 classrooms within the next three years to achieve our aim to
bring down the number of students per classroom to 30, under prevailing conditions, this objective cannot
be realized without new financial resources. Similarly, renewed efforts must be deployed to find the
resources needed to renovate schools in rural and urban areas, as well as the YIBOs and PIOs.
The World Bank Support - The Basic Education Project
Our government has requested a two-phase Adaptable Program Loan amounting to US$ 600 millions from
the World Bank as a support for the implementation of the Basic Education Program and this request has
been accepted by the Bank. The Loan Agreement for the first phase of the Basic Education Program was
signed on June 25, 1998. The World Bank has accepted to finance the second phase of the Project just like
the first phase. It will be determined in time whether a third phase should be launched or not.
The cooperation based on mutual understanding and trust has been maintained for many years between
Turkey and the World Bank. This positive ground was the solid foundation for the implementation of the
US$ 300 millions worth first phase of the Basic Education Project.
The Basic Education Proiect - Phase I
The implementation of the first phase of the Project has aimed to achieve the following objectives:
i) Expanding universal eight-year basic education;
ii) Improving the quality of basic education and computer supported learning and teaching;
iii) Strengthening management capacity to provide basic education; and
iv) Monitoring and evaluation to guide the implementation of the Program.
Within the framework of the first APL, activities have been carried out in four components. The main
points of these activities are indicated below:
a) Renovation and construction of additional facilities for rural and urban schools in gecekondu
areas, and YIBO's to extend basic education.
b) Improving quality of education. Under this component, 3188 ICT classes have been established
in 2802 basic education schools. Furthermore, work continues to procure 22,854 computers for the use
of teachers working in rural schools. We expect to complete procurement before the end of 2002.
Within the implementation of the program, we are strengthening learning through productive use of ICT as
a tool in the whole basic education curriculum. Our activities to develop the curriculum for maximum use
- 91 -



of ICT are continuous. Information technology can have various objectives, ranging from importing basic
skills in routine applications such as data entry or word processing, to conveying more advanced skills such
as facilitating learning in other subjects (foreign language, science, math, etc.) to research through the
Internet. We are working to ensure maximum use of such opportunities offered by ICT classrooms to
students.
c) In-service Training for Primary Education Teachers. Within the framework of expanding
computer aided instruction, a total of 221,000 teachers were provided with computer training under the
Basic Education Project, along with an intensive training program for basic education inspectors.
d) Provision of educational materials for rural schools to increase school attendance and
achievement rates for children from low-income families. Within this framework, the Ministry of
National Education is in the process of procuring educational materials for approximately 22,776 rural
schools and students in these schools. The procurement activities to purchase these educational
materials is expected to be completed in 2002.
Besides providing educational materials for students the Ministry of National Education continues its
activities to provide free lunches and school uniforms for the children from low-income families. To
realize these activities, MONE uses its network of Girls' Vocational High Schools and Adult Training
Centers. It has been observed that such assistance has a positive impact on school attendance and student
achievement.
Implementation of the Basic Education Project
Existing capacity and resources of the MONE are used to the maximum in implementing the Basic
Education Project. The Project Coordination Center (PCC) under the direct responsibility of a Deputy
Undersecretary is mainly responsible for the implementation of the Project. PCC carries out its tasks in
coordination with and with the support of the relevant ministerial line units. PCC, at the same time, is in
close cooperation with provincial/sub-provincial units of the MONE. In addition to the Ministry staff,
consultants are recruited when necessary to support implementation of various components of the Project.
One of the most important tasks of the PCC has been monitoring and evaluation activities. On-going
evaluation provides us with essential feedback for gauging progress, making course corrections, and
responding to changing circumstances and lessons leamed.
Results of the monitoring activities are assessed regularly and at various levels. An important dimension of
these assessments is joint evaluations made with Bank missions.
Analysis of learning outputs of the Basic Education Program is at the centre of monitoring and evaluation
activities. Activities to measure student achievement in four areas (Turkish, science, math, and social
sciences) based on existing assessment tools developed within the scope of National Education
Development Project, have been completed. These activities shall be expanded to include computer literacy
and foreign language through a measurement test to be applied on April 14th, 2002. Results of the tests
which will be repeated at regular intervals shall be a useful tool to measure the successes and shortcomings
of the Basic Education Project, and to overcome deficiencies.
Basic Education Proiect Phase II
The cooperation based on mutual understanding and trust between Turkey and the World Bank shall
- 92 -



constitute a solid basis for the implementation of the second phase of the Basic Education Project.
Our main targets in Phase II of the Basic Education Project shall comprise the same actions that were
supported under Phase I. These targets are to expand the coverage of basic education, to improve the
quality of basic education, and to expand computer assisted teaching and learning. Besides these basic
objectives, Phase II shall also support pre-school education and special needs education as an integral part
of primary education.
Inclusion of special needs education within the scope of the Project is part of our efforts to integrate
students with special needs into the educational system and to extend basic education coverage. Including
pre-school education within the scope of the project shall reinforce our endeavors to expand pre-school
education, which is presently not at the desired level. Furthermore, an early start in areas with low
achievements in basic education, will contribute to raising achievement rates.
In order to complete the Second Phase of the Basic Education Project in a timely and efficient way,
management capacity of the Ministry of National Education shall continue to be reinforced. Necessary
steps are being taken to hire sufficient number of consiltants to assist in the activities of the Project
Coordination Center.  Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms which provide guidance on the
implementation of the project shall continue to be used under Phase II of the project.
I believe thaw experience gained by all Ministry units and the staff of these units during the implementation
period of the first Phase of BEP, shall accelerate and assist in the implementation of the second Phase.
Our activities in the second Phase of the BEP shall be implemented mainly in four areas as in the first
Phase of the project. These components are indicated below:
a) Renovating primary education schools to extend basic education coverage. The Second Phase of
the Project shall also cover the renovation of and the construction of additional facilities in a number of
pre-education and special needs education schools.
b) Installation of additional ICT classrooms to increase quality in education.
Through the installation of additional ICT classrooms in 3000 basic education schools, the number of ICT
classrooms installed under this Project, shall be increased to over 6000. Increasing the number of schools
with ICT classrooms shall assist us in reaching our objective of extending computer literacy and
computer-assisted education.
In parallel with the installation of additional ICT classrooms we shall carry on our activities regarding the
use of ICT classes as a tool within the basic education curriculum to strengthen learning. Our aim is to
utilize the teaching possibilities offered by ICT classrooms to the maximum to increase the quality of basic
education. Monitoring and Evaluation studies on the use of ICT classes installed in the first Phase of the
project, and the achievement rates in these classrooms which are being carried out by consultants will be
completed by the end of June 2002. The results of these studies shall be a useful tool in determining the
measures needed for efficient use of ICT classrooms and guiding our activities on implementation and
development.
In order to ensure maximum use of ICT classrooms installed in the basic education schools by the local
community, work continues to determnine the principles under which computer classrooms will be opened to
the local community as technology-intensive learning environments. These activities will be completed by
- 93 -



June 2002.
The second Phase shall also cover installation of ICT classroom in special needs education schools.
c) In-service Training in Basic Education
In-service training activities shall continue to enable basic education school teachers to effectively use the
active learning method. Within the framework of expanding computer assisted education, teachers and
primary education inspectors shall continue to receive computer training.
Under the second phase, in-service training activities shall also cover pre-school and special needs
education school teachers.
In order to meet the need for in-service training of a great number of staff in the most effective way, an
Education Portal shall be established under the second phase, which shall improve distance education
opportunities of the Ministry.
d) Provision of educational materials for schools in gecekondu areas. Related activities carried out
under the first phase of the first phase, shall be carried on under the second phase of the Project.
As in Phase I of the Basic Education Project, monitoring and evaluation activities shall have an important
role in Phase II in guiding our activities. Results of the Student Achievement Measurement Studies shall
be an important tool to determine the successes and failures of the Basic Education Program, and to
overcome those failures.
Basic Education Program provides us with an historic opportunity to invest in our future and to prepare
our children for the challenges of the 21st century. Through our efforts to achieve universal access to
eight-year basic education and to improve education quality, we will elevate Turkey's stature and
competitiveness in the intemational community. Our partnership with the World Bank in this effort will
strengthen our prospects for success.
