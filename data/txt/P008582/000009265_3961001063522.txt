MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND FOR
AN EMPLOYMENT PROMOTION AND SERVICES PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Poland for US$100 million is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan will assist the Government to develop improved employment policies,
institutions, and programs which will mitigate the negative impact of economic
adjustment on the labor force and contribute to a resurgence of economic
growth. The loan will have a maturity of 17 years, including a grace period
of five years, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.       Backaround.  The ambitious economic reform program launched in Poland
in 1989, with Bank support, will require parallel reforms on the demand and
supply sides of the labor market. Because previous labor policies and
institutions did not acknowledge the existence of unemployment, the Government
now faces considerable challenge in efforts to manage large-scale joblessness,
expand labor market flexibility, facilitate labor mobility, and redirect human
capital formation to support a market economy. Both national and local
institutions are experiencing serious difficulty in responding to growing
unemployment. The number of registered jobless has increased from
55,800 persons in January 1990 to more than 1.1 million or about 6.1 percent
of the labor force by the end of 1990. U.aemployment is expected to reach 2.0
million persons (10.6 percent of the labor force) by the end of 1991.
3.        The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MOLSP) has established
priorities for reform of employment policy and programs. Labor and social
welfare legislation have undergone major revisions in 1990 and 1991. Some
refinement will be needed to improve targeting and cost-effectiveness of
individual employment assistance programs, coordinate benefits between income
support programs such as unemployment and social welfare, and allocate
resources among programs.  Local libor offices will need to be reoriented and
strengthened to provide the services individuals need to cope with economic
restructuring and changing conditions in a market economy. Office operations
will need to be automated, staff will need training in counseling and mass
layoff response techniques, and supporting materials will need to be developed
and disseminated. There exist many local non-government and semi-private
agencies to provide training, placement and micro-enterprise development
services to the unemployed, but they lack incentives, expertise and modern
equipment to work with labor offices and enterprises. These institutions must
be activated to assist adults who are unemployed or need retraining, develop
customized training that will promote new investment and employment, and
support entrepreneurial initiative among the unemployed.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Inadequate attention to the human
capital base could constrain and possibly paralyze economic reform in Poland.
Ongoing aralytical work in labor markets and unemployment, education and
training, science and technology, and health is assisting the Bank and
Government to identify the human capital constraints to generating and
maintaining the needed supply response to the new economic environment. This
project is intended to be the first of .everal planned to address pressing
requirements of human resource development in Poland. With respect to
employment promotion and services, there is a need for investment in both



proactive labor programs that promote employment and reactive income support
programs that assist the unemployed and help to avert poverty. The Bank is in
a position to bring to Poland experience in other countries with employment
policy, income support, employment services and employment promotion issues.
Bank staff are cooperating with bilateral and multilateral agencies that are
developing parallel programs. The Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3247-POL)
addresses policy issues of income support programs for workers displaced by
economic restructuring. The proposed project will support and strengthen
delivery of these and more proactive programs.
5.       Project Objectives.  The goal of the project is to promote
employment, investment and economic growth by improving labor force
development programs.  The specific objectives are to:  (a) improve the cost-
effectiveness of existing employment and social welfare programs; (b) increase
occupational, sectoral and geographic mobility of the labor force;
(c) increase productivity of the labor force and promote investment; and
(d) test mechanisms for job creation by the unemployed through micro-
enterprise development.
Prolect DescrintIon
6.       Management Infrastructure.  This component will improve the
administrative efficiency and coverage of programs supported under the
Employment and Social Welfare Laws. This will be done in consultation with
regional and local Labor and Social Welfare Offices, Employment Councils, and
the Central Statistics Office. MOLSP will undertake initiatives in general
administration, automation of labor and social welfare offices, and labor
market information systems.
7.       Income Sum,ort.  This component will improve the efficiency of income
support programs by: (a) establishing criteria for client means testing at
Social Welfare Offices (SWOs); (b) developing and implementing SWO staff
training; (c) improving SWO facilities; and (d) creating an unemployment
benefit and financing system coordinated with other cash benefit systems and
financially independent from programs supported by the Employment Law.
8.       Zmloyment Services.  This component will expand and improve existing
services. The project will support: (a) development and implementation of
Industrial Adjustment Services (IAS), a rapid response mechanism to assist
enterprises and communities experiencing mass layoffs; (b) development of
materials, techniques and facilities to improve occupational counseling; and
(c) improvement of national and Local Labor Office (LLO) staff training.
9.       Adult Training.  This component will support establishment of
national guidelines and procedures and development of local training programs
for unemployed adults. At the ngtional level, MOLSP will develop model
procedures for LLOs to use in awarding contracts to local training
institutions. MOLSP, in cooperation with selected local training
institutions, will also develop models for marketing and implementing
customized training to support revitalization of existing enterprises and
entrepreneurs seeking to start new enterprises. At the local leval, the
project will provide resources to institutions to develop vocational, junior
and middle management, foreign language, mobile training and basic education
programs. Selection of sites for all programs will be made by MOLSP according
to criteria agreed with the Bank (e.g., the need to reskill the workforce to



-3-
respond to structural change, the level of unemployment, the availability of
retraining resources in a region).
10.      Micro-Enterprise DeveLopment.  This small component will strengthen
the ability ^f local non-governmental organizations (e.g., Chambers of
Commerce, Agencies for Local Initiative) to provide improved services: (a) to
the unemployed who have shown the aptitude to start micro-enterprises; and
(b) to LLOs to strengthen the existing entrepreneurship program.  Activities
supported under the project will be divided into two overlapping phases.
Phase I will provide technical assistance to build the general understanding
of micro-entrepreneurship in MOLSP and LLOs and the capacity of local NGOs to
promote micro-enterprise development by the unemployed. Phase II will provide
technical assistance, and limited credit for sub-projects proposed by these
local NGOs to: (a) furnish technical services to micro-entrepreneurs;
(b) establish incubators, providing affordable space and other services, for
micro-enterprise development; and (c) test the feasibility of providing non-
subsidized credit for new and early-stage micro-enterprises which have
difficulty obtaining credit from commercial sources, due to lack of
collateral. Credit will be provided through pilot Enterprise Development
Funds (EDFs) managed by local NGOs, supplemented by a loan review committee
including at least one representative from a commercial bank. Capital will be
provided in the early stage of business development and will act as a
transition financing mechanism until the enterprise is able to obtain credit
from commercial sources.
11.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$142.2 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$100.0 million (70 percent). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Poland
are given in Schedule C. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9408-POL, dated May
15, 1991, is being distributed separately.
12.      Actions Agreed.  During negotiations the Government gave assurances
that: (a) revisions to the existing legislative framework for employment
programs will be submitted to Parliament by December 31, 1992 to improve cost-
effectiveness, targeting, and financing of such programs at the local level;
(b) a comprehensive plan will be developed by June 30, 1992 to support
automation and sharing of information between labor and social welfare offices
at the local, regional, and national levels; (c) revised legislation for
benefits and financing of the unemployment, social welfare, and related income
support systems will be submitted to Parliament by December 31, 1992; (d) a
framework, including job titles, for a new national occupational
classification system, satisfactory to the Bank, will be developed for use in
all MOLSP programs by December 31, 1991; (e) criteria agreed with the Bank
will be used to identify local sub-projects in social welfare, adult training
and micro-enterprise development; and (f) the MOLS2 will substantially staff
all units supporting major project components by December 31, 1991.
13.      During negotiations the Government also confirmed that (a) technical
assistance will be procured in accordance with terms of reference and a
schedule agreed with the Bank; (b) the Government will furnish an annual audit
of expenditures six months after the end of each fiscal year; and (c) the
Government will provide a project technical and financial report by November
30 of each year and conduct an annual Government-Bank review of implementation



-4-
progress and the program for the following year.
14.      Benefits.  The major benefit will be to refine and improve the cost
effectiveness of significant investments the Government is making in
employment programs (about US$2 billion in 1991). These programs must promote
a quick and flexible supply response to changing economic conditions and will
be a key factor in the transition to a market economy in Poland. The policy
framework for the employment and social welfare systems will be further
clarified through refinement of legislation. The unemployed and other
vulnerable groups will be better served by well-coordinated and efficiently
administered income support programs.  Mobility of labor between occupations,
economic sectors, and regions will be facilitated through improved employment
services and training programs. Modeis of proactive training and employment
promotion programs will be developed, tested and replicated, thus widening
alternatives to prolonged and costly income support in the face of structural
unemployment and deficient demand for labor. The capability of national and
local institutions will be enhanced to deliver the employment programs needed
for a smoothly functioning labor market in a market economy and to develop
human capital to support economic development.
15.      Risks.  The major risks are that:  (a) the Government's broad
policies for economic restructuring may not sufficiently compel enterprises to
shift emphasis from employment to productivity; (b) employment and social
welfare institutions may not have sufficient resources and services to cope
with major displacements in the labor force, or may misdirect resources if the
economic restructuring program is not implemented effectively; and
(c) training and micro-enterprise support institutions may not be capable of
providing services to enable new investment and enterprise development. These
risks have been addressed in the project through review of employment and
social welfare budget support, legislation and policy, organization and
staffing of national and local institutions, and methods of delivering
services to clients. MOLSP has made adjustments in all these areas along the
lines recommended by the Bank and will continue to improve institutional
capabilities during project implementation. All components of the project
provide for substantial technical assistance which should assist with
supervision and evaluation of project activities and improve institutional
capabilities and performance at the national and local levels.
16.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
