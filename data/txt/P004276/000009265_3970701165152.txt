PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
(EIGHTH EDUCATION LOAN)
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:      Malaysia
Amount:         US$127.0 million equivalent
Terms:         Repayable in 15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable rate
Project
Description: The main objective of the project would be to assist the
Government in accelerating the implementation of policy reforms
and institutional changes aimed at improving the quality of
education and the efficiency of educational management as well
as at increasing access to better education.
In support of this objective, the project would help finance
the first five-year phase of a ten-year program to develop and
improve the primary and secondary education subsector under the
Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-1990), including: (a) the provision
of 4,000 student places to replace the most inadequate teacher
training facilities; (b) the provision of about 3,300 primary
and secondary classrooms, and related boarding and staff
housing facilities in the most disadvantaged and overcrowded
districts; (c) an increase in educational resources through the
provision of about eight million school library books, and
equipment for 5,400 rural schools and 350 district resource
centers; (d) a staff development program for about 500 key
education officers, includin& fellowships abroad and local
training, and (e) studies on quality, efficiency and equity in
education.
Risks:         Constraints on resources might slow down the implementation of
the proposed project and the number of additional staff needed
to implement the new activity-oriented curricula would result
in a substantial increase in recurrent coscs. However, the
project schools could be adequately staffed according to a more
modest teacher:class ratio than currently envisaged by the
Government, thus reducing the fiscal burden. No problem is
anticipated with regard to the staffing of the schools, which
is well within the training capacity of teacher training
colleges and universities.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
(EIGHTH EDUCATION LOAN)
1. INTRODUCTION
Socio-economic Background
1.01      Malaysia, a country of about 15 million people in 1984, is separated
by the South China Sea into Peninsular, or West, Malaysia and the East
Malaysia states of Sabah and Sarawak. In 1980 Peninsular Malaysia accounted
for 83Z of the population while approximately 72 of the population resided in
Sabah and 10% in Sarawak. Malaysia is still predominantly a rural country
with 60% of the population of Peninsular Malaysia and 80% of the popuLation of
Sabah and Sarawak living in rural areas. Malays constitute the largest ethnic
group (48% of the population), followed by the Chinese (30%), indigenous
ethnic groups (132), which constitute four-fifths of the population of Sabah
and one-half of the population of Sarawak, and the Indians (9%). Within
Peninsular Malaysia, ethnicity also differs significantly between urban and
rural areas with 73% of the Halays residing in rural areas, compared with 41%
of the Chinese and 552 of the Indians. Administratively Malaysia is divided
into 13 st tes and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, and 123
districts.-
1.02      Malaysia's resources and the benefits of its economic growth have
not been equally shared among all people and regions. Although the overall
incidence of poverty has decreased substantially since 1970, there are still
wide variations in poverty among regions. In 1980 approximately 38% of rural
households were in poverty compared with only 13% in urban areas. Ethnic
differences in income also persist: in the early 1980s, the mean annual
household income of Malays was M$3,550 per month compared with M$5,460 for
Indians and M$6,830 for Chinese.
Development Objectives and Economic Performance
1.03      The New Economic Policy articulated in 1971 set forth the develop-
ment goals for the next twenty years as being the eradication of poverty, by
raising income levels and increasing employment opportunities for aLl
Malaysians irrespective of race, and the restructuring of society so as to
1/   In Sabah and Sarawak, where the population is widely dispersed, the
"Division" is the third administrative level between the State and the
District.

reduce racial imbalance in economic functions. This policy has been implemen-
ted through economic growth and increased participation of the poorest
segments of the population in the benefits of development through selective
programs. Regional inequalities have also been alleviated through greater
regional decentralization of economic activity, with priority given to
disadvantaged areas. These economic programs to eliminate poverty and
inequality have been combined with political and social programs to encourage
national integration and social change. Education has been accorded a crucial
role in this process.
1.04      The most dramatic economic progress occurred in the 1970s as a
result of strong external demand for Malaysia's commodity exports and a world
boom in their prices. The growth rate of GDP, which was 6Z in the 1960s,
increased to 7.8% for the period 1971-80. This, combined with the
Government's policies, led to substantial improvements in welfare, as measured
by the incidence of poverty and access to public services, including educa-
tion. The growth rate of employment reached 3.7% overall and the proportion
of the population below the poverty line dropped from about 50X in 1970 to
about 30% in 1983.
1.05      This period of rapid growth in the 1970s slowed down in the early
1980s. The recession in industrialized nations reduced exports and GDP growth
declined from 7.8% in the 1970s to 5.6% in 1982. The recovery in 1983 was
only mild and the prospects for the Malaysian economy over the next plan
period (1986-1990) are dependent on the economic recovery in developed
countries. The Government initially attempted to maintain growth by maintain-
ing its spending and assuming more responsibility for expansion: government
expenditures rose from 31Z of GNP in 1977-79 to over 45% of GNP in 1982.
However, as the recession continued and deficits grew, the Government cut its
expenditures in 1983 and 1984. The cuts were more severe in the capital than
in the recurrent budget and the 1985 budget, which is 7.8% above that of 1984,
follows the same trend: operating expenditures will increase while capital
expenditures will decline and represent only 20% of the total budget as
compared with 23% in 1984.
Implications for Education
1.06      Malaysia's economic circumstances and development goals have a
substantial impact on both the need for educational expansion and improvement,
and the ability of the economy to provide resources for yijese tasks.  The
diversification of the economy out of primary production- requires that the
labor force have an ability to acquire new skills. Education is essential to
such a labor force. In addition, several attempcs have been made to estimate
the economic benefits from schooling in Malaysia: while the private returns
to secondary education were estimated at about 33% according to one
2/   In 1970 the employment distribution was 47Z in agriculture, 23% in the
secondary sector and 30% in the tertiary sector. The corresponding
figures for 1980 were 36%, 29% and 35%.

study,3/ another study on paddy farmers in the Muda River Valley indicated
that primary schooling was instrumental in helping farmers obtain higher
yields. Each additional year of primary schooling was reported to yieLd about
a 22% rate of return net of schooling costs. This rate of return to primary
schooling is si lar to that observed in Thailand and substantially above that
found in Korea._ In general, it has been estimated that in Asian developing
countries the social rate of return (net of the cost of education to society)
is 27% for primary, 15% for secondary and 13% for higher education. Thus,
primary and secondary education remain high priorities on purely economic
grounds. The crucial issue is the ability of Malaysia to afford investment in
schooling to the extent it would like, given its related recurrent cost and
the recent constraints on resources.
2. THE SECTOR
Overview
2.01      General.  Since independence in 1957, the Government's effort to
develop the education system has been an integral part of a wider national
policy. The Government has indeed regarded education as a key factor to pro-
mote national identity and integration, socio-economic development and employ-
ment. Education is also considered a major instrument of social and economic
mobility, a means of providing productive skills, raising the standard of
living, and lowering the gap in earnings among ethnic groups. It is, there-
fore, a major vehicle to achieve the New Economic Policy goals of eradicating
poverty and reducing racial imbalance in economic functions.
2.02      The establishmegy of a federal Ministry of Educ:ation (MOE) and a
unified education system,-' the introduction of a common curriculum and Bahasa
Malaysia (the standardized Malay language) at all levels of the education
system, and the inculcation of national values have helpea to integrate the

and Implications", Journal of Human Resources, 1985.

Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982.
5/   The education system comprises six years of primary education, three
years of lower secondary and two years of upper secondary education,
followed by two years of preuniversity courses, or two to three years of
postsecondary vocational and teacher training, and three to six years of
higher education (Chart 1).



various ethnic communities, while preserving their specific cultural valueg
through the use of their own language of instruction in primary education.-
2.03      The Government has concentrated its effort on providing as many
children of the 6-14 age group as possible with access to at least nine years
of basic education. This is considered by the Government as the minimum
general education requirement for further training and productive life, as
long as universal access to the full five-year secondary course cannot be
achieved due to financial constraints. Basic education is provided through a
policy of free primary education and virtually automatic promotion from Grade
1 to Grade 9.
2.04      Enrollment Expansion.  The above policy has resulted in a
significant expansion of education. Enrollments in government educational
institutions grew at an annual average of 3.3% between 1971 and 1984. In
1984. primary education was virtually universal; the secondary enrollment
ratio of 72Z was one of the highest in the region (Annex 1), while post-
secondary and higher education enrolled 11% and 4% respectively of the rele-
vant age groups, excluding enrollments in local private and overseas
postsecondary institutions and universicies (Chart 2).
2.05      Female Participation.  The participation of girls in education is
high with 49% of enrollments in primary and secondary, 52% in postsecondary
and 38% in local public higher education. In technical/vocational education,
girls are also substantially represented with 33% in technical secondary and
postsecondary schools, 27% in vocational schools and 25% in polytechnics.
Women now constitute the majority of students in TTCs (55Z) and almost 60% of
teachers are women.
2.06      Teacher Training.  The teacher training system (Annex 2) provides a
diversified and flexible range of programs. Primary, lower secondary and
vocational teachers are trained in 27 teacher training colleges (TTCs), and
upper secondary teachers in five universities. In 1984, the TTCs enrolLed
17,000 teacher trainees in three-year courses with an annual output of
5,500. In universities, 5,400 teacher trainees attended four-year Bachelor's
Degree and three-year Diploma courses, and one-year postgraduate Certificate
or Diploma-in-Education programs. The annual output was 1,700. Since 1983,
teacher trainees have been admitted to TTCs following completion of grade 11
with at least four mandatory major subjects including Bahasa Malaysia, and a
mandatory pass in mathematics. This selection at admission is expected to
improve teacher trainees' academic background. In addition, inservice courses
are provided through various full-time and part-time programs: a part-time
four-year program, with a final fully residential year in the TTCs, trains
6/   At the primary level, Bahasa Malaysia is taught in all schools, but the
main language of instruction in some schools is Chinese or Tamil. A one-
year extra course (remove class), following primary education in Chinese
and Tamil, is provided to non-Malays to upgrade their Bahasa Malaysia to
the working knowledge required in secondary education where it becomes
the sole language of instruction.



some 6,000 academically qualified teachers who lack teaching certification and
are hired on temporary contracts; also about 500 specialized teachers and
1,700 remedial specialists and guidance counselors are trained annually;
intensive language teacher training courses are provided to university
graduates wishing to teach English and Bahasa Malaysia; and about 10% of qual-
ified teachers, i.e. 8,000 primary and 5,000 secondary teachers each year, are
introduced to new teaching approaches and methods (including the use of
libraries and media) through intensive courses. In 1984, about 85X of primary
and secondary teachers were professionally qualified. However, the percentage
of university graduates among seconilary teachers (5Z of lower secondary teach-'
ers, in particular) is below the desirable proportion sought by the MOE.
2.07      Educational Finance.  These improvements in educational quality and
opportunities have resulted in a relatively high share of GNP spent on educa-
tion. In 1984, this share was 6.1%, as compared with 2.1% in Indonesia, 2.8%
in the Philippines and 3.4% in Thailand, but was exceeded by Korea (7.7%).
Higher expenditures are due both to the wide 57 verage of the education system
(para. 2.04) and t higher student unit costs-  resulting from competitive
teachers' salaries   and modest student:teacher ratios (25:1 in primary and
22:1 in secondary education). As education is a federal responsibility in
Malaysia, the cost of education is borne mainly by the Federal Government.
Only about 5%, including fees, is met from private contributions and local
authorities' levies. Typically, the MOE bears about 80% of all expenditures
on education and training. The remaining 20% is borne largely by other minis-
tries and by private agencies. Private schools enroll a negligible proportion
of primary students (0.3%) and only 6Z of secondary studenLs.
2.08      Over the period 1971-84, the MOE's high share of development
expenditures (around 6.5%) was due to the Government's policy of increasing
educational opportunities even in the most remote areas. However MOE's share
of recuyrent expenditures declined during the same period from 24.iZ to
16.7% - as a result of the relatively fastec growth of other sectors. In
1985, budgetary estimates include US$290.0 million equivalent for investment
in education and US$1,510.0 mfl ion equivalent for recurrent expenditure on
education, representing 9.5% - and 17.5% of total government development and
recurrent budgets, respectively.
2.09      The distribution of recurrent expenditures over the three major
levels of education is about 39Z, 43% and 18% for primary, secondary and
7/   M$540 and M$770 for primary and secondary education, respectively, i.e.
11.5% and 16.4% of GNP per capita (Annex 1).
8/   Average teacher salaries in Malaysia are about 2.5 times the GNP per
capita.
9/   As compared with 20.3% in Thailand and 20.8% in Korea.
10/ 13.8% if expenditures on education and training incurred by ministries
other than MOE, are included.



higher education, respectively. With regard to capital investment, the
Government has gradually increased emphasis on vocational/technical and higher
education during the Fourth Malaysia Plan in order to meet growing demand in
these subsectors resulting from the development of the country's economy and
the steady expansion of primary and general secondary education. This trend
is confirmed by the Fifth Malaysia Plan which allocates about 45% of its
investment in education and training to higher education and 16% to technical
education and vocational training, while primary and general secondary
education development is maintained with 39% of the funds.
2.10      External Assistance for Education.  Malaysia receives external aid
for education in the form of technical assistance and investment programs. In
1983 technical assistance to education amounted to US$5.1 million. This
represented 19.5% of all technical assistance to the country. Over three
quarters of technical assistance came from bilateral sources (US$3.9 million)
with the United Kingdom contributing 65% of these bilateral funds (US$2.5 mil-
lion) and Australia an additional 24% (US$900,000). Belgium, the Netherlands
and New Zealand also made substantial contributions. Multilateral contribu-
tions mainly originate from UNDP and Unicef. As for capital investment, the
ongoing programs, which concentrate on skill training, come from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic Development Bank and IBRD in loans total-
ing US$180.2 million (of which US$113.9 million under Loans 2145-MA and 2601-
MA) and a grant of US$8 million from the Japanese International Cooperation
Agency.
2.11      Educational Management.  Educational administration in MaLaysia is
highly centralized with a four-tiered line of authority including federal,
state, district and school levels. The MOE operates through its 14 profes-
sional and 12 administrative divisions and services (Chart 3). Decisions are
made th.ough a committee system (Chart 4) with the Educational Planning
Committee (EPC), chaired by the Minister of Education, being the supreme
educational policy-making and planning body. EPC coordinates the work of six
Specialized Committees, for curricula, textbcoks, scholarships and training,
higher education, finance, and development. The secretariat of EPC is the
Educational Planning and Research Division (EPRD) of the MOE. This secr!-
tariat (a) coordinates all inputs from MOE divisions and State Education
Departments (SED), universities, and other statutory bodies and agencies
relating to education, and (b) presents the MOE's plan to the Economic
Planning Unit (EPU) of the Prime Minister's Department. The EPU is responsi-
ble to the highest policy-making and planning body in the country, namely the
National Development Planning Committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary to the
Government.
2.12      Downstream, in each of the 13 states of the Federation, an SED
(Chart 5) is responsible for the implementation of the government educational
policy while providing the MOE with feedback on the issues specific to each
state and adjusting the national policy to local conditions. SED directors
are directly responsible to the Director General of Education in the MOE.



- 7 -
2.13      The rapid expansion of the education system resulted in the need for
an additional tier of decentralized management and quality-control, between
SEDs and schools, to monitor and evaluate educational programs and school
activities, and upgrade teachers locally. To meet this need, 57 District
Education Offices (DEOs) were established in Peninsular Malaysia in 1982
(Chart 6). In Sabah and Sarawak, 13 Division Education Offices and 50 DEOs
already existed. A DEO is headed by a District Education Officer, directly
responsible to the SED director.
2.14      Educational Development and Support Services.  The MOE provides the
education system with a diversified educational development and support net-
work including: (a) the Federal Inspectorate, compri ing 181 inspectors, in
charge of assessing teachers' and school managers' efficiency as weLl as major
educational issues; (b) the Curriculum Development Center responsible for
developing, testirg and monitoring implementation of new curricula and related
educational media programs and textbooks; (c) the Examinations Syndicate in
charge of (i)11eveloping, conducting, processing and evaluating national
examinations  -  as well as external examinations, administered on behalf of
over 30 foreign examination bodies, and (ii) cooperating with the University
of Cambridge Local Examination Syndicate to fix standards and awards; (d) the
Textbooks Bureau in charge of selecting, revising and distributing textbooks,
and managing the Textbook Loan Scheme of US$16 million p.a., which provides
free textbooks (1,000 titles), workbooks and readers to over 80Z of the school
population (1.8 million primary students and 1.1 million secondary students);
(e) the School Library Unit of the Schools Division, responsible for compiling
the recommended list of library books, planning and monitoring the utilization
of books, and training librarians; and (f) the Educational Media Service
responsible for developing, broadcasting and monitoring over 100 series of
radio and TV programs covering most of the primary and secondary grades, and
distributing radio and TV sets. All the above bodies are adequately staffed
and highly dedicated and efficient.
2.15      Resource Centers (RC).  Four State RCs in Peninsular Malaysia
(established under the Fourth Education Project, Loan 1329-MA), 15 Division
RCs (eight in Sabah and seven in Sarawak) and 117 District RCs (57 in Penin-
sular Malaysia, 24 in Sabah and 36 in Sarawak) provide referral support in
educational technology and staff upgrading in their own facilities. About 230
complementary District RCs are established in selected central schooLs to
serve 15 to 20 satellite schools each.
Major Issues in the Sector
2.16      Despite the above achievements, there are several problems affecting
the quality of education, the efficiency of educational management, and access
to quality education at both primary and secondary levels.

examination and the upper secondary general, commercial and vocational
examinations completing Grade 11.



-8-
Quality of Education
2.17      The Government is concerned over the quality and relevance of
education in view of: many primary students' inability to read and write
properly after six years of primary education; the high percentage of primary
students in need 1   remedial instruction, as shown by the primary Grade 5
assessment test;-  and the substantial differences in students' achievements,
with students from predominantly poor rural districts generally performing
more poorly.
2.18      Studies have identified two main sources of problems with the
quality of education: (a) unsuitable curricula and teaching practices in the
context of the present socio-cultural needs of Malaysia, combined with a
rather rapidly modernizing economy; and (b) the shortage of educational
resources and adequate facilities required to encourage active teaching/
learning processes.
(a) Curricula. Until 1983, curricula focussed on the acquisition of
overly academic knowledge overloading students' minds with uncoord-
inated subjects and topics, particularly in sciences and mathema-
tics. Insufficient emphasis was given to the acquisition of basic
skills, practice in the classroom and homework. These curricula
were mostly unrelated to local environment, irrelevant to the modern
life and economy, and disconnected from surrounding communities. In
addition, the curricula lacked continuity between educational
levels. Also, the shift in the medium of instruction to Bahasa
M4alaysia has resulted in a general lack of interest in English among
students, teachers and parents, particularly in rural areas. Defi-
ciencies in Bahasa Malaysia have mainly involved students in primary
schools where Chinese or Tamil are the media of instruction, in
areas where Bahasa Malaysia is not the first language and where
local teachers are not proficient in the language.
(b) Teacher Training. Curricular deficiencies in schooLs were
aggravated by the training and attitudes of teachers. Until 1982,
most teacher trainees were admitted to training programs in TTCs
without passing mandatory tests in English, mathematics and some
other major subjects at the upper secondary examination completing
Grade 11. Teaching practice within the training programs was also
found insufficient. Due to the lack of guidance and models, gener-
ally teachers tended to adopt formal teaching methods, with insuffi-
cient attention being paid to interaction in the classroom, and to
students' aptitudes and motivation. In addition, more attention
should have been given to remedial instruction, testing and
evaluation techniques, which could help offset students' cumulative
loss of learning due to automatic promotion. In secondary
12/ In 1982/83, the percentages of students scoring below the standards were
as follows: Bahasa Malaysia 25%, English 52%, Mathematics 44Z, Physical
and Social Sciences 30X.



- 9 -
education, although most teachers are professionally qualified, less
than a quarter of them are university graduates. While 75% of upper
secondary teachers are degree holders, only 52 of lower secondary
teachers are graduates. The latter is particularly insufficient to
achieve the normal academic standards in secondary education sought
by the MOE. Over one third of teacher trainers (600 out of 1,600)
are nongraduates and have no postsecondary qualifications. Head-
masters lack training in managerial and leadership techniques, which
could boost teachers' commitment and motivation.
(c) Educational Resources. Teachers' deficiencies have been compounded
by the shortage of learning and teaching materials and equipment,
particularly for language, mathematics and science teaching. There
is on average only one library room for three primary schools and
most school libraries are not properly equipped and accommodated.
Moreover, the 5,400 rural primary schools are poorly equipped to
teach the new curriculum and to benefit from the educational media
programs (para. 2.14f). Most District RCs are also too poorly
equipped to provide these schools with the required educational
support.
(d) Facilities. The rapid expansion of education (para. 2.04) has been
achieved through the intensive utilization of schools and teacher
training facilities: With regard to schools, there is still a
serious shortage of adequate facilities resulting in a large number
of oversized classes. About 19,000 primary classes (30% of the
tctal) and 7,000 secondary classes (21Z) enroll over 40 students.
Some 10,000 classes average 48 students and 1,000 classes even
exceed 50 students (Maps). In addition, the shortage of classrooms,
reflected in the respective classroom:class ratios of 73% and 602 in
primary and secondary education, results on average in more than
half of primary classes and 80% of secondary classes being schooled
in double shifts. This results in a reduction of instruction time
by 10%; precludes extracurricular activities which are an integral
part of the regular school programs; and generates commuting
hardships and hazards to students living far from school. Double
shifting has reached a critical level in secondary education due to
the students' heavier instruction program. On the other hand, 10%
of primary students (over 200,000) are enrolled in 2,400 dispersed
underenrolled primary schools (37% of the total number of schools),
with enrollments below 150 each, and uneconomically small classes of
about 18 (14 in Sabah). As for TTCs, there is a demand for more
teachers as the Government (a) is increasing the primary teacher:
class ratio from 1.2:1 to 1.5:1 and the number of teachers with
special functions, and (b) plans to reduce class size to a maximum
of 40 students and alleviate double shifting in all specific cases
when it critically affects education programs and students'
learning. This will gradually raise teacher demand by an estimated
25% over and above the needs resulting from enrollment increase and
teacher attrition. This, together with continuous retraining of
inservice teachers (para. 2.06), is taxing the TTCs. In addition,
eight TTCs do not have adequate facilities, as they were not



- 10 -
originally meant for teacher training. Extension of daily operation
time in a number of TTCs has made it possible to increase their
capacity from about 17,000 in 1984 to 20,000 in 1985. This process
will be expanded, despite resulting hardships for evening session
students, in order to cope with growing teacher demand (Annex 3).
Efficiency of Educational Management
2.19      The management of the education system is affected by major issues
relating to staff constraints and insufficient monitoring and evaluation
capacity.
(a) Staff Constraints. The rapid growth of the school population,
combined with the increased scarcity of resources, is presenting new
problems for planning and administration of the education sector.
As a consequence, in MOE divisions, the staff's practical qualifica-
tions need to be upgraded to ensure cost efficient formulation,
implementation, management and evaluation of educational policies
and programs. At state and district levels, a number of newly
appointed education officers still lack relevant exposure and train-
ing. At school level, only one fourth of headmasters (about 2,000)
have been able to attend the basic training course in managerial and
leadership skills, provided by the National Institute of Educational
Management (NIEM), established in 1979 and provided with adequate
facilities in 1983 under Loan 1657-MA.
(b) Monitoring and Evaluation. Although MOE and the universities carry
out valuable monitoring and evaluation activities, these activities
are insufficiently coordinated and systematic in the establishment
of their objectives, priorities and methodology, and in the process-
ing of their findings. Among the major fields of investigation
affected are teachers' attributes (para. 3.12) and effectiveness;
the utilization of facilities; progress in the distribution of new
facilities and resources, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak;
improvement in the quality and efficiency of education; national
integration through education; and the evaluation of educational
media, textbooks, examinations and testing, and students' employment
following skill training.
Access to Quality Education
2.20      The issues relating to access to quality education are imbalances in
the distribution of adequate academic facilities and insufficient provision of
student and staff accommodation:
(a) Distribution of Academic Facilities. The average classroom:student
ratios are 1:46 and 1:61 in primary and secondary schools, respec-
tively. Low as these averages may be, particularly in secondary
education, they conceal wide variations (Maps): in 59 of the 123
districts, the ratio at the secondary level is below the national
average and, in many instances, reaches critical levels beyond
1:100; the situation is similar for primary education in 44



- 11 -
districts. This cJmpounds the double shifting problem (para.
2.18d), particularly in the districts where the classroom:class
ratios are below the already low national averages, namely 55 dis-
tricts for primary and 59 districts for secondary education
(Annex 4). This situation affects both poorer states and states
where labor migration results in dense populations.
(b) Student and Staff Accommodation. In 1984, while a minimal 2Z of
primary students were boarders (mainly in Sarawak, because of the
extreme dispersion of population), 10% of secondary students were
accommodated at school. Although the cost of boarding is high, it
is required to (i) ensure universal primary education, (ii) enroLl
in secondary education able students from the poorest segments of
the population, who otherwise could not have access, and (iii)
recruit teacher trainees on a national basis according to the
Government's policy. Staff housing is provided to about 10,000 out
of 86,000 primary teachers, most of whom serve in the 5,400 rural
schooLs (out of a total of about 6,600 primary schools). Shortage
of staff housing in disadvantaged areas results in a high turnover
of qualified teachers. Although providing rural teachers with
decent accommodation would tax the investment budget, the benefits
would be increased commitment and efficiency of teachers in the most
remote areas of Malaysia where communications and living conditions
are extremely poor.
Government's Objectives and Strategy
2.21      The Bank has received a letter of policy for primary and secondary
education development, stating the Goverment's objectives and strategy, and a
plan of action on policy and institutional development (Annex 5). These
documents, agreeable to the Bank, precisely address the problems described in
the above paragraphs. They aim to improve the quality of education and subse-
quently students' achievement; increase managerial efficiency at all levels of
educational administration; and expand access to improved education equitably
throughout the country.
2.22      Quality of Education.  To address the issues described ir. paragraph
2.18, the Government's strategy calls for qualitative improvements in curri-
cula, teacher training, educational resources and facilities.
(a) Curricula. A New Primary School Curriculum (NPSC) was introduced in
Standard One in 1983 and will be taught in all primary grades by
1988. The NPSC aims at the overall growth of an individual, and
emphasizes mastery of reading, writing and arithmetic, and the
acquisition of knowledge and skills through attractive and meaning-
ful activities, relevant and useful to the students. To avoid the
previous subject dispersion, the NPSC is based on subject integra-
tion under broad headings, namely basic skills, man and environment,
moral and spiritual values and citizenship, art and recreation,
manual skills, and extracurricular activities to improve students'
responsibility for the upkeep of their schools, and the insertion of
schooling into the community at large. To improve continuity



- 12 -
between levels of education, a New Secondary School Curriculum
(NSSC), to follow upon the NPSC lines, will be introduced in 1988.
The NSSC will be oriented towards general education and teaching/
learning strategies focusing on citizenship qualities ard national
unity as well as relevant knowledge, creativity, moral and religious
values, and integrated living skills suited to modern living,
including manual and business skills, and computer literacy.
(b) Teachers. Since the late 1970s, positive steps have been taken to
make teacher training techniques and approaches more effective and
interesting. For instance, practice teaching has been increased,
the contents of teacher education curriculum have been constantly
reappraised, and extensive use of micro-;.eaching, language
laboratories and audio-visual equipment has been made. Presently
primary and secondary teacher training programs are being reoriented
to the new educational requirements, namely: integrated subjects,
multigroup teaching based on students' aptitudes, remedial
instruction, specialized training to teach Bahasa Malaysia as a
first language and English as a second language, activity-oriented
teaching methods, student achievement evaluation techniques, and
teaching/learning materials development and production. The objec-
tive is to supply primary and secondary schools with a better quali-
fied and creative teaching force by 1995. The teacher:class ratio
is being gradually raised from 1.2:1 to 1.5:1 to allow teachers
sufficient time to prepare their courses, correct students' assign-
ments, lead extra-curricular activities, and provide remedial
instruction under the new curricula. A number of studies indicate
that more time spent by teachers on class preparation ane close
evaluation of students' assignments resul;s in improved quality of
instruction and students' achievements.131 It is intended that all
schools will be staffed by teachers with special functions, to
improve remedial instruction in primary education; and guidance
counseling, library services, sports and media in secondary educa-
tion. The main objective of these teachers is to take care of
students' needs outside academic instruction. With regard to the
improvement of academic standards in secondary education, the
academic qualifications of the teaching force are being progres-
sively upgraded through the provision of a higher proportion of
university graduate teachers so that eventually all upper secondary
teachers and 40% of lower secondary teachers will be university
degree holders. All teacher trainers will be university degree or
postsecondary specialized diploma holders by 1995. The 600 present
trainers who have no post-secondary qualifications will be upgraded
through overseas fellowships or local training (para. 2.18b).
Studies conducted in several countries, and in Malaysia in
particular, indicate that teachers' total years of schooling and

Investments Boost Learning?", Discussion Paper, Education and Training

- 13 -
postsecondary instruction and teacher training will raise verbal
skills and teWXing effectiveness leading to higher students'
achievements.
(c)  Educational Resources.  As the new curricula, based on teachers' and
students' creativiry, require the availability of teaching/learning
materials, the Government's policy is to provide all primary schools
with resource facilities by 1995, including a library, audiovisual
equipment and media facilities, so that these schools can fully
benefit from the programs produced by the Educational Media Service
(para. 2.18c). District RCs (para. 2.15) would also be adequately
equipped to provide educational technology and staff upgrading
support to individual schools. It is generally recognized that
availability of texts, reading materials and instructional media,
the presence and active use of libraries, and better physical
facilities provide more motivating conditions for learning and raise
students' achievements.
(d)  Facilities.  With regard to schools (para. 2.18d), the Government's
policy is to adjust class size to the educational requirements of
the new curricula, and to alleviate double shifting, particularly in
secondary education, whenever it is crip,cally detrimental to
instruction or students' achievements.1' With regard to class
size, the two prongs of the government strategy for 1995 are:
(i) to reduce class size in crowded schools to 40, considered as a
maximum for efficient class management using aultigroup teaching
methods under the new activity-oriented curricula; and (ii) to
consolidate underenrolled schools to the extent possible into more
economical units with a minimum enrollment of 150 students each, so
that the average class size in these schools rises from 18 to about
24. It is assumed that by 1990, only the size of the 10,000 classes
averaging 48 students each, will have been reduced to 45, and that
the average class size in underenrolled schools will have reached
20, as a first step towards the 1995 targets. The Government
originally planned to virtually eliminate double shifting from
primary education and considerably reduce it in secondary education,
with respective classroom:class ratios reaching 95% and 85% by
14/ B. Fuller, pages 44 and 45.
15/ In "The Production Surface for Academic Achievement: An Economic Study
of the Malaysian Secondary Education", University of Wisconsin, 1972,
H. Beebout's findings are that (a) fewer students per teacher will
improve the quality of interaction and raise students' achievement, and
(b) more than one shift of classes per day will strain the effectiveness
of resources and lower achievement. Bridge, Judd and Moock (1979) also
indicate that more total hours spent in school on instructionaL activi-
ties will boost achievement. In Malaysian schools, rhe instruction time
normally required to deliver the curricula, has to be reduced due to
double shifting (para. 2.18 d). See also B. Fuller, pp. 36, 76 and 79.

1995. However, because of resource constraints and increasing
enrollments, this objective has been modified. The Government will
concentrate on expanding facilities only in those schools, mainly at
the secondary level, where double shifting is so widespread as to
prevent normal delivery of the curricula and cause hardships for
commuting students, detrimental to their learning process. With
regard to TTCs, the Government's strategy is to reach a total output
of about lG,000 new teachers annually to cope with the demand for
college-trained primary and lower secondary teachers, which will
peak in the late 1980s (Annex 3). This would require about 30,000
student places in the late 1980s, as compared with 20,000 in 1985.
To reach this goal and improve the quality of teacher training, the
Government plans to replace the eight inadequate TTCs as a priority
and expand a number of existing colleges, while extending daily
operation time in TTCs to the extent possible. By the same token,
this will help the Government implement its policy to establish TTCs
in all states. However, inadequate TTCs will be kept in operation
as long as teacher shortages prevail and then will be converted into
the type of schools which they were meant originally to be. The new
TTCs will be provided with boarding in order to recruit teacher
trainees on a national basis and to ensure the higher quality of
training generally provided through residential courses. The
secondary teacher training capacity of the universities will also be
expanded from the present 5,500 student places to about 6,800, to
increase the output from the present 1,800 to about 2,000 in the
early 1990s and meet the growing needs for graduate teachers
(para. 2.18b).
2.23      Efficiency of Educational Management.  To address managerial issues
(para. 2.19), the Government has initiated a comprehensive staff development
program; cost efficiency measures; and better coordination of monitoring and
evaluation activities.
(a) Staff Development Program. So far 5,000 education officers and
headmasters have been trained at NIEM which has also been instru-
mental in launching quality control circles throughout the educa-
tional management structure. The Governmert plans to expand this
into a comprehensive program to improve the quality of educational
development, management and evaluation in MOE divisions, SEDs and
DEOs, RCs and schools. Key officers will be selected for a variety
of training programs ranging from master's degree to short courses
abroad and locally. The key staff development program during the
1986-95 period will include an estimated 2,000 participants. A
priority list of about 140 fellowships abroad and 400 local fellow-
ships has been established. It includes key positions at NIEM, and
in ministerial divisions, SEDs, DEOs and resource centers, which
should be filled by adequately trained officers by 1990. NIEM, in
conjunction with the MOE Scholarships Division, will play a key role
in implementing all training programs which will address a total of
116,000 education officers and clerks, of whom 12,000 would be
headmasters, during the 10-year period 1986-1995.



- 15 -
(b) Cost-Efficiency Measures. The Government has initiated action to
reduce the number of underenrolled primary schools through consoli-
dating and gradually phasing out small schools with enrollments
below 70 students; to improve multigrade teaching to maximize the
utilization factor of underenrolled school facilities and teachers;
to develop more cost efficient school construction designs and
standards without lowering school quality or increasing maintenance
costs which will be kept minimal; and to increase the utilization
rates of secondary school facilities to no less than 80% for
classrooms and 75% for workshops and laboratories.
(c) Monitoring and Evaluation. The Government's monitoring and evalua-
tion capacity will be better coordinated and strengthened (para.
2.19). EPRD will be reinforced to provide leadership to, and
coordinate, the monitoring and evaluation activities carried out by
ministerial divisions (para. 2.14), universities, and private
educational agencies in Malaysia and abroad. The EPRD, in conjunc-
tion with universities and MOE divisions, will focus on assessing
progress in (i) provision of facilities, resources, qualified staff,
programs and methods, over the various districts, and (ii) policy
changes, institutional development, quality improvement and cost
efficiency. This will include research and evaluation studies
concentrating on the most cost efficient combinations of educational
quality inputs, and equity in the distribution of educational oppor-
tunities.
2.24      Access to Quality Education.  To alleviate the present imbalance in
educational opportunities (para. 2.20), the Government plans to: (a) provide
adequate school and educational resource facilities by priority to the dis-
tricts where their number and adequacy are below the national average, and
raise this average gradually, as equitably as possible throughout the country;
(b) achieve nine years of universal schooling (para. 2.03), and reach a
secondary enrollment ratio of over 80% by 1995, with primary and secondary
enrollments respectively totaling about 2,500,000 and 1,400,000 in 1990, and
2,800,000 and 1,700,000 by 1995 (Annex 6); (c) provide boarding to primary
students in rural areas, wherever it is the only feasible action to maintain
universal education and consolidate uneconomically small schools, and to able
secondary students from the poorest segments of the population, who otherwise
could not benefit from secondary education; (d) provide staff housing to
teachers in rural areas to improve their living conditions and thereby slow
down the rotation of qualified and experienced teachers in these areas; and
(e) expand the textbook loan scheme (para. 2.14) proportionaLly to the
increase in school population.
Government's Program
2.25      To carry out the above strategies, the MOE proposed a 10-year
primary and secondary education subsector investment program (1986-1995)
amounting to US$3.5 billion equivalent, including contingencies, of which
US$1.7 billion was proposed for the first five-year phase (1986-90) which
would coincide with the fifth Malaysia Plan period. However, during
discussions between the Government and the Bank, this program was scaled down



- 16 -
to focus on alleviation of the most serious deficiencies in line with expected
resources. The investment in primary and general secondary education under
the MOE, approved by the Cabinet for the first phase (1986-90) of the 10-year
program, amounts to US$757 million equivalent. Parliament's approval is
expected by late March 1986. The above subsector investment represents 35% of
the five-year allocation for the provision of new facilities for education
amounting to US$2.1 billion equivaLent. An additional US$261 million
equivalent for upgrading of existing facilities, US$63 million equivalent for
research and US$130 million equivalent for vocational training under
Government agencies other than the MOE, are also included in the comprehensive
education and training development program which amounts to a total of
US$2.6 billion equivalent. This represents 152 of the total investment
program under the federal budget for the Fifth Malaysia Plan period, and ranks
second after land development (15.2%). This reflects the top priority given
by the Government to education and manpower development at large. The first
investment slice of about US$313 million equivalent, to be financed by the
project, would specifically focus on the provision of new facilities for
primary and general secondary education under the MOE. It would be followed
by two overlapping slices of about US$175 million equivalent each, which could
be initiated in 1988 and 1989, respectively, and for which Bank financing has
been requested by the Government. An additional US$94 million equivalent have
been earmarked for the remainder of the Fourth Malaysia Plan program to be
completed independently, along with the first slice of the new program.
2.26      Assessment of the Program.  The Government's policy for the next ten
years is educatioially sound and the Government's plan of action gives
substance and meaxiing to this policy. However, as the scope of the original
investment program had to be reduced, the Government's ambitious quality-
oriented reform of primary and secondary education, requiring more staff and
facilities, will have to be slowed down. The original ten-year program
targets will therefore need to be rephased over a 15-year period, to end in
the year 2000, in order to remove the remaining shortcomings, unless the
current economic outlook changes significantly. However, the scaled-down
program, which prioritizes the MOE's objectives for 1986-90, remains
substantial and important. It calls for: (a) expanding school facilities in
the districts where shortages of facilities are most acute; (b) replacing the
most inadequate TTCs; (c) providing the necessary educational resources to
implement the new curricula on which the whole qualitative reform of primary
and secondary education is based; (d) training key education developers and
managers; and (e) studying major issues affecting the sector.
2.27      The increase in the teacher:class ratio, in the number of teachers
with special functions and in teachers' academic qualifications, and the
reduction of class size to a maximum of 45 in crowded schools, together with
the additional requirements for educational materials, are expected to
increase the share of education in the total government recurrent budget by an
estimated 24% in 1990.  The variouc strategies will have the following impact
on the increase in real cost: In primary education, increases in enrollment
will account for 212 of the cost increases; the addition of remedial teachers
7%; increases in the teacher:class ratio 24X; the reduction of class size 3%;
additional materials 29%; and real salary increase 16%. In secondary educa-
tion, the increase in enrollments will account for 37% of the increase in



- 17 -
cost; the addition of teachers with special functions 24Z; the increased
proportion of graduate secondary teachers 15%; the elimination of classes over
45 2%; and real salary increases 22Z (Annex 7). Under these conditions, the
MOE recurrent budget in 1990 would represent 21Z of the total federal recur-
rent budget, as compared with the recent 17Z. This increased share is within
the historic budgetary limits (26Z in 1972). Moreover, the Government
considers the proposed development of the primary and secondary education
subsector as one of the top priorities of the Fifth Malaysia Plan and is
prepared to meet the above recurrent budgetary implications of its policy and
investment in the subsector. Therefore, the MOE is likely to be able to
implement its overall policy, although it may have to slow down its strategy
to increase the teacher:class ratio and the number of teachers with special
functions.
Experience with Past Bank Lending to Education and Bank Objectives
2.28      The Government's present overall education policy and strategies are
the re3ult of a long-term continuing process which the Bank has already sup-
ported through seven education loans since 1969 for a total amount of US$230.2
million. This lending program has aimed to expand and improve basic educa-
tion, and provide trained manpower for industrial development through support
to primary and secondary education and related teacher training, and tech-
nical/vocational training at secondary and postsecondary levels. The proposed
project follows more specifically upon the Third, Fourth and Fifth Education
Projects (Loans 974-MA, 1329-HA and 1657-MA) which aimed inter alia to: (a)
improve the quality and e'ficiency of education through the development of the
curricula which are being implemented presently; teacher and managerial staff
training; and expansion of educational resources, radio and television; and
(b) equalize educational opportunities and reduce double shifting throughout
the country through the provision of 850 primary and 83 secondary schools,
including laboratories and workshops, boarding and staff housing.
2.29      Significant Bank support has also been given to institution build-
ing. The manpower, authority and management skills of MOE's Development and
Supplies Division (DSD), which has been in charge of planning and implementing
the seven education loans, was strengthened through the implementation of the
Fourth and Fifth Education Projects. The improvement of DSD has been reflect-
ed in the implementation of the newer projects largely on schedule. DSD's
efficiency is expected to be further increased shortly through computerization
of its operations under the Government's own resources. Also, the establish-
ment of NIEM has already started improving efficiency in the management of the
education system. The capability of the Faculty of Education of the
University of Malaya to produce high caliber evaluation of completed Bank
projects has been instrumental in improving the design of new projects, and
the University of Science Malaysia, is now being contracted by the MOE to
prepare the project completion report of the Fifth Education Project (Loan
1657-MA) along similar lines. The Bank has also assisted the MOE's Curriculum
Development Center and Educational Media Service which are now among the best
in the region.



- 18 -
2.30      The OED audit report and project completion reports,16/ prepared for
the first four education projects, concluded that these projects were success-
fully implemented overall, despite delays, and their educational objectives
were achieved. Other points of interest were the need for: (a) strengthening
the staff and authority of the project implementation unit, and (b) acquiring
sites at an early stage in project processing. These lessons were incorpo-
rated in the design of the following three education projects and the Fifth
Education Project was recently completed on schedule.
Rationale for Bank Lending to Primary and Secondary Education
2.31      Primary and secondary education are the subsectors where the need
for improvement in quality and efficiency is the greatest because they involve
the majority of students (97% of total enrollments) and education costs (80Z
of the MOE budget), and because they are the foundation on which the effi-
ciency of the whole education structure depends. In addition, the Government
has embarked on a major program to industrialize the country, looking to
Korea, Japan and other developed countries where higher enrollment ratios and
quality of education were instrumental in reaching high levels of industrial
diversification and technology. In Malaysia, comparable education deveLopment
might result in some unemployment among secondary school graduates and educa-
tional cost overruns. However, this risk is offset by Malaysia's economic
orientation which provides a strong rationale to improve and strengthen the
education base. In addition, the Government has worked in close cooperation
with the Bank to establish its policy and strategies, and the realistic and
balanced scaling down of the original 1986-90 education development program
also constitutes a positive outcome of the dialogue maintained with the
Bank. The proposed project would encourage the Government to continue this
collaboration with the Bank. The overall size of the project and the respec-
tive weights of its inputs are consistent with the most urgent needs and
government priorities in the education sector. Also, the MOE's increasing
efficiency in program implementation has been demonstrated by the most
recently completed project, tihe MOE's performance d- ring the Fourth Malaysia
Plan period (para. 4.01), and the careful and expeditious preparation of the
proposed project (para. 4.08). This augurs well for the success of the
project, the scope of which is well within the MOE's implementation capa-
city. Through the project, the Bank would also take advantage of its long-
term involvement in the development of primary and secondary education in
Malaysia to further its fruitful dialogue with the Government on the stra-
tegies and institutional changes for the sector, which would reconcile the
need for a stronger education base and its fiscal implications.

3. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Strategy
3.01      The proposed project would constitute the first subsector investment
slice, under the Fifth Malaysia Plan, of the Government's 10-year program to
improve the quality of education, increase the efficiency of educational
management and expand access to better primary and secondary education oppor-
tunities, with priority given to areas of greatest need (para. 2.25). To
achieve this goal, the project would help accelerate the policy and institu-
tional changes described in the Government's letter of policy which sets out
the Government's perception of the issues affecting primary and secondary
education, and states its objectives to alleviate the deficiencies
(para. 2.21).  Mu. specifically, the project would assist in carrying out the
Government's plan of action on policy and institutional development (Annex 5).
3.02      To assist with the above policy and institutional development objec-
tives, the proposed project would include four national level programs (one
each for teacher training, educational resources, staff development and
studies) and 13 state Level programs, comprising primary and secondary schools
and related boarding and staff housing facilities (Annex 8). The national
level programs would address educational needs of the whole Federation of
Malaysia, whereas the state level programs would address specific educational
needs of the various states. The national level programs would be implemented
under the responsibility of central education authorities and the state level
programs under the responsibility of state authorities, although in both
cases, central and local authorities vould operate in close cooperation
(Annex 9). The national and state level programs would each include a number
of subprojects as follows: Among national level programs, (a) teacher train-
ing would include three subprojects, one for each of the three TTCs, the
implementation of which would be supervised by three respective state Public
Works Departments (PWD); (b) educational resources would include two subproj-
ects to be monitored by two different agencies, one for schGol library books,
the other for equipment and materials for schools and district resource
centers; (c) staff development would include two subprojects to be managed
separately, one for fellowships abroad, the other for local training, includ-
ing specialist services; and (d) stuidies would include six subprojects, one
for each of the implementation agencies involved. The HOE Appraisal Committee
has identified 26 subprojects, namely 13 for primary and 13 for secondary
education within the state level programs. Each subproject would include a
variable number of district components, each of which would in turn comprise a
number of school, boarding and staff housing facilities. Primary and second-
ary education subprojects would be monitored respectively by the primary and
secondary school sections of DEOs and SEDs.
3.03      The Government, in close cooperation with the Bank, has established
general eligibility criteria for approval of programs and subprojects
(Annex 10), and specific criteria for identification and appraisal of programs
and subprojects (Annex 11). These criteria which have been applied by the
Government to the development and appraisal of the proposed project, ensure
that project objectives would be met. The specific criteria 'or each type of
program and subproject have been established on the basis of the following



- 20 -
common considerations: relevance to the priority needs to be met during the
Fifth Malaysia Plan; timely land acquisition; local implementation capability;
technical feasibility within approved norms and standards; and efficiency
(facility utilization rates, unit costs, staff resources and recurrent
budgetary allocacions). Also, guidelines and criteria for allocation of loan
funds (Annex 12) would ensure that these funds are distributed over the
various programs and subprojects according to their specific features, degree
of sophistication and cost, and the emphasis placed on them. The following
paragraphs summarize the Government's action plans to achieve its subsector
development objectives.  The Government's inves:ment program funds, including
contingencies, would be allocated as follows: (a) improving quality:
US$93 million, or 30% of the total program; (b) increasing efficiency:
US$8 million, or 2%; and (c) expanding access: US$212 million, or 68%
(Annex 13).
Improving the Quality of Education
3.04      Teacher Training Program.  Three new TTCs would be provided to
replace the most inadequate teacher training facilities presently located in
primary and secondary schools. The new TTCs would enroLl a total of 4,000
students of whom about 80% would be boarders. The TTCs would be located so
that the remaining 20% could be accommodated within the local communities.
The new TTCs would also enroll about 600 professionally unqualified teachers
on temporary contracts during the final residential year of their upgrading
program (para. 2.06). The capacity of the new TTCs wouLd represent 20Z of the
1985 teacher training capacity and over 13% of the planned capacity required
to cope with the college-trained teacher demand (para. 2.22d). The 280
trainers required will be recruited from among the most experienced graduate
teachers and specialized diploma holders within the education system. In
order to ensure adequate complementarity betsween TTC training and graduate
teacher training within the universities, during negotiations, agreement was
reached on performance indicators for the training of certificate, diploma and
graduate teachers for primary and secondary education for the period 1986-95
(para. 5.01a).
3.05      Educational Resources Program.  Financing would be provided for:
(a) about 8 million library books for the 6,600 primary schools; (b) bookcases
for the 4,700 most underprivileged rural schools; and (c) audio-visual and
educational material production equipment for the 5,400 rural primary schools
and the 350 District RCs (para. 2.22c). Inservice training for primary teach-
ers in the use of library books and audiovisual aids is provided through
regular inservice upgrading courses (para. 2.06).
3.06      The thrust of the program is to improve the standard and quality of
universal primary education for nearly 2.5 million children by 1990, with
particular regard to the most disadvantaged rural schools where reading mate-
rials and educational radio and TV programs (well developed and effectively
used in many areas) are rare. Therefore, a major objective is to provide each
primary schooL with a minimum of five library books per child by 1990 through
supplementing the school libraries of the 1,900 larger schools (over 350 stl-
dents), where two to three books are already available per student, and esta-
blishing new libraries in the 4,700 smaLler schools.



- 21 -
3.07      The 5,400 rural primary schools would also be provided with a basic
set of audiovisual aids and equipment to benefit from the high quality
programs produced by the Educational Media Service of the MOE (para. 2.14).
This would be part of the classroom "resource corners", the use of which is
emphasized by the NPSC in its active group learning approach.
3.08      Each District RC would be provided with complementary equipment to
give the teachers from 15 to 20 surrounding satellite schools, the opportunity
to produce a greater range and variety of teaching-learning materials than in
their own schools. The RCs would also be provided with more elaborate
equipment to be borrowed for use in the satellite schools. The RCs would also
serve as decentralized inservice training locations for teachers to attend
orientation and awareness training sessions to improve their day-to-day
service.
3.09      School Facilities.  The provision of adequate school facilities to
improve the quality of education would also serve the policy objective to
increase access to improved education described in paragraph 3.14 below.
Increasing the Efficiency of Educational Management
3.10      Staff Development Program.  The program would finance the
fellowships required to fill urgently needed key positions at federal, state,
district and school levels by 1990 (para. 2.23a). This would include:
(a) about 40 Master's Degree fellowships abroad for NIEM instructors, the
Teacher Education and Schools Divisions (including SED staff), and the Curri-
cul§'.un Development Center; (b) about 100 intensive study fellowships abroad for
the above units (including SED and DEO staff) and for the Federal
Inspectorate, the Educational Media Service, EPRD and DSD, and State RCs;
(c) about 400 three-month intensive local training fellowships to be provided
at NIEM; and (d) 45 man-months of specialist services for 15 specialized
instructors to assist for three months each with the delivery of the local
training programs at NIEN. Thirteen to 14 candidates for Master's Degree
fellcwships would be sent overseas each year between 1986 and 1988; 20 to 30
candidates for intensive studies abroad would start their fellowships each
year between 1986 and 1989; and about 80 MOE officers would be trained locally
and nine man:.'maths of specialist services would be utilized annually over the
five-year program period. During negotiations, agreement was reached on terms
of reference, procedures and timetables for the proposed overseas and local
training fellowships and specialist services (para. 5.01b). In addition, the
Government provided assurances that adequate operational funds would be made
available for: (a) NIEM to carry out the local training programs included in
the program; and (b) the MOE Scholarships Division to implement its fellow-
ships program through 1990 (paras. 5.02a and b).
3.11      The Staff Development Program would focus on:  (a) managerial
sub,ects including statistics, planning and school mapping, education finance,
administration and supervision, and project development, implementation and
evaluation; (b) general methodology areas such as educational research,
curricuLum development, educational technology, testing and measurement,
remediaL instruction, and guidance and counseling; and (c) specific subject
methodology relating to educational psychology, sociology of education,



- 22 -
languages, business and technical education, mathematics and sciences,
computer science education, physical and health education, music, education
for the deaf and the blind, automotive, engineering and landscaping. For SED
and DEO staff, the courses would concentrate on educational planning, school
mapping and management at state and district levels, education finance, media
techniques and evaluation, and project development, implementation and
evaluation.
3.12      Studies Program.  The program would finance five research studies to
refine the analysis of major issues affecting the quality, cost efficiency and
equity in education. They would be part of the Government's efforts to
improve educational development planning and qualitative assessment of the
education system, and further increase the efficiency of investments in
education. They would also contriblite to preparing future Bank loans in the
sector. The studies would include: (a) an analysis of the relationship
between teachers' attributes (including qualifications, experience, salary,
inservice upgrading, career development, etc.) and teachers' effectiveness;
(b) an analysis of the management and effectiveness of school facilities,
particularly laboratories and workshops, and also the RCs, to assess the
linkage between the Level of sophistication of specialized facilities and
equipment, the curricula and the educational outcomes; (c) school mapping for
Sabah and Sarawak, similar to that recently completed for Peninsular Malaysia,
to assess the specific features and needs of these two states where
substantial educational development will be required in the foreseeable future
in view of the dispersion and diversity of population; (d) an analysis of the
interactions among educational inputs and ratios, socio-economic and environ-
mental factors, and students' achievement and employment, to assess their
degree of linkage, the thresholds at which inputs have a sizeable impact, and
the most cost efficient mix of educational inputs in the various social,
ethnic and economic contexts of the country; and (e) an analysis of the
national integration process in the education setting. In addition, the
Government would evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the educational
media service, the textbook loan scheme, and the evaluation and testing sys-
tem. Tracer studies on graduates from polytechnics, and technical and
vocational schools would also be undertaken.
3.13      The program would provide 24 man-months of specialist services to
assist universities and EPRD, whenever convenient, in the three-year period
(1986-1989) during which the studies are planned to be carried out. Although
this program is minor in financial terms, its impact would be essential to the
Government's search for improved cost efficiency and to strengthen the coord-
inating role of EPRD in monitoring and evaluating the quality of education.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on terms of reference, procedures
and timetables for the proposed research studies (para. 5.Olc}.
Expanding Access to Better Education
3.14      Schools Programs.  The programs would finance the construction,
equipping and furnishing of about 3,300 classrooms and related boarding and
staff housing facilities (depending on the types and standards of construction
elected in the various areas concerned) in the districts where availability of
educational facilities is below national average (para. 2.24). These



- 23 -
districts are located in poorer states such as Kedah or Kelantan, in states
where labor migration has resulted in dense populations such as Johore,
Pinang, Selangor and the FederaL Territory, or in Sabah and Sarawak where
educational needs are still among the cost acute in the Federation
(Annex 14). About 1,100 primary classrooms and related facilities would be
completed annually in CY1987 and 1988 and about 400 secondary classrooms and
related facilities would be completed each year between CY 1987 and 1989. The
program would provide about 92,000 new student places in primary eaucation and
about 40,000 new places in secondary education benefiting (because of double
shifting of some facilities) over 120,000 primary and about 60,000 secondary
students. These state level programs would accommodate about 5Z of the
primary and secondary students planned to be enrolled in 1990, and would
alleviate the most critical shortages of school facilities. Extensions would
be added to existing schools to establish more cost efficient consolidated
primary schools, and relieve the pressure in crowded secondary schools.
Critically dilapidated classrooms would also be replaced. Administrative and
specialized facilities (e.g. multipurpose rooms and libraries) would be added,
as required. Boarding, particularly for secondary education, and staff
housing, mainly for primary schools in rural areas, would be included
(para. 2.24). The estimated 100 headmasters required to manage the new
schools, -ould be hired from among the most experienced teachers, and the
7,500 teachers required to staff the new schools, would be provided by exist-
ing TTCs and universities.
4. HANACEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Government's Project Implementatior capacity
4.01      The proposed project was prepared and would be implemented by the
MOE, with selective review of national level programs and sample state level
programs by the Bank. The project would be well within the implementation
capacity of the MOE whose construction program would comprise the 3,300 class-
rooms and related boarding and staff housing facilities, and the TTCs under
the proposed project; five pol-technics under the First and Second Industrial
Training Projects (sixth and seventh education loans Nos. 2145-MA and 2601-
MA); and 18 ADB-financed secondary vocational schools, which are already well
underway. As a comparison, during the first four years of the Fourth Halaysia
Plan (1981-85), the MOE completed about 15,000 classrooms while being simul-
taneously involved in the construction of nine secondary vocational schools,
three TTCs and one polytechnic. It is estimated that the MOE capacity for the
primary and secondary education subsector during the Fifth Malaysia Plan
period could be about 20,000 classrooms. Moreover, DSD, the MOE project
implementation unit, has increased in size and efficiency since it started
operations in 1969 (para. 2.29). While the first four education projects were
completed two to three years behind appraisal schedules, the Fifth Education
Project (Loan 1657-MA) was closed on schedule on June 30, 1985.

The Sector Approach
4.02      The proposed project was developed and prepared with a sector
approach stemming from the long-term dialogue and cooperation with the Bank in
relation to policies and programs for the education sector at large
(para. 2.28). The sector approach is based on a general agreement on the
Government's letter of policy and related plan of action for the 10-year
period 1986-95 (para. 3.01). The MOE has already appraised in detail most of
the proposed subprojects on the basis of agreed criteria (para. 3.03). The
sector approach is also recommended as the most efficient way to cope with the
diversity and wide coverage of programs and subprojects, spread throughout the
country, which could not all be appraised and supervised by Bank missions. Tn
addition, this approach would permit faster and more flexible financing based
on global program expenditures and not on individuaL project items. It is
also a desirable way of further strengthening the program management capaciry
in governmernt agencies. Moreover, the present project is likely to be the
first of a sequence of sectoral operations in the next ten years, guided by
the same agreed policy and plan of action, with possible adjustments over the
years.
4.03      The sector approach is also based on the Government's capability to
manage comprehensive education sector development programs. In this respect,
the proposed project would continue and improve past educational achievements
in the education sector (para. 2.04), assisted by successful Bank-financed
projects (para. 2.28), which have demonstrated the Government's ability to
prepare, monitor, implement and evaluate sectoral projects through its own
institutions (para. 2.29). This has been confirmed by the comprehensive
preparation and appraisal tasks (Annex 15) carried out carefully and expedi-
tiously by a MOE Appraisal Committee established in 1984 under the chairman-
ship of a Deputy Director General, and its six specialized subcommittees in
charge of teacher training, schools, school libraries, resource equipment and
materials, staff development, and studies. The project has been prepared and
appraised in cooperation with SEDs and in conformity with the procedure for
generating and processing programs and subprojects (Chart 7), and guidelines
and criteria (para. 3.03) acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, agree-
ment was reached on further appraisal and implementation of the project
according to these agreed criteria, procedures and guidelines (para. 5.01d).
Organization, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.04      The proposed project wouLd be implemented under the responsibility
of the Development Committee (DC) of the MOE (para. 2.11). The DC would be
assisted in its tasks by a Joint Secretariat including MOE staff from EPRD
(Chart 8) and DSD (Chart 9), operating in conjunction with the Economic
Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's Department, the Ministry of Finance
(Treasury), the Public Works Department and other government agencies (Chart
10) generally operating through the specialized subcommittees referred to in
paragraph 4.03. These subcommittees would manage, monitor and evaluate the
program they had appraised (Annex 9). Through these subcommittees, the proj-
ect would promote practical cooperation between MOE divisions and other
government agencies. The staff of the agencies in charge of project implemen-
tation are sufficient, dedicated and competent. The Joint Secretariat would



- 25 -
liaise with the efficient trouble-shooting State and District Action
Committees, which include representatives from all government agencies
involved, and are in charge of monitoring development programs at their
respective levels, under the chairmanship of the state Chief Ministers and the
District Officers; and with the Implementation Coordination Unit (ICU) within
the Prime Minister's Department, in charge of moritoring physical and finan-
cial progress of national projects at the central level. DSD would be gener-
ally in charge of physical and financial program implementation, including
general supervision and procurement of equipment, furniture and materials,
while detailed supervision of civil works would be carried out by PWD at the
district and state levels in cooperation with MOE district education officers.
4.05      Progress in policy changes, institutional development and quality
improvement would be generally assessed by EPRD in conjunction with appropri-
ate universities, MOE divisions and specialized subcommittees. EPRD would
establish performance indicators to monitor and evaluate progress in the dis-
tribution of educacion facilities and resources by district; improvement in
education quality and cost efficiency; and the level of related education
expenditures. The project-financed studies would contribute to this assess-
ment which would be the basis for the joint Government-World Bank annual
project implementation review (para. 4.07). Performance indicators were
prepared by the Government on the basis of key targets selected from the
Government's Letter of policy and plan of action (para. 3.01). These
indicators relate particuLarly to physical implementation and related capital
and recurrent expenditures, and qualitative improvements such as the reform of
curricula, progress in teacher and managerial staff training and upgrading,
reduction of class size, expansion of multigrade teaching, and increased
utilization of educational resources. During negotiations, agreement was
reached on the above performance indicators (para. 5.01e).
Implementation Procedures
4.06      Procedures for implementation of the civil works component and for
equipment procurement and technical assistance, acceptable to the Bank for
previous similar project components, would be applied to the proposed
project. The project would be implemented in four years between June 1986 and
June 1990 according to the implementation schedule given in Annex 16. The
Completion Date would be June 30, 1990 and the ul>sing Date June 30, 1991.
The critical implementation dates are given in Annex 17.
Reporting
4.07      Following district and state periodic reviews, the Joint Secretariat
(para. 4.04) would report progress on a semi-annual basis to the Development
Committee. These reports would assess quantitative physical progress as well
as quality and cost efficiency improvement, as compared with agreed key per-
formance indicators (Annex 18). They would be sent to the Bank for comments
by March and September of each year, and would form the basis of annual
project implementation review meetings to be held between the Government and
the Bank by October of each year, during which targets for the subsequent year
would be established. An in-depth mid-term review of progress towards the



- 26 -
targets of the government education investment program would also take place
with the Bank about October 1988. During negotiations. agreement was reached
on the above annual and mid-term review meetings and reports to be implemented
according to the above schedules (para. 5.01f).
Status of Project Preparation
4.08      A comprehensive survey of educational needs was completed in
November 1984 for the preparation of the Fifth Halaysia Plan. In May 1985 the
SEDs established a detailed priority list of school facilities by district, to
be implemented under the project, in conformity with the draft appraisal
guidelines and requirements agreed with the Bank (para. 4.03), including,
above all, availability of sites. The list was reviewed by the MOE Appraisal
Committee and adjusted to the amount of funds allocated to the subsector.
Sites have already been acquired for the TTCs and most of the schools, and are
at various stages of acquisition for a few remaining schools. The designs for
one TTC are completed and those for the other two TTCs are being revised
according to more cost-efficient standards suggested by the Bank. Contractors
are being prequalified for TTCs. Standard school designs will be used for
primary and secondary classrooms. Standard equipment lists for the schools
and TTCs are being adjusted to the new curricula, and lists of library bc-ks
are being completed. Bidding and contract documents for books, equipment and
civil works are being prepared. The commercial terms in the bidding documents
utilized for previous Bank education loans with similar project components
would continue to be used. The fellowship program is being finalized;
advertizing for prospective candidates for the proposed fellowships is being
prepared; and contacts with foreign educational institutions for the
fellowship program have been made. Draft terms of reference, procedures and
timetables for the proposed studies have been completed. The proposed pro-
grams, as appraised by the MOE Appraisal Committee, were approved by the MOE
Development Committee (para. 2.11) in September 1985. At the time of negotia-
tions: (a) tender documents were 90% completed for one TTC and construction
documents were about 70% completed for the other two TTCs; (b) civil works had
started for an estimated 102 of the schools; the tendering process had started
for another 60Z of the schools; and designs for the remaining schools were
underway; (c) tenders were called for school library books and the bidding
documents for equipment and materials were under completion; (d) contractual
arrangements with overseas institutions for the first group of fellowships and
selection of specialists for the first local training courses were being
finalized; (e) the terms of reference for the agencies and specialists in
charge of studies were completed. During negotiations, agreement was reached
on space standards for school classrooms (para. 5.01g).
Investment Program and Financing
4.09      The project is estimated to cost US$312.8 million equivalent,
including US$265.1 million baseline costs and US$47.7 million contingencies.
The project would be implemented over the five years of the Fifth Malaysia
Plan as shown ;n Annex 19. The funds would be distributed by category of
expenditure as follows: 78Z of baseline costs for civil works; 20% for
equipment, furniture and books; and 2% for technical assistance, as shown in
Table 1. Baseline costs have been adjusted to prices in March 1986, the date

of negotiations. Costs include duties and taxes on building materials
amounting to an estimated US$5.0 million equivalent, representing about 1.6%
of total project costs. Equipment and teaching materials imported under the
project would be exempt from duties and taxes.
4.10      The Bank loan of US$127.0 million equivalent would finance the
foreign exchange component of the project cost, excluding duties and taxes.
The Government would finance the remaining costs of US$185.8 million equiva-
lent. The overall financing plan is indicated in Annex 20.
4.11      Basis of Cost Estimates.  Construction costs for the primary and
secondary schools have been estimated at US$170 per square meter and those for
the TTCs range from US$240 for ancillary facilities to US$660 for the lecture
theatre which includes air-conditioning and insulation. The average unit cost
per square meter for most TTC facilities is US$350.  Site works have been
estimated to cos: from 10% to 20% of building costs. These estimates are
consistent with the recent costs of similar schools and colleges in Peninsular
Malaysia.  In addition, based on MOE's past experienyE  primary and secondary
school construction costs in a number of districts,-  and in Sarawak and
Sabah would be significantly higher due to higher labor costs, the need for
more extensive site works, lesser competition in bidding and, above all,
costly transportation. Furniture and equipment costs are estimated on the
basis of standard MOE master-lists and the experience of previous similar
project components, adjusted to the new curricula. Unit costs for overseas
fellowships are estimated at about US$2,000 per man-month for long-term and
US$4,500 per man-month for short-term fellowships, all inclusive, on the basis
of the recent experience of the MOE Scholarships Division. Local training
costs are estimated at US$370 per man-month. Unit costs for specialist
services are estimated on the basis of recently negotiated contracts and
include external and internal travel, accommodation and subsistence.
4.12      The unit areas and construction costs for schools and TTCs are
generally between recent Bank median and high values for comparable facilities
worldwide (Annex 21). In primary schools, unit areas are high because of the
specialized facilities needed to implement the new activity-oriented curri-
cula. In TTCs, the high unit areas and costs reflect the Government's desire
to adjust facilities to the new curriculum requirements and provide a high
standard of training. Utilization rates for classrooms (80 to 85% in second-
ary schools and TTCs, and over 90% in primary schools) and workshops and
laboratories (70 to 75%) would be cost efficient.
4.13      Foreign Exchange.  The foreign exchange cc-ponent of US$127.0
million, representing 41% of the total project cost, excluding duties and
taxes, has been computed on the basis of 35% for civil works; 15% for profes-
sional services; 25% for furniture and books; 90% for equipment, fellowships
abroad and specialist services; and 20% for studies and local training.

4.14      Contingency Allowances.  Physical contingencies have been computed
on the basis of 5% for technical assistance and 10% for all other cate-
gories. Price contingencies, which are equivalent to about 7% of base costs
plus physical contingencies, were calculated in accordance with the implemen-
tation schedule and the following expected average annual price increases: 5%
for 1986 through 1990 for domestic price inflation, and for foreign costs,
7.2% for 1986; 6.8% for 1987 and 1988; 7.0% for 1989; and 7.1Z for 1990.
4.15      Incremental Recurrent Cost.  The estimated incremental annual
recurrent cost generated by the proposed project, when all schools and colle-
ges are operating at full capacity, would be abo-t US$84 million equivalent at
1990 prices. This would represent about 3% of the MOE operating budget,
assuming that this budget grows at about 11% p.a., including real growth and
inflation (para. 2.27).
4.16      Maintenance.  Previous Bank financed facilities have, with few
exceptions, been well maintained. The Government provides adequate budgetary
allocations for acceptable annual maintenance.
Procurement
4.17      Civil works contracts for the three TTCs (estimated to cost a total
of US$41.1 million including contingencies) would be awarded on the basis of
ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. The primary and secondary education
facilities are dispersed over 80 districts and are unlikely to draw interest
from international firms. Therefore, contracts for these facilities would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in which for-
eign firms would be allowed to participate in accordance with the government
procurement procedures which have been acceptabLe to the Bank in previous
similar projects. This is justified because contracts would be small and
locations scattered; Malaysia's construction industry is large and efficient;
and all civil works in the first five projects relating to primary and secon-
dary education have been awarded to local contractors even though foreign
firms were allowed to tender. The project procurement arrangements are shown
in Table 2.
4.18      Equipment and furniture would be grouped to the extent possible into
attractive bid packages to facilitate bulk procurement. Packages estimated to
cost US$200,000 equivalent or more would be awarded on the basis of ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. In bid comparison, domestic suppliers would
be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing
imports or the actual customs duties, whichever is lower. Below this thres-
hold, equipment and furniture packages which, because of content, are not
expected to interest foreign suppliers, would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with government procure-
ment practices which are acceptable to the Bank. The aggregate of such
packages would not exceed US$13.1 million and would represent about 15% of
equipment and 70% of furniture costs. Miscellaneous items in packages not
exceeding US$35,000 in value and aggregating US$5.0 million, i.e. about 10% of
furniture and equipment costs, would be purchased on the basis of at least
three price quotations or through Treasury contracts for bulk procurement, as
agreed with the Bank in previous projects. Books and instructional materials

would be procured in accordance with normal government procedures which have
been acceptable to the Bank for previous projects. All specialists would be
selected in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants, and
fellowships abroad and local training would be arranged according to agreed
criteria for fellowship selection (Annex 11) and through negotiated contracts
acceptable to the Bank. Contracts awarded under ICB would amount to about
US$72.3 million, i.e., 23% of total project cost including contingencies and
31% of the loan would finance this type of procurement.
4.19      Prior Bank approval of sketch plans, bidding documents and contract
awards would be limited to the three TTCs, in view of the adequate capabili-
ties of DSD (para. 2.29) and PWD, responsible for survey, design, tendering
and supervision of projects. In all other cases, the Government would con-
firm, without submitting designs, bidding documents and contracts, that this
documentation would conform to agreed schedules of accommodation, construction
standards and guidelines. Contract awards for furniture and equipment, valued
at US$200,000 or more each, would also be subject to prior Bank review. This
review would cover an estimated 30% of the contracts and over 60Z of their
value according to recent contract profiles for similar project components.
Disbursement
4.20      The proposed sector investment loan of US$127.0 million would be
disbursed over a period of five years (July 1986-June 1991). Disbursements
would be made on the basis of: (a) 40% of the cost of civil works and profes-
sional services; (b) 100Z of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment, furniture
and books; (c) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment,
furniture and books; (d) 70% of the cost of imported equipment, furniture and
books procured locally; and (e) 100% of the cost of specialist services and
fellowships. For disbursements relating to miscellaneous items such as small
furniture and equipment, teaching materials, specialist services and fellow-
ships, and a few primary school construction contracts, costing below
US$200,000, statements of expenditures (SOEs) would be used. In this case,
supporting documents and contracts would be retained by DSD and made available
for review by visiting Bank missions. All other disbursements would be made
against full documentation.
4.21      The disbursement forecast (Annex 22) indicates that the proposed
loan would be disbursed at a faster pace than the Bankwide and regional aver-
ages for education projects and the most recent general education project in
Malaysia (the Fifth Education Project, Loan 1657-MA). This is feasible
because of the improved efficiency and implementation capacity of DSD
(para. 2.29), the advanced status of project preparation (para. 4.08), the
routine character of most operations, and the fact that the total project
works are well within the MOE's implementation capacity (para. 4.01) due to
the limitation imposed by constraints on resources.
4.22      Special Account.  To ensure that funds for the project would be made
available as soon as needed, a Special Account, operated by DSD, would be
established in a bank in Malaysia with an initial deposit of up to US$8.5 mil-
lion, approximately equivalent to the Bank's share of four months of estimated



- 32 -
expenditure during the first four years of project implementation. Applica-
tions for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted when the
balance of the Special Account reaches about 50Z of the initial deposit or
US$4.0 million. These applications would be supported by documentary evidence
or SOEs, whichever is applicable, of payments made from the account for goods
and services eligible for Bank financing under the project. A matching
revolving fund for counterpart funds is not required as such funds are
committed and readily available within the Treasury as soon as the project
budget is approved by the Government.
4.23      Retroactive Financing.  In view of the advanced state of project
preparation (para. 4.08) and to ensure a prompt start-up of project opera-
tions, expenditures on civil works and related professional services, con-
struction materials and equipment, books and technical assistance, incurred as
from January 1, 1986, would be financed retroactively up to a totaL of US$6.0
million equivalent (para. 5.03).
Accounts and Audit
4.24      Separate accounts for all project activities would be maintained by
DSD in accordance with sound accounting practices satisfactory to the Bank.
DSD would submit to the Bank within nine months of the end of the Government's
fiscal year, i.e. by September 30 of each year, starting in 1987, statements
reflecting the financial performance and position of the project together with
independent auditors' reports, including separate audit accounts relating to
disbursement against SOEs and Special Accounts. Six months after the Closing
Date (June 30, 1991), the Joint Secretariat of the Development Committee
(para. 4.04) would send to the Bank for comments a project completion report
assessing attainment of project objectives, project implementation and initial
operation, its cost and the benefits derived, the performance of the Govern-
ment, the Bank and other agencies involved, and the significant lessons
learned. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the above requirements
for annual expenditure and performance audit reports and a project completion
report (para. 5.01h).
Benefits and Risks
4.25      Benefits.  The project would improve instructional quality,
managerial efficiency, and equity in the distribution of educational oppor-
tunities, while asserting the importance of the nine-year Sasic education
program. The project would replace substandard facilities impeding effective
learning and would provide about 130,000 new student places in primary and
secondary education, benefiting about 180,000 students, in order to either
centralize primary education into more economical units, or relieve the
pressure on secondary schools in which overcrowding results in excessive class
size and double shifting detrimental to the teaching/learning process. This
would also help expand educational opportunities in areas of greatest need,
and establish more cost efficient practices and quality standards for school
construction. The provision of staff housing, moscly in rural areas, would
promote teachers' commitment and efficiency where they are particularly cri-
tical. The teacher training component would benefit 4,000 prospective



- 33 -
teachers who would be trained in high quality facilities which would improve
the trainees' status and motivation. The provision of educational resources
in rural areas would strengthen educational support to the poorest segments of
the educational system. They could thereby benefit from educational media
enhancing the quality of education and the motivation of students and teachers
where it is most needed. The staff development program would benefit over 500
education officers who would be responsible by 1990 for key educational and
managerial functions. The proposed studies would enhance the knowledge of
major issues affecting the educational system and would assist in further
improving the quality and ef.iciency of education.
4.26      The project would also yield significant educational outcomes:  the
emphasis placed in the NPSC on basic skills would enable students to master
reading, writing and basic calculation better than in the past, as expected by
parents. The practical orientation of curricula and availability of educa-
tional resources would enhance students' creativity, initiative, ability to
analyze critically, problem-solving skills and constructive interaction in the
classroom. Enrichment materials and media would be used to give students a
taste and skills for self-instruction, thus preparing them for life-long
education. Extra-curricular activities would contribute to making students
more conscious of their role and responsibility within the school and society
at large, and also to teaching them how to make positive use of recreational
time. Manual skills in the curricula would prepare students for the modern
technological environment while developing their psychomotor skills as part of
a well-rounded personality. These expected improvements would be reflected in
the positive results of the continuous students' achievement evaluation system
which will replace the present Grade 5 assessment test. The practical orien-
tation of teacher training and inservice upgrading programs, and the improve-
ment of teacher trainers' and secondary teachers' qualifications would enhance
teachers' class management skills, resourcefulness and creative interaction
with students, while raising the academic standards of their teaching. This,
combined with improved managerial and leadership skills among headmasters and
education officers through the staff development program, would resuLt in more
effective use of school facilities and resources, and greater staff
motivation.
4.27      Risks.  The educationally justified but demanding reform of primary
and secondary education coincides with a time of resource constraints which
may slow down the implementation of the subsector development program, as
originally planned. The investment allocation to the subsector under the
Fifth Malaysia Plan will not enable the MOE to reach its original targets to
dramatically reduce the shortage of educational facilities and double shifting
throughout the country. This would have required over 20,000 new classrooms
to be built by 1990, as compared with the 7,000 to 8,000 classrooms possible
under the revised investment program. However, this program w-ll alleviate
the most critical needs, and the qualitative inputs will compensate for the
modesty of the quantitative development program which may have to be extended
to the end of the century.
4.28      The increase in recurrent costs resuLting from the increase in
teacher needs and qualifications required to implement the new activity-
oriented curricula, is likely to represent a heavy fiscal burden. Therefore,



- 34 -
it may be necessary to maintain some traditional methods and thus slow down
the implementation of the ambitious reform of curricula and teaching methods,
as initially envisaged. However, this is not a major risk since primary and
secondary schools could be acceptably staffed according to a more modest
teacher:class ratio than presently decided by the Government, and the improve-
ment in teacher training, educational management and resources under the
project would compensate for the smaller number of primary teachers which the
country could afford.
4.29      There is also the risk that the new integrated educational programs
and active teaching methods may be rejected by older, more conservative
teachers and also by younger teachers resenting the additional burden deriving
from increased class preparation, correction, extracurricular and remedial
duties. However, the recent evaluation of the NPSC in the first two grades by
the MOE in cooperation with the University of Malaya and the University of
Science Malaysia, provides strong indications that headmasters, teachers,
students and parents generally react positively to the NPSC, as it does meet
their expectations (para. 4.26).
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed on the
following:
(a) performance indicators for the training of certificate, diploma and
graduate teachers for primary and secondairy education (including
Form VI) for the period 1986-95 (para. 3.04);
(b) terms of reference, procedures and timetables relating to overseas
and local training fellowships and specialist services (para. 3.10);
(c) terms of reference, procedures and timetables for the proposed
research studies (r a. 3.13);
(d)  further appraisal and iLplementation of the project according to
agreed criteria, procedures and guidelines (para. 4.03);
(e) performance indicators to monitor and evaluate: (i) progress in the
distribution of education facilities and resources by district,
(ii) improvement in education quality and cost efficiency; and (iii)
the level of education expenditures (para. 4.05);
(f) annual project implementation review meetings to be held between the
Government and the Bank by October of each year, on the basis of
semi-annual progress reports to be sent to the Bank for comments by
March and September of each year, and an in-depth mid-term review of
progress towards the targets and government education investment
program, would take place with the Bank about October 1988
(para. 4.07);
(g) space standards for school classrooms (para. 4.08);



- 35 -
(h) annual expenditure and performance audit reports and a project
completion report to be submitted to the Bank according to agreed
procedures and schedules; (para. 4.24).
5.02      During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that ade-
quate operational funds would be made available for: (a) the National
Institute of Educational Management to carry out the local training programs
for educational and managerial staff included in the project (para. 3.10); and
(b) the MOE Scholarships Division to implement its fellowships program through
1990 (para. 3.10).
5.03      Expenditures on civil works, construction materials and equipment,
books and technical assistance, up to a total of US$6.0 equivalent, incurred
as from January 1, 1986, wouLd be financed retroactively (para. 4.23).
5.04      Subject to the provisions in paras. 5.01 through 5.03 above, the
proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$127.0
million equivalent to the Government of Malaysia, with a term of 15 years,
including a grace period of three years, at the standard variable rate.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
Teacher Training System
1.        Organization.  In 1984, about 17,000 primary, lower secondary and
vocational teachers were enrolled in a three-year course provided in 27
teacher training colleges (TTCs). This enrollment, which represents the nor-
mal capacity of the TTCs, was increased to 20,000 in 1985 through the exten-
sion of daily operation time in TTCs. Teacher trainees are admitted to TTCs
upon completion of Grade 11 with at least four mandatory major subjects
including Bahasa Malaysia, and a mandatory pass in mathematics. This
selection was introduced in 1983 in order to improve teacher trainees'
academic background.  Upper secondary and poy secondary teachers are trained
through four-year Bachelor's Degree courses _  at the University of Malaya,
the University of Science Malaysia and the National University Malaysia;
three-year Diploma courses in Science with Education at the University of
Agriculture and the University of Technology; a one-year course preparing for
the postgraduate Diploma in Education at the University of Malaya; or a one-
year course prep iring For the postgraduate Certificate of Education in TTCs.
In addition to the above preservice programs, inservice training is provided
throug: (a) iull-time one-yeiy Certificate courses in specialized educa-
tion - and language teaching,- enrolling about 500 trainees per year in four
TTCs; (b) eight-week vacation programs, annually enroLling about 1,200
trainees in remedial instruction and 400 trainees in guidance counseling,
followed by full-time six-month higher qualification courses for the best
graduates (about 70 in remedial instruction and 40 in guidance and
counseling); (c) part-time vacation courses of one to two weeks' duration pro-
vided by TTCs, resource centers and MOE divisions, to upgrade about 10% of the
qualified teaching force each year (i.e., 8,000 primary and 5,000 secondary
teachers) in specif'c subjects, and to introduce them to the new curricula and
related teaching methods; (d) three months' intensive language courses (to be
extended to six months shortly) provided to university graduates electing to
teach Bahasa Malaysia or English; and (e) a part-time four-year program,
including a final fully residential year in TTCs, to train academically
qualified teachers without professional certificati,n, hired on temporary
contracts. This program started in 1984 to train 6,000 teachers over a five-
year period on the basis of 1,200 per year.
1/   Bachelor of Arts (Education), Bachelor of Science (Education) and
Bachelor of Education.
2/   Physical education, guidance and counseling, education technology, music,
Library science, home science, special education for the deaf and blind,
remedial instruction, agricultural science, and arts and crafts.
3/   Bahasa Malaysia as a first language or English as a second language.

2.        Outcomes.  In 1984 about 90% of primary teachers and virtually all
secondary teachers were professionally qualified. Moreover, most of profes-
sionally unqualified teachers had an adequate academic background (e.g , 6,000
out of 9,100 in primary education). However, the proportion of universa.-v
graduates among secondary techers (5% in lower and 75% in upper secondary edu-
cation) is still insufficient to achieve the normal academic standards sought
uy the MOE. In 1984, unqualified teachers were distributed as follows:

ments for educational materials; and 16% to real salary increases.
The increase in secondary education costs between 1984 and 1990 is
M$1,058 million. This is an increase of 14$533 million in real terms and M$525
due to a 5% annual price increase. Of the real increase, 37% is due to
enrollment increase; 24% to the addition of teachers with special functions;
15% to an increase in the proportion of graduate teachers; 2% to the reduction
of class size to a maximum of 45; and 22% to real salary increases.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
General Eligibility Criteria for Approval of Programs and Subprojects
All programs and subprojects should comply with the following
conditions in order to be eligible for Bank financing:
(a) relevance to the priorities of the Fifth Malaysia Plan for primary
and secondary education, namely improved quality, managerial
efficiency, and equity in the distribution of schools in the
perspective of a universalized nine-year basic education program;
(b) technical feasibility with regard to management capacity, norms and
standards, availability of sites, availability of staff to run
programs and subprojects and to apply for training, and adequacy of
capital and recurrent financing; and
(c) efficiency in impLementation with regard to unit costs, utilization
rates for facilities and equipment, utilization of staff, and
monitoring and evaluation.
A.   Relevance to Quality, Efficiency and Equity Objectives
Applications have been evaluated to determine the degree to which
they meet overall program objectives aimed to alleviate identified
deficiencies. The analysis has covered the following:
(1) Curricula. Whether the proposed changes would alleviate past
deficiencies. Following an analysis of the causes of such
deficiencies, new curricula and related teaching methods would be
assessed to determine whether they are expected to improve the
acquisition of basic skills; increase students' problem-solving
skills, creativity, resourcefulness, eagerness to learn, moral
values; and involvement in classroom, school and community
activities.
(2) Teachers. Whether the new training and upgrading programs are
suitable to increase teachers' academic and professional
qualifications, including resourcefulness, initiative and
leadership, and whether this will result in a more effective use of
facilities, resources and media, and higher students' achievements.
(3) Educational resources. Whether the proposed school library books
and resource materials and equipment are adequate to improve
teachers' efficiency and students' achievements under the new
activity oriented curricula, taking the conditions of their
utilization (facilities and staff) into account.



- 58 -
ANNI . 10
Page 2 of 3
(4) Facilities. Whether the proposed schools with specialized
facilities (e.g. multipurpose room and library/resource center) are
suitable to ensure effective delivery of the new curricula; whether
the reduction of class size towards a maximum of 40 and of double
shifting wiLl improve the delivery of the new cur7icula and
students' learning process; and whether new teacher training
facilities will be suitable to improve teacher training in line with
the new curricula and active teaching methods, and to increase
teacher trainees' commitment.
(5) Staff development program. Whether the overseas fellowship and
local training programs are suitable to improve managerial and
leadership skills to make education administration more innovative,
dynamic and cost-efficient at central, state, district and school
levels.
(6) Cost-efficiency oriented measures. Whether measures supported by
the proposed programs, such as consolidation of small, uneconomical
schools, wherever possible, improvement of multigrade teaching, and
alternative designs for classrooms of reduced size, wherever classes
do not exceed 40 students, will result in more cost efficient
utilization of facilities and staff.
(7) Studies. Whether research and evaluation studies on the major
educational issues are suitable to refine the analysis of their
causes and to find adequate ways and means to further improve the
cost efficiency of educational inputs.
B. Technical Feasibility
Each program and subproject has been evaluated on the basis of the
extent to which it can actually be implemented. In general, the analysis has
considered:
(1) Management. Whether central, state and district government agencies
are able to manage and evaluate progress in program and subproject
implementation through adequate organizational structures,
communication mechanisms and procedures; and whether qualified local
agencies are available to carry out the planned local training
programs and studies.
(2) Norm and standards. Whether construction, maintenance, furnishing
and equipping standards can be normalLy implemented.
(3) Sites. Whether adequate sites will be available by the time
implementation of programs and subprojects is planned to start.
(4) Staff. Whether qualified managers, teachers and trainers will be
available to run program and subproject institutions to implement
the local training program and to carry out the studies; whether
adequate numbers Qf staff with appropriate qualifications will be
available for fellowships abroad and local training programs; and



- 59 -                         ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3
whether conditions and regulations will ensure retention of trained
instructors and managers in functions relevant to their training
under the staff development program.
(5) Finance. Whether the required capital outlays are included in the
Fifth Malaysia Plan and whether the Government is able and committed
to meet the recurrent cost implications of the investment, in order
to maintain the physical and educational operation of the programs
and subprojects at high levels of quality.
C.   Efficiency of Implementation
Efficiency has been the third criterion to assess whether programs
and subprojects can be implemented and operated at reasonable cost. This has
included the following aspects:
(1) Unit costs and areas. Whether the capital and recurrent costs and
areas per student will be reasonable.
(2) Utilization rates. Whether facility utilization and equipment use
will be sufficiently intensive. For educational resources, priority
will be given to library books ane equipment with the greatest
frequency of use.
(3) Staff utilization. Whether staff wiLl be efficiently utilized; and
whether the staff trained through the staff development program will
be utilized to maximize their improved qualifications.
(4) Monitoring and evaluation. Whether the monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms utilized by the Joint Secretariat (EPRD and DSD) of the
MOE Development Committee, the specialized Appraisal Subcommittes,
PWD and SEDs will be adequate to efficiently assess progress in the
physical, educational and financial implementation of programs and
subprojects.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
Specific Criteria for the Identification and Appraisal
of Programs and Subprojects
The MOE Appraisal Committee, through its six Appraisal
Subcommittees, has appraised and the MOE Development Committee (DC) has
approved programs and subprojects on the basis of the general eligibility
criteria for approval of program and subprojects (Annex 11). Further specific
criteria have been applied to each program and related subprojects as follows:
I. National Level Programs and Subprojects
A.   Teacher Training Program
(1) The subprojects should be instrumental in improving the training of
primary and lower secondary teachers along the lines of the NPSC and
related activity-oriented teaching methods based on teachers'

classroom:student and classroom:class ratios are below the national
average, beginning with Lhe most disadvantaged districts;
(2) Deconcentration of schools with enrollments of over 1,000 pupils
where establishment of a new school could absorb excess enrollment
from the catchment area into a new unit of at least 150 students;
(3) Where local conditions permit, consolidation of underenrolled
schools in a given catchment area where the total enrollment in a
consolidated new school, or extension to the most adequate existing
school, could result in a total enrollment of at least 150 students;
(4) Location of the school should take into consideration access road,
rivers and means of communication, the terrain, the students' age,
number of daily sessions and the time required to cover the distance
from home to school, so that students should not have more than

MALAYSIA
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
Guidelines and Criteria for Allocation of Loan Funds
under Programs and Subprojects
General Objectives
1.        Loan funds would be used according to the objectives of the primary
md secondary education subsector development program under the Fifth Malaysia
Plan (January 1986-December 1990), namely: (a) improving the quality of edu-
cation through implementation of new curricula and availability of qualified
teachers, educational resources and adequate facilities; (b) increasing the
efficiency of educational management through staff development, cost
efficiency oriented measures in relation to the utiLization of facilities and
staff, and studies; and (c) expanding access to better education through
provision of primary and secondary school facilities in areas of greatest
needs.
2.        Loan funds would be used for disbursement of the whole or part of
the expenditure on: (a) civil works; (b) furniture, equipment and books; and
.c) technical assistance, including specialist services for staff training and
studies, fellowships abroad and local training.  Studies would contribute to
preparing future projects.
3.        Loan funds would be used for:  (a) national level programs and
subprojects which would benefit the whole subsector and also the education
sector at large, namely; (i) teacher training; (ii) educational resources;
(iii) staff development; and (iv) studies; and (b) state level programs and
subprojects which would address the specific needs of states and districts,
namely: (i) primary schools; and (ii) secondary schools.
4.        Loan funds would be used for the above programs and subprojects in
accordance with general eligibility criteria for approval of such programs and
subprojects; and specific criteria for identification and appraisal of
national and state level programs and subprojects, as stated separately in
Annexes 11 to 12.
5.        The present guidelines and .riteria for allocation of loan funds
under programs and subprojects are subject to amendments and modifications
from time to time, after the Government and the Bank have reached agreement on
such amendments and modifications.
Specific Criteria and Guidelines
6.        By Objective.  Overall allocation would not exceed US$46 million
(i.e. 36% of total loan funds) for programs and subprojects addressing
improvement in the quality of education; US$6 million (5Z) for increasing
educational management efficiency; and US$75 million (59%) for expaniing



- 69 -
ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 2
access to better education. Of the aLlocation to quality at least 452 would
address teacher training and no more than 55% educational resources. Of the
allocation to management efficiency, at least 97% would cover the expenditure
on staff development and no more than 3% that on studies. Of the allocation
to access, no more than 47% would address primary education and at least 53%
would go to secondary education. The distribution of loan funds reflects the
emphasis placed on the various program objectives as well as the bulk, degree
of sophistication and cost of the respective subprojects.
7.        By Program.  OveralL allocation would not exceed US$52 million (i.e.
41% of total loan funds) for national level programs and US$75 million (59%)
for state level programs. This distribution gives an indication of the decen-
tralization process in educational management.
8.        Regional Distribution of Funds.  At least 90% of Loan funds under
state level programs and subprojects would be allocated to school facilities
outside the Capital area (Federal District). This reflects the emphasis
placed on assistance to disadvantaged rural districts.
9.        Concentration of Funds.  Within the above ceiling for state level
programs, to avoid dispersion of funds, it is expected that there would be no
more than 26 subprojects for primary and secondary schools, i.e. two subproj-
ects (one for primary and one for secondary education) in each of the
13 states.
