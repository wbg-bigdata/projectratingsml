REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR THE NIAMEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for the equivalent of US$5.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the developmaent
of Niamey International Airport. The proceeds of the credit would be made
available to ASECNA (Agence pour la Securite' de la Navigation Ae'rienne en
Afrique et 'a Madagascar), which will be responsible for the execution of the
proj ect.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The basic ?roblems of economic development in Niger were set out
in a report entitled "The Economic Position and Prospects of Niger" dated
May 1972 (R72-125). An economic mission has visited Niger in October/November
1973 and its report is expected to be completed in July 1974. Annex I contains
country data.
Background
3.        Niger has been classified by the United Nations as one of the 25
"least developed countries" in the world. Like its sahelian neighbors, it
suffers from a number of serious growth constraints: a landlocked situation
coupled with long borders and formidable internal and external distances,
limited domestic markets, lack of water and other natural resources which
can be easily and quickly developed, generally poor soils, uneven population
diEtribution and a low level of education, particularly in the rural areas.
These constraints have been compounded since 1967 by six consecutive years
with little or no rainfall. The magnitude and the effects of this drought are
described in more detail in a report entitled "Appraisal of Drought Relief
Fund Project--West Africa" dated October 24, 1973 (R73-112).
4.        Niger's economy is almost entirely dependent on agriculture and
livestock, and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Together,
these two sectors account for half of GDP and about 80 percent of export
earnings, and make the economy particularly vulnerable to adverse weather
conditions. The sectors of services and industry (mainly construction and
uranium mining) account for a further 35 and 10 percent of GDP respec-
tively.
5.        Mainly as a result of the drought, real GDP per head, which had
been growing slowly from pre-independence years until about 1967, has been
declining at an increasingly rapid pace since then. Production of basic
grains (millet and sorghum) has declined and is expected to fall to less than
800,000 tons in 1973/74, as compared with a "normal" level of about 1.2 million



tons. Export crops have also been affected both through lower yields and
through reallocation of land and labor to foodcrops; whereas groundnut produc-
tion had reached a peak of nearly 300,000 tons unshelled in 1967/68, it is
not likely to exceed 30,000 tons in 1973/74, while the cotton crop will be
less than 2,000 tons against 10,500 tons in 1969/70. Livestock losses are
extremely difficult to evaluate, but are estimated to have amounted in 1973
to about 30 percent of tuie "normal" stock.
6.        Although small percent changes in average per capita incomes are
not very meaningful in Niger's context, the setback caused by the drought has
had very serious concrete effects. As a result, the share of national income
going to rural areas, i.e., about 90 percent of total population, has declined
seriously, especially in most recent years. Second, large groups of the
population have seen their already low standard of living reduced further.
To ensure their basic food requirements, they have withdrawn from the cash
economy into the pure subsistence sectors. A further effect has been the
acceleration of the southward migration of population, creating serious
political, social and health problems in addition to the economic ones, and
taxing heavily the administration in its attempts to deal with them. Finally,
the free distribution of food has tended to create among the destitute popu-
lation an attitude of dependency which might provide difficult to reverse,
particularly if prolonged.
7.        During the past 4 to 5 years the economy's dependence upon external
factors has remained very strong. This is evidenced notably by the size of
the resource gap which has varied between 5 and 9 percent of GDP with an
average proportion roughly 50 percent higher than the ratio of public invest-
ment to GDP. The current deficit was growing until 1970 when it exceeded
US$20 million equivalent. Since then uranium exports--a new item in the
balance of payments--have somewhat improved the situation. Very high prices
for groundnuts and groundnut oil over the past two years have brought addi-
tional relief to the current balance. However, Niger has not been able to
take full advantage of the favorable markets because quantities exported have
fallen sharply as a result of the drought. At the same time, forced sales
of live animals by herders, because of the drought have created a buyers'
market in Niger's second major export.
8.        Over the last 5 or 6 years the general picture has been one of a
deteriorating real economy. However, in the same period, this picture has
been coupled with one of relative financial ease. A rather strict control
of current expenditure by the Government and rising revenues mainly from
taxes on the "modern" sector have resulted in a budget current surplus of
CFAF 3 billion in 1971/72, nearly 25 percent of current receipts, and about
triple the budgeted surplus. Further, the elimination of past budget deficits
and arrears, as well as the accumulation of deposits from public and semi-
public institutions (such as the marketing organizations and the social
security fund), has resulted in an increasingly liquid position of both the
treasury (currently some CFAF 4 billion) and the banking system. Finally,



- 3 -
a very sizable increase in foreign assets since 1970--now amounting to some
CFAF 11 billion, or 6 months worth of imports-- has resulted from movements
in unrecorded trade with neighboring countries, from the inflow of foreign
aid (mostly grants) and, to some extent, from direct foreign investments
(such as the uranium mine and a textile mill).
9.        The last year for which external debt figures for Niger were
reported was 1970, when the total outstanding amount was about US$63 million
equivalent, including an undisbursed portion of about US$31 million. Since
a large part of the foreign aid inflow to Niger since then has been in the
form of grants, it is estimated that the country's foreign debt has not in-
creased substantially in the past three years. However, debt service payments,
which were equivalent to 3.4 percent of exports of goods and non-factor
services in 1970, are estimated to have reached about 6 percent in 197!I and
1972.
Government Policies
10.       Until 1971 Government development policies were embodied in a fairly
sophisticated planning system of 3 interrelated components: a ten-year (1964/
74) "Perspectives Decennales," medium-term "Plans" (e.g., for 1971/74) and
rolling four-year public investment "Programmes" designed to permit necessary
adjustments over time. The system also provided for yearly reviews of the
execution of public investment programs, an exercise all too frequently over-
looked elsewhere in Africa.
11.       However, the Government has become increasingly dissatisfied with
this system for three main reasons. In the first place, the Government has
resented the fact that outside observers (mainly aid donors) have frequently
and overtly criticized the Government for the non-achievement of officially
stated targets; secondly, the Government has become disillusioned with the
results of past development efforts, including national planning and external
assistance; finally, the very flexibility built into the planning system led
to repeated adjustments, resulting in a gradual but significant drifting away
from the Government's initial objectives. Consequently, the Government
decided in 1971 not to make official the draft "Plan 1971-74," to stop the
formal public investment review process and to refrain from using the
"Perspectives Decennales" as well as past 'Plans" and "Programmes" as a
frame of reference. At the same time, a decision was taken to proceed with
the preparation of new "Perspectives" for 1972-82.    While a comprehensive
picture of the Government's development strategy is not available at present,
there is little doubt that the Government will give first priority to agri-
culture, with particular emphasis, on foodcrop production and the improvement
of living conditions in the rural areas.
12.       Niger's immediate problem is the food shortage expected again for
1974, due to the 1973 drought. The estimated import requirement of at least
some 300,000 tons of staple grains alone will tax heavily the country's



- 4 -
financial resources and raises formidable difficulties in terms of supply
sources, external and internal transportation, storage and organization of
distribution, which seem to be beyond the present capacity of the Govern-
ment. Emergency relief supplies from abroad and foreign assistance in
dealing with the transportation and distribution problems may again be
necessary.
Prospects
13.       The basic constraints to development in Niger can hardly be mini-
mized and for a long time to come the central problem will remain the rela-
tionship between population and resources, primarily agricultural resources.
Since in the current religious, social, ethnic and political context of Niger
it is unlikely that an active population policy could be successfully imple-
mented in the foreseeable future, any solution to this problem would have to
aim first at an increase in agricultural productivity.
14.       Methods of advance technology, such as soil analysis by satellite,
nuclear and solar energy, and artificial rain are being experimented with or
are contemplated by the Government as a partial solution to the country's
problems. However, until more conclusive and applicable results of these
trials are reached, the Government is pursuing a number of more "conventional"
schemes ranging from general improvements not requiring any specific organiza-
tional framework, such as widespread distribution of improved seeds, to the
more complex integrated rural development projects and capital-intensive
operations, such as irrigation projects and breeding and fattening ranches.
All these projects aim at increasing productivity in agriculture, mainly
yields per hectare, since the availability of agricultural land is gradually
but unavoidably becoming a major constraint, and growth through extensive
production methods increasingly more difficult.
15.       At the same time, the Government is actively promoting mineral
prospecting and production. Plans are being implemented to double uranium
production, to reach 1,400 tons of concentrates in 1974. Exploration for
other minerals and oil is being carried out by a number of foreign firms.
Encouraging findings by oil companies have been reported in the Eastern
part of the country, while a number of other minerals (copper, manganese,
limestone and iron ore) have been found in the South-West, mainly in the
Liptako-Gourma area. However, the cost of transportation is likely to be
a major constraint to the economic exploitation of these resources.
16.       Short of major, unusually rich discoveries of underground wealth
or a technological breakthrough in the development of agriculture, Niger's
[oreseeable economic future cannot be depicted as bright. In view of the
prospective resource gap, the level of poverty of the country, the limitations
of its resources and of its growth potential, as well as its heavy dependence
on external factors, foreign aid to Niger should continue on concessionary
terms. Also, in spite of the present combination of a high level of foreign



reserves and liquid funds in the public sector, Niger cannot be expected in
the long run to make large contributions to the financing of public investments.
Foreign aid funds should, therefore, continue to finance a high proportion of
local costs if development projects are to be implemented.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGER
17.       To date the Bank Group contribution to Niger's development consists
of five credits (Annex II). The first credit was made in 1964 to finance a
highway development project, which was satisfactorily completed in 1969. The
highway maintenance project, for which a credit of US$6.1 million was made in
1968, was due for completion in October 1973. To enable continuation and
extension of the training program included in the project, an increase of
US$350,000 in the amount of the credit has been recently approved by the
Executive Directors, and the Closing Date has been postponed by 15 months,
until December 31, 1974. A US$584,000 credit was made in 1970 for an agri-
cultural credit project. Although project implementation has been delayed
and credit requirements have been so far below appraisal estimates, the
project is now proceeding satisfactorily and is providing long-term benefits
by improving the quality of Niger's agricultural extension services. A
US$5.7 million credit was made to Niger in 1972 to help finance a highway
construction project. The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Due to the
various recent currency realignments, an increase of US$850,000 in the credit
amount has been recently approved by the Executive Directors to cover .m
increase in the dollar costs of the project. It is expected that the project
will be completed and the credit fully disbursed by the present Closing Date.
Finally, in October 1973, the Executive Directors approved a US$2 million
credit to Niger within the US$14 million of credit extended to the six sahelian
countries for a drought relief fund project.
18.       Recognizing the magnitude of the constraint of inadequate transport
and communications on the development of Niger the Bank Group's strategy in
the country has been so far concentrated mainly on the development of the
internal transportation infrastructure, primarily roads. This strategy has
complemented the efforts of the Government and other aid donors and has
helped lay the foundation of a minimum infrastructure for the development
of the productive sectors of the economy.
19.       Bank Group assistance in the development of the transportation
sector will continue. However, future IDA lending will be increasingly
channelled directly to the two main productive sectors, agriculture and
livestock, with a view to raising the income of the rural population. An
integrated rural development project has been recently appraised and is
scheduled to be submitted shortly to the Executive Directors for considera-
tion. The project would cover the whole department of Maradi and is designed
to provide benefits to about 70,000 families, involving some 500,000 people.
Its primary aim would be to raise productivity in agriculture and animal
husbandry through improved extension services, agricultural credit, road
development, soil conservation, health care and functional literacy.



-6-
20.       A number of other projects are also under consideration by the
Association for financing and are scheduled to be submitted to the Executive
Directors for consideration in FY75 and FY76: a telecommunications project,
which a Bank mission is currently helping prepare; an education project likely
to result from the sector work currently being done by the Government with the
assistance of a Bank staff member, specifically appointed for this purpose;
a road development project, likely to result from the transport sector review
undertaken by the Bank in February 1974; a project for the production of rice
under irrigation, currently under preparation; and a livestock project
currently being prepared by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC).
21.       Niger remains one of the countries in which external assistance is
limited at present more by the country's capacity to identify, prepare and
implement projects than by shortage of external funds. To alleviate this
constraint, projects financed by the Bank Group in Niger will generally include
elements of technical assistance and training of local staff.
22.       The Bank Group, which ranks sixth in terms of volume of aid committed,
about $17 million, behind France, the Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED),
Canada, USA and Germany, and roughly on a par with UNDP, has been a relatively
small lender to date, providing only about 7 percent of total foreign aid
committed to Niger during the 1968-73 period. Ilowever, Niger is one of the
countries to which it has been possible to devote additional staff resources
since the Bank's reorganization, and these efforts should be reflected in an
appreciable increase in the IDA resources channelled to Niger in the coming
years.
PART III: TRANSPORTATION IN NIGER
23.       Niger's land-locked economy is burdened with high transport costs
because of the long distances to be covered within the country and to the
nearest ocean ports. Road transport is predominant, rail transport non-
existent. Mechanized surface transport is complemented on the one side by
animal transport, on the other by air transport.    The sector is ,he responsi-
bility of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urbanism, with the
Directorate of Transport being responsible for policies and regulations,
while the Directorate of Public Works is in charge of construction and
maintenance of the transport infrastructure. A mission has recently visited
Niger to review this sector, focussing mainly on roads with some attention
given also to river transport.
24.       Niger has about 8,000 km of roads of which less than 10 percent
are paved. The main backbone of the road system is the 1,800 km east-west
axis between the Mali and Chad borders, which crosses the most fertile and
densely populated parts of the country, and which is being improved with
assistance from IDA, Canada and FED. Secondary roads stretch from this



axis to the northern desert regions with connections to the Mediterranean
across the Sahara, and to the south, through neighboring countries to Join
the various access ways to the seaports of Abidjan, Cotonou, Lagos and Lame.
The Bank Group has been associated with improvements of these access ways
in neighboring countries, as in the case of the Parakou-Malanville highway
in Dahomey, for the rehabilitation of which a $11.8 million credit was made
in July 1973. This road links with the railway at Parakou to carry about
45 percent (about 150,000 tons in 1970) of Niger's external trade through
the port of Cotonou.
25.       Water transport is still of little importance, primarily due to
highly irregular water levels and lack of infrastructure to harness the main
waterway, the Niger river. However, the recent completion of the Kainji dam
in Nigeria makes the river potentially navigable for about 7 months per year.
Canada (CIDA) is currently undertaking a US$4 million study of the feasibility
of this mode of transport with experimental barge trips between Niamey and
the coast, while USAID has financed the raising of the bridge over the river
at Malanville. Further, a prefeasibility study of a dam in Niger at Kaindadji
near the Malian border has just started. If feasible, this dam would render
the river navigable all year round between Bamako in Mali and Port Harcourt
in Nigeria.
26.       Although only limited investments in the water transport system seem
justified until completion of these studies, in the long term substantial im-
provements in this system might in time bring significant economic benefits
to Niger in the form of lower transport costs, particularly as this mode of
transport is suitable for heavy bulk cargo, such as petroleum products.
Furthermore, an adequate water transport system would enhance the economic
justification of the exploitation of mineral resources, which have been
identified in the Liptako-Gourma area.
27.       Air transport in Niger is centered around Niamey airport, the
closest to Europe of all West African airports south of the Sahara. Five
airlines provide international services to Niger, including Air Afrique, a
multinational company of which Niger is a shareholder. Internal air trans-
port is served by Air Niger, a national airline with a route mileage of about
2,600 km and scheduled services to five local airports. These services are
complemented by the operations of some minor charter services.
28.       Aviation, as a mode of transport, is the responsibility of the
Directorate of Civil Aviation and Meteorology of the Ministry of Public Works,
Transport and Urbanism. However, in view of the still limited number of
its trained staff in the civil aviation field, most of the functions of the
Directorate are being carried out by ASECNA, a multinational corporation
formed in 1959 by the Treaty of St. Louis between 14 African states, includ-
ing Niger, and France. Pursuant to this treaty, ASECNA is entrusted with
tliree main functions: (i) to control air navigation over the territories
of its African members, as well as approach and landing aids at their main
airports (art. 2); (ii) to manage, operate and maintain, if requested,



- 8 -
ground facilities of member states' airports (art. 10); and (iii) to study,
design and construct, if requested, airport facilities for its member states
(art. 18).
29.       In 1961 ASECNA entered into an agreement with the Government of
Niger, the "Contrat Particulier," on the basis of which ASECNA manages,
operates and maintains Niamey airport and some other minor airports in Niger.
Under this agreement, ASECNA may be requested to execute, as an agent of the
Government, specific projects for the development of Niger's airports. To
this end, the Government and ASECNA would enter into a specific agreement,
the "Contrat Special," for each such project.
30.       ASECNA is governed by a Board of Directors, designated by the
member states. A Director-General is ir. charge of its management and is
assisted by technical staff drawn from the various member states. ASECNA's
headquarters are in Dakar, with a representative in every member country.
The representative is assisted by technical staff and can call upon head-
quarters' experts whenever required. ASECNA has currently a staff of about
6,000, of whom about 400 are expatriates from France and countries other
than the 14 African member states. Abouit 350 of the staff are based in
Niamey, where ASECNA maintains one of its Flight Information Centers (FIC)
serving the area, and its main regional school for training of all technical
staff (air traffic controllers, meteorological personnel, etc.).
31.       The total cost of ASECNA's operations in its member countries is
about CFAF 9 billion (US$36 million equivalent) a year. This is financed
by receipts from airlines (40%) and subsidies from France (34%) and other
member governments (26%). These subsidies are in line with the world-wide
practice of providing aerial navigation facilities at government expense.
ASECNA's budget does not cover construction of airport facilities, and such
financing is, therefore, the sole responsibility of the individual Govern-
ments concerned.
PART IV: TIE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Niamey International Airport Project
- Niger" (No. 289a-NIR) is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project
Sumlmary is attached as Annex III. The proposed project was identified in
1971 by a Bank mission, and subsequently prepared by ASECNA. Field appraisal
took place in January/February 1973 and was completed at headquarters in
July 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington from March 18 to 22, 1974.
hle delegation of Niger consisted of Mr. A. Alfidja, Director of Planning
in the Ministry of Development and Cooperation, as head; Mrs. M. Hadiza,
Charge d'Affaires at the Embassy of Niger in Washington; MIr. A. Cheiffou,
Director of ASECNA in Niger; arLd Mr. C. Bellier from ASECNA's headquarters
in Dakar.



- 9 -
33.       Niamey airport occupies a strategic position on the air routes
between Europe and the cities of the Wesit African Coast between Abidian
and Lagos. As the last major airport before or after crossing the Sahara,
it is of interest as a transit stop for international air carriers operating
on these routes. Also in view of the landlocked position of the country the
airport is vital for long distance travel and transport of high-value and
perishalle commodities between Niger and the outside world.
34.       Niamey airport derives substantial revenues from these transit
operations, since Niger traffic alone would not justify international service
on the scale currently enjoyed. Nearly 50 percent of the current international
passenger volume utilizing the airport is transit traffic (39,096 passengers
in 1972 of a total of 80,695) and the transit proportion is expected to in-
crease to over one-half of international traffic by 1977. If Niger were to
be deprived of these transit flights, its own international traffic would
warrant only a costly feeder service with smaller aircraft serving adjacent
centers offering connections with international flights. This would affect
both passengers and freight. International air freight generated by Niger
totalled only 4,783 tons in 1972, but is expected to rise to 8,200 tons in
1977 and 16,700 tons by 1982.
35.       Niamey's future as an air traffic transit stop is threatened by the
current deficiencies of the airport. The runway at Niamey airport is too
short and weak to handle such aircraft as some of the DC-8 types now in use.
Not only are severe payload limitations imposed but also the runway is dete-
riorating noticeably under the impact of heavy aircraft landings. This situa-
tion will shortly be aggravated by the introduction of newer and heavier wide-
bodied aircraft which, while more efficient than those ciurrently in service,
will still be subject to payload limitations. Continued deterioration of the
runway could soon result in an unacceptable risk to the safety of international
flights.
36.       ASECNA has prepared a long-term development plan for the improvement
of Niamey airport. The current investment program of the airport, which covers
the period 1974-82, is the first phase of this plan and is expected to cost
about US$7.3 million equivalent.
37.       The proposed project comprises most of the items included in the
investment program, leaving only the freight shed extension, transfer of
offices and some minor buildings and equipment renewals to be undertaken by
the Government (Section 4.01 of the Development Credit Agreement). The
project is expected to provide improvements to existing facilities so as to
enable large, modern, long-range aircraft to operate safely and economically
from Niamey airport. Specifically, the project consists of:



- 10 -
(i) reinforcement of the existing runway and taxiway;
(ii) extension of the existing runway from 2,570 m to 2,770 m,
with a turning area and overshoot (stopway);
(iii)  enlargement and reinforcement of a portion of the existing
apron, and addition of a further aircraft parking position;
(iv)  provision of blast protection on shoulders;
(v) replacement and relocation of the localizer of the Instrument
Landing System (ILS), and provision of new equipment therefor;
(vi)  provision of high-intensity runway lighting equipment and of
a high-intensity approach lighting system; and
(vii)  provision of various meteorological equipment.
Cost and Financing Plan
33.       Total project costs including taxes are estimated at aboUt US$5.9
million equivalent, out of which US$3.5 million would be in foreign exchange.
The cost estimate is based on detailed engineering studies and includes an
allowance of about US$1.3 million to cover contingencies. Taxes estimated at
US$900,000 are also included in the total. A breakdown of cost8 is provided
in Annex III.
39.       The proposed credit of US$5.0 million would be made to Niger on
standard IDA terms. ASECNA, which manages the Niamey airport will execute
the project on behalf of the Government. The Government will, therefore,
make the proceeds of the credit available to ASECNA, which would control and
disburse the funds, as was the case in the Dakar International Airport Project
(Loan No. 867SE), approved by the Executive Directors in November, 1972. For
legal and aministrative reasons it has not been feasible to impose a direct
repayment obligation upon ASECNA, but the proceeds of the credit will be
treated in the airport's accounts as a loan for a period of 25 years, includ-
ing 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum, capitalized
during the construction period. ASECNA will make the corresponding service
payments to the Government from the revenues of the airport operations. A
"Contrat Special" acceptable to the Association, covering the above terms,
would be concluded between the Government and ASECNA as a condition of
effectiveness of the Credit (Section 8.01 (b) of the Development Credit
Agreement).
40.       The proposed credit would cover 100 percent of total estimated
project costs after taxes. It would finance 100 percent of the estimated
foreign exchange costs, or about US$3.5 million, and US$1.5 million equivalent
of local costs.



Procurement and Disbursement
41.       In view of the nature and size of the project, all civil works
would be executed under one contract, a procedure estimated to interest as
large a number of contractors as possible, as well as to ensure better execu-
tion and more adequate supervision. Such contract will be awarded, and all
other equipment to be financed under the proposed credit will be procured,
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
42.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against 85 percent of total
expenditures (including taxes) for civil works, design and supervision, and
100 percent of foreign exchange costs or 85 percent of total costs (including
taxes) for equipment and its installation. The project is expected to be
completed by June 30, 1976 and the credit fully disbursed and closed by
December 31, 1976. It is proposed that any balance of the credit remaining
unused after project completion be used, with the Association's approval, for
further improvements to the airport.
Stpervision and Training
43.       ASECNA's own staff are preparing the engineering design of the
proposed project. In view of their competence in this field, it is proposed
to entrust ASECNA also with the supervision of construction and inspection
of installations. Further, since the training facilities of ASECNA, located
in Niamey, are adequate, provision for training under the project is not
required.
Accounting
44.       Under the terms of its "Contrat Particulier" with Niger ASECNA is
responsible for accounting at Niamey Airport. Since ASECNA accounts for its
operations in Niger on a country-wide basis, the true cost of operation of
any particular airport is not directly reported. However, ASECNA is able to
extract from its accounts those directly related to the operation of Niamey
airport and to calculate the portion of its indirect costs and depreciation
attributable to that operation. Under the proposed project agreement ASECNA
will produce annually for Niamey airport proforma statements of profit and
loss, as well as of sources and applications of funds. These statements will
be audited by the "Agent Comptable," the auditor appointed to ASECNA by the
Government of France and who is acceptable to the Association (Section 4.02
of the Project Agreement).
Financial Benefits and Measures
45.       Mainly as a result of the project, the Niamey Airport operation,
currently a deficitary one and a burden on the Government, is expected to
become profitable. To ensure that operating revenues cover operating expenses
as well as interest payments and debt amortization, and further produce a
reasonable surplus to be applied to future investments, tariff increases
will be implemented upon completion of the project. These measures will



- 12 -
comprise an increase of up to 10 percent in landing fees, and a handling
charge on imports of up to US$20 per ton, or any other suitable measures
which will achieve (a) an operating ratio (ratio of operating expenses before
depreciation, to gross revenues) of less than 60 percent as of 1978 and of
less than 55 percent as of 1981, and (b) a return on net fixed assets of at
least 7-1/4 percent as of 1982. The financial rate of return on project
investments is estimated, on conservative assumptions, at 9 percent.
Economic Benefits
46.       The quantifiable economic benefits of the project fall under three
main headings:
(a) increased revenue from landing fees resulting from the
introductibn of large aircraft;
(b) avoidance of loss of existing revenue from landing fees for
long-range aircraft - a loss which would be incurred if inter-
national flights had to be discontinued; and
(c) avoidance of additional costs that eventually would have to
be met by Niger in providing a feeder service to a neighboring
international airport if Niamey was removed from the interna-
tional air network.
Taken together over 20 years, these benefits would yield an economic return
of about 20 percent.
47.       The calculation of quantifiable benefits assumes that international
freight and passenger traffic at present originating or terminating at Niamey
could be diverted, if necessary, by means of a feeder service to the nearest
adjacent international airport in the region. In practice, it is doubtful
whether the growing exports of meat and fresh vegetables to the European
market could economically be handled in this more costly way, and this export
trade would probably be signficantly reduced if no direct air service were
available, whereas with the introduction of more efficient, larger capacity
aircraft on the existing service there will be scope for considerable expan-
sion. A further benefit from the project, which has not been quantified,
will be the maintenance of emplovment for the several hundred employees whose
work relates mainly to the large aircraft currently calling at Niamey.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Niger
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and ASECNA, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text



- 13 -
of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the
normal pattern for credits for airport development projects.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECONMENDATION
50.       In formulating this proposal it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed credit remains fully justi-
fied.
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 128 - Highway Maintenance Project; US$6.47 million Credit of
September 23, 1968 (as amended on November 26, 1973);
Closing Date - December 31, 1974
The original Closing Date of March 31, 1973 has been twice postponed
to October 1, 1973 and then to December 31, 1974. All items of the project
have been satisfactorily completed with the exception of the training of

which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.

do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

personnel. Since 1968, the total road network length maintained by the
Public Works Department (PWD) has increased considerably and the quality of
routine maintenance operations has substantially improved.
The training of mechanics and operators was delayed since most
staff had first to be given basic literacy courses. It is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Training of staff for higher echelons in PWD had also been
delayed due to difficulties in finding suitable personnel. Nigerien engi-
neering graduates have been now assigned to their new positions but they
still require training on the job by the consultant's staff. In order to
consolidate the results so far achieved and realize the full benefits from
the project, an increase of $350,000 in the credit amount, to $6.47 million
was recently approved by the Executive Directors, and the Closing Date
postponed by 15 months until December 31, 1974.
Credit 207 - Agricultural Credit Project; US$584,000 Credit of June 29, 1970;
Closing Date - December 31, 1974
The objective of the Project is to increase farmers' incomes and
Government revenues by raising the yields of groundnuts, cotton and rice.
The credit finances the cost of fertilizers and pesticides, foreign exchange
for farm implements and cooperative equipment, technical assistance to the
national agricultural bank (CNCA) and additional extension services by the
cooperative assistance agency (UNCC). Farmers' credit requirements to date
have been negligible because (a) farmers' plots are generally too small to
use animal-drawn equipment, (b) existing inventories of implements, fertilizers
and pesticides were available until 1972, and (c) Government extension services
for groundnut growers are deficient. It is expected, however, that fertilizers
and a limited number of farm implements will be purchased before the Closing
Date, December 31, 1974, leaving an estimated US$200,000 in uncommitted funds.
The project has not been able to achieve the success expected in
strengthening CNCA because of deterioration in the agency's financial
situation, and it has had only a marginal impact on the production of ground-
nuts, rice and cotton, which, at appraisal, was expected to increase by about
15 percent, 20 percent and 4 percent, respectively. However, long-term
benefits will be realized as a result of improvements made under the project
in UNCC extension services for cotton.
Credit 231 - Second Highway Construction Project; US$6.55 million credit of
January 29, 1971 (as amended on November 26, 1973);
Closing Date - December 31, 1974
Work on the Niamey-Tillabery road (115 kIm) which was delayed
(initially due to difficulties of the contractor in mobilizing, and recently
due to damage to parts of the road caused by abnormally severe flash floods)
is now completed. Construction of the remaining two roads (28 km) has started
and is expected to be completed by the end of 1974. All the laboratory and
traffic-counting equipment has been procured. The recently completed

feasibility studies of the Niamey-Baleyara ane the Zinder-Bande roads show
that the first one will not be justified before 1981. The detailed engineering
of the second road is due to start soon and is likely to lead to a road con-
struction project to be financed by IDA.
Disbursements are about 15 percent ahead of appraisal estimates.
Although the total foreign exchange cost of the project expressed in CFAF is
now estimated to be about CFAF 130 million ($650,000) less than at appraisal,
the dollar cost of the project is now estimated at $850,000 more than at
appraisal, wholly due to currency realignments. Consequently, an increase
in the amount of the credit from $5.7 million to $6.55 million has been
recently approved by the Executive Directors. In order to complete construc-
tion and finalize all disbursements, a postponement of the Closing Date by
one year, to December 31, 1975, might be recuired.
Credit 441 - Drought Relief Project; US$2.0 million Credit of Dece'nber 7, 1973;
Closing Date - June 30, 1976
The credit, approved on November 13, 1973, is one of six credits
made to the six sahelian countries to help people in drought-affected areas
to re-establish their self-sufficiency through redevelopment and improvement
of their farms and herds. The project would be executed by the Banque pour
le Developpement de la Republique du Niger (BDRN).
The credit is not yet effective and no disbursements have taken
place so far.
