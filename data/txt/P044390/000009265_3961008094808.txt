MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION, ACTING AS
TRUSTEE FOR THE TRUST FUND FOR BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA,
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$35 MILLION TO
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
FOR AN EMERGENCY TRANSPORT RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
1.    I subrnit for your approval the following memorandum on a proposed Credit in the
amount equivalent to US$35 million to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) to help finance an
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project. The proposed Credit will be on International
Development Association (IDA) terms, with 40 year maturity, including 10 years grace.
Cofinancing in an amount of US$ 57.6 million equivalent has been identified and US$ 56.4 million
is also expected from other donors. Donors should also provide an additional US$3.0 million for
recurrent expenditures.
Part I - Background and the Assistance Strategy
A. Background
2.    Relations with the World Bank: Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply
involved in developing a donor-funded reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the
World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Union (EU), European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) in late 1995 resulted in the preparation, with the Government, of a
priority reconstruction program which was presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the
Bank and the EU in Brussels on December 20-21, 1995. This program identified some US$5.1
billion of external financing needed to meet Bosnia's urgent reconstruction needs, of which
US$1.8 billion would be needed in the first year, 1996. This first donor meeting led to new donor
commitments of some US$500 million for priority reconstruction activities for the first quarter of
1996. Another donor conference is scheduled for the spring of 1996 to seek financing pledges
from donors for the remainder of 1996 as well to present needs for the entire reconstruction
program.
3.    The Bank's own assistance strategy for BH consists of a two-track approach. First, prior
to financial normalization and membership in the World Bank Group, the Bank will support
selected immediate assistance programs through the special World Bank Trust Fund for BH
(TFBH) in the amount of US$150 million, approved by the Board of Governors on February 23,
1996. Of these Trust Fund resources, US$125 million is to be extended at concessional terms
identical to those offered by IDA and US$25 million is to be provided as a grant. Second, once
the country becomes a World Bank Group member and following the clearance of arrears to the
Bank, a program of direct World Bank Group lending and technical assistance would be initiated



-2-
to support reconstruction and development, as well as economic transformation. The current
pipeline of operations in CY1996-1997, to be financed both from the TFBH as well as
subsequently from regular World Bank Group resources, comprises a number of emergency-type
projects, including this proposed Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project, and prospective
operations in gas, district heating, war victims rehabilitation, and water supply. These would be
followed by additional projects in education, health, housing, employment generation, de-mining,
electric power supply, forestry and agricultural services, and a structural adjustment operation in
support of structural reforms to enterprises, banks and public finance.
B. The Transport Sector
The situation
4.    As with other sectors, the transport sector was severely damaged during the hostilities
with links leading to or near confrontation lines being particularly hard hit. Roads have suffered
damage due to excess military traffic on both main roads and, through deviations, on secondary
and local roads. In addition, the network has deteriorated from near total neglect. Except for
emergency maintenance by UNPROFOR, virtually no road maintenance has been carried out for
four years. Bridges - for strategic reasons, a favorite target - have been destroyed and while most
now have either deviations or temporary bridging in place, with increasing traffic, these are now
creating serious bottlenecks within the system. All ten road and rail bridges across the Sava and
Una rivers bordering BH and the Republic of Croatia have been cut, tunnels have been damaged
and natural landslips have occurred which have not been repaired. Large quantities of
construction and maintenance equipment have been destroyed, purloined or are inoperative due to
neglect.
5.    Sarajevo airport has been damaged and, being on the confrontation line, has also suffered
due to lack of maintenance. The runway and taxiways are severely cracked, the terminals and
control tower damaged, and most air traffic control systems and mobile equipment destroyed. The
Implementing Force (IFOR) is currently operating the airport under military conditions with only
an additional few UN and civilian non-scheduled flights using the facility. Of the other four
airports, Tuzla is an IFOR base, Banja Luka is said to be operational under military conditions,
and Bihac and Mostar are damaged and not operational.
6.    The rail network of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) was severely
affected with considerable damage to the electrified system. The line between the Port of Ploce
and Sarajevo was cut with two bridges destroyed, and similarly cut between Sarajevo and Zenica
with one bridge destroyed. Large quantities of rolling stock are either unaccounted for or have sat
in isolated pockets with their condition unknown. The rail system in the Republica Srpska (RS)
was also damaged, but less so with 75% now functioning with light traffic. The European Union
and Germany are involved in the railway reconstruction program in a substantial way, and it is
suggested that they continue to take the lead in this sub-sector. IFOR is currently undertaking a
detailed survey of rail infrastructure.



-3-
7.    The port of Ploce, the main port for BH but located in the Republic of Croatia, was
damaged through bombing during the hostilities and requires urgent rehabilitation and possible
expansion. Nevertheless, the port is functioning and improvements are being considered for
financing under a proposed Reconstruction Loan to the Republic of Croatia.
8.    The public transport system in Sarajevo is barely functioning. Two tram lines have been
minimally repaired but the other means of public transport (buses, minibuses and trolley buses)
require extensive repairs and replacement of vehicles and supporting equipment. Public transport
vehicles and equipment in other cities (Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar and Bihac) also have been damaged
but less so than in Sarajevo, or run down due to the embargo (Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Doboj, and
Trebinje).
9.    Most institutions have suffered loss of staff and also premises and there is little budgetary
support for their operations. The Road Directorates (RDs) have been particularly hard hit with
much reduced staff and no permanent premises. Also, contractors and consultants staff were
mobilized into the armed forces and some have gone abroad. Further, much of the professional
engineering equipment was destroyed during the hostilities and currently funds are so limited that
institutions have difficulty in obtaining even the simplest supplies to run their offices.
The Strategy
10.   As part of the Bank assistance strategy, a Transport Reconstruction Program  (the
Program) was prepared which required total three year commitments of US$698 million, of which
US$301 million would be for the first year. The strategy detailed in the Program notes that
reconstruction of the transport network is essential for the recovery of economic activity and the
unification of the country. However, investment priorities and their implementation will be
determined by the implementation of the peace settlement. Population relocation may also
generate specific local transport requirements. Agreements with the Republic of Croatia and
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will significantly affect transport demand, particularly for
international traffic and the railways. Detailed technical condition surveys also need to be carried
out for some major investments (particularly those commencing in the second or third year) to
confirm or revise feasibility and priority assessments, and cost estimates. Technical assistance in
transport planning is included in the project to assist in setting up a planning unit within the
Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Communications (BHMTC)
and to prepare a short and medium term strategic transport plan with particular emphasis on
internal and international transport coordination.
11.   Under these circumstances, it is proposed to concentrate first on transport systems which
are going to be needed under any scenario, and plan in a flexible way to adapt to new information.
Within the overall Program, the most important transport systems include the north-south
corridor of Ploce-Sarajevo-Zenica-Tuzla and possibly further north, inter-city main and regional
roads, roads running east-west in the south, Sarajevo airport, public transport and some street
works, particularly in Sarajevo. The First Year Program (FYP), which is similar to that prepared



-4-
in December 1995 (para 10) covers those components that are needed most urgently, with other
components included in the second and third year subject to the findings of feasibility studies. The
FYP will be implemented through two projects. The first, this emergency project, comprises
works to overcome the most serious transport system constraints and amounts to US$149.0
million. The project includes such items as repairs to failing roads, reconstruction of downed
bridges, opening Sarajevo airport to scheduled services, improvement to rail services and
providing initial support to reestablishing urban transport services - principally in Sarajevo.
Preparation work for a proposed second project (Transport II) are also included. With an
estimated cost of about US$150.0 million, Transport II will complete the FYP and will likely
include works requiring more detailed preparation including major road construction, some or all
of the remaining downed Sava and Una bridges, further support to rail and urban transport, and
support to bring road maintenance activities up to an efficient level. Transport II will continue the
modernization of the transport system and support increasing efficiency through privatization.
Part II - First Year Program and the Project
A.    First Year Program and Project Objectives
12.   Objective: The objective of the FYP is to reconstruct and repair urgent high priority links and
services in the transport system - particularly roads, bridges, tunnels, the railways, Sarajevo airport and
urban transit, and to provide equipment and assistance to prepare, implement and maintain the program
works and to provide a framework for the future development and management of the country's
transport system.
13.   The FYP includes the following: (i) the rehabilitation of about 375km of main and regional
roads; (ii) repairs to tunnels and slips; (iii) reconstruction of about 30 national and 10 international
road and rail bridges; (iv) construction and maintenance equipment; (v) provision of asphalt plants
and quarries; (vi) equipment for the railways, including telecommunications equipment, spares for
rolling stock etc.; (vii) rehabilitation of Sarajevo airport; (vii) support for urban transport
including the supply of buses and parts and urgent repairs to urban streets and traffic systems;
(viii) supply of fuel and bitumen; (ix) technical assistance for project preparation, implementation
and support to transport institutions; and (x) mine clearing. The project is a slice of this FYP and its
relationship to the FYP and the proposed Transport II is shown below.

This latest FYP, shown in Table 1, varies slightly from the original first year program prepared in
December 1995. Better cost estimates are now available, the port of Ploce improvement may be
financed through financing to the Republic of Croatia, and the Gorazde road preparation has been
added. Further modifications are likely over time.
B.    Project Description
14.   Objective: The objective of the project is identical with that of the Program (para 12),
namely to reconstruct and repair high priority links in the transport system. The components
comprise mostly those items for which funding is assured or likely to be forthcoming, are of top
priority, where the state of preparation is such that all contracts will be awarded in 1996 and,
where for the most part, about 50% of disbursements will be made in the first year.
15.   To achieve these objectives, the project would comprise the components listed below:
(i)    Roads: the overlay and rehabilitation of about 180km high priority road sections
to restore these links to serviceable condition;
(ii)   Bridges: reconstruction of about 21 high priority bridges to eliminate lengthy
and/or dangerous deviations,
1 Includes engineering equipment.



-6-
(iii)  International Bridges: reconstruction of the Brcko rail and Orasje road bridges
across the Sava river to permit the flow of international traffic';
(iv)   Tunnels and Slips: repair of damaged tunnels and of landslips on critical road
links,
(v)   Construction and Maintenance Equipment: the provision of equipment to
contractors to support the rehabilitation of the road network and also equipment to begin to
reestablish the more urgent maintenance activities;
(vi)   Asphalt and Quarry Equipment: the provision of equipment needed to supply
base and surfacing material for urban street, road and airport rehabilitation;
(vii)  Railway Equipment: equipment required to open lines from Ploce to Sarajevo
for 6-7 pairs of trains per day, and the opening of lines to Zenica and Vares;
(viii)  Sarajevo Airport: the first phase of a rehabilitation program to enable safe and
secure operations of scheduled aviation services at the airport in accordance with ICAO standards
and recommended practices;
(ix)   Urban Transport: the provision of urban transit buses, spare parts and associated
workshop equipment and spares and equipment for the Sarajevo tram and trolley bus systems to
permit the movement of people and the resumption of economic activity;
(x)   Street Safety: the provision of urban street safety equipment including traffic
lights, sign manufacturing equipment, and equipment for the more urgent street repairs;
(xi)   Technical Assistance:  services  and  equipment to  assist with  project
implementation, institutional strengthening, preparation for further rehabilitation works and for
setting up transport planning institutions;
(xii)  Project Implementation Directorates (PIDs): the setting up and operation of
PIDs in the BHMTC, FMTC and RSMTC;
(xiii) Gorazde Road Preparation: preliminary studies and investigation and design of
new road to Gorazde, as required by the Dayton Agreement;
(xiv) Mine Clearing: services to clear all project sites of mines;
(xv)  Bitumen: supply of bitumen for roadworks to intercity and city streets; and
Diesel Fuel: a fuel component has also been included for parallel financing, but has not been
included in the overall project cost.
C.    Project Costs and Financing
16.   Details of the estimated project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The
total project cost is US$149.0 million equivalent. Price and physical contingencies (on civil
works) total US$13.5 million.
17.   Of the US$149.0 million, the Bank would provide US$35.0 million from the TFBH as a
Credit, at concessional terms similar to those offered by IDA. The EU would provide US$23.0
million as a grant. The EBRD would provide a loan and grants of about US$29.1 million,
I Will require international agreements between the Republic of Croatia and BH (see para. 2 1)



-7-
including grant funding for technical assistance, for Sarajevo airport. The Government of the
Netherlands has given grants totaling US$50.0 million for the benefit of the Federation, US$1.0
million of which has been allocated to transport for project preparation activities. The
Government of Italy has also indicated its interest to grant US$3.0 million for equipment to
Sarajevo airport. The Czech Republic is interested in assisting urban transport with US$1.5
million. The balance of US$56.4 million is expected to be provided by donors both on a parallel
basis as a financial contribution or in kind, and as Bank-administered funds. Retroactive financing
of up to US$7.0 million will be permitted from the TFBH Credit - mainly for some advance bridge
contracting and roadworks, mine clearing, equipment procurement and technical assistance. The
procurement and disbursement arrangements are shown in Schedule B.
D.    Project Implementation
18.   The BHMTC, the BH ministry charged with overall transport coordination, will be the
recipient of the funds and will delegate implementation responsibility for their respective parts of
the project to the FMTC and the RSMTC. All three ministries are creating Project
Implementation Directorates each headed by a director with a small staff for project
implementation. A Program Management Adviser (PMA) has been employed, through IMG, to
assist with implementation of the overall Transport Reconstruction Program and, within this
program, to assist all three PIDs. The PMA, with one deputy and a small staff, will report to the
Director of the BHMTC PID. From time to time, the PMA will be assisted by experts in
procurement and other specialized activities. The PMA also will be responsible for assisting the
BHMTC with coordination of aid in the transport sector. The BHMVTC will be responsible for
implementing those components of an international nature including the reconstruction of the
Sava bridges, some technical assistance and the rehabilitation of the Sarajevo airport; however it
is expected that, for the latter, the work will be delegated to the FMTC. The Bank's involvement
will continue under the proposed Transport II.
19.   Under the FMTC, the roads components (Part A of the project) will be implemented by
the Federal Road Directorate (FRD). Initially the FRD will be assisted by Dutch Trust Fund-
financed consultants providing Start Up Services (SUS), which commenced end-February 1996.
The services will be taken over mid 1996 by donor-financed consultants providing Roads
Advisory Services. Local and international consultants will be employed for design and
construction supervision activities.
20    The FRD, assisted by the SUS (para 19), will be responsible for the procurement of civil
works, civil works related consulting services for the Federation and for TFBH-financed
equipment. The RSRD will be responsible for procuring RS related preparation technical
assistance. Other items, including Sarajevo airport rehabilitation, equipment and urban transport
requirements will be procured according to donor's requirements. Working closely with the
National Mine Action Agency, each ministry will also be responsible for the mine clearing.



-8-
E.    Agreements Reached
21.   During negotiations, the following were discussed and agreed: (a) project objectives,
description, cost and financing; (b) the content of the proposed subsidiary loan agreement
between BH through the BH Ministry of Finance and the Federation, including the on-lending
arrangements for construction equipment, and that the submission of which, and agreement by the
Bank would be a condition of effectiveness; (c) the implementation arrangements and Plan, (d) the
procurement and disbursement procedures, and (e) that submission and agreement by the Bank on
agreements reached between BH and the Republic of Croatia would be a condition of
disbursement for the Orasje bridge component.
F.    Environmental Aspects
22.   The project will follow accepted Bank procedures and, as an emergency operation, the
project has not been assigned an environmental category. However, any subcomponents which
present an opportunity for environmental enhancement will be designed accordingly, and all
subcomponents will be monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no degradation to the
environment.
G.   Program Objective Categories
23.   The project will support the Government's program  to alleviate poverty through
employment generation. Jobs will be created directly within the construction and local consultant
industry through the roads and bridges reconstruction and maintenance program. As a serviceable
transport system is essential to jump start the economy, the project will also indirectly support the
creation of jobs throughout the territory.
H.   Benefits
24.   The economic benefits from restoring critical links in the road network are high. Downed
bridges are critical bottlenecks in the transport system and their reconstruction will eliminate
lengthy and/or dangerous deviations. For roads, vehicle running costs will be lowered on
improved road surfaces and, with the maintenance equipment, road pavement service life will be
extended through timely major maintenance. Rates of return for the type of work envisaged
average around 50%. Currently, air travel to and from BH is extremely restricted being limited to
military traffic, some charter flights and cumbersome UN flights operating out of Zagreb. With
Sarajevo being the principal airport of the country, rehabilitation will greatly facilitate access to
and from the country for international travelers, including those assisting in the reconstruction
program. The provision of buses and street safety equipment will support freedom of movement
and the resumption of employment and economic activity. The technical assistance component
will support project implementation and, with institutions sorely affected by the hostilities, will

promote a recreating and modernizing of transport institutions, particularly those dealing with
roads and airports. Besides the economic benefits, construction activity and the sight of new
equipment and buses will provide concrete evidence to the people that the peace process is
beginning to work and that the reconstruction program is underway.
I.    Risks
25.   There are many risks. Those of a political nature cannot be contained through this project.
Project related risks comprise mainly delays in implementation. Delays could be caused by: (a) the
fragility of institutions; (b) material shortages; and (c) the rate of mine clearing. In addition, there
is a risk of not closing the gap in the financing plan. The senior staff of the principal project
implementation agency, the FRD, have past experience working with the Bank. However, the
current political conditions are considerably different from those in the former Yugoslavia, and the
decision making processes have yet to gel. The FRD and its consultants have also been isolated
from technical advances particularly in computer assisted design and project management which
are considered normal practice elsewhere. The technical assistance assignments are designed to
provide immediate assistance in project implementation and thus minimize delays1 and then to
gradually assist with rebuilding and reforming the RD into modern highway organizations. Delays
due to shortage of materials - principally bitumen - and equipment could be reduced by donor
contribution in kind and further efforts will be made to secure such contributions. All successful
contractors will receive a higher than normal advance to secure some equipment. Finally, the
proposed Emergency Recovery Project includes construction equipment for the transport sector.
Experience with the pace of mine clearing in advance of project work is extremely limited but
experience from other countries indicates that it can delay implementation and be a source of
contractor claims. Clearly, mine clearing is on the critical path and the advance contracting of
mine clearing contracts is of the highest priority. Given the foregoing, and the lingering effects of
hostilities, it would be unusual if there were not some delays. Further, while there is a risk of not
completely closing the financing gap, now that the project has been appraised, additional potential
cofinanciers are showing a keen interest in participating. While not yet firm, an additional US$15-
20 million is under discussion. In the event that financing from donors could not be mobilized to
close the financing gap, the project scope would be reduced without adverse effect. Fortunately,
the bulk of the project is made up of small subcomponents providing flexibility in implementation
such that the project objectives can be met.
