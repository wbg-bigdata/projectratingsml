Bosnia and Herzegovina
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project
A. BACKGROUND
General
1.    Prior to the hostilities, the transport system of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was
organized to meet the needs of the former Yugoslavia. Inland transport was provided by a road
system (including 8,600 km of main and regional roads). As with other sectors, the ability of the
transport sector to function has been seriously affected by the hostilities. Virtually all parts of the
transport system have been damaged, either as a result of direct targeting, by the movements of
military vehicles on roads which were not designed to carry heavy traffic, or by lack of
maintenance and spare parts for more than four years.
Scope of Emergency
2.    Roads: The past four years of hostilities have affected the entire road network. Virtually
no road maintenance has been carried out and this combined with military traffic has caused
significant deterioration in road pavements. Roads either near or used as bypasses around
shifting confrontation lines have suffered the most with some sections of regional and local roads
now requiring complete reconstruction. Also roads used as deviations around downed bridges
(e.g. around the Visoko bridge) are breaking up. While some sections of main roads show only
superficial signs of apparent wear, they are well past due periodic maintenance and visible
distress can be expected soon with a more rapid deterioration setting in quickly. While the entire
network will need attention in the next five to seven years, about 28% of the main and regional
network will require more immediate attention within the next three years to remedy both
damage and the more severe effects of maintenance neglect. Damage estimates are based on
visual surveys and, without neglecting immediate attention to urgent works, will be
supplemented by technical investigations to confirm or revise the proposed repair treatment.
3.    Bridges: Bridges are prime strategic targets in military operations and, in the last four
years, about 70 bridges have been damaged with about 25 of these made impassable. Many of
these bridges are on main routes with the principal crossings now being maintained through
makeshift deviations or single lane military bridges. Although, for some impassable bridges, both
part or all of the superstructure and, in some cases, piers and/or pier heads have been destroyed,
many have the piers and abutments still standing and most reconstruction will be confined to
replacement of the decks. Demolition of the damaged sections and downed decks will form a
significant part of the reconstruction cost. Areas around and beneath some of the damaged
bridges have been mined.
4.    Sava/Una river bridges: All ten bridges (7 road, 2 road/rail and 1 rail) connecting the
Republic of Croatia with BH across the Sava and Una rivers are now impassable. Some have
been completely destroyed while others have one or two spans cut. At least one of the destroyed



Technical Annex p.2 of 26
bridges is still mined. While one or two ferries are operating and IFOR has constructed two
pontoon bridges near Orasje, most road and all rail traffic is virtually cut off from the rest of
Europe.
5.    Construction and maintenance equipment: Many items of construction and
maintenance equipment were damaged, destroyed or purloined during the hostilities. Much of
the remainder has suffered from neglect due to an inability to use the equipment or through lack
of spare parts. Shortage of this equipment now severely hampers reconstruction of the transport
system. Of particularly high priority is the need for asphalt plants and quarries to supply material
for the repair of both the road network and city streets.
6.    Railways: The railway system was severely damaged and, within the Federation, with
the exception of some minor lengths, is not functioning. Two bridges on the main line between
Ploce and Sarajevo and one between Sarajevo and Zenica have been cut and equipment
damaged or stolen. Some traction and rolling stock has also been damaged, but most is sitting in
unknown condition, in isolated pockets. A US$8.6 million EU initiative is underway to reopen
the main trunk line between Sarajevo and Ploce for about two pairs of trains per day. In the RS,
the line from Banja Luka west to Prijedor and to the east is functioning but with light traffic and
no connection outside RS. The EU and Germany are involved in the railway reconstruction
program in a substantial way and it is suggested that they continue to take the lead in this sub-
sector. IFOR is currently undertaking a detailed survey of the rail infrastructure.
7.    Airports: The runway, taxiways and aprons at Sarajevo airport are severely cracked and
most of the air traffic control equipment has been destroyed. In addition, most mobile
equipment, the lighting system and airport buildings have also been damaged. The airport is
operating but with military equipment and under the management of IFOR. While UNPROFOR
has carried out urgent maintenance works to the runway, taxiway and aprons, major repairs have
been precluded by the proximity of the confrontation line. For the remainder of the airports,
Banja Luka is said to be operational, Tuzla is operating as an IFOR base, and Bihac and Mostar
are damaged and not in operation.
8.    Ports: The port of Ploce, located in the Republic of Croatia, was bombed during the
hostilities, the oil terminal shut down and berths requires urgent rehabilitation and possibly
expansion. Nevertheless, the port is functioning mainly for military purposes and humanitarian
aid, although at a much reduced throughput than before hostilities. Port improvements are being
considered from financing under a proposed Reconstruction Loan to the Republic of Croatia.
9.    Urban transport: The public transport system in Sarajevo is barely functioning. Two
tram lines have been minimally repaired, but the other means of public transport (buses, mini-
buses and trolley buses) require extensive repairs to vehicles, installations and the workshops.
Public transportation vehicles and installations in other cities (Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar and Bihac)



Technical Annex p.3. of 26
are also reported to have been damaged but less so than in Sarajevo, or run down due to the
embargo (Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Doboj and Trebinje).
10.   Institutions: Most institutions have suffered loss of staff and also premises and there is
little budgetary support for their operations. The RDs have been particularly hard hit with much
reduced staff and no permanent premises. Also, contractors' and consultants' staff were
mobilized into the armed forces and some have gone abroad. Further, much of the professional
engineering equipment was destroyed during the hostilities and currently funds are so limited
such that institutions have difficulty in obtaining even the simplest supplies to run their offices.
B. DONOR'S RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
11.   In December 1995, in a joint effort with the Government and donor community, the
Bank assisted in preparing a reconstruction program that envisages funding requirements of
about US$5 billion over the next three to four years. Within that program, the funding
requirements for transport are estimated at US$698 million to be committed over three years
with first year requirements of US$301 million.
12.   The transport program (the Program) was based on a strategy that reconstruction of the
transport network is essential for the recovery of economic activity and the unification of the
country. Critical links should be restored without delay including those supporting national and
intemational traffic. However, other investment priorities will be influenced, more than in other
sectors, by the implementation of the Dayton Agreement and possible changed traffic patterns.
Population relocation may also generate specific local transport requirements. Agreements
between BH and the Republic of Croatia, and between BH and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia will also significantly affect transport demand, particularly for road and rail
international traffic. Significant short term traffic is already being generated by IFOR with
demands on the road, port and, when open, the rail system. Prehostilities traffic pattems are well
documented; however, given the foregoing, a cautious approach is recommended for medium
and long term investments. Under the project, assistance will be provided to the Bosnia and
Herzegovina Ministry of Foreign Trade and Intemational Communications (BHMTC) to set up
a planning unit to monitor the development of transport pattems and traffic and to produce
strategic plans for the short and medium term (para 36 (xv)).
13.   With the uncertainty of demand, the underlying strategy of the Program will be to
concentrate first on transport systems which are going to be needed under any scenario, and plan
in a flexible way to adapt to new information. The most important transport links include the
north-south corridor of Ploce-Sarajevo-Zenica-Tuzla and possibly fiirther north, inter-city main
and regional roads, roads running east-west in the south, Sarajevo airport, public transport and
some street works, particularly in Sarajevo. In addition, there are new links required to ensure
freedom of movement. The most urgent needs are proposed to be started in the first year, with



Technical Annex p.4 of 26
other important items included in the second and third years subject to the findings of feasibility
studies.
14.   Both the Bank and EBRD expect to play an important role in assisting with coordination
in the transport sector and facilitating dialogue between the various parties. Both institutions are
prepared to support the coordination function through the establishment of a coordinating body
such as an expert commission or corporation for the sector (see Annex 10 of the Dayton
Agreement). With respect to the international bridges across the Sava and Una rivers,
discussions have been taking place whereby the Republic of Croatia and BH would share the
cost of reconstruction. Accordingly, the project includes technical assistance for a quick review
of these bridges with recommendations and for recommendations on desirable bridge
intemational agreements (para 36 (iii)). Concerning the Port of Ploce, an agreement reached in
1994 (the Washington Agreement) envisaged free transit and free movement of goods through
Ploce. It is reasonable to expect that the necessary agreements or other provisions should be put
in place within a short period of time, and that investments in the port to be included in the
proposed Bank-financed emergency project to the Republic of Croatia would depend on the
successful conclusion of such arrangements.
15.   The First Year Program (FYP) which is similar to that prepared in December 1995
(see para 11) covers those components that are needed being most urgently, with other
components included in the second and third year subject to the findings of feasibility
studies. The FYP will be implemented through two projects. The first, this emergency
project, comprises works to overcome the most serious transport system constraints and
amounts to US$149.0 million. The project includes such items as repairs to failing roads,
reconstruction of downed bridges, opening Sarajevo airport to scheduled services,
improvement to rail services and providing initial support to reestablishing urban transport
services - principally in Sarajevo. Preparation work for a proposed second project
(Transport II) are also included. With an estimated cost of about US$150.0 million,
Transport II will complete the FYP and will likely include works requiring more detailed
preparation including major road construction, some or all of the remaining downed Sava
and Una bridges, further support to rail and urban transport, and support to bringing road
maintenance activities up to an efficient level. Transport II will continue the modernization
of the transport system and support increasing efficiency through privatization.
C. FIRST YEAR PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The program
16.   Objective: The objective of the FYP is to reconstruct and repair urgent high priority
links and services in the transport system - particularly roads, bridges, tunnels, the railways,
Sarajevo airport and urban transit, and to provide equipment and assistance to prepare,
implement and maintain the program works and to provide a framework for the future
development and management of the country's transport system.



Technical Annex p.5. of 26
17.   The FYP includes the following: (i) the rehabilitation of about 375km of main and
regional roads; (ii) repairs to tunnels; (iii) reconstruction of about 30 road bridges; (iv)
construction and maintenance equipment; (v) provision of asphalt plants and quarries; (vi)
equipment for the railways, including telecommunications equipment, spares for rolling
stock etc.; (vii) rehabilitation of Sarajevo airport; (viii) support for urban transport including
the supply of buses and parts and urgent repairs to urban streets and traffic systems; (ix) the
supply of fuel and bitumen; and (x) technical assistance for project preparation,
implementation and support to transport institutions. The project is a slice of this FYP and its
relationship to the FYP and the proposed Transport Project H is shown below.

This latest FYP, shown in Table 1, varies slightly from the original first year program prepared in
December 1995. Better cost estimates are now available, the port of Ploce improvement may be
financed through financings to the Republic of Croatia, and the Gorazde road preparation has
been added. Further modifications are likely over time.

The Project Description
18.   Objective: The objective of the project is identical with that of the Program (para
16), namely to reconstruct and repair high priority links in the transport system. The
components comprise mostly those items which that are adequately funded, and of top
priority, preparation is such that all contracts will be awarded in 1996 and, for the most
part, disbursements will be made the same year.
19.   Roads: The project includes those sections of high priority roads where only a minimal
to medium level of design work is required. The total of sections is approximately 180 km and
includes works to the Ml 7 (the main road from the port of Ploce through Sarajevo to Zenica
and routes west of Mostar). The Federation road program is shown in Table 3(a) (page 60) and
the RS Indicative Program in Annex I, Table A (page 30). The programs will be subject to
detailed review with consequent possible revisions and proposed major works will be subject to
confirmation/revision through feasibility studies.
20.   Bridges: About twenty-one concrete and composite steel/concrete bridges are included
for repair or reconstruction together with some steel modular bridging for high-priority
crossings. Modular bridging will be sited to aUlow eventual reconstruction of the bridges in 1997
or 1998. For the most part, bridges will be reconstructed similar to the original bridge designs
and their loading will be according to DIN standards. See Table 3 (b) (page 61) for project
works and Annex I, Table B (page 31) for RS Indicative Program. Work should commence on
two critical bridges in March 1996 (para 53).
21.   Sava river bridges: The project includes a study of the work required and priorities to
restore adequate road and rail communication between BH and the Republic of Croatia. The
study also includes assistance in formulating the necessary international agreements to manage
the reconstruction and operation of the crossings. In the meantime, the project includes the
reconstruction of the Brcko rail and Orasje road bridges and study and design of the more
critical of the remaining bridges identified by the above study.
22.   Construction and maintenance equipment: The project includes the procurement of a
variety of construction and maintenance equipment. The provision of this equipment is a
continuation of equipment supply begun under the Emergency Recovery Project which includes
US$11.1 million of construction equipment. The equipment will be for use both by contractors
and the RD's road maintenance organizations which will be provided with spare parts and
appropriate workshop equipment. Some minor adjustments may be made in requirements when
access permits a more detailed survey. Equipment used principally for regular maintenance will
be passed to RD maintenance organizations free of charge. Equipment used for contract
maintenance works and construction will be passed to companies under the following
arrangements:



Technical Annex p.7. of 26
A: Eligibility: The company must be a genuine autonomous joint stock or private company with
accounts kept following an acceptable practice;
B: Terms: Hire/purchase with payments calculated on 5% interest for seven years with an initial
two years grace period;
C: Equipment Location: Equipment may not be used outside of BH during the two years grace
period.
For project equipment, see Table 3 (c) (page 62) and Annex I, Table C (page 32) for RS
Indicative Program.
23.   Railway Equipment: The project also includes provision of equipment and materials
for the railway infrastructure which will complement the assistance underway by the EU and will
reopen the main line Ploce-Sarajevo for 6-7 pairs of trains per day, and lines to Zenica and
Vares. The equipment to be provided includes that required for track repair, repairs to the
electrical and telecommunication systems, and spare parts for locomotives, wagons and
passenger cars. The project will also provide equipment and tools to assist with the rehabilitation
of rail bridges. The list of needed equipment is attached in Table 3 (f) (pages 65-67).
24.   Sarajevo Airport: The works would cover the safety-related rehabilitation of the
Sarajevo Airport in order to provide adequate standards to reestablish commercial air services.
The emphasis is on a coordinated approach which will involve additional site surveys (see Annex
II), a review of design work underway on the runway, preliminary design of infrastructure and
the terminal building and identification of needs for navigational aids. EBRD is taking the lead in
preparing and implementing this component.
25.   Buses: About 96 urban transit buses will be procured for the cities and towns of the
Federation (75 buses) and Republica Sprska (21 buses). The buses will be 18m articulated 135
passengers models, 12m, 80 to 100 passengers models and 7m-9m, with 25-50 passengers
models for Sarajevo. The urban transit buses will be provided to the urban bus companies on
terms which should be not more generous than the correspondent donor funding. The project
also includes spare-parts for buses, repairs to workshops and workshop equipment. Details of
allocations to cities and towns is given in Tables 3 (e) (page 64) and Annex I (page 34). The EU
is taking the lead in this component.
26.   Street Safety: The project includes the provision of urban street safety equipment
including traffic lights, sign manufacturing equipment, and equipment for the more urgent street
repairs.
27.   Trams and Trolley Buses: The project includes spares and equipment to rehabilitate
the tram system and to restart the trolley buses on a limited emergency basis.



Technical Annex p.8 of 26
28.   Technical assistance: Technical assistance will be provided to the FRD to prepare and
implement the project and to both FRD and RS RD for preparation of a follow on project - see
Section D Studies and Technical Assistance and Annex IV for details (pages 39 to 58).
29.     Mine Clearing: Several bridge sites are known to be mined as well as the verges of
the paved roads, rendering repairs and reconstruction work extremely hazardous. All work sites
need to be cleared of mines out to a distance allowing freedom of movement and operation of
construction and repair teams, and the edges of these cleared areas will have to be clearly
marked. This mine clearance will be carried out by contract, with supervision by a National Mine
Action Agency.
30.     Vehicles, engineering and design equipment: Equipment for the FRD and local
consultants for preparatory work and construction supervision. The equipment would include
such items as four wheel drive vehicles, theodolites and computers.
31.   The High Representative's Office has indicated that financing of humanitarian aid and
project preparation work but not of investment projects in the RS would be acceptable.
Investments proposed under this project which would benefit and be located in the RS are
therefore subject to prior discussions with the High Representative's Office at the appropriate
time. Accordingly, the project includes technical assistance for project preparation and buses and
bus spare parts to support freedom of movement. An Indicative Transport Reconstruction
Program for Republica Srpska is given in Annex I (pages 28-34) and will be considered for a
future project subject to prior discussions with the High Representative's Office'.
Costs
32.   The estimated cost of the proposed project, excluding local taxes and customs duties, is
shown in Table 2 below. The total project cost is US$149.0 million. The total estimated project
cost includes US$9.9 million to meet any physical contingencies on civil works (15% of the civil
works cost), and US$3.6 million (2.5% of the base cost) for price contingencies for a period of
one year.
1 In a letter dated March 9, 1996, the High Representative indicated that he considers it
now appropriate to finance programs that link the Federation areas and the Republica
Srpska areas.

Financing
33.     The size and composition of the project may be adjusted to take advantage of further
financing, bearing in mind important linkages and priorities.
34.     Financing Plan: Of the US$149.0 million, the Bank would provide US$35 million
from the TFBH, at concessional terms similar to those offered by IDA. The EU would provide
US$23.0 million as a grant for transport project component. The EBRD would provide a loan
and grants of about US$29.1 million, as well as grant funding for technical assistance for
Sarajevo airport. The Government of the Netherlands has given grants totaling US$50.0 million
for the benefit of BH, US$1.0 million of which has been allocated to transport for project
preparation activities. The Government of Italy has also indicated its interest to grant US$3
million for Sarajevo airport. The Czech Republic has shown its interest in assisting urban
transport with US$1.5 million. The balance of US$56.4 million is expected,to be provided by
donors both on a parallel basis as a financial contribution or in kind, and as Bank-administered
funds. Retroactive financing, up to US$7.0 million, will be required for some high priority items
(see para.57).

E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Institutional Arrangements
38.     The project will be implemented through PlIDs as noted above. The principal PID will
be located in the BHMTC. The PIDs will have the responsibility for overseeing the management
of the project through the actual implementing agencies such as the FRD, BH Railways etc. The
BHMTC will be advised by the PMA who already has been employed to assist in overall
coordination of the Program and of this project in particular. The PMA would have a deputy
PMA and would be responsible for assisting the BHMTC PID and the PIDs in the other two
ministries. From time to time, the PMA would be assisted by experts in procurement and other
specialized activities.
39.     Roads and bridges: For Part A and F and some assignments in Part E, the FRD
would be responsible for implementation of the components. Local and international consultants
would be employed to undertake designs and construction supervision. To strengthen its
capacity to implement the project in a timely and efficient manner, using the Dutch Trust Funds
(para 34), the FRD will employ additional critical FRD staff for planning, road maintenance, and
project preparation and implementation functions. In addition, under a Start Up Services
contract also financed from Dutch Trust Funds, road engineers and, on an intermittent basis, a
bridge engineer will be employed for about five months to assist the FRD with the start up of the
project. By then, an international consulting firm will be employed to provide Roads Advisory
Services (RAS) to assist the FRD in project implementation and both the FRD and the RSRD in
upgrading and modernizing directorate organizations including road maintenance management.



Technical Annex p.15. of 26
The RAS would also provide advice to the RDs and local consultants and, with them, will carry
out training in construction supervision. Please see para 58 for details of institutional
arrangements relating to procurement.
Procurement, Accounts, Reporting
40.   Procurement: Because of the urgent nature of the project, the works, goods and
services are required to be contracted and supplied quickly so that reconstruction works can
start and also be seen to be starting. Procurement for TFBH financed items and those
financed from Bank administered funds will follow the Bank's Guidelines within which
procurement under emergency projects will be followed; however, with the exception of the
Dutch Trust Funds, all other financing institution and donor participation is on a parallel
basis and these entities (including the other major participant - EBRD) will follow their
normal procurement procedures. The procedures for this project are set out below.
General
41.   Advertisement. As early as possible a General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be
published in the Development Business announcing ICB procurement packages and
consultants to be procured and inviting interested eligible suppliers, contractors and
consultants to send their expression of interest to the project implementation agencies in
BH. The GPN will also invite civil works contractors to request prequalification documents.
The GPN will also be published in Bosnian and English in the local press. The GPN will be
followed by specific advertisements for individual contracts in the local press. Bidding
documents will be sent to suppliers who will respond to the GPN.
42.   Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used. These documents are being
customized and approved for each component to avoid further reviews. The period allowed
for submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks. Bid and payment currency will be
limited to one currency widely used in international trade. The documents have been
translated into Bosnian.
Goods
43.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be followed for procurement
packages estimated to cost more than US$5 million each. Given the small size of the goods
contracts, it is unlikely that ICB will be employed for goods.
44.   Limited International Bidding (LIB). LIB, tendering by invitation, will be used
for procurement packages estimated to cost over US$2 million but less than US$5 million
each. If there are a limited number of suppliers, the list for LIB should include them all.
Exceptions to this threshold will be the cases where there will be only a limited number of
suppliers. The following LIB procedure will be used:



Technical Annex p.16 of 26
(a)    List of LIB bidders. The list will be based both on the expressions of interest
received in response to the GPN as well as other sources, such as the implementing
agency and procurement agent's own experience, etc. The list will be as broad as
possible but must include at least three suppliers. Geographical distribution will be
considered to the maximum extent possible;
(b)   Bidding Documents for LIB. The Bank's Standard Bidding documents will be
used (see ICB above). Procedures will be established to enable dispatch of bidding
documents and receipt of bids by the fastest means of communications, such as fax
machines. This shall be subject to condition that project implementation agencies
and procurement agents will be required to put in place a mechanism to ensure
transparency and fairness and to avoid any manipulation of bids received by faxes.
LIB contracts will require prior approval of the Bank relating to the list of suppliers
and technical specifications.
45.   International Shopping (IS). IS will be used for procuring nearly all the project
equipment and materials estimated to cost up to US$2.0 million per contract up to an
aggregate amount of US$1.5 million. IS is based on comparison of price quotations
obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.
46.   National Shopping (LS). This method will be used for contracts for sundry items
and smaller items, including spare parts, computer equipment, and local commercial services
available in BH from more than one source up to an estimated cost of US$200,000 per
contract with at least three quotations.
47.   Direct Contracting (DC). Direct contracting will be used for proprietary items, for
reasons of compatibility and standardization, in any other justified case. All direct
contracting packages should be identified in the procurement plan for each project and
preapproved by the Bank. Any direct contracting during project implementation will need
prior Bank approval. Existing contracts will not be extended.
Works
48.   Prequalification: A prequalification of contractors, both for ICB and NCB, will be
carried out. For ICB, the Bank's standard prequalification documents will be followed; for
NCB, special documentation will be prepared with criteria to be agreed with the Bank. In
the interests of expediency, the notice inviting contractors to apply for prequalification will
be published as part of the GPN. which will be published as noted above (para 41). The
information in the completed questionnaire submitted by firms will be used to carry out their
general prequalification for different levels in terms of contract values. The prequalified
contractors will be listed in a registry. The registry will remain open for additions/deletions



Technical Annex p.17. of 26
during the course of project implementation. The prequalification criteria shall be approved
by the Bank.
49.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB): See ICB for Goods above. ICB for
works will be used for contracts estimated to cost more than US$5.0 million each. The
advertisement procedure will be the same as for goods. The Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for Works will be used for all ICB packages. ICB will be employed for the
construction of the Orasje bridge.
50.   National Competitive Bidding (NCB): Given the dispersed nature of works
(repairs of roads, etc.), NCB is proposed for contracts over US$1.0 million but less than
US$5.0 million per contract. However, interested foreign contractors will be allowed to
participate in NCB. The following procedure will be followed. Bidding Documents will be
sent to prequalified contractors who will be allowed four weeks to submit their bids. This
document shall include requirements based on the current situation in the country. The
German Mark (DM) will be used as the currency of bid pricing and contract. Most civil
works will be contracted using NCB.
51.   Simplified NCB. Simplified NCB will be used for works contracts estimated to cost
up to US$1 million per contract. These works will be procured under lumpsum, fixed price
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three qualified domestic contractors in
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of works,
including basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement
acceptable to the Bank and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made
to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has
the experience and resources to successfully complete the contract.
52.   Direct Contracting for Works. Any direct contracting not identified in the
procurement plan will be subject to the Bank's prior approval. Such approval has been
obtained for the direct contracting of the urgently needed reconstruction of the Bijela and
Jasen bridges on the M 17. The contract amounts will be about US$1,600,000 and
US$900,000 respectively (without contingencies).
Technical Services
53.   Limited International Bidding (LIB): LIB will be used to procure mine clearing
services (US$1.8 million) from a limited number of suppliers.
Services
54.   Consultants will be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines which shall
include both competition and sole sourcing. The sole sourcing packages will be identified
and justified in the procurement plan. Sole source contracting during project
implementation will need Bank's prior approval. Procurement documentation for contracts



Technical Annex p.18 of 26
with consulting firms procured competitively and exceeding US$200,000 each will also be
subject to Bank's prior review. For individuals, the prior review threshold will be
US$50,000. Follow up assignments will be permissible to the extent that this will be
indicated in the initial TORs. Details of consulting assignments and selection methods are
given in Annex IV (page 39).
Second-hand Equipment
55.   Second-hand equipment, such as buses, can be procured through sole-sourcing with
the Bank's prior approval, provided the equipment is appraised by an independent technical
expert to confirm that the used equipment being considered will meet the criteria for quality,
technical requirements, and economic value, and that spare parts and service for the
equipment will be available for the operation of the equipment.
Procurement Agents
56.   Because of lack of institutional capacity in BH, procurement agents and
construction managers may be used who will be responsible for the whole process of
procurement. Sole sourcing may be accepted if justified. The agent's contracts would cover
"door-to-door" services, including bidding, contracting, verification/inspection, certification,
and preparation of withdrawal applications. These requirements will be reflected in the
terms of reference for procurement agents. The procurement agents will report to their
principals, i.e., implementation agencies, and will cooperate fully with these implementation
agencies.
57.   Retroactive financing of up to US$7.0 million will be permitted to finance mine
clearing, the Sava/Una bridges review, some road and bridge project design, advance and
progress payments for the Bijela and Jasen bridge contracts on the MI 7, down payments for
equipment, and advance payments to road and bridge contractors. These urgent activities
are expected to commence in March 1996 and well before the Credit Agreement is likely to
be signed. Items to be financed under retroactive financing need to be procured following
the Bank's Guidelines and particularly the procurement procedures detailed in this Annex.
58.   Procurement Institutional Arrangements: The FMTC  will delegate  its
responsibility for contracting national road and bridge civil works to the FRD. The FRD
with some of the same senior staff and the local consultants have experience in
implementing past Bank-financed civil works and are somewhat familiar with Bank
procedures. However, FRD staff have been considerably depleted and this, together with
the large size of the program and the need for speedy implementation, necessitates up-to-
date project management assistance which will be provided initially through the Start Up
Services (SUS) (para 36 (i)) and then through the RAS (para 36 (viii)). For procurement of
the Bank-financed equipment, the FMTC may employ the procurement agent under the
Emergency Recovery Project in which is included US$1 1.1 million of transport related



Technical Annex p.19. of 26
construction equipment. For smaller items and items that are urgently needed (such as the
engineering equipment), the FRD may undertake its own procurement with the assistance of
the SUS. Procurement responsibility for the international Orasje bridge will be determined
through agreements to be reached between the Republic of Croatia and BH. Technical
assistance services including the Gorazde road preparation services will be procured by the
agencies requiring their services - particularly by the FRD. Assistance in the selection
process will be provided by the PMA and the SUS. The Bank will join a Project Launch
Workshop to be held March/April 1996. A summary of the procurement arrangements is
given in Table 4 below.

59.   Prior Review: Prior review in accordance with Appendix I of the Bank's Guidelines
will be followed tor the prequalification process detailed in para 48. Prior review in
accordance with para 2 of the same Appendix will be followed for: (i) Goods: all ICB, LIB
and Direct Contracting contracts and the first three contracts for International Shopping; (ii)
Works: all ICB, LIB and Direct Contracting contracts and the first three contracts for NCB
and simplified NCB. All ToR and hiring of consulting firms above US200,000 and
individuals above US50,000 will be subject to prior review by the Bank. To the extent
possible, this prior review will take place in the Bank's Resident Mission in Sarajevo.
60.     The US$35 million equivalent, would be disbursed against the project components
as follows:
Table 5: Disbursement Categories

Total (including contingencies)         35,000,000
61.     Special Account: To facilitate timely project implementation, the MoF would
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special
Account, in U.S. dollars in a commercial bank or in the Central Bank. The authorized
allocations of the MoF Special Account would be limited to US$5,000,000 representing
about four months (average) of the Bank's share of estimated expenditures expected to be
paid from the Special Accounts. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least
every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other
appropriate documents.



Technical Annex p.22 of 26
62.      Statements of Expenditure (SOEs): Disbursements would be made against
Statements of Expenditures for contracts (a) for goods and works up to US$2,000,000
equivalent; (b) all incremental operating costs and commercial services; (c) for consulting
firms up to US$200,000 equivalent; and (d) for individual consultants up to US$50,000
equivalent, for which detailed documents evidencing expenditures will be reviewed by the
FRD and the BHMTC and FMTC and made available for the required audit as well as to
Bank supervision missions. Disbursements against contracts exceeding US$2,000,000
equivalent would be made against normal documentation. The project completion date
would be December 31, 1997. An indicative disbursement Schedule is given in Table 5.
63.     Accounts: Separate and auditable project accounts would be established in the
FRD and BHMTC. The project accounts would comprise (i) a record of withdrawals on the
Bank Credit (Trust Fund) with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying
documentation; (ii) a record of transactions on the Special Accounts and the copies of the
bank statements on this account. Project Accounts documentation would be maintained for
one year after they have been audited.
64.     Audits: The project accounts would be audited at the end of each fiscal year of
the Borrower by independent auditors and under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Account and for Statements of
Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest six months
after the end of the fiscal year.
65.     Reporting: The BHMTC, the FMTC and FRD will prepare and furnish to the
Bank a quarterly progress report showing the status of implementation of the project as well
as financial report in a format and content acceptable to the Bank.
66.     Supervision Plan: Project implementation would incorporate maximum flexibility
in view of the fact that it will need to be adapted to changing circumstances.
Implementation progress would be evaluated at mid-term, i.e., approximately 9 months after
effectiveness. The review would assess the need for any adjustments, based on
implementation experience to date. The implementation responsibilities, as outlined above,
would be confirmed at negotiations. Given the need of expedited implementation of the
project, the project would be supervised every three months after effectiveness.
F. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
67.     Road Program: Using local consultants, 1MG had undertaken visual inspection of
most of the road network using a consistent system for assessing damage and repair costs. The
program was screened using this data and 1987 traffic data adjusted for changes in traffic
patterns. This gave an initial road program. An economic appraisal was undertaken for each



Technical Annex p.23. of 26
activity proposed in the roads program: reconstruction, rehabilitation and overlays. The costs per
kilometer and the original condition of the pavement for each activity is detailed in Table 6
below.
Table 6: Costs per kilometer
Activity                        Cost (US$/km)         Intemational Roughness
Index (IRI)
Reconstruction                     250,000                     7.0
Rehabilitation                     175,000                     5.5
Overlay                            100,000                     4.0
68.     Vehicle operating costs (VOC) for a typical car and truck were calculated using input
data provided by the Croatian Roads Administration, where well developed systems for such
analysis exist. A 50:50 split between cars and trucks was assumed. The HDM III VOC model
was used. The latest available traffic data in BH is from 1987 and traffic levels have fallen
considerably since this date. A broad approach was therefore adopted and savings in VOCs were
calculated for a number of AADTs (Annual Average Daily Traffic) 500, 1,000 and 2,000, which
through observation and discussions with the RD were felt to represent typical current levels on
the main and regional roads. Traffic was projected over a 10-year time period from 1996 to 2005
using GDP projections provided by the IMF and the Bank mission. The internal rate of return
(IRR) for each option is presented in Table 7 below.
Table 7: Internal Rate of Return for Roads
Activity          |                    AADT
500                1000               2000
Reconstruction             17%                43%                 106%
Rehabilitation             18%                44%                 107%
Overlay                    14%                36%                 86%
The analysis indicates that the road program proposed will yield high rates of return.
69.     Bridge Program: Critical bottlenecks in the road transport system are caused by
bridges destroyed during the course of the hostilities. Temporary bridge structures are now in
place on most of the main routes where bridges have been completely destroyed, but they are
normally only single lane. Traffic is delayed as a consequence of this reduced capacity and, at
certain locations, waiting times are considerable. A single lane pontoon bridge is now in place on
the Sarajevo to Mostar road, near Potoci, where delays of up to 4 hours have been recorded.
Where temporary structures are not available, diversions are made, increasing both the time and



Technical Annex p.24 of 26
cost of travel and in some instances, for example at Capljina, causing congestion in urban
centers. Damaged bridges are still used despite the constant risk of failure.
70.     Given the urgency of the work, a pragmatic approach was adopted to the bridge
program, based on discussions with the RDs, site visits by this mission and available traffic data.
About 21 bridges are included, requiring varying levels of reconstruction and repair, with a
further 10 in the RS Indicative Program. The project bridges selected for financing are on main
road links and their reconstruction/repair will obviate the use of dangerous and/or lengthy
deviations.
71.     Both road and bridge programs will be reviewed by the FRD and the SUS. Any
revisions will be subject to the approval of the Bank.
72.      Equipment: The FRD now has little operational equipment, the consequence of
hostilities damage, inadequate maintenance and theft. At present there is little routine
maintenance being undertaken in BH, the consequence in part of inadequate funding, but lack of
equipment is also a major problem. Provision of equipment to the Federation road maintenance
units will facilitate the resumption of routine maintenance activities. Failure to execute an
effective program of maintenance would adversely effect the benefits expected from the road
reconstruction program.
73.      Sarajevo Airport: There are five airports in BH: Banja Luka, Bihac, Tuzla, Mostar
and Sarajevo, the first two of which are former military airports. For the foreseeable future,
Sarajevo airport is the only airport likely to play an important role in commercial operations. As
a consequence of hostilities damage and neglect of maintenance, Sarajevo airport cannot be
used, at present, for civilian operations, including scheduled passenger services. Access to the
country is restricted to limited and cumbersome air services out of Zagreb or overland by road.
A rehabilitation project must be put in place in order for the airport to meet intemational aviation
standards and to enable international scheduled airlines to make use of it (see Annex II). There is
an immediate need for a basic rehabilitation program for two reasons: (a) it will greatly facilitate
access to and from the country for intemational travelers; and (b) it will present evidence to the
intemational community that civilian rule is restored and the situation in the country normalized.
74.      Technical Assistance: All institutions responsible for transport have been severely
affected by the hostilities. The technical assistance services are required to ensure the timely and
efficient execution of the project and to build up the capacity and capability of the institutions
such that they can effectively manage the transport sector. In particular, the RAS will assist the
FMTC and RSMTCs and the RDs in a review and restructuring of their organizations -
particularly in the area of road maintenance. The resulting modernized road maintenance
management will result in efficiencies of operations and lower vehicle operating costs. The
Sava/Una river bridges review will result in prioritizing of works and should also assist in the
creation of an efficient inter governmental coordinating body to manage the intemational



Technical Annex p.25. of 26
crossings. The transport planning assistance will assist in the creation of a planning unit in the
BHMTC and will assist in developing both short and medium  term  priorities including
rationalizing of public transport services.
75.      Urban Transport: Buses in Sarajevo were used as barricades against sniping activity
and most of the remainder were severely damaged by gunfire and blast. The project will alleviate
the resulting grave shortage of public transport in Sarajevo and in other cities by providing new
and reconditioned buses and will increase the quality of service. Major benefits will include
sharply reduced passenger waiting times and severe overcrowding, vehicle maintenance savings,
higher level of availability and fuel savings.
76.      The project will thus make a major impact on most sub sectors in the reconstruction of
the transport sector which in tum will support a restart of economic activity in the country.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Republica Srpska Indicative Program
1.    As indicated in the text (para 31), the High Representative's Office has indicated
that financing of humanitarian aid and project preparation work but not of investment
projects on the territory of the Republica Srpska would be acceptable. Investments
proposed under this project which would directly benefit and be located on the territory of
the Republica Srpska are therefore still subject to prior dicussions with the High
Representative's Office at the appropriate time. An Indicative Transport Reconstruction
Program for Republica Srpska is given below and may form part of a future project
subject to prior discussions with the High Representative's Office'.
2.    The RS Indicative Reconstruction Program  is similar to the program to the
Federation. However, while the program focuses also on priority links, some links have
increased in importance resulting from the Dayton Agreement.
3.    Roads (Table A): The road reconstruction shown in the Indicative Program and
totaling 150 km includes a significant upgrading to roads which reconnect major links
close to the separation line. The program also includes reconstruction and overlay of roads
leading to the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Indicative Road
Program is subject to detailed studies and confirmation/revision of priorities.
4.    Bridges (Table B): The Indicative Program comprises the reconstruction of
several high-priority bridges which are now impassable including some around the Foca
area. The Program is also subject to detailed studies and confirmation/revision of
priorities.
5.    Construction, Maintenance, Asphalt, and Quarries Equipment (Table C and
D): The Indicative Program is similar to the Federation's.
6.    Buses (Table E): The Indicative Program comprises supply of buses, spares and
workshop equipment for the cities of Banja Luka, Trebinje, Bijeljina and Doboj. These
buses are included in the project (see para 31).
1 In a letter dated March 9, 1996 the High Representative indicated that he considers it
now appropriate to finance programs that link the Federation areas and the Republica
Srpska areas.

Annex 11 p.1 of 3
SARAJEVO AIRPORT INITIAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    Background
In July 1992, UNPROFOR took over responsibility for the managemiient and operations of
the Airport on a temporary basis in order to ensure the transport of humanitarian aid and
various materials for the UNPROFOR operations. With the implementation of the Dayton
Agreement, responsibility for the operations of the Airport was transferred to IFOR, the
French Army on behalf of IFOR will continue to operate the Airport until the end of 1996
It is, however, expected that the Airport will gradually be taken over by a state-owned
corporation as from 15 April.
It is envisaged that the Airport will be rehabilitated in two phases: one initial rehabilitation
phase and one full rehabilitation phase. The purpose of the initial phase is to implement all
those measures which are required as a minimum in order to enable safe and secure
operations of scheduled aviation services at the Airport in accordance with ICAO
standards and recommended practices. The purpose of the full rehabilitation phase is then
to undertake the remaining works and the provision of additional equipment required to
provide a service level which is normal at an airport of the size of Sarajevo in Europe.
The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has made a preliminary
allocation of USD 10 million for financing the initial rehabilitation phase and an additional
USD 5 million have preliminary been pledged by one donor as a contribution to the initial
rehabilitation phase.
The EBRD has also allocated the ECU 150,000 from the Bank's Technical Cooperation
funds in order to prepare the preliminary design and cost estimates for the initial
rehabilitation phase. The terms of reference for this study, which are attached, have been
reviewed and discussed together with Directorate of Civil Aviation, including the
management of the Airport of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
2.    Issues
Approval of Initial Study: In order for the EBRD to initiate the recruitment of consultants
to undertake the preparation the preliminary design for the initial rehabilitation phase,
there is a need for an expression of approval by the Ministry of Transport and
Communications. Recruitment of consultants can commence on 23 February, so that the
consultants can commence working in the field at the beginning of March, leading to a
preliminary design with cost estimates being available by the end of April.
Proposed Rehabilitation Program for the Airside Infrastructure: Preliminary work has been
done to map out the rehabilitation works required of the airside infrastructure. In a study



-36-
Annex II p.2 of 3
carried out by the UN Office of the Special Coordinator for Sarajevo, dated April 1995, it
is proposed that 5 cm of wearing course plus I cm of the base course of the runway,
exitways, taxiway and the apron be cut out and be replaced with new asphalt concrete of
the same thickness. It is also proposed that an additional 8 cm of asphalt concrete be
added on the runway only, as reinforcement. The European Commission (EC) and the
French government have made available ECU 1.56 million and ECU 0.317 million,
respectively, to allow for a partial implementation of the rehabilitation works of the
runway during the first half of 1996; the French contribution would be in kind.
Work done by the EBRD mission suggests that there may be other and more appropriate
approaches to the reconstruction of the airside infrastructure both in the short and long
terms. It is likely that the most appropriate approach at the present time would be to
undertake a minimum program concerning the airside infrastructure during the present
year, comprising an overlay of micro asphalt. Such an action would likely enable more
extensive reconstruction works to be delayed for about three or four years and to be
undertaken as part of the proposed full rehabilitation phase of the airport.
The EBRD mission would therefore suggest that the resources made available by the EC
and the French government instead be devoted to implementing such a resurfacing
program, and that the remaining resources available from EC and France then be devoted
to a program of clearing the airport of all mines. Ideally, the mine clearing should be
undertaken in two phases; the first by the military and the second by an expert commercial
company in the field. A certificate of mine clearance is likely to be a requirement for any
other work on the rehabilitation of the airport to commence, and the mission would
therefore like to suggest that this be done as soon as possible.
The Institutional Structure for the Operations of the Airport: Annex 9 of the Dayton
Framework Agreement apparently does not provide for clear guidelines for the ownership
of and how to operate airports in the future Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a need for the
parties concerned to reach an agreement on this in order for any actual implementation
work of the Sarajevo Airport to commence.
Institution Building: Although a substantial number of people who were involved in the
aviation sector in Sarajevo during the period of former Yugoslavia will be available for the
future operations of the airport, there is a need for designing a program for building up the
capacity required to operate the airport as an international airport, including to handle air
traffic control. The approach chosen to this end will be of crucial importance to the aim of
opening up the airport to international scheduled aviation. Initial discussions have been
held between the Directorate of Civil Aviation and the management of the airports of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the EBRD mission. There is a need for developing these ideas
further, and also to mobilize the funds required for implementing the institution building
program on a timely basis.

Annex IV p.3 of 20
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project
Start Up Services
Terms of Reference
1.    Objective: The purpose of the assignment is provide assistance to the Federation
Roads Directorates of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the start-up phase of the roads, bridges
and tunnels (the roads) component of a proposed donor financed Emergency
Reconstruction Transport Project. The Services are expected to commence in mid-
February 1996.
2.    Background: Conscious of the need to rebuild the transport infrastructure of
Bosnia and Herzegovina following the recent war, the World Bank and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) intend to finance (and act as
coordinators of other donors wishing to finance) an Emergency Reconstruction Transport
Project. A joint World Bank/EBRD appraisal of the proposed project was carried out in
Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period 10th to 23rd January 1996. Details of the
project are given in a discussion paper prepared during the course of the appraisal and
subsequent documents.
3.    The proposed project includes technical assistance to the Roads Directorates of
Bosnia and Herzegovina through a proposed Roads Advisory Service, but it is unlikely
that personnel to provide these services will be in place until about June 1996. There is,
therefore, a need for start-up advice and assistance to be provided to the Roads
Directorates commencing mid-February and lasting until the Roads Advisory Service is in
place.
4.    Scope of Work: The Consultants will work closely with the Ministry of Traffic
and Communications of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, IMG (based in
Sarajevo), the EBRD, and the World Bank's Resident Representative in Sarajevo in their
performance of the Services. The Consultants will be expected to travel throughout the
country as conditions permit but the Consultants should be aware that areas of the country
and facilities have been mined and they should not venture into such areas or facilities
before they have been certified clear of mines. At the moment, these Terms of Reference
do not cover the territory of Republica Srpska. Conditions may change, and the
Consultants should be prepared to expand their activities to cover Republica Srpska when
requested in writing by the Bank.
5.    Design and Construction: At the time of the appraisal mission a program of
emergency road and bridge repairs was drawn up and tentatively agreed with then
Ministry of Transport and the Roads Directorates in Mostar and Sarajevo (for the
Federation area). However, significant ministerial reorganizations have since taken place



-42-
Annex IV p.4 of 20
and there will be a need to review and agree the program with the new authorities,
keeping in mind that while priorities may change from those previously perceived, they
must still be based on sound economic criteria and value for money rather than political
considerations. With this in mind, the Consultants will, prior to (and as a basis for)
finalizing the road repair program, carry out a riding quality survey and drive-over visual
assessment of the roads under consideration.
6.    Draft terms of reference for the preparation of engineering designs and bidding
documents for road and bridge repair works have been drawn up and passed to local
consultants for comment and pricing. These negotiations must be finalized on realistic
terms of engagement in order that contracts for design may be prepared for Bank's
approval and letting. The Consultants will assist the Roads Directorates in determining
local consultants' equipment needs for the preparation of these designs.
7.    The Consultants will assist the Roads Directorates to manage the designs being
carried out and to ensure that appropriate and consistent standards are adopted in all
areas. The Bank's standard bidding documents have already been translated into Bosnian
but the Consultants will review the existing standard specification for road and
bridgework's and prepare an updating document in Bosnian and English for inclusion as
part of the standard bidding document. Work packages will be put together to enable a
variety of procurement methods to be used.
8.    The design of certain bridge works is already finalized but bidding documents must
be prepared in Bank's standard format to allow these works to be let to local contractors
by direct negotiation. The Consultants will also assist in negotiating contracts (including a
review of rates) with contractors for the construction of the Bijela and Jasen bridges and,
during the period of the Services, will assist in construction supervision.
9.    Road Maintenance: An estimate has been made of the number of road
maintenance depots to be established in each part of the country. This must be refined and
the extent and the condition of existing equipment verified. Eventually most periodic and
winter maintenance activities (and, possibly, even routine maintenance) will be contracted
out but recommendations are to be prepared on the road maintenance organization that
should be put in place both for the immediate need and in the longer term to ensure timely
maintenance of the repaired infrastructure.
10.   The number of aggregate crushing plants and asphalt plants to be established or
reestablished in each part of the country has to be agreed with the Roads Directorates. It
is envisaged that these plants will be run by local contractors on a commercial basis but
the way in which it will operate is still to be resolved. The Consultants must visit each site
and determine the condition of the existing equipment to see whether completely new
equipment or just spare parts are needed and to confirm, in the case of the aggregate



-43-
Annex IV p.5 of 20
crushing plants, that the type of material available is indeed suitable. Each plant is to be
sited so that maximum benefit can be obtained from the equipment provided.
11.   The Consultants will prepare  specifications and  bidding  documents for
maintenance and quarry equipment and will assist in its procurement. For the more
immediate items, the Consultants may be called upon to assist the Federation Ministry of
Traffic and Communications and the Roads Directorates through the entire process; for
other items and for donor supplied equipment (either parallel financing or in kind) the
Services are likely to be advisory only.
12.   Time Schedule: The Consultants are expected to arrive in Sarajevo to commence
work on or about 15 February 1996.
13.   Reporting: The Consultants will produce the following reports in accordance
with the schedule below in the requested languages:

Bosnia and Herzegovina Reconstruction Program
Road Advisory Services
Terms of Reference
1.    Objective:   The objective of services is to provide advice and assistance to the Federation
Road Directorate (FRD) of Bosnia and Herzegovina in managing their road and bridge reconstruction
programs.
2.    Background' Together with loss of life and severe damage to property and infrastructure,
hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have damaged roads and bridges and have also brought about a
3-4 year hiatus in road maintenance. Bridges have been destroyed, tunnels damaged and road
pavements have deteriorated both due to direct damage from the hostilities (track damage, shell holes,
overloading and destruction of secondary roads etc) and also, most markedly, due to neglect. In
addition, road maintenance equipment has been purloined, damaged or destroyed, and road
maintenance units broken up.
3.    In 1993, through UN auspices and with funding from the European Union, a project
management group was formed called the International Management Group (1MG). 1MG filled a vital
need and has performed a multitude of tasks ranging from procurement of equipment for
UNPROFOR, managing construction and reconstruction projects (by UNPROFOR) to working with
many Government entities in damage assessment and containment. IMG has branches in Zenica, Tuzla,
Mostar, Sarajevo and in Zagreb (Republic of Croatia). IMG has detailed and well prepared data on the
road system and its status and will cooperate fully with the consultants in providing this data and in
assisting the Consultants in carrying out these Terms of Reference
4.    A World Bank led reconstruction mission took place October/November and prepared and
distributed a report entitled 'Bosnia and Herzegovina: Priorities for Recovery and Growth" The report
covers in some details the reconstruction needs all sectors including the roads and bridges sub sector.
The report was discussed at Donor's meeting held December 20 and 21, 1995. In these ToR, the
report is referred to as the Program. In January 1996, a combined Bank/EBRD follow up mission took
place to prepare an Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project. The Project is the first step to
implementing the overall Program.
5.    In the overall Program, the road, bridge, tunnel and road maintenance and associated
equipment program amounts to US$468 million with a target first year commitment of US$174
million. Road maintenance equipment, asphalt and quarry equipment makes up about half (US$84
million) of the first year amount and, indeed, much of it must be procured before many road works can
begin. There is a critical need to assist with the organization of this massive road program, to arrange

investigation and design contracts and assist with design contract supervision, prepare bidding
documents, invite bids and award contracts and, in road maintenance, confirm the condition of existing
equipment and the proposed requirements for the future road maintenance management system, and to
prepare the equipment specifications.
6.    The proposed Transport Reconstruction Project appraised In January, 1996, amounts to about
US$149 miilion and comprises
(i)    Roads: the overlay and rehabilitation of about 180km high priority road sections
to restore these links to serviceable condition;
(ii)   Bridges: reconstruction of about 21 high priority bridges to eliminate lengthy
and/or dangerous deviations;
(iii)  International Bridges: reconstruction of the Brcko rail and Orasje road bridges
across the Sava river to permit the flow of international traffic2;
(iv)   Tunnels and Slips: repair of damaged tunnels and of landslips on critical road
links:
(v)   Construction and Maintenance Equipment: the provision of equipment to
contractors to support the rehabilitation of the road network and also equipment to begin to
reestablish the more urgent maintenance activities;
(vi)   Asphalt and Quarry Equipment: the provision of equipment needed to supply
base and surfacing material for urban street, road and airport rehabilitation;
(vii)  Railways Equipment: equipment required to open lines from Ploce to Sarajevo
for 6-7 pairs of trains per day ,and the opening of lines to Zenica and Vares;
(viii)  Sarajevo Airport: the first phase of a rehabilitation program to enable safe and
secure operations of scheduled aviation services at the airport in accordance with ICAO standards
and recommended practices;
(ix)   Urban Transport: the provision of urban transit buses, spare parts and associated
workshop equipment and spares and equipment for the Sarajevo tram and trolley bus systems to
permit the movement of people and the resumption of economic activity,
(x)   Street Safety: the provision of urban street safety equipment including traffic
lights, sign manufacturing equipment, and equipment for the more urgent street repairs;
(xi)   Technical Assistance:  services  and  equipment to  assist with  project
implementation, institutional strengthening, preparation for further rehabilitation works and for
setting up transport planning institutions;
(xii)  Project Implementation Directorates (PIDs): the setting up and operation of
PIDs in the BHMTC. FMTC and RSMTC:
(xiii) Gorazde Road Preparation: preliminary studies and investigation and design of
new road to Gorazde, as required by the Dayton Agreement;
(xiv) Mine Clearing: services to clear all project sites of mines;
(xv)  Bitumen: supply of bitumen for roadworks to intercity and city streets; and
2 Will require international agreements between the Republic of Croatia and BH (see para. 2 1)



-46-
Annex IV p.8 of 20
(xvi) Diesel Fuel: a fuel component has also been included for parallel financing but has
not been included in the overall cost.
7.    The Federation Road Directorate (FRD) has been affected by the hostilities with that for the
Federation having lost its premises, its equipment and with a good portion of its staff dispersed.
Assistance is needed not only to implement the Project described above, but also to assist in rebuilding
and modernizing the FRD such that they can implement the overall reconstruction Program and
manage the networks in an efficient manner.
8.    To meet immediate needs, a consulting firm has already been employed directly by the World
Bank to provide Start Up Services which will assist the Federation RD with the first stages of project
management and with the preparation of equipment specifications. The services covered by these ToR
will take over and expand the work begun by this firm.
9.     Scope of Consulting Services. The scope of the services are set out below; however, the
Consultants should recognize that the situation is an unusual one and that, within the overall objectives
of the services, calls may be made on their services which depart from those listed below. In the
conduct of their work, the Consultants shall be working alongside staff of the Federation RD and shall
collaborate fully with such staff. As necessary, the consultants will also collaborate with other branches
of the government and with the government of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The consultants
will also collaborate fully with IMG which has agreed to assist the consultants in the attainment of the
objectives. Further, many donors are expected to participate in the transport reconstruction program
with their activities following different procedures and practices, including different procurement
procedures and with these activities at different stages. The consultants will need to demonstrate a high
degree of adaptability to the preparation and implementation of the program as it evolves. An
indicative staffing schedule is attached.
1 0    The services will cover the entire State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as necessary, adjoining
countries, for advice and assistance on the reconstruction of international crossings and ports.
11.   The scope of the services will advice and assistance in the following areas
(i)    confirmation of needs and priorities;
(ii)   project management;
(ii)   investigation;
(iv)   design;
(v)    procurement activities;
(vi)   construction supervision;
(vii)  equipment specifications;
(viii)  road maintenance;



-47-
Annex IV p.9 of 20
(ix)   engineering equipment; and
(x)    coordination.
12.   Confirmation of Needs and Priorities: With the FRD and local consultants, 1MG has carried
out damage assessments of most roads, bridges and tunnels. After discussions with IMG, the
Consultants will confirm/refine the assessments to the extent necessary for the appropriate levels of
investigation and design. The Consultants will continue with an assessment of maintenance, quarry and
asphalting equipment if any assessment is still outstanding. The Consultants will also review the overall
road, bridge and tunnel reconstruction program and advise on any desirable changes in priorities.
13.   Project Management: Assisting with project management will be the consultants main
activity. The Consultants will continue past assistance to the RDs in planning, organizing and managing
tasks and resources needed for the preparation and implementation activities such that all the planned
first year work/ procurement commences within 1996 with commitments in line with the Program
amount of around US$ 297.0 million. The Consultants will introduce up to date computer assisted
planning techniques and will train local staff in their use. This will include a confirmation/revision of an
assessment of available capacity including capacity within the FRD itself, the local consulting industry,
local capacity and the capacity that is likely to be available in adjoining countries. The Consultants will
make recommendations and also assist with expanding this capacity to meet the needs of the Program -
including expanding the staff of the FRD. The Consultants will introduce up to date computer assisted
project management techniques and will train local staff in their use.
14.   Investigation: The Consultants will assist in determining the levels of investigation still
required of the various works. In considering investigation or any activity at a potential works site, the
Consultants will assist the FRD in its dealing with competent entities including NATO in ensuring that
sites and surrounding area are mine free. For roads, while some works are of such an urgent nature that
overlays are required immediately, for the remainder, the Consultants will assist the FRD in setting up
systematic pavement strength assessment programs. The Consultants contract includes for the
procurement of some of this equipment. For this and other equipment (procured, rented or borrowed),
the Consultants will train both FRD and local consulting staff in its use.
15    Design: Local consultants are quite capable of undertaking acceptable road and bridge design
and, apart form random design checks, it is not expected that the Consultants will need to engage any
detailed design themselves; however there is a need to modernize the design process and improve
productivity. Road geometric design standards have been agreed with the World Bank and the German
DIN standards used for bridge design are also acceptable. The Consultants should ensure that road and
bridge standards incorporate the new European 11.5 ton axle load and that, as appropriate, designs
take account of military traffic. The Consultants will also review the construction specifications to
determine if these are acceptable for the proposed works and will recommend any revisions deemed
necessary. The Consultants will assist the FRD in arranging for all documents to be translated into the
English language - for drawings, this need only be a glossary of terms used in the drawings -or, if the



-48-
Annex IV p.10 of 20
English language is not acceptable, in a language requested by a particular donor. In addition, the FRD
and the local consultants could benefit from assistance in the management of the design process to
achieve economy efficiency and timely production of documents suitable for bid invitation. FRD staff
and local consultants could also benefit from training in modem pavement assessment and design, and
the introduction of contemporary computerized road and structural design techniques.
16    Procurement Activities: The Consultants will assist the RD with procurement activities but,
except for the procurement of computers, office and engineering equipment, not with actual
procurement. In other words, except as previously noted, the Consultants will not act as procurement
agents. Some of this procurement will be already underway. The assistance will comprise assistance in
procurement planning, preparation of documentation, the bidding and evaluation process and contract
award and monitoring. The procurement arrangements will largely depend on the procedures of a
particular donor/financing agency. For World Bank and EBRD procurement, both the World Bank and
the EBRD Guidelines on Procurement and on Consultants (as modified for emergency procurement for
Bosnia and Herzegovina) will be used together with the Bank's Standard documentation. The
Consultants will liaise with other advisors providing procurement assistance to the Ministries of
Transport and to other agencies, and with the implementation staff in the World Bank Resident
Mission.
17.   Construction Supervision: Under the project management activity, the consultants will assist
the RDs in organizing effective construction supervision. In the past, under the self management
system, construction supervision was limited. The Consultants will therefore be expected to prepare
ToRs for such supervision and provide theoretical and on-the-job training to RD staff and local
consultants in supervision practice. The repaving projects are seen as suitable vehicles for 'hands on"
construction supervision training and, for the larger works, if they have not already done so,
consultants may be asked to hire some international staff to provide the core for their supervision
activities.
18.   Equipment Specifications: It is expected that most of the equipment specifications will have
been prepared prior to the start of these services; however, if some road maintenance, asphalting,
quarry or other RD related specifications still have to be prepared, assisting with their preparation will
be the responsibility of the Consultants. These should be prepared to meet the requirements of the
donors/financing agencies concerned.
19.   Road Maintenance: The Consultants will advise the FRD in al] aspects of maintenance policy
and practice. This will include a refining of the preliminary work undertaken by IMG and by the Start
Up Services consultants (para 8) and recommending policy, organizations and practices for road
maintenance on a prioritized permanent basis. On a preliminary basis, equipment is being procured to
equip eighteen maintenance depots for the entire country. The Consultants should not be bound by this
figure and should feel free to make their own recommendations for the organizations. The aim is to set



-49-
Annex IV p.1 1 of 20
up road maintenance management organizations which will function on the basis of a modem road
maintenance management system. When conditions return to near normal, i.e when the urgent works
are completed, road maintenance policy should be such that most periodic maintenance activities, snow
clearing and other well defined activities will be undertaken through contracts with private contractors.
This should be taken into account when devising a program for the urgent overlay works so that as
much work as possible is put out to contract with private contractors. Nevertheless, given that most
overlay work was previously undertaken by the road organizations themselves, it is unlikely that, even
in normal times, there was much contracting capacity with the asphalting capability needed for this
urgent program. Hence it could be that, initially, most of the urgent overlays are undertaken by
maintenance units and equipment to be procured under the Program will be allocated to them. But, at
some time in the future, mechanisms should be set up such that this asphalting equipment can be sold
to local contractors. Similarly, at the start of the program, if there are local contractors who have a
track record of performing this type of work, some equipment might be made available to these
contractors either through outright sale, loans or deductions from the contracts.
20.   Engineering Equipment: The project includes for the procurement of 8 vehicles and
US$670,000 of investigation, design, computer and office equipment. Immediately on arrival, the
Consultants should assess with the FRD its specific requirements and, as appropriate, local consultants.
Major items may be held by the FRD and rented to local consultants for use on the Program.
21.   Coordination: It is self evident that with a Program of this size and with the willingness of
donors to assist in its implementation that there must be good coordination amongst all parties. The
Consultants will assist the FRD with this coordination ensuring a minimum of duplication of effort in
preparation and implementation. Through the FRD, the Consultants will maintain constant contact with
donor and financing agencies offices in Sarajevo and will assist the FRD in preparing status reports for
interested parties. The Consultants will also assist the FRD in managing the expected large flow of
solicitations expected from consulting firms, suppliers and contractors. Time Schedule: The period of
the assignment is 30 months. The Consultants will be expected to mobilize their team (at a minimum,
the team leader) in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Starting Date (the date from which payments are
measured); the Starting Date will be two weeks after contract signing.
22.   Reporting Requirements: The Consultants shall prepare and submit the following reports to
the Government of the Federation and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to other
parties as noted, within the time periods and in the quantities and language required (to be determined).
23.   All reports to the Government shall be in Bosnian. All reports to the World Bank shall be in
English. Reports to donors may be in English or the language of the donor. Inception and progress
reports shall be brief The inception report shall summarize the Consultant's initial findings, outstanding
mobilization problems (if any) and out line of the work program for the next six months. Progress
reports shall contain a brief summary of the work accomplished in the previous two months, an outline



-50-
Annex IV p.12 of 20
of the work to be performed over the next two works and any issues being faced. The format and
content of other reports will be determnined during the assignment.
24.   Training: The Consultants will be expected to make every effort to transfer skills and modem
concepts to the local personnel with whom they are working. As part of this goal, the Consultant will
hold seminars and workshops on the subjects relevant to the services, covering particularly, project
management, construction supervision and road maintenance management systems. The Consultants
will also assist in selecting and placing personnel on study tours to be funded under the overall
Program.
25.    Data, Services and Facilities to be Provided by the Government: To be discussed with the
Governments. However, it is unlikely that much can be provided. It would be advantageous for the
Consultants offices to be in the roads directorates buildings and it is possible that the Government
might fund the communications costs.
26.   Services and Facilities to be Provided by the Consultant: The Consultants will be expected
to provide their own accommodation, transport, office equipment, supplies, translators, secretaries,
drivers, and the running cost of the vehicles and the offices.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project
Review of Sava / Una River International Crossings
Terms of Reference
I. Objectives
1.    The objectives of the services (the Review) are: (i) to prepare a report on the status,
existing designs, required preparation work, preliminary cost estimates and recommendations on a
reconstruction program concerning the reconstruction of the ten international road and rail
bridges on Sava and Una bridges on the border of the Republic of Croatia and the State of Bosnia
and Herzegovina; and (ii) to provide recommendations (including models) on the agreements
which should be reached between the governments for the construction and maintenance of the
bridges. The results of the review and material collected will be held by the governments of the
Republic of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and, within Bosnia and Herzegovina the Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republica Srpska.
H. Background
3.    Together with loss of life and severe damage to property and infrastructure, hostilities in
Bosnia and Herzegovina have damaged roads and bridges and have also brought about a 3-4 year
hiatus in road maintenance. Bridges have been destroyed, tunnels damaged and road pavements
have deteriorated both due to direct war damage (track damage, shell holes, overloading and
destruction of secondary roads etc) and also, most markedly, due to neglect. In addition, road
maintenance equipment has been purloined, damaged or destroyed, and road maintenance units
broken up. All international bridges spanning the Sava and Una rivers have been cut and at least
one is still mined.
3.    Some reviews of the Sava\Una have already taken place with variations in detail and depth
depending the accessibility of the bridges at the time the review took place. Probably the most
detailed information is held by IFOR whose engineers have detailed photographs of each site and
some further information. A report on the original construction of each road bridge is available -
but not necessarily the original drawings.
4.    A World Bank led reconstruction mission has prepared, and distributed to potential
donors, a report entitled "Bosnia and Herzegovina: Priorities for Recovery and Growth". The
report covers in some details the reconstruction needs all sectors including the roads and bridges
sub sector. The report was discussed at Donor's meeting held December 20 and 21, 1995. In



-52-
Annex IV p.14 of 20
these ToR, the report is referred to as the Program. In January 1996, a combined Bank/EBRD
follow up mission took place to prepare a Transport Reconstruction Project. The project includes
this review and the possible reconstruction of the Orasje road bridge. The governments of the
State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the Federation and Republica Sprska
have all expressed their support for the Review.
III. Scope of Services
5.    General: The consultants should  contact all appropriate  governmental or non-
governmental, civilian and military agencies including the relevant ministries, road directorates,
local authorities, IFOR, consultants, and contractors (including Duro Dakovic) on both sides of
the rivers and to obtain all the available information on the bridges. The World Bank will assist in
arranging the contacts. The consultants will document and copy the data and its sources and will
analyze the information received.
Status Assessment
6.    The consultants will then arrange to visit all the bridge sites with the appropriate
authorities (usually with different authorities on the each side of the river) to confirm, revise
and/or update the information available. Some of these site are know to be mined. The
Consultants will be expected to arrange with the appropriate authorities - principally IFOR -
before visiting the sites and should arrange for IFOR escorts where [FOR thinks necessary. The
World Bank will assist in all such contacts with IFOR. The consultants will make records of
significant meetings with parties and individuals concerned. The consultants will visit all the sites
and will take photographs in sufficient number and good quality to confirm the location, the
situation and the damages occurred. Based upon this information review, site visits and
interviews, the consultants will prepare a report which will include (inter alia) for each bridge:
(i)   information on the original design and construction;
(ii)   a history and assessment of the damage;
(iii)  information on the accessibility of both sides of each bridge site (i.e the extent of
mines);
(iv)   alternative crossing arrangements which might be in place or are being considered
(pontoon bridges, ferries etc)
(v)   an assessment of the state of any reconstruction design;
(vi)  information on any contracts awarded (debris removal, pier repairs etc)



-53-
Annex IV p.15 of 20
Technical Assessment
7.    The consultants will assess the work required to complete the reconstruction of each
bridge at each bridge site. This should include:
(i)   the extent of mine clearing required;
(ii)  recommendations on debris removal;
(iii)  the need for site investigations:
(iv)  the level of design work required;
(v)   taking into account the need for economy and efficiency and speed of
reconstruction, contracting alternatives with recommendations;
8.    The consultants should also make recommendations conceming the advisability of
reconstructing each bridge in its original configuration or in a form that would be more
economical and or technically advantageous.
Cost estimates
9     The consultants prepare preliminary cost estimates for the necessary design work and
bidding documents, for the removal of debris, and for the reconstruction.
International agreements
10.   All the bridges included in this review will cross from the Republic of Croatia to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with, within Bosnia and Herzegovina, one crossing situated
in the Federation and the other nine in the Republica Srpska. Some intemational agreements need
to be reached on the reconstruction and management of the bridges.
11.   After discussions with the various authorities and based on experience elsewhere, the
consultants will make recommendations as the type of agreements which should be reached and
will provide draft model agreements. The consultants should consider staging the agreement
process such that, say, memorandums of understanding, can be agreed to allow investigation and
design work to commence. For the purpose of the review, cost sharing between Croatia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina should be considered on a 50/50 basis.

Documentation
12    The consultant will produce a register of:
- all documents attached and those available at specified institutions,
- minutes of meetings,
- details about all authorities, institutions and individuals contacted during his mission.
IV. Time Schedule and Reporting.
13    This is an urgent task. The Contract Starting Date will be one week after contract signing.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project
Program Management Adviser
Terms of Reference
1.    Objective: The objective of the Program Management Adviser's (PMA) assignment is to
provide advice and assistance to the Federation Ministry of Traffic and Communication (FMTC)
in the implementation of (a) the Transport Component of the World Bank prepared
Reconstruction Program; and (b) the World Bank/EBRD financed Transport Reconstruction
Project (the Project)'. For full details of the Project, please see the Project Technical Annex
attached.
2     Background: Prior to the war, the transport system of Bosnia and Herzegovina was
organized to meet the needs of the former Yugoslavia. Inland transport was provided by a road
system (including 8,600 km of main and regional roads) and a rail network (1,030 km, 75%
electrified) which was generally adequate in extent and condition. The primary port for what is
now a land-locked country is in Ploce, in southem Croatia (see map, p.70). Civil aviation airports
were located in Sarajevo and Mostar, and military airports in Tuzla, Bihac and Banja Luka.
3.    As with other sectors, the ability of the transport sector to function has been seriously
affected by the hostilities. Bridges have been damaged or destroyed, road pavements have been
damaged or have deteriorated due to neglect, regional and local roads used as bypasses have also
suffered with forestry roads and earth tracks pressed into service and kept open with massive
UJNPROFOR maintenance. Although the railway east and west of Banja Luka is open, the main
line between Sarajavo and Ploce (in Croatia) has been cut, is virtually not functioning, and most
rolling stock is sitting in isolated pockets and for the most part in unknown condition. Sarajevo
airport is badly damaged and is being operated by IFOR under military conditions. The port of
Ploce in Croatia functions but requires upgrading to handle Bosnia and Herzegovina traffic. Due
to severely damaged stock, only a handful of trams and buses are operating in Sarajevo and buses
in other cities.
4.    Reconstruction of the transport network is essential for the recovery of economic activity
and the unification of the country. However, investment priorities on several transport corridors
will be determined, by the rate at which the territories settle down after the peace settlement, and
to some extent, the timing of works by IFOR operations. Priorities will also be determined by
The project will be co-financed with several other donors under terms yet to be determined.



-56-
Annex IV p. 18 of 20
freedom of access to traditional transport corridors including enclaves with access under the
peace settlement.
5.    Recognizing these circumstances, a World Bank led team proposed a Reconstruction
Program (the Program)2 and, in transport, recommended that investments be concentrated first
on transport systems which are going to be needed under any scenario, and plan in a flexible way
to adapt to new situations. The Report identified the most important transport systems to include
the north-south corridor of Ploce-Sarajevo-Zenica-Tuzla and possibly further north, transport
links with Banja Luka, inter city main and regional roads, roads running east-west in the South,
and the road to Gorazde in the east, Sarajevo Airport, public transport and some street works,
particularly in Sarajevo and recommend that reconstruction priorities should be concentrated on
these systems. The report further recommended that first year projects should include those
required to overcome serious constraints, an upgrading of roads which have become important
due to territorial realignments changes, a restoration of infrastructure and services on the most
important parts of the network, and the re-establishment of maintenance activities.
7.    In January, 1996 a joint World Bank/EBRD mission assisted the governments in preparing
a Transport Reconstruction Project (the Project) comprising quick disbursing components. The
proposed project is consistent with the Program and includes investments for high priority first
year program works in the principal corridors with accompanying equipment and institution
building to support their sustainability. The project complements the expected activities of other
donors and financing agencies, notably EBRD and bilateral agencies who have indicated an
interest in (inter alia) reconstructing airport, railway and port facilities.
8.    Most institutions have suffered loss of staff and premises due to the hostilities and there is
little budgetary support for their activities. The Federal Roads directorate has been particularly
hard hit with no premises and a much reduced staff. There is therefore a need for technical
assistance to assist with the implementation of the Project including coordination of all aspects of
the Program.
Scope of Services.
General
9.    Within its organization, the FMTC has created a small Project Implementation Directorate
(PID) responsible for the preparation and implementation of components of the overall Transport
Reconstruction Program (the Program). The PMA will be located within the State Ministry of
External Trade and Communications with a Deputy PMA in the PID. There will be thus a
minimum of two persons providing project management advice and assistance (the PMA staff).

Annex IV p. 19 of 20
The PMA staff will call upon additional expert assistance as required - particularly for
procurement assistance.
10.   The PMA will be expected to provide day to day advice to their respective units together
with assisting with a planned program of project implementation. The duties of the PID are given
below together with the detailed services to be provided by the PMA staff. While the services are
specifically directed at the forthcoming Project, the duties will also apply to the Program as a
whole.
Project Implementation Directorates.
15    Within the FMTC, the PID will be responsible for the implementation of the proposed
World Bank/EBRD Transport Reconstruction Project. PID duties will include (inter alia):
(i)    procuring items and/o working with procurement agents charged with such
procurement;
(ii)   disbursement activities;
(iii)   monitoring, accounting and auditing;
(iv)   reporting;
(v)   supervision activities for donors and financing agencies, including the World Bank,
EBRD and EC;
(vi)  coordination between cities and towns receiving buses and bus related equipment;
(vii)  assisting in the transfer of construction and maintenance equipment to construction
and maintenance companies according Project agreements;
PMA staff
16.   The first task of the PMA staff will be to quickly assess the status of preparation and
implementation of the Project and identify and assist in removing constraints such that the Project
moves ahead with all speed. PMA staff will be expected to assist the PID, other MoT staff and
staff of the sub sector implementing agencies in moving ahead with project preparation and
implementation. In detail, PMA staff will:
(i)   assist the PID  with project management, supervision and trouble shooting
particular issues;
(ii)   assist with setting up and/or consolidating the PIDs office organizations and
functions (with filing systems);
(iii)  assist with the procurement of office equipment;
(iv)   assist in setting up project information, reporting and communications systems
(including e-mail) and assisting the PID with project monitoring in accordance
with donor requirements;
