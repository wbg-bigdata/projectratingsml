INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION AND A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE RERJPLIC OF THE PRILIPPINES
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Power Corporation (NPC) with the guarantee of the
Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of US $22 million and a
proposed development credit to the Republic of the Philippines for the
equivalent of US $10 million to help finance a fifth power project for the
expansion of generation and transmission facilities in Luzon. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including four years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.  The development credit would be on standard terms
and would be relent to NPC on the same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I - BANK GROWUP OPERATIONS
2.        The Fhilippines has  received 15 loans amounting to $238.8 million,
net of cancellations. Almost half of the Bank's lending, about $110.0
million, has been for priority infrastructure projects in power, transporta-
tion, water supply and education. The remainder has been divided equally
between the productive sectors:   about $65.o million in agriculture for
irrigation, agricultural credit and rice processing and about $65.0 million
in industry for three loans through the Private Development Corporation of
the Philippines (PDCP).
3.        Of total Bank lending of $238.8 million, the undisbursed balance
on January 31, 1972 was $69.9 million, almost all of which was accounted for
by the five loans made during the last three fiscal years. Disbursements for
four of the five loans have been progressing satisfactorily; disbursements
under the loan for the Second Raral Credit Project are significantly behind
schedule. Sub-loan demand under this project was adversely affected by the
change in the value of the peso in February 1970 which resulted in a sharp
increase in the cost of imported equipment. The Bank agreed in October 1971
to a number of proposals of the Central Bank for increasing disbursements;
e.g. a reduction in farmers' and rural banks' contributions and a more
diversified range of crops and items to be financed under the project. These
changes and recent increases in the price of rice, which have helped to restore
farmerst investment incentives, have led to a substantial increase in the rate
of disbursements under the Bank loan during recent months.
Bank Strategy
4.        I expect to recommend before the end of this fiscal year a loan of
$20 million for a fourth development finance companies project for PDCP and
a $7.5 million loan for a first livestock project. A second education project,



-2-
to assist the Government in its efforts to improve the quality of secondary
and higher education, should be ready for negotiation soon and is expected
to be presented to the Executive Directors either late in this fiscal year or
early in the next.  The Bank Group's future lending program will continue to
concentrate on financing public infrastructure which has been neglected in the
past because of the scarcity of public resources, but which is essential to
the future development of the economy;  highway and ports projects are currently
being prepared for possible future Bank financing. Bank assistance to agricul-
ture is also expected to increase as it is the largest sector in the economy
and the Government is mounting a major effort not only to stimulate food grain
production to eliminat,e shortages which have necessitated substantial rice
imports during the last year but also to encourage some diversification with
emphasis on livestock and feed grain production. The Bank will continue to
provide assistance for general agriculture, including rice, through loans for
irrigation and for agricultural credit through the rural banking system and,
for rice processing through the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
The Bank also expects to assist the Government's efforts to diversify agricul-
tural production and increase.the protein content of the diet of the Fhilippine
population through loans for livestock and fisheries.
5,        The inaugural meeting of the Philippine Consultatiye Group in April
1971 endorsed the need for quick disbursing aid on favorable terms and both
Japan ard-the United States have responded by announcing major increases in
their level of assistance.to the Philippines,  Given the poverty of the
Philippines, the magnitude of the, debt problem,. the overall improvement in-

PART' I- THE, ECONOMY
7.        A report entitled "Philippine.s:  Prospects- and- Pr.oblems of the
Economy"  (EAP-21,, dated March 3,1, 19,71.) was cir-culated to' the Executive
Directors' on,Apr,il 5,, 19-7,. An' ec,onomic mission. visited- the- Philippines i-n-



-3-
October-November 1971 and is preparing a report which will be completed after
the updating in the field in March. The report will then be distributed to
the Executive Directors and the participants of the Consultative Group for the
Philippines as a basis for discussion at the Group's second meeting to be held
in Tokyo in late June. Basic data on the country are given in Annex II.
8.        The Ehilippines is endowed with favorable potential for economic
growth. The country's principal economic assets are good natural resources,
a literate labor force and a dynamic and well-developed private sector. The
political system has remained democratic, and despite intermittent and widely
publicized outbreaks of violence, relatively stable. A nationwide two-party
system has existed since independence and an equal number of Presidential
elections have been won by the Liberal and Nacionalista Parties. Public
administration still remains uneven in quality, but the influx into the top
levels of public service of a highly able class of administrators has contrib-
uted to an impressive improvement in the implementation of public sector
programs during the last several years.
9.        The Philippine economy has grown at an average rate of growth of
about 6 percent during the past decade. The ratio of gross fixed capital
formation to GNP rose from an average of about 13 percent during 1960-62 to
about 20 percent during 1968-70 and the marginal saving rate was around 20
percent. However, notwithstanding the impressive growth in total investment,
there was, as noted in para 4, a relative neglect of infrastructure and
agricultural investments reflecting mainly the continued low level of public
investment. Almost 90 percent of total investment is in the private sector
and raising the share of public investment to about 15 percent of total
investment is an important objective of the Four-Year Development Plan
(FY1972-75).
10.       A serious weakness of the economy during the last decade was the
failure to make headway in strengthening the balance of payments. While
exports expanded by less than 5 percent per annum during 1960-69, imports
rose by around 8 percent annually during this period; the current account
deficits rose to well over 4 percent of GNP during 1968 and 1969. A large
part of the external borrowing to finance these deficits took the form of
suppliers' credits and short- and medium-term loans to the
Central Bank. The Philippine economy thus was confronted with a serious
foreign exchange crisis at the end of 1969 which was aggravated by a large
fiscal deficit. The stabilization program which was adopted in February 1970
consisted of a number of measures aimed at reducing excessive liquidity in
the economy and limiting the growth of short-term external debt. The program
also provided for adoption of a floating rate of exchange for the peso and
liberalization of most import restrictions. During the last two years, the
stabilization program has been implemented with determination by the Govern-
ment and has contributed significantly to restoring balance in the fiscal,
monetary and foreign exchange situation. Partly as a result of the stimulus
provided by the de facto devaluation of over 40 percent, export earnings
increased by 22 percent in 1970 and showed a further increase of 4 percent
in 1971 despite a sharp drop in the prices of copper and coconut products.'



-4-
The current account balance of payments deficits during 1970 and 1971 have
been relatively small.
11.       During the last two years, the Government has also made a concerted
effort to improve debt management and instituted control over medium- and
short-term borrowing. But the heavy burden of external debt remains a crucial
problem for the economy. Of the total medium- and long-term debt of $1.7
billion at the end of 1971, not in itself a large sum for an econorm of this
size, about two-thirds is payable within the next four years. Debt service
accounted for 28 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1971 and this ratio
is not likely to decline significantly before 1974.
12.       In the fiscal field, the large revenue deficit during FY69-70 was
replaced by a surplus of P506 million (US $79 million) during FY70-71. Tax
revenues increased by 36 percent during FY 71 in part due to the imposition of
an export tax and are likely to increase another 10 percent during the current
fiscal year. The ratio of Government revenues, including those of the social
security system and local governments, to GNP is about 13 percent, lower than
in many developing nations. The Government recognizes the need for further
improvement in mobilizing public resources and intends to submit new tax
measures to Congress during its current session this spring.
13.        In general, the stringent financial measures adopted under the stabiliza-
tion program no longer seem to be seriously restricting the level of economic
activity. The opportunities opened for industrial growth by the peso exchange
rate adjustment are becoming evident and both public and private investments
have begun to pick up. GNP in constant prices is estimated to have grown by
6 percent in 1971 which compares with 4.5 percent in 1970. The exchange rate
adjustment, however, has led to very considerable price pressures during the last
two years which were intensified during 1971 by rice shortages resulting from
typhoon damage, tungro disease and some shift of land to sugar. Price increases
are expected to level off during the coming months as the econory has now largely
adjusted to the exchange rate reform and the Government has imported substantial
quantities of rice to meet existing shortages.
14.       Per capita income in the Philippines is about $165 and incomes are
unevenly distributed. Income disparities have probably widened during the last
two years because a large part of the benefit of higher export earnings has
gone to a relatively small group of exporters of sugar, minerals and logs.
The Government has recently become increasingly aware of this problem and land
reform legislation has been enacted which limits the level of land rents and
reduces the maximum size of land holdings. Other social sector programs now
receiving increased attention which may contribute to improved living standards
of large segments of the population are rural electrification, family planning
and housing.
15.       Though the management of the foreign exchange and debt position will
continue to require skill and tight discipline in the next few years, the
prospects for sustaining an annual growth of 6 percent remain good. Merchandise
exports are expected, according to the recent Bank mission estimates, to rise



by 8.2 percent per annum during 1971-75. The current account deficit would,
however, still average about $145 million a year during 1972-75n Allowing
for amortization payments, gross external borrowing requirements would average
$470 million annually during this period. A substantial part of this deficit
would have to be financed through longer term capital on favorable terms,
if the debt structure is to be improved and imports are not to be unduly
restricted. While the external debt and payments problems facing the
Philippines are considerable they can be handled given good management
and a willingness on the part of foreign lenders to continue their support.
PART III - THE FROJECT
Power Sector
16.       The Fhilippines is not rich in energy resources.   Hydroelectric
resources are limited to only a few economic sites. Coal, oil and gas are
not found in significant quantities. Electricity supply is largely based
on the use of imported fuel, and it is likely to remain so at least for
the next decade, although nuclear power is being considered.
17.       Only about one-fifth or some 7.5 million of the population is
supplied with electricity. Of these, about 4 million are in the Manila
area, 2 million in other urban centers and 1.5 million in rural areas. The
vast majority, or about 15 out of every 16 families, in the rural areas
have no access to electricity.
18.       The power sector is dominated by two utilities - NPC and the
Manila Electric Company (Meralco), which together account for about 90% of
total generation. Meralco, serving the Manila metropolitan area, is privately
owned and has a total installed capacity of 1,200 MW, mainly thermal. NPC
is government-owned and has a total installed capacity of about 655 MW,
mainly hydro. It sells bulk power to industrial users and local utilities,
including Meralco. In addition, there are about 460 small private or
municipal utilities that distribute power received from NPC ard Meralco or
produced by their own generating facilities. The Government has in recent
years given high priority to rural electrification. The National Electrifica-
tion Administration (NEA), established in 1969, is responsible for organizing
and expanding distribution in rural areas, with priority given to providing
assistance in creating and financing rural electric cooperatives.
19.       NPC and Meralco interchange substantial amounts of power, but
there is little coordination in the planning and development of hydro and
thermal power schemes for the expansion of the Luzon grid. Coordination is
also needed for the planning and integration of small utilities and the
electric cooperatives now being sponsored by NEA to expand distribution
into new areas. To meet these needs, a Power Development Council was
established in 1970 to conduct research and advise the President of the
Philippines on future power development and the coordination of the activi-
ties of the numerous agencies participating in this sector. However, the
Council has not yet been given adequate powers, funding or staff to enable
it to provide the required coordination. The Government is aware of this
deficiency and is considering legislation to strengthen the council. During
the negotiations the Government agreed to submit to the Bank for comment



-6-
before the end of 1972 a proposal for improving the coordination of the
planning and implementation of power development.
20.       Discussions during the last meeting of the Consultative Group for
the Philippines among the Government and several foreign donors focused on
power development and the coordination of future foreign assistance efforts
in the sector. It was agreed that the Bank would finance generation and
transmission projects in Luzon, the Asian Development Bank projects for
similar purposes in Mindanao and USAID rural electrification projects. For
the expansion of the Mindanao grid, ADB made a loan of $23.4 million last
November and is considering making a loan of $19 million this spring. USAID
is considering a low interest loan of about $20 million for expansion of the
activities of new electric cooperatives.
National Power Corporation
21.       NPC was created in 1936 and was subsequently converted to a stock
corporation whose shares are wholly government owned. The authorized capital
stock of P300 million (us $46 million ) is fully issued. The Bank has made
four loans to NPC totalling $67.3 million, net of cancellations. The first
three projects (Binga, Angat and Maria Cristina) were for hydro power develop-
ment and were completed after considerable delays because of poor performance
by NPC and its contractors. The fourth project, for the construction of a
75-MW thermal plant on Bataan peninsula, has progressed satisfactorily and
is to be placed in operation in early 1972.
22.       NPC has had chronic financial trouble due to difficulty in securing
tariff rate increases and has been unable to earn the 8 percent rate of return
on investment by FY 1969 required under the Bankis fourth power loan (Loan No.
491 PH).  The rate of return was only 4.8 percent in FY69 and fell to 1.5
percent in FY70. A 42 percent tariff increase was put into effect in May 1971,
but this is expected to result in a rate of return of only 2.6 percent in FY71
rising to 4.6 percent in FY72 and 5.6 percent in FY73. To deal with this rate
difficulty, legislation amending NPC's charter was enacted in September 1971
which inter alia improved rate making procedures by exempting NPC's rate
increases from lower court injunctions which had in the past been the major
cause of delay.  The legislation also exempts NPC from all taxes, including
the income and franchise taxes, reflecting the Government's determination to
help NPC overcome its financial difficulties.
23.       In January 1972 under the improved rate making procedures of the
NPC Act, NPC filed a new rate schedule which will take full effect by July
1972. The schedule represents an increase of about 8 percent over NPC's
existing average tariff in Luzon and would raise NPC's rate of return to
slightly over 6 percent.  NPC has agreed to implement a further rate increase
to become effective early in 1973 so that NPC would achieve the overall 8
percent return required in FY74.
24.       NPC's management was hampered in the past by administrative restric-
tions and lack of adequate authority and management information. Management
consultants, employed under previous Bank loans, have recommended a reorganiza-
tion of management structure, the introduction of new internal procedures and
the improvement in NPC's accounting system.   The recommendation regarding



-7-
managerial reorganization was incorporated in the new NPC Act and NPC has
now implemented most of the other recommendations. NPC has agreed that a
follow-up review by consultants of the operations of the new accounting system,
reporting procedures and staffing arrangements would be desirable and provision
has been made in the proposed loan for this purpose.  NPC's overall adminis-
trative capability has been inproving steadily during the last several years
and with the recently implemented improvements should be able to carry out
the proposed Bank project effectively with the help of consultants, and to
operate the system upon completion of the project.
The Project
25.       The project forms part of the Government's four-year infrastructure
program (FY72-75), of which public investment in power is the second largest
(after transportation), accounting for about $200 million or 18 percent of
the total. The project consists of the construction of a thermal unit of 150
MW, three 75-MW transformers and ancillary equipment on the Bataan peninsula;
24 substations and 1,400 km of transmission lines in Luzon; and consultant
services for the final design and supervision of construction, the prepara-
tion of a long-term plan for the expansion of the Luzon grid, feasibility
studies for further hydroelectric projects in Luzon and technical assistance
to NPC.
26.       NPC's load in Luzon has been growing steadily by 21 percent annually
for the past six years. The load growth during 1972-77 is projected at 14.5
percent annually on the basis of realistic estimates. As NPC's generating
capacity is mainly hydroelectric, it needs thermal units to firm up its capacity
as well as for expansion. The 75-MW unit at Bataan financed under the last
Bank loan is NPC's first sizable thermal unit. The second thermal unit, to
be financed by the proposed loan and credit, is the most economical way to.
meet the expected load increase. There is no hydro-alternative of suitable
size. The proposed size of 150 MW is appropriate in relation to the combined
capacity of the NPC/Meralco system. This unit will increase NPC's installed
generating capacity in Luzon by about 30 percent and will enable NPC to meet
demand until 1977. Expansion in Luzon beyond 1977 will need further thermal
plants for base load and hydro plants for peaking.
27.       In line with the priority given by the Government to rural electri-
fication, NPC's expansion program includes considerable transmission extension
to supply power to regions which do not presently have access to electricity.
The proposed project will increase NPC's transmission in Luzon by about 60
percent in length and cover 80 towns and 20 large users, in addition to the
250 towns and 27 large users that NPC is now serving.
28.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $46 million, as
follows:



-8-
$ million equivalent
Local     Foreign    Total
Generation                         4.7        18.9      23.6
Transmission                      11.1        10.3      21.4
Consultants' services               .2          .8      1.0

Interest during construction                   2.0
32.0
The proposed Bank/IDA lending of $32 million would cover the entire foreign
exchange cost of the project and interest on the Bank loan during construction.
The latter is included because of NPC's difficult financial situation and the
time involved before the new facilities will start to earn revenues. The
foreign exchange costs of generation and transmission include about $100,000
for retroactive financing of expenditures for engineering services from
January 1, 1972 for the preparation of the final design and tender documents
of the project.  These costs also include, in addition to normal price
contingencies, an allowance to cover cost increases resulting from the recent
readjustment of exchange rates. Local costs are to be met from generation of
internal funds and local borrowing. The Government has undertaken to provide
additional funds should this prove to be necessary.
29.       Construction of the project including transmission subprojects would
be done by contractors. Contracts for civil works and for equipment would be
awarded after international competitive bidding. It is likely that the civil
works contracts would be won by local contractors while equipment contracts
would go to foreign suppliers since none of the equipment is manufactured
locally.  The IDA credit would be disbursed first.  Foreign exchange savings,
if arty, would result in cancellation to be applied first against the Bank
loan.
30.       Construction is expected to take about three years and to be completed
by mid-1975. It is proposed that the loan should have a term of 20 years,
including a grace period of four years which would correspond to the period of
disbursement. The proposed credit would be made to the Government on standard
terms, and relent to NPC on the same terms as the Bank loan.
31.       The internal financial rate of return of the project, after taking
into account the stream of costs and benefits to NPC for a 30 year period, is
estimated at 15 percent. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the project
would continue to earn an adequate rate of return when reasonable allowances
are made for possible increases in project costs or delays in construction.
The project will allow NPC to supply the required load until FY 1978, and
will provide new power connections to a number of areas. These new connec-
tions will result in a savings to consumers of 25-35 percent over the cost
of energy currently provided by local diesel plants. Moreover, a reliable



-9-
supply for 24 hours a day instead of the usual 6-8 hours a day supply in these
areas would encourage the use of electricity for marn purposes such as drinking
water distribution, pumped irrigation and power for workshops, cottage indus-
tries and other small businesses. These benefits have not been quantified.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and NPC, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the Bank,
the draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of the Philip-
pines and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed development credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
33.       The draft loan and credit documents contain normal provisions for
power projects.   Provisions are made for cross-default between this loan
and the previous loans and between this loan and the credit.
34.       In addition, the Republic of the Fhilippines and NPC would enter
into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, for relending
the proceeds of the credit to NPC on the same terms as those of the Bank
loan. The execution of this Agreement is a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan and credit.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
and credit.
