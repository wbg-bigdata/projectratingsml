SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers an appraisal of a Project consisting of a
thermal-electric generating unit of 150 MW capacity to be installed at the
National Power Corporation's (NPC's) power station at Bataan, extensive
additions to NPC's transmission grid on the Island of Luzon, and managerial
and technical studies by consultants. The estimated total cost of the
Project is US$46.0 million equivalent. A Bank loan to NPC of US$22.0
million equivalent is proposed, plus an IDA credit of US$10 million equiv-
alent which would be relent by the Government of the Philippines to NPC, a
Government owned enterprise, on the same terms as the Bank loan. The foreign
exchange cost of the Project and interest on the Bank loan during construc-
tion of US$2 million (about two-thirds of the total cost) would be met by
these amounts.
ii.       NPC has received four loans from the Bank aggregating US$67.3 mil-
lion. The most recent Loan 491-PH for Bataan No. 1 Thermal unit will be com-
pleted early 1972. The other projects are all in successful operation.
iii.      Demand for electricity in the Philippines is concentrated largely
around Manila, where it is increasing rapidly. National plans for develop-
ment however, place special emphasis on provincial electrification and give
a high priority to connecting as many of the population as possible. At
present only 20% of the population has a supply of electricity and even in
Luzon there are substantial numbers of people without one. The Project,
which is part of the FY 72-75 national plan, would make a substantial con-
tribution towards this national aim. The five transmission sub-projects
would expand transmission on Luzon by about 60%, and by 1976 connect about
80 towns and 20 large industrial consumers. The generating unit, the other
main item in the Project, is essential to meet the growing demand and would
increase NPC's installed capacity by about 30%.
iv.       There are two large power utilities operating on Luzon.  The Manila
Electric Company (Meralco), a privately owned enterprise, serves the greater
Manila area, generating from thermal-electric plant and supplying power direct
to consumers. NPC supplies the rest of the Island, mainly in bulk to local
distributors, from hydroelectric sources. The grids of the two utilities are
interconnected. Cooperation in planning and operating the two systems is
desirable to achieve maximum economy in the sector, and a start is being made
in this respect.



- ii -
v.        Total investment equivalent to about US$169 million is planned by
NPC in FYs 1973-76. The proposed loan and credit would constitute about
one-fifth of this total. Expenditure in Luzon and Visayas would be about
US$98 million, and in Mindanao about US$71 million on two projects where
the Asian Development Bank would lend about US$41 million.
vi.       NPC was expected to earn by FY 69 a minimum rate of 8% on net fixed
assets in operation, but as tariff action was delayed it did not achieve that
goal. The 42% tariff increase in Mlay 1971 was inadequate because the special
presidential committee which heard the case was of the opinion that tariffs
should not provide funds for future construction. The Government has since
accepted that NPC's tariffs should be high enough to provide a reasonable
proportion of the capital needed to finance development. The financing plan
envisages tariff increases which will enable about one-fifth of the capital
needed in FTs 1973-76 to be provided from internal cash generation, and to
maintain a return of not less than 8% from FY 74. A first increase in tariff
announced in January 1972 should provide a rate of return of about 6% in the
interim FY73.
vii.      The performance of NPC in the past has been weak, especially its
financial performance. However, recent developments have brought about im-
portant improvements and further Bank assistance appears warranted. A re-
vised charter for NPC was approved in September 1971 by the Congress of the
Philippines. It contains provisions which increase NPC's institutional au-
tonomy, strengthen the powers of its general manager, facilitate changes in
tariffs, and introduces other measures, including exemption of NPC from taxes.
Moreover, under the last loan the organization of NPC was studied by consult-
ants and the recommendations, except those which had to await approval of the
new charter, implemented. Assets have been revalued and a comprehensive fi-
nancial reporting system introduced. Prospects for NPC becoming viable fi-
nancially are much improved in view of the above, notwithstanding their pre-
vious weaknesses in this respect. At this juncture, the proposed loan/credit
should greatly help NMC in its efforts to establish itself as an autonomous,
efficient and viable financial organization.
viii.     The internal financial rate of return on the Project is estimated
to be 15%.
ix.       The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$22.0 million equiva-
lent over 20 years, including four years of grace plus an IDA credit of US$10
million equivalent which is proposed in view of the country's heavy burden
of short-term foreign debt.



APPRAISAL OF
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
PHILIPPINES
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a Project consisting of a 150
MW unit (No. 2) at a thermal-electric power station on the Bataan peninsula
near MIanila, development of the transmission system in five regions of Luzon,
and the services of consultants. The Project would be completed by the end
of FY 75. The Government of the Philippines has requested finance for the
foreign exchange cost of the Project, including interest during construction
on the Bank financed portion of the project. The Project's total cost is
estimated to be US$46.0 million. A Bank loan of US$22.0 million and an IDA
Credit of US$10 million are proposed.
1.02      The Borrower of the Bank loan would be the National Power Corpora-
tion (NPC), a government corporation established in 1936. The Government of
the Philippines wqould be the Borrower of the IDA Credit which it has agreed
to relend to NPC on terms similar to those for the Bank loan.
1.03      The Bank has made four loans to NPC for power projects, totalling
US$68.1 million net of cancellations (90% of NPC's foreign currency loans)
as follows:
Net Loan Amount
Year     Loan No.                  Project                      US$ Million
1957     183 PH       Binga hydro-electric                          18.4
1961     297 PH       Angat hydro-electric                          33.5
1962     325 PH       Maria Cristina hydro-electric
(No. 3 unit)                               3.3
1967     491 PH       Bataan thermal electric, No. 1 unit
and Maria Cristina hydro-electric
(No. 4 unit)                              12.0
Total                          67.3
Delays in construction have occurred in some loans, but finished projects
have been operating successfully. The Maria Cristina hydro-electric ex-
tension on Mindanao was completed in 1970 and is operating satisfactorilv,
and the Bataan No. 1 thermal unit will be commissioned in early 1972.
Bank Group lending to the Philippine power sector has also included a
commitment by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) equivalent to
USS12 million in FY 1967 to the Manila Electric Company (Meralco).

1.04      The institutional objectives of Loan 491 PH have been partly
achieved. The management consultants have completed their task, and their
recommendations, except those which had to await approval of NPC's new
charter, have been implemented. But NPC has not earned the minimum rate of
return of 8% stipulated in Loan 491 PH, owing to delayed consideration of its
tariff proposals and the inadequate increase allowed.
1.05      However, as noted in section IV, the recent enactment of a revised
NPG charter and other developments have provided NPC an adequate framework
for improving its financial and overall performance. Actual achievements
will depend on how this new framework is utilized by management and on gov-
ernment support of a sound financial policy. The assistance provided by the
proposed loan/credit will be important in helping to achieve these objectives.
1.06      This report is based on information obtained by Messrs. S. S. Scales
and E. Friedmann and from discussions with officials of the Philippine Gov-
ernment and NPC during a mission to the Philippines in June 1971.
II. THE ECONOMY
2.01      The Republic of the Philippines has a population of about 38 mil-
lion people; it consists of more than 7,000 islands with a land area of some
300,000 km2, spread over six times that area of the Pacific Ocean. The
two major islands of Luzon and Mindanao have about 70% of both land area and
population. Greater Manila and a few provincial cities are the main urban
areas; some 35% of the population is urban. The population is growino, fast,
by 3.1% a year.
2.02      During 1966-69 GNP increased satisfactorily at the rate of 6.2% a
year, but it increased only 4.5% in 1970, due to the serious financial crisis
of 1969.  The four-year development plan (1971-74) established a target of
about 5.5% for annual growth of GNP. Prices had been remarkably stable in
the past but increased by 20% in 1970, mainly as a result of devaluation of
the peso; figures for the first seven months of 1971 showed a further in-
crease by 12.5%.
2.03      While the overall investment and saving rates in the Philippines
do not compare unfavorably with many developing countries, the level of pub-
lic investment is extremely low and serious deficiencies in public infra-
structure act as a constraint on growth. When gross domestic capital forma-
tion dropped in 1970, due to a financial/economic squeeze, very substantially
below the peak year 1967, public investment suffered a serious setback. The
Philippine Government in subsequent development plans has expressed its ob-
jective to provide a more adequate infrastructure, with an imoortant role to
be given to the power sector to which about 1'3% of the infrastructure outlay
is allocated. Resource mobilization for the public sector is a matter of
continuous concern. Total revenue of national and local governments is pres-
ently around 13% of GNP and this level which is lower than in many developing



-3-
countries leaves ample scope for increase. Improvement of the tax performance
as well as other income sources, including income earned by government-owned
corporations as the result of sound tariff policies is a vital issue which
affects the ability of the Philippine Government to absorb foreign aid.
2.04      The economy has a heavy burden of relatively short-term foreign
debt. Substitution of outstanding debts by longer-term debt on more favor-
able terms, decreasing the present heavy dependence on private trade credits
and increasing foreign loans for public investment would be desirable. With
these considerations in mind it has been proposed that an IDA Credit of
TJS$10 million be made to help finance the Project.
III. THE POWER SECTOR
3.01      The power sector is complex, not as coordinated as it should be,
and uneven in performance and institutional strength.  Only one in five
Filipinos enjoys the benefits of electricity.  Reliable service exists only
in Greater Manila and a few large towns. Most of the small towns have
electricity only for six to eight hours a day for lighting needs. Rural
electrification is at an early stage of development.
3.02      The Government's policy of electrification, which aims at providing
a supply of electricity to all the population, is guided by a sound strategy.
Generation and transmission in the public sector are to be developed by NPC.
Distribution in rural areas and small towns will be developed mainly through
cooperative and municipal supplies. Private and municipal utilities will con-
tinue to supply the urban areas, including Manila. As NPC's transmission
grids are built or extended, cooperatives and municipal utilities will take
power from them and electricity services will be extended to areas without
any supply. Some of the larger utilities will continue to generate from their
own plant as well. Thus. evolution towards an integrated sector is envisaged,
in which the many small utilities will continue to play a part, perhaps after
some consolidation, mainly as distributors. Given the geography of the Phil-
ippines, the uneven nature of development of different areas, and the large
investment required to provide a satisfactory power supply to most inhabitants,
the sector development strategy is an appropriate one. However, the mechanics
for its implementation needs considerable improvement as noted hereafter.
Energy Resources
3.03      The country is not rich in energy resources.  Known coal deposits
are of little commercial value. The hydro-electric potential is estimated
at 3,600 NW, and 16% of it, utilizing the best sites, has already been
developed in Luzon and M.indanao. Explorations for oil and gas are in pro-
gress in the Cebu and Palawan areas, but have not yet been successful. The
main source of energy will continue to be imported oil. Its high cost and
the uncertainties of future supply led the Government to consider nuclear
power as an alternative. But it is not likely that this source of power



will be utilized before 1980 when the Luzon grid will have grown sufficiently
to accommodate 500 MW units, the minimum size that presently makes nuclear
power competitive with fossil-fueled power. Geothermal energy has also
attracted Government interest recently, and a contract for initial explora-
tion at Tiwi in Southern Luzon is being negotiated.
Power SuppyY
3.04      Power is generated mainly by two utilities -- the Manila Electric
Company (Meralco), a private company serving the Manila area, and the Na-
tional Power Corporation (NPC), a government-aoned public utility.  Between
them, they generate about 90% of all the energy supplied. Meralco distrib-
utes most of its energy directly in Greater Manila in a franchise area of
800 km2 with a population of about 4 million and a heavy concentration
of business and industry. NPC operates on the basis of bulk sales to some
300 utilities and large industrial customers spread over many provinces in
Luzon, in small areas of Mindanao, and in the Visayas Islands. The table
below gives a general picture of the Philippine power industry in 1969.

3.05      Electricity is distributed to the consumers by some 456 private and
municipal utility systems.  They range in size from Meralco's large system,
to six companies with capacities below 35 MW and several hundred small,
family-owned and poorly operated systems with capacities below 50 klW.
3.06      Meralco is by far the largest utility in the sector and generates
over 60' of the sector's output of energy, almnost entirely fron thermal plant.
This privatelv-owned company is managed and operated very efficiently and is
financially sound, although devaluation of the peso in 1970 seriously dis-
located its cash flow projections and led to tariff increases. In the past,



- 5 -
Meralco has been able to sell bonds abroad to finance its development, but
this is now difficult with the foreign exchange problems facing the Philippine
economy.
3.07      NPC, owned and controlled by the Government, is primarily engaged
in developing the country's hydroelectric resources and in the bulk supply
of power to other utilities and major industrial users. Its installations
are listed in Annex 1. NPC operates two important power grids -- Luzon grid
on Luzon Island and Agus grid on Mindanao Island -- plus seven small systems
(three in Luzon, two in the Visayas and two in Mindanao). Load in NPC's
Luzon grid has been growing by about 21% annually (Annex 2) over the past
six years, compared with a national average of 13%, 7% for isolated utilities
and 11% for Meralco. In Mindanao, the development of industry near Maria
Cristina has been the main reason for growth in NPC's loads.
3.08      There are 121 municipal and 335 private utilities with an average
capacitv of less than 500 KW. About half of them are isolated and, with few
exceptions, they provide substandard and costly 6-8 hour per day service;
the others distribute energy that they buy from NPC and Meralco. Of these
456 small utilities, 184 are associated in an organization called the
Philippine Electric Plant Owners Association (PEPOA) that aims at representing
their interests vis-a-vis the Government's or NPC's tariff increases.  Until.
now, PEPOA has done little to improve the technical standards of its members
or to help them reduce costs. To assist in these matters, the Utilities
Development and Finance Corporation was formed recently by PEPOA and three
banks.
3.09      Tariffs charged by the small utilities range from YO.15 to tO.50
(US$0.023 to US$0.077) per kWh sold, the tariffs in the lower part of the
range being charged by those utilities that receive their power from NPC or
Meralco, and the higher tariffs by the small and isolated systems. NPC
charges, on average, about VO.059 (US$0.009) per kWh on Luzon and rO.027
(US$0.004) on Mindanao, but these are wholesale rates; Meralco's charges,
which are retail, are about rO.08 (US$0.012) per kWh on average.
National Electrification Administration (NEA)
3.10      In 1969 the Government created The National Electrification Adminis-
tration (NEA) to accelerate electrification of the entire country. Just as
NPC is the agency in charge of bulk generation and transmission, NEA has the
task of organizing and expanding distribution. It has given first priority
to a nationwide program for creating rural cooperatives; each cooperative
would provide services to areas with populations of about 70-150 thousand
people.  Two Dilot projects of this type have been started with the help of
U.S. rural electrification experts. In the next five years NEA plans to
establish at least one cooperative in each of the 66 provinces of the country,
which would extend electric supply to about five million people.  Many of
these projects will be supplied by NPC's transmission systems, while others
in more isolated regions will need their own generating plant, at least
initially. US AID is expected to finance about one-half of the estimated
cost of $100 million of this program.



-6-
Public Service Commission
3.11      The Government exercises control over utilities in the power sector
through the Public Service Commission (PSC), which regulates franchises and
tariffs and has to approve plans for new installations. NPC is in a special
position. as explained in paragraph 4.03.
Future Developments
3.12      Total installed capacity in Luzon is expected to increase by
69% from 1,630 MW (83% of the national total) to 2,755 MW between mid-1971
and mid-1977 (see Graph 1). Expansion of generation plant is planned as
follows:
Capacitv                       Commissioning
Plant                         14            Owner               Date
1.  Bataan No. 1                    75             NPC                1972
2.  Snyder No. 2                   300           Meralco              1972
3.  Montelibano No. 1              300           Meralco              1974
4.  Bataan No. 2                   150             NPC                1975
5.  Montelibano No. 2              300           Meralco              1976
NPC and Meralco operate independently and each utility is installing capacity
sufficient to meet the demand on its own grid. However, the two grids are
interconnected, and there is seasonal exchange of energy between the two
systems (para. 6.02). There would be technical and economic advantages if
expansion of the two systems could be planned with closer cooperation.
Ul1timately, agreement for joint development, with shared investment, might
be envisaged. The political situation in the Philippines however precludes
very rapid progress along these lines. Another reason is that Meralco is
reluctant to rely on NPC undertakings, given NPC's dependence on Government.
In February 1971, a joint working committee was set up by the two utilities
as an initial but important step to coordinate development.
3.13      Expansion in Luzon for the period beyond 1977 will require further
thermal installations for base load and hydro installation for peaking.
Feasibility studies for the Upper Pamnpanga hydro-electric plant (100 14W) are
already available. Studies for the Caliraya pumped storage scheme and the
Chico River hydro-electric plants (450 NW4 approximately) are to be financed
by the proposed loan and credit. NPC has agreed to appoint engineering
consultants satisfactorv to the Bank, to carry out these studies.
3.14      NPC is planning to double its generating capacity on Mindanao
from 150 MW at present by adding a 5th unit of 50 MW to Maria Cristina by
1974 and the 120 MW Agus II hydroelectric plant by 1976. It also plans
construction of about 1,300 km of transmission lines to cover the island.



No plans have been made for expansion in other areas, but a feasibility
study for power development in the Visayas is to be undertaken. The for-
eign exchange cost of expansion in Mindanao is to be provided by loans
from the Asian Development Bank. A first loan of US$23.4 million equiva-
lent was made in October 1971. A second loan for about US$18 million is
presently being considered.
3.15      In 1972-76 foreign loans for power development of over US$130 mil-
lion are expected-US$50 million from the Bank and IDA for NPC's Luzon expan-
sions, US$40 million from ADB for NPC's Mindanao expansions, and US$40 million
from US AID for NEA's cooperatives-on reasonable terms and conditions. On
the other hand, the private utilities, mainly Meralco, can only obtain fi-
nancing at interest rates and maturities (10-12 years at 10% annual interest)
which would add to the national burden of relatively short-term foreign debt.
The Government is reluctant to approve such short-term foreign debt in view
of the country's heavy foreign debt service burden. The small private utili-
ties have had practically no access to foreign credits; the Utilities Develop-
ment and Finance Corporation is trying to resolve this problem and has obtained
a US$5 million credit line from the Export-Import Bank of the U.S.
National Planning and Coordination
3.16      The coordinated growth of power supply in the Philippines is com-
plicated geographically by the isolation of the many islands, and administra-
tively by the difficulties of trying to integrate publicly-owned and privately-
owned utilities. In the rural areas, conflicts are bound to arise between
the private companies that serve small towns but not the adjacent rural com-
munities, and the government-sponsored cooperatives that soon will be im-
pinging on their franchise areas.
3.17      The lack of an effective national planning body which can guide
coordination is a serious problem. It seems logical to rely on Meralco for
the continued supply of its franchise area and to direct NPC to the urgent
task of supplying power to the provinces. However, the growth of NPC and
Meralco in Luzon calls for the integrated development and operation of hydro,
thermal, pumped-storage and possibly nuclear plants in the not too distant
future, and suitable coordination will be important.
3.18      In the past, most of NPC's energy has been delivered in and around
Manila in Luzon, and in a very limited area of Mindanao. However, the Project
includes extensive regional transmission. National planning for distribution
is also required; many of the inefficient private and municipal utilities
should be merged into larger ones which, according to circumstances, could be
private, cooperative or municipal.
3.19      The need for systematic and coordinated development of the power
sector was recognized by the Philippine Government when it formed the Power
Development Council in 1970. This body which reports to the office of the
President is intended to carry out research and to advise on these overall



matters, but has no power to enforce changes. Its organisation and staff-
ing were determined only in 1971, and Congress has been asked to make an
appropriation in the budget to finance it. The Government has agreed to
consider means of achieving effective coordination of planning of power
development and the implementation thereof among power suppliers and seek
Bank comment thereon.
IV. THE BORROWER
4.01      The National Power Corporation (NPC), the borrower, was created
by Commonwealth Act No. 120 of 1936 to control all water rights in the
Philippines and to develop and generate hydroelectric power. Later, NPC
was authorized to generate power from other sources. Subsequent amend-
ments to the Act converted NPC into a stock corporation whose shares are
wholly government-owned. The authorized capital stock of W30O million
(US$46 million) is fully issued.
4.02      NPC's corporate powers are vested in the National Power Board
(the Board), which has seven members, including the General Manager, who
is ex-officio Vice-Chairman. The Chairman and the other five members are
appointed by the President of the Philippines, with the consent of the
Commission on Appointments of the Congress.
NPC's Revised Charter
4.03      NPC's new Charter was approved by the Government of the Philippines
in September, 1971. This charter had become necessary for a number of reasons
explained below, but most particularly because of the legal difficulties in-
volved in the implementation of tariff increases. In effect, though NPC's
tariff had been exempted from the control of the Public Service Commission
(PSC) which exercises control over all other power utilities, the effect of
this exemption had been paradoxically to make NPC tariff increases subject
to lower courts decisions when they were appealed to the courts. The courts
effectively delayed the implementation of the increases for years by issuing
injunctions blocking collections pending hearing of the appeals. The new
charter allows NPC to fix its own tariffs and gives the PSC and the Supreme
Court sole jurisdiction in case of appeals. During the hearing of any appeals,
NPC's tariff increases cannot be deferred.
4.04      The main new provisions of the revised charter are given in Annex
3. Its practical impact will be to give NPC sufficient autonomy to function
efficiently. The following are the main changes:
(a) The powers of the Board (i.e. to make policy and to advise)
and of the general manager (i.e. to execute and administer)
have been clarified, which should nov obviate conflict be-
tween members of the Board and management.
(b) NPC has been given full authority to award contracts for
construction and repair work.



- 9 -
(c)  NPC is empowered to set tariffs provided a maximum rate of
return of 10% is not exceeded.
(d) PSC now has jurisdiction (in place of the lower court) to
settle, within 90 days, appeals against new tariffs set by
NPC. Implementation of the new tariff cannot be deferred.
Final appeal is to the Supreme Court.
(e) NPC is now exempted from all taxes, duties or fees. This
exemption reduces the size of the tariff increase which
would otherwise be necessary to yield a required minimum
rate of return.
(f) Each region is to be represented on the Board, and have its
own manager and tariffs. These measures are evidence of the
Government's strong wish to accelerate electrification by NPC
in the less-developed areas of the country.
Organization and Management
4.05      NPC's management was hampered in the past by administrative
restrictions and lack of authority and information. Revision of the
charter and overhaul of the accounting function (as described below)
have now created a framework within which effective management can be
practised.
4.06      In connection with Loan 491-PH Gilbert Associates Inc. (U.S.A.) were
engaged as consultants to organize NPC's management on a sound basis. Their
task involved the reorganization of managerial duties; the introduction of
new systems and procedures and on-the-job training of personnel working with
them; revaluation of NPC's fixed assets on a current-value basis; revaluation
of accumulated depreciation and depreciation schedules. NPC has adopted
the revaluation as explained in paragraph 7.02.
4.07      The information which management requires periodically has also
been identified and financial statements are now available between the
10th and 15th of the next month. Annex 4 lists the various reports pre-
pared regularly since July 1971. In view of NPC's improved financial
reporting, it should be able to transmit copies of the audited balance
sheets, income statements and other related financial statements to the
Bank within three months of the end of the fiscal vear. NPC has agreed to
this arrangement.
4.08      The management consultants' recommendations have been substantially
implemented. A follow-up review by the consultants of the operations of the
accounting systems and procedures, reporting procedures and staffing would now
be highly desirable. NPC agreed to this review during negotiations.



- 10 -
Technical Operations - Engineering Consultants
4.09      NPC's system planning, equipment maintenance and load dispatching
need to be improved, especially in view of the large expansion and growing
complexity of its operations. TPC has agreed to appoint engineering con-
sultants acceptable to the Bank to study improvement of its technical opera-
tions and to prepare long-term plans for NPC's Luzon system.
Audit
4.10      The Auditor General of the Philippines is legally ex-officio
auditor of NPC. He is empowered to appoint a representative known as Auditor
of the Corporation who has normally audited NPC's accounts. This arrangement
was acceptable to the Bank in past loans and remains so, provided that, if
the Bank is not satisfied with the audit or is of the opinion that the Auditor
of the Corporation is not sufficiently experienced and independent to perform
the audit effectively, then NPC will agree to appoint an additional auditor
to undertake the audit. NPC has agreed to do this upon request by the Bank.
4.11      Following the recommendations of the management consultants, NPC
has recently created an internal audit staff directly responsible to the
General Manager to assist management inter alia by reviewing the adequacy
of accounting, financial and operational controls, to ensure compliance
with policies and regulations, and ensure that proper accountability
exists; the work of the internal audit unit will also be reviewed by the
Auditor of the Corporation.
Staff
4.12      The number of staff on May 31, 1971 was about 2,300, about 300
more than NPC required as determined by a detailed analvsis made by the
Consultants. The surplus is to be reduced by attrition. Over 100 posts
have already been cancelled since a preliminary evaluation of staff was made
in 1968. The management consultants have worked out for NPC a procedure for
evaluating staff and jobs, to help in assigning staff to posts for which they
are properly qualified and trained.
V. THE PROJECT
Background
5.01      At present, practically all NPC's generating plant on the Island
of Luzon is hydro-electric. As the system grows, it will become necessary
to firm up the energy supply with thermal-electric plant, relying on thermal
plant as well for subsequent expansion, perhaps with some help from further



- 1 1 -
hydro-electric development in meeting peak loads. The 75 MW unit to be com-
missioned December '71 and financed by Loan 491 PH will be NPC's first ther-
mal unit. The 150 MW unit proposed for financing would be the second.
5.02      While provincial electrification in Luzon has been characterized
in the past by many delays, its further development is given Government pri-
ority. The Project will increase NPC's generating capacity on Luzon by
about 30%, but transmission including low voltage lines for rural electri-
fication will be increased by about 60%.
Description of the Project
5.03      The Project would consist of:
Generation
1.   Bataan No. 2 unit (150 MW) including a boiler; turbine:
and a hydrogen-cooled generator and extension of the Power
House. The boiler would burn low-cost high-viscosity fuel
oil, piped from a refinery two kilometers away.
2.   Three 75 MVA transformers and extension of the switchyard.
The control room, cooling water system, workshops and travelling crane built
at the power station to serve No. 1 unit would also serve No. 2 unit. A 230
kV transmission line connecting the power station with the grid has also been
built.
Transmission
The works proposed would consist of five regional sub-projects:
Central Luzon, Laguna-Batangas, Ilocos, Zambales and Southern Luzon,
involving construction of 24 substations with an aggregate of 340 MVA,
and over 1400 km of transmission lines are shown in Annex 5 and maps.
Advisorv Services
1.   A follow-up review by the management consultants of account-
ing systems and procedures, reporting systems and staffing
(para. 4.08) and a review of the current value of fixed assets
(para. 7.02).
2.   Engineering consultants to improve technical operations and
to prepare long-term plans for Luzon (para. 4.09).
3.   Feasibility studies of possible hydroelectric schemes on the
Chico River in Northern Luzon of about 450 MW capacity and
1,600 GWh output, for peaking duty, and of the pumped storage
scheme at Caliraya (300 MW initial canacitv) (para. 3.13).

financed by IBRD and IDA        -     208.0      -        -      32.0
5.05      The estimates for the generating plant were made by Electroconsult
of Milan who have been retained by NPC as consulting engineers for both the
Nos. 1 and 2 units. The estimates were based on recent international bidding
for similar plant, and on the local costs for No. 1 unit. Estimates for the
transmission sub-projects were made by NPC's staff on the basis of experience
with similar work. They have been adjusted for current exchange rates. There
are no physical uncertainties in the Project, so physical contingencies are
small (3% and 2% respectively for local and foreign costs). Construction
will be completed in three years (by June 1975), so price contingencies of
11% for local and 7% for foreign costs should prove adequate.



- 13 -
Amounts of Proposed Loan and Credit
5.06      The loan and credit would cover the full foreign exchange cost of
US$30.0 million and the interest on the Bank Loan during construction, of
US$2.0 million. The total amount required is US$32.0 million, for which a
Bank loan of US$22.0 million and an IDA credit of US$10 million are proposed.
Engineering
5.07      Electroconsult, the consulting engineer for the Bataan No. 2 unit
(para. 5.05) is satisfactory to the Bank.  It has been agreed with NPC that
a consultant is required to review the preliminary design of the transmission
sub-projects, and help NPC's staff in the preparation of specifications, bid
documents, bid analysis, final design, and supervision of erection. NPC
has agreed that consulting engineers, satisfactory to the Bank will continue
to be retained for the design and supervision of the Project.
Procurement
5.08      All contracts for civil engineering and plant and equipment will
be awarded after international competitive bidding according to the Bank's
guidelines. NPC has agreed, in principle, to contract most of the transmis-
sion sub-projects on a "'supply and erect" basis, to ensure coordinated
scheduling of completions and expenditure.
Disbursement
5.09      Disbursements will be made against the full foreign exchange costs
of the equipment and services provided. No disbursements would be made for
goods bought prior to approval of the loan, but expenditure for consultants'
services may need to be covered retroactively to January 1. 1972, in-
volving a sum of up toA$t00,000. Estimated disbursements, by quarters, are
given in Annex 7. As indicated, the IDA funds will be disbursed first.
Any surplus remaining on completion of Project would be cancelled, unless
there are good reasons for applying savings to related works such as addi-
tional transmission sub-projects.
Ecological Aspects
5.10      No ecological problems are expected to arise from the No. 2 gener-
ating unit at Bataan. Cooling water is discharged 600 meters offshore at
the far end of Manila Bay, 50 km from Manila. The height of the chimney
will ensure adequate dispersal of the flue gases and wil' meet the require-
ments of the Water and Air Pollution Control Commission of the Philippine
Government. These problems have been thoroughly examined by the consul-
tants and a summary of their appreciation is given in Annex 8.

VI. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
6.01      The Project forms part of the Government's four-year development
plan for Luzon. The plan gives the power sector the second highest priority
(after transport), because of the social, political and economic importance
attached by the Government to bringing electricity to as many inhabitants as
possible, a process assisted by connecting as many of the provincial popula-
tion to the national system of electricitv supply as soon as feasible. NPC's
current objective is to extend systematically its transmission system to load
centers presently served by isolated diesel plants in order to provide cheaper
and better quality service to all of Luzon, an area, exclusive of Greater
Manila, of about 100,000 sq. km. with a population of about 13 million. NPC's
load has been growing steadily by about 21% annually in the last five-six
years as a result of pursuing this policy.
Load Forecasts
6.02      The attached graphs 1A and 1B show peak-loads and energy demands
from 1971 forecasts through 1978 and the corresponding installed capacity
and half-yearly generation of energy (i.e., in wet and dry seasons respec-
tively) for the whole of Luzon's interconnected system, that is the grid
served by both NPC and Meralco which is operated with seasonal interchanges
of energy between the two utilities. The forecast has been made on the
basis of the comprehensive market studies carried out in 1964-65 by Gilbert
Associates Inc. and by the Power Industry Survey Team; 1/ these studies
have been continuously updated by NPC and Meralco. The forecasts have proved
to be accurate. The program of new generating plant provides about 15% re-
serve capacity, which is reasonable.
6.03      NPC's forecast for its own grid (i.e., the provincial grid on Luzon)
is based on detailed consideration of present loads and of the new ones that
are expected to be connected to the system, as well as on the realistic esti-
mates of economic and industrial growth assumed in the Government's develop-
ment plan. The forecast assumes that growth of NPC's load will decrease to
an average of 14.5% annually during FY71-78. 14PC's peak loads and installed
capacities, half-yearly energy demands and energy available, projected through
1971-77 are shown in Annexes 2A and 2B and Graphs 2A and 2B. By FY 1974 there
would be a small energy deficit. The completion of the No. 2 unit at Bataan by
FY 1975 is therefore essential.

composed of 13 U.S. specialists on all aspects of Public Utility Power
Industry who prepared a report under contract to USAID.

Least Cost Solution - Economic and Social Benefits
6.04      An additional thermal unit at Bataan is NPC's most economic method
of meeting the increased load expected on its system. There is no hydro-
electric alternative of suitable size. The 150 M unit size adopted is
acceptable in relation to the combined capacity of the NPC-Meralco system.
6.05      The transmission sub-projects in Southern Luzon are based on stu-
dies made by Electricite de France in 1965, which have been brought up-to-
date by NPC. They are the most economic proposals on the basis of present-
value comparisons of the various transmission voltages which were consider-
ed as possible alternatives.
6.06      The Project will allow NPC to supply the load until FY 78.  New
connections made possible by the Project would include 80 towns and 20
large industrial consumers (compared with 250 towns and 27 large consumers
now served). The economic value of these new connections includes other
factors as well as the difference in cost (usually a reduction of 25% to
35% to the consumers) between NPC's energy and that of the present diesel
plants. A reliable supply for 24 hours a day instead of the usual 6-8
hours supply for lighting only would encourage the use of electricity
for many purposes such as drinking water distribution, pumped irrigation
and power for workshops, cottage industries and other small businesses.
Unfortunately no reliable data or methodology is yet available to measure
these benefits which are nevertheless quite important and evident.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
6.07      A calculation of the internal financial rate of return on the
Project was carried out considering streams of cost and benefits for a pe-
riod of 30 years (Annex 9). The Project is considered to be a well ba-
lanced expansion of both generation and transmission capacity. Therefore,
benefits have been measured by the income from the additional energy ge-
nerated by the Bataan Unit No. 2 when sold at customers' substations.
Costs cover total investment, fuel, operation and maintenance, but exclude
depreciation, taxes and customs duties. The internal financial rate of re-
turn with the proposed increases in tariffs discussed in Chapter 7, would
be about 15%. Sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in costs of con-
struction of 15% and a delay of 25% in completion of the Project would re-
duce the rate of return to about 12%.
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
7.01      As noted in para- 1.04 and 1.05, NPC has been hampered for several
years by poor earnings, inadequate capital, poor financial and operating in-
formation, and inadequate authority. Earnings improved following a 42% tariff

increase in May 1971 but are still inadequate. The provisions of the revised
NPC chapter enacted in September 1971 (para. 4.04) should enable NPC to put
its financial operations on a sound utility basis. The rate and other cove-
nants agreed to during loan negotiations as described hereafter should helD
to ensure achievement of this objective.
Past Record and Present Position
7.02      NPC's assets were revalued as at December 31, 1967 but the new
values were not entered into NPC's books until FY 70. The management con-
sultants, Gilbert Associates, Inc., who appraised the assets recommended an
interim updating procedure by trending based upon a combination of the whole-
sale price index of imported manufactured goods in Manila (as prepared by the
Central Bank of the Philippines), and a construction labor cost index devel-
oped by the consultants. This interim procedure was recommended only for
rate making purposes. It was further recommended that a periodic review of
the current value of fixed assets be made every two or three years by an in-
dependent consultant. As the peso was devalued in February 1970 from 14 to
the U.S. dollar to a floating rate, presently about P6.50 to the dollar, a
further revaluation of assets became necessary. An appropriate increase in
value has therefore been estimated by NPC and incorporated into the net plant
in service as at June 30, 1971 for rate making purposes, shown in Annex 10.
NPC has agreed to appoint independent consultants to revalue the net fixed
assets as at June 30, 1972 and thereafter every four years or more freauently
if required.
7.03      Summarized income statements for FY 67 through FY 71 are shown in
Annex 11. (Annexes 12 & 13 show Luzon and Mindanao separatelv). The rates
of return during the three years to FY 69 are overstated because the histor-
ical value of assets was used (a) for the calculation of annual depreciation
(which increased the numerator) and (b) as the rate base (which understated
the denominator).  The low FY 69 return of 4.8% reflects the commissioning
of the Maria Cristina No. 3 Unit (50 MW) Loan 325 PH and the Angat 100 MW
Project (Loan 297 PH) in FY 68 and the drought during FY 69.
7.04      The rate of return for FY 70 was 3.0% and an earnings deficit
resulted after charging interest. Poor earnings continued throughout FY 71,
until the 42% increase in tariffs became effective during the last two
months of the fiscal year. A return of only 2.6% was earned for the year
and the Government had to advance funds under the terms of the Guarantee
Agreement (Loan 491-PH) to enable NPC to pay the interest and repayments of
principal on the Bank loans.
7.05      Condensed balance sheets for FYs 67-71 are showqn in Annex 10.  NPC's
capitalization at June 30, 1971 is summarized below. Long-term debt on that
date was t368 million if foreign exchange loans are calculated at the ex-
change rates in force at the times they were withdrawn. Using the devalued
rate of F6.5 to the dollar, long-term debt becomes f565.6 million.  Annex
10 includes an adjusted balance sheet for 1971.

7.06      About half of the equity is capital stock of f300 million, made up
of p85 million subscribed by Government, r175 million converted from bonded
debt, and P40 million from earned surplus. The ?175 million converted from
NPC bonds is the gross value without adjustment for the sinking funds of
about ?20 million which NPC had accumulated for their repayment. When the
capital structure was changed the net debt, and not the gross debt, should
have been transferred. The Government has agreed to repay F20 millions from
the sinking funds to NPC or make such other adjustment satisfactory to the
Bank.
7.07      The local-currency debt is mainly from Government financial insti-
tutions. The NPC bonds are repayable over 30 years and carry annual interest
at rates varying between 4% and 7%. Sinking funds administered by the Cen-
tral Bank have been created to repay them. The revised charter provides for
a maturity of ten years or more for future bond issues.
7.08      Customers' accounts outstanding at the end of FY 71 amounted to
nearly t39 million, or about eight months' billings on the increased tariffs.
NPC has already introduced revised billing and collection procedures and, at
the time tariffs were increased in May 1971, also introduced new conditions
of supply which involve a discount for prompt payment, disconnection of
supply for non-payment of bills, a charge for interest at 1% per month on
amounts unpaid, and a reconnection fee after disconnection for non-payment.
NPC has agreed to take all necessary steps to reduce the balance of the
unpaid accounts as of June 30, 1973 and thereafter to an amount not more

than three months' billings.
Financing Plan
7.09      Annex 4 presents sources and applications of funds for FY 72
through FY 77. Annexes 15 and 16 show separately information relating to
rnPC's operations in Luzon and Mindanao. These Annexes are based on sales
forecasts and on the income statements for FY 71-77. Tariff increases
amounting to 28% have been assumed to meet the minimum overall return of
8% in FY 74. The forecasts produce the following financing plan:

/2   Includes interest capitalized.
7.10      NPC's Capital expenditure during the four years FY 73-76, would
amount to US$169 million, of which about 60% would be spent in Luzon and
about 40% in Mindanao.  Internal funds would finance 22%, and 78% would
be borrowed (57% foreign and 21% local capital). NPC has previously raised
local capital by the sale of bonds for relatively small amounts and these
efforts would not have been successful without G^overnment help in marketing
(i.e., purchase of bonds by Government agencies). The much larger domestic
financing now needed over the four-year period (USS35 million eouivalent)
would not be obtained unless Government provides most of it. The Government
has agreed to ensure that these funds shall be made available to NPC on terms
satisfactory to the Bank. On this basis, the financing plan is acceptable.
Financial Forecasts
7.11      Loan 491-PH requires that NPC's tariffs should earn a minimum
annual rate of return of 8% of its average net revalued fixed assets in
oneration. While 8% was not expected until FY 69, it was not earned even



- 19 -
then because NPC's tariff applications were delayed several years bv court
injunction pending the hearing of appeals against the rate increase. Finally,
a 42% rate increase was implemented in May 71 following intensive efforts of
NPC and Government officials in this connection. However, this increase is
inadequate to earn 8% in the future. An 80% rate increase had been called
for but the application was heard in public by a presidential ad hoc commit-
tee, whose view was that tariffs should not provide funds to finance future
construction, but should only be sufficient to meet annual operating expenses
and debt service. It therefore agreed only to the 42% increase. Nevertheless
subsequent to this increase, the Government has agreed that tariffs should
provide funds to finance future construction, and that NPC's tariffs should
be raised over the next two years to achieve the rate of return required.
7.12      The first of these, an increase of f0.005 kWh (about 8%) on Luzon
consumers was promulgated in January 1972 and will become effective on the
expiry of the notice periods which vary from one to six months. This tariff
increase should raise NPC's overall rate of return for FY 73 to not less than
6% on its average net fixed assets in service.  The Government and NPC have
agreed to further adjust tariffs to provide revenues sufficient to produce
and maintain an annual rate of return of not less than 8% in FY 74 and there-
after. The financial forecasts (Annexes 10-17) were prepared on this basis.
7.13      NPC's tariffs are based on bulk supply at wholesale rates.  The
tariff increases envisaged (para. 7.12) would be recovered by the small
utilities bv an increase of less than 10% at the retail tariff level.
7.14      NPC's tariff structure includes both a monthly demand charge and an
energy charge. NPC has engaged a consultant to advise on modification of the
present tariff structure and interchange pricing with Meralco.
7.15      NPC has recently introduced a fuel cost adjustment clause as a
condition of supply, which enables it to pass on to its consumers any
increase in fuel cost above a base price of f1.10 per million BTUs. The
fuel cost included in the projected operating expenses in Annexes 11 and 12
is the base price, so revenue projections do not require any upward adjust-
ment of tariff to reflect any variation of fuel cost. Present price of fuel
has already risen to $2.60 per million BTU, therefore when Bataan No. 1 Unit
begins operation the tariffs for Luzon will be increased initially by f0.004
per kWh (approx. 6%).
7.16      NPC's charter does not permit payment of any dividends.  All funds
generated after meeting operating expenses will therefore be applied towards
meeting debt service, maintaining adequate working capital and financing
canital expenditure.
7.17      Condensed balance sheets as of June 30, 1971 through 1977 in
Annex 10 show that NPC's gross plant would increase over that period by
p1.4 billion, or by 86%, to a total of p2.3 billion (US$354 million equiv-
alent). Plant in Luzon would increase by f650 million, or by 56%, and that
in Mindanao would increase by f450 million, or nearly fourfold.



- 20 -
7.18      The ratio of current assets to current liabilities falls from 2.8
times in FY 70 to 1.8 times in FY 71, because of a reduction which NPC has
achieved in its working capital, mainly by reducing materials and supplies
by nearly t11 million (US$1.7 million equivalent). A further reduction is
expected as the collection of customers accounts improves (para. 7.08).
7.19      The debt equity ratio was 49/51 in FY 71.  It would increase to
59/41 by FY 75 reflecting the increased borrowing to meet the construction
program. (Annex 10).
7.20      Interest chargeable to revenue would be covered 1.4 times by net
operating income in 1972, and 2.5 times after the Project has been commis-
sioned. Debt service would be covered 1.3 times by cash generation in 1972
and by 1.5 times or more each year through FY 77.
7.21      With the tariff adjustments described, (para. 7.12), internal cash
generation would increase from p78 million in FY 72 to f198 million in FY 77.
Net of debt service, internally generated funds would finance 22% of the
capital expenditure during FY 73-76. These ratios and percentages are
acceptable.
7.22      NPC has agreed that the existing debt limitation covenant that
revenues should cover 1.3 times the maximum debt service requirement of
any succeeding fiscal year on all debt including anv debt to be incurred,
should be repeated for the proposed loan. The purpose of this limitation
is to maintain some control over incurrence of debt by NPC without being
undulv restrictive. When further tariff increases (para. 7.12) have been
made, to produce the minimum 8% rate of return required, NPC should be
able to meet this requirement.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations in January 1972 agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
(a)  engineering and management consultants will be employed upon
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 3.13, 4.08,
4.09 and 5.07)
(b)  the Government will prepare proposals regarding the effective
coordination of power development among all the power suppliers
(para. 3.19)
(c)  a revaluation of the borrower's net fixed assets in service will
he made as at June 30, 1972 and thereafter every four years or
more frequently, if required (para. 7.02)



- 21 -
(d) a sum of f20 million in respect of the sinking funds accumulated
on the borrowers' bonded indebtedness converted into capital
stock will be paid by the Government to the Borrower, or other
adjustments made satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.06)
(e) the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that
funds required by the Borrower to finance local currencv costs
during fiscal years '73 to '76 shall be made available on terms
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.10)
(f) tariffs will be set to achieve a rate of return on average net
assets in service of not less than 8% in FY 74 and thereafter
(para. 7.12)~
(g) debt will not be incurred without prior Bank approval unless
the borrowers' net revenues cover by 1.3 times the debt service,
including the debt to be incurred, in the future year of maximum
debt service (para. 7.22)
8.02      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$22.0 million for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of four
years, and an IDA Credit of US$10 million.

ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS-/
The following sources of pollution were exanined:
(1) Thermal pollution fromi cooling water.
(2) Other pollutan-.s in water.
(:.)  Gaseous pollution in the atcposphere fronm  combustion products.
Pollution of the Sea
Thermal pollution of tlhe sea by cooling water does not presenit a threat
to marine fauna.  Cooling water is discharged directly into Manila Bay, where
its heat is quickly dissipated.
'rhe various ot7ner pollLitants in water are kept within acceptable limits,
as tollows:
(a)  Cooling water is chlorinated in order to inhibi, nliarinie
~i,rowths in the pipino,; it acts only inside the piping of
the plant and -:s practically ab)sent when the warer ,1is-
charges into thie sea.
(b)  In the treatment plant for boiler feed-water, anionic and cationic
rinse effluents are neutralized in a special basin before being
discharged into the sea.
(c)  Acid-containinig washing effluents from the Liungstron air heaters
are treated, and diluted 100 tinmes by the coolingc svst.em,
Gaseous Pollution
CoEibustion takes place under the Dest conditions and is strictly controlled
so that atmospheric pollution from unburned rmtaterial is eliminated,  The fuel
nas a very low ash content; hence, the problem of dust emitted by the flue gases
ioes not arise.
On the other hand, the high-viscosity oil has a high content of sulphur
which in the present state of technology, cannot be se1arated economically from
the fuel itself.  A study has therefore been undertaken Lo aesign a coimney
whicnl will give satisfactory dispersion of Lthe flu2 o.ases.
The chirmney of Bataan No. 1 unit (75 MW capacity) is 70 meters hi.-Ii,  For
tt,e proposed seconrd unit (150 M1W capacity), a thermally insulated chimney (() itetters
'liL  is contemplaLed.  If the gases enter the atm.osphere at high temperature,
:he smoke plume rises faster, which is equivalelnt to an increase in thle hei-ht of
the chirtmney as far as dispersion is concerned.
The calculation of maxinmum concentration of SO2 at ground level gives
values much lower than 0.4 ppm, the maximum value permitted by the Philippine
Air aidtG Water Pollution Control Commission, which is in line with control
regulations Chus far adopted by other countries.  The calculated values are well
oelow *he usual limllits leaving a margin of safety for other possiole sources of
SO' in tne area, exisLi no and future.

Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR)

(1) Based on 940 GWh per year (72% average plant factor) at proposed tariff
of tD.073 per kWh.
(2) Includes fuel and operation and maintenance staff and materials. Fuel
costs are taken at the basic contract price of 10.011 per kWh. Present
tariffs allow NPC to increase rates automatically when fuel prices go
up to compensate for the extra cost of generation.
The IFRR derived from this calculation is above 15.3%.
2. Sensitivity Tests
i) Cost overrun of 15% and schedule delay of 25% gives IFRR of 12.6%
ii) Benefit increase of 25% gives IFRR of 18.5%
iii) Benefit decrease of 25% gives IFRR of 11.7%
3. Other Remarks
No separate rate of return for the generating plant was calculated
as the system has no established tariff at generating bus bars and it would
have been necessary to assume an arbitrary value. The relation between the
transmission and generation expansions of the project is higher than the
average of NPC in Luzon, however, it was considered plausible to include
the total cost of the transmission project in the calculation of the
IFRR realizing that the effect would be to show a somewhat smaller return
on the project.
