PHILIPPINES: FIFTH POWER PROJECT
PREFACE
The Project comprised the construction of the second 150 MW unit
at the Bataan thermal power station and various transmission lines and
substations in Luzon, and consultant services to the National Power
Corporation (NPC). A credit of US$10.0 million (296-PH) and a loan of
US$22.0 million (809-PH) were made on April 3, 1972 and became effective on
June 30, 1972. The final disbursement from the credit was made on April 10,
1975 and from the loan on July 1, 1980.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the East Asia
and Pacific Regional office on the basis of the appraisal report, super-
vision reports and other documents in the Bank's files, a completion report
prepared by NPC, and a project completion mission to the Philippines.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower (NPC) and to
the Government of the Philippines for comment. Comments were received from
NPC, and are reproduced at Annex 13; they have been taken into account in
finalizing the report.
The project has not been subjected to audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PHILIPPINES: FIFTH POWER PROJECT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project formed part of the Government's four-year development
plan for Luzon and had as its principal objective the expansion of the
availability of electric power through extension of the transmission system
to facilitate connection of further rural electric cooperatives, and the
augmentation of NPC's generating capability to improve reliability of
service. The project was successful in achieving both of these objectives,
as evidenced by the growth of energy sales in provincial Luzon, which
advanced at an average of almost 10% per year between 1976 and 1978 without
deterioration in the reliability of service (para. 6.02). Facilities
constructed under the project have operated satisfactorily since entry into
commercial use (para. 3.17-3.18). However, all components of the project
were completed late, the transmission component particularly so (para. 3.01-
3.03). Changes in the design of various project components and slow
procurement procedures were the principal causes of delay. Largely as a
consequence of this slippage, there was a considerable cost overrun,
especially on the local currency element (para. 3.11) even though some of
the transmission components included in the original project concept were
eventually executed by another agency or transferred to a subsequent project
(para. 2.03).
The project also aimed at institutional development of NPC, and in
this it was partially successful. A number of measures were initiated to
help strengthen NPC's general management, planning (para. 5.02), collection
of receivables (para. 4.10) and audit (para. 4.12), although some of these
did not come to fruition until well after project completion.
NPC's financial condition was under considerable pressure during
the period of project construction as a result of the rapid rise in fuel
costs (para. 4.02) and the burden of debt service associated with its
substantial development program (para. 4.08). Tariffs did not keep pace
with the increase in NPC's costs and, as a result, NPC was unable to meet
the rate of return target of-8% covenanted with the Bank (para. 4.05). For
the same reason the latest estimate of the financial rate of return to the
project is negative. The financial rate of return is, however,
an inadequate measurement of the justification of the project (para. 6.05),
which is still considered to have been the least-cost solution available at
the time of appraisal to meet the load growth forecast for the project area
(paras. 6.03-6.04).






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since 1957, the Bank has made nine loans to the power sector in
the Philippines amounting to US$290.2 million equivalent, including seven
loans amounting to US$218.2 million to the National Power Corporation (NPC).
The first loan to NPC (183-PH, US$18.4 million, 1957) helped finance the
Binga Hydroelectric Project and the second (297-PH, US$33.5 million, 1961)
financed the Angat Hydroelectric Project. The third loan (325-PH, US$3.3
million, 1962) was used to finance the third unit of the Maria Cristina
hydroelectric power plant, located in Mindanao. The fourth loan (491-PH,
US$12.0 million, 1967) was used for the construction of a thermal power
plant (75MW) at Bataan, Luzon, and addition of a fourth unit at Maria
Cristina hydropower plant.   These projects were completed without major
problems and have been operating satisfactorily. Credit 296-PH/Loan 809-PH,
which is the subject of this report, was made to NPC in 1972 to finance the
Fifth Power Project. The sixth loan (1034-PH, US$61.0 million, 1974) is
helping to finance the construction of the 100 MW Pantabangan hydropower
plant and the expansion of the transmission system of the Luzon grid, which
is expected to be completed in May 1982. The seventh loan, which is the
Bank's latest operation with NPC (1460-PH, US$58.0 million, 1977) is financing
the expansion of the transmission system in Luzon and construction of a load
dispatching center, and is expected to be completed in 1984.
1.02      Bank Group lending to the Philippines power sector has also
included: (a) a loan to the National Electrification Administration (NEA)
for US$60 million in 1978 to help finance the 1979/80 portion of the rural
electrification program; and (b) a commitment by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) equivalent to US$12 million in 1967 to the Manila Electric
Company (MERALCO).
1.03      The Fifth Power Project was identified during a Bank mission that
visited Manila in January 1970. The Bank advised NPC that appraisal of the
project would be contingent upon the implementation of a substantial rate
increase in that year and upon satisfactory progress on the proposed NPC
legislation designed to avoid delays in the implementation of future rate
increases. Although the rate increase, implemented in late 1970, was well
below expectations, the project was appraised in May/June 1971 and the loan
credit agreements were signed on April 3, 1972.
1.04      Main undertakings and compliances with loan documents are shown
in Annex 12.



II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Original Project Description
2.01      The original project description for the NPC Fifth Power Project
included the following items:
(a) Generation
(i) construction of Bataan No. 2 steam power plant (150 MW)
including a boiler, turbine-generator, associated
electromechanical equipment and extension of the power house;
and
(ii) three 75MVA transformers and extension of the switchyard.
(b) Transmission. The transmission program for Central Luzon,
Lagunas-Batangas, Ilocos, Zambales and Southern Luzon
regions consisting of:
(i) 317 km of 230 kV lines and 90 km of 115 kV lines;
(ii) 440 km of 69 kV lines and 586 km of 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV
lines;
(iii) 8 large substations (245 MVA) at 230 kV and 115 kV; and
(iv) 16 load-end substations (95 MVA) at 69 kV.
(c) Advisory Services
(i) follow up review by management consultants of accounting
systems and procedures, reporting systems and staffing
requirements and a review of the current value of fixed
assets;
(ii) engineering consultants to improve technical operations and
to prepare long-term power development plans for Luzon; and
(iii) feasibilty studies of possible hydroelectric schemes on the
Chico River in Northern Luzon of about 450 MW capacity and
1,600 GWh output, for peaking duty, and on the pumped storage
scheme at Caliraya (300 MW initial capacity).
Changes to the Project
2.02      The scope of the project remained essentially the same as
envisaged at appraisal with the exception of works for the transmission
program (para. 2.03) which had to be reduced substantially owing to cost
overruns.



- 3-
only minor changes were introduced in the generating component as
follows:
(i)  two 125 MVA, 240/13.8 kV main transformers were installed
instead of three 75 MVA, 240/13.8 kV;
(ii) location of the fuel tanks, boiler feed water pumps,
demineralizing water treatment plant house, and compressed
air plant were modified; and
(iii) a demineralizing and pretreatment plant was incorporated as
an added safety feature in case of future change in the
properties of the present well water.
2.03      The main changes made to the transmission program during
implementation were:
(i)  the originally planned route for the 230 kV transmission line
was changed after survey and also the originating point of
the line was changed from Caliraya hydroplant to the Malaya
thermal plant. This resulted in an increase of 36 km in the
total length of the line;
(ii) additional transformer capacity at high voltage (230 kV and
115 kV) from 245 MVA to 315 MVA;
(iii)  construction of 34.5 kV (67 km) and 13.8 kV (519 km) lines
was transferred to the National Electrification
Administration (NEA); and
(iv) the following parts of the transmission components were
transferred and financed under the Sixth Power Loan:
(a)  switching equipment and steel structure for 230 kV and 115 kV
substations;
(b)  117 km of 69 kV lines;
(c)  nine load-end substations at 69 kV with a total capacity of
95 MVA; and
(c)  power line carrier equipment and relays.
2.04      A comparison between the original estimates and actual lengths of
transmission lines is shown below.    Details are shown in Annex 1.

Parts of the 115 kV and 69 kV transmission lines were built using materials
supplied from Japanese reparations which did not involve withdrawal from the
Credit or the Loan.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Project Execution
3.01      The project was completed 31 months behind schedule as shown
below:
Completion date     Delays
Project item      Original    Actual   (months)
Generation        June 1975   July 1977   25
Transmission      June 1975   Jan. 1978   31
The 150 MW Bataan thermal unit was connected to the grid in February 1977,
but entered into commercial service in July 1977, two years behind schedule.
3.02      Delay in implementation of the expansion of the thermal power
plant resulted in part, from NPC's insistence on prequalification of
suppliers of electromechanical equipment. The Bank had indicated early in
1972 that this requirement was not necessary. Nevertheless, NPC went ahead
with prequalification of suppliers (see para. 3.05) and did not award the
contracts until late 1973. Completion of this component was also held up by
delays in execution of civil works and late deliveries of the main power
transformers due to strikes in the manufacturer's country.
3.03      Major delays in the implementation of the transmission component
were caused by:
(a) changes in the design of the transmission projects prepared by
NPC following a revision of the consultants;
(b) changes in the location of some substations because of the need
for supplying electricity to some important industries which had
not been contemplated in the original plan;
(c) rerouting of several transmission lines; and
(d) delays in the delivery of some materials and factory strikes in
the country of origin of the goods.



-5-
Procurement
3.04      Preparation of bidding documents and procurement of equipment and
materials were in accordance with the Bank guidelines, and no significant
problems were reported in relation to contract awards.
3.05      At appraisal it was expected that the major equipment contracts
would be awarded before the end of 1972. Subsequently, however, NPC
stated that prequalification of prospective suppliers was required by
Philippine law in a public bidding for Government contracts. Also, NPC
wished, as a matter of policy, to avoid rejection of bids through post
qualification. The prequalifying process delayed calling for bids for about
six months. Further delays occurred because government regulations in
force at that time required all publicly-bid or negotiated contracts with
values exceeding P 2 million to be submitted to the NEDA Contracts Review
Committee for review and subsequent endorsement and approval by the
President. This contributed to delays beyond NPC's control. NPC itself was
slow in dealing with the procurement process. As a result, the main
electromechanical equipment contracts were not awarded until late 1973.
Award of Main Contracts
3.06      A total of 13 manufacturers of turbo-generating equipment were
invited to submit tenders in December 1972. Only six bidders submitted
tenders. They were: Fuji Electric Co. (Japan), Mitsubishi Electric Co.
(Japan), Brown, Boveri & Cie. (Switzerland), Ansaldo Meccanico Nucleare
(Italy), Franco Tosi S.p.A. (Italy) and General Electric (USA). The
contract was awarded to Fuji Electric Co. in October 1973.
3.07      Out of 13 prequalified manufacturers of steam generators, only 4
submitted bids: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (Japan), Babcock
Atlantique (France), Franco Tosi S.p.A (Italy) and Sulzer Bros., Ltd.
(Switzerland). The contract was awarded to Mitsubishi in November 1973.
3.08      The contract for the remaining equipment for Bataan No. 2 was
awarded to Gruppo Industrie Elettro Mecchaniche per Impianti all'Estero
(GIE), Italy in November 1973. Fourteen manufacturers had been
prequalified, but only five bidders submitted tenders.
3.09      The contracts for the transmission system were awarded between
1974 and 1975. The 69 kV transmission equipment and materials were procured
on a supply basis only, rather than a turnkey basis as had been originally
scheduled.
3.10      Countries of the main contractors and suppliers are listed below
and Annex 2 contains a breakdown of suppliers for the main project
components.

Project Cost
3.11      The total project cost exceeded the appraisal forecast by about
US$20.2 million equivalent (or 42.1%). The project as actually executed
cost US$68.3 million, of which US$36.5 million represented the foreign
component, including the cost of materials obtained from Japanese
Reparations. If construction of 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV lines and some
substations and communication equipment had not been omitted from the
project, the cost overrun would have been higher. The comparison of
appraisal estimate and actual costs is detailed in Annexes 3 and 4 and
summarized below (in US$ million):

3.12       The actual cost of generation component of the project exceeded
the original estimate by 19% (local 3% and foreign 22%). Despite deletion
of the 34.5 KV and 13.8 KV lines the cost overrun for the transmission
component was much higher. While the foreign currency costs of that
component rose about 22% only, the local costs were more than twice the
original estimate. These cost overrun resulted mainly from:
(a) a two-year delay in the completion of the project;
(b) revaluation of the yen and of the currencies of different
countries where the equipment was purchased;
(c)  increased length of the 230 kV transmission lines (36 km) and
changes in the design of the transmission project;
(d) increases in the prices of cement and reinforcing steel procured
locally and in the minimum wage rates which affected the domestic
costs.
3.13      The cost of consulting services was about four times the original
estimate mainly because of substantial increase in the scope of their work
and employment over a longer period resulting from revisions of the design
of the transmission subprojects. Also the preparation of NPC's long range
power development program involved more detailed studies than envisaged
originally.
Disbursements
3.14      The Credit of US$10.0 million was fully disbursed by April 10,
1975 as against the original date of June 30, 1973. The final payment from
the loan was made on July 1, 1980, more than five years behind schedule and
the loan account was closed on that date. An amount of about US$181,000 was
cancelled from the loan.
3.15      Because of project delays, the Bank extended the Closing Date
from June 1976 to June 1978 and twice thereafter to enable NPC to complete
the withdrawal of funds from the loan. The final Closing Date for the loan
was July 1, 1980. A summary of estimated and actual credit/loan
disbursements is shown in Annex 5 and a comparison of original and final
allocation of proceeds of the Credit/Loan by categories is shown below:

Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.16      In general, the performance of the consultants, contractors and
suppliers that participated in the project, was satisfactory. Some delays
in the delivery of materials and equipment were justified.
Operating Performance
3.17      From the date it entered into commercial operations, the Bataan
No. 2 power plant has performed satisfactorily, with an average plant factor
above 75%. A number of changes were made in the boiler (high pressure
preheater) since its performance during the acceptance tests was lower than
that guaranteed by the manufacturer. The supplier made the necessary
modifications at no cost to NPC, and extended the guarantee on that part of
equipment for another year.
3.18      All other project components have also been operating
satisfactorily.
IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Operating Results
4.01      NPC's operating results during the period of project implementa-
tion (1972-77) (see Annex 6) were slightly better than expected at the time

of appraisal. Net income quadrupled from P 24 million in FY71/72 to P
103 million at the end of CY77. During this period average revenue per kWh
sold increased from 5,2 centavos (8 US mills) to 14.68 (19.5 US mills) while
operating costs per unit sold increased from 1.9 centavos to 11 centavos.
Operating income, however, was only sufficient to meet the rate of return
targets agreed with the Bank in FY73, when NPC achieved 6%. Thereafter, NPC
was unable to achieve the agreed level of 8% on revalued net fixed assets
(see Table of Key Indicators).

4.02      The principal reason for NPC-s failure to meet the rate of return
covenant was that tariff increases were not sufficient to match increases in
costs. Although NPC introduced a fuel cost adjustment clause about mid-1973
which fortunately enabled it to pass on increases in costs of fuel oil,
increases to cover higher costs of other operating expenses including
depreciation were permitted by Government too infrequently and too late to
enable NPC to meet the financial performance targets agreed with the Bank.
These increases were made in July 1974 (20%) and November 1976 (35%).
4.03       Under the rate of return covenant in the Loan Agreement, NPC
agreed to revalue its assets "once every four years or more frequently in
accordance with sound and consistently maintained methods of valuation,
acceptable to the Bank." It was also agreed that consultants would be
employed to carry out the revaluations; the first of which was to be
completed for FY72 by October 31, 1972. The consultants selected for this
assignment by NPC carried out revaluations as of June 1972 and December 31,
OED Note: See also item 3-A on page 2 of Annex 13.



- 10 -
1976. The results of these revaluations were recorded in NPC's books in the
years immediately following their completion.    In the intervening years, NPC
adjusted its rate base using suitable price indexes which had been
recommended by the consultants.   During the years 1972-77, NPC's average net
fixed assets in service were revalued about 90%. Over approximately the
same period, the Philippine consumer price index doubled. This suggests
that the consultants' revaluation led to adjustments to NPC's rate base
which reasonably approximated the change in the general level of prices.
4.04      NPC's overall depreciation cost rates have shown some fluctuation
from one revaluation to the next. To some extent this is attributable to
changes in the mix of components in each asset category. But besides this,
one of the valuation study recommendations both in 1972 and 1976 was the
adoption of revised rates of depreciation based on revised asset lives.
The changes proposed have led to some inconsistency in the accounting for
depreciation expense. However, they would not have been sufficient to
materially affect NPC's financial performance. Nevertheless, the Bank has
suggested to NPC that it give due consideration to the need for maintaining
consistent depreciation rates and only revise them on the basis of long-term
operating experience.
4.05      While NPC's rate of return performance in most years was not much
below the agreed level of 8%, it is now apparent that the agreed level was set
too low to provide NPC with an adequate level of self financing mainly because
of the unexpected increase in working capital requirements. The Bank
recognized this when processing the Seventh Power Loan and renegotiated the
covenant to include a provision for the borrower to consult with the Bank to
establish rates of return higher than 8% by June 30, 1979. However, so far
NPC has not been willing to agree any rate higher than 8%. The issue of the
8% rate of return covenant has been the subject of frequent discussion and
correspondence between NPC and the Bank. However, both parties are agreed as
to the need for NPC to mobilize a greater proportion of the resources required
for its development program from its own customers, and targets for this have
been adopted for the years 1983 through 1986 in the context of the negotia-
tions for the Second Structural Adjustment Loan. Although expressed in terms
of a reducing dependence, and eventual elimination, of government equity
contributions, their achievement will also imply an improvement in NPC's rate
of return. Satisfactory progress will be a condition of Bank preparedness to
consider further lending to NPC.!/
Financing Plan
4.06      NPC's capital expenditure for FY73-76 (See Annex 7) totalled
US$160.8 million compared to US$168.8 million anticipated when the project
was appraised, but substantial unforeseen increases took place in working
capital amounting to about US$81 million over the period. Cash generation
and borrowings provided about the planned level of funding. Commencing
FY75, Government began the first of a series of subscriptions to NPC's
capital. These contributions were required to finance the local costs of
NPC's rapidly expanding construction program which included the country's
first nuclear power plant at Bataan. To finance the latter, NPC arranged a
$367 million bond issue through Eximbank, the proceeds of which were
1/ OED Note: See also item 10-D on page 5 of Annex 13.



- 11 -
temporarily placed on deposit pending their use thus accounting for the
substantial increase in working capital shown in the financing plan.
4.07       In addition NPC arranged a series of loans and bond issues
totalling about US$900 million through the US Eximbank and a group of banks
headed by Citicorp (USA) to finance the foreign costs of the Bataan nuclear
plant. However, the arrangement of these funds did not reflect in NPC-s
finances up to the end of the planned construction period for the Fifth
Power Project, i.e., June 30, 1976.
Financial Position
4.08       During project implementation, the level of NPC's debt equity ratio
and debt service coverage was lower than the Bank's appraisal report projec-
tions at least until 1977 (Annex 8 and 9). The debt/equity ratio which was
40/60 in FY72 rose to 60/40 in CY77 mainly due to the surge in NPC's
borrowings to finance the Bataan nuclear project and other ongoing projects.
By June 1976, the debt/equity ratio had declined to 26/74 due to conversion of
government bonds and loans to equity (P 247 million). In addition equity
contributions which began in FY75 accelerated in the following year to provide
NPC with an additional P 900 million in new capital in the 2-1/2 year period
to December 1976. However, because of the increase in NPC debt service
charges due to additional borrowing discussed in paras. 4.06 and 4.07 and the
coincident expiration of the grace period on a number of other large loans,
debt service coverage declined dramatically in FY77. Until this decline, NPC
had maintained an adequate level of debt service coverage and been able to
meet the requirement for at least 1.3 times coverage in the Loan Agreement.
Because of this serious deterioration in NPC's debt service position, the Bank
introduced a new covenant in the Seventh Power Project Loan Agreement (Section
5.05) which required NPC to:
(a) submit its ten-year development program and supporting financial
plan to the Bank for review;
(b) undertake new investment projects (i.e., in excess of $50 million)
only after agreeing with the Bank that such projects form part of
a least-cost program to be financed at reasonable cost as part of
an appropriate financing plan; and
(c) to limit medium- and short-term debt, i.e., debt maturing within
five years to US$50 million equivalent.
The debt service coverage ratio has subsequently recovered to above the
covenanted level. 1/
4.09       Under the debt service coverage covenant in the Loan Agreement for
the Fifth Power Project, it was agreed that foreign debt would be valued on
the basis of prevailing exchange rates. In partial compliance with this
covenant, NPC revalued its foreign debt in 1973 and 1976 using the official
rate of exchange between the US currency and the peso. While this procedure
would have provided an appropriate valuation of foreign debt in US currency,
1/ OED Note: See also item 5 on page 3 of Annex 13.



- 12 -
it would not have in the case of debts incurred in other currencies which
NPC began to obtain from FY75. To ensure that NPC's debt is properly
valued, the Bank has advised NPC that all foreign debt be valued at the end
of each year using prevailing exchange rates as provided in the loan
agreement and not just on the basis of periodic adjustmentL of the US$/peso
exchange rate.
Collection of Unpaid Electricity Accounts
4.10      Under the Fifth Power Project Loan Agreement NPC agreed to take
steps to reduce unpaid electricity accounts as of June 30, 1973 and there-
after annually to an amount equivalent to not more than the amount billed
during the last three months of the year. .NPC introduced revised billing and
collection procedures including discount for prompt payment, disconnection
for nonpayment, and levy of interest charges on overdue accounts. Despite
this change in procedures NPC did not consistently meet this undertaking
until FY77. In the preceding years it did make arrangements with a number
of its industrial customers, (e.g. cement companies) to pay off their
arrears in monthly installments. This covenant was repeated in the Loan
Agreements for the Sixth and Seventh Power Loans.i/
Audit
4.11      NPC's annual financial statements were audited each year by the
Government's Office of the Corporation Auditor.   In most years the audit
reports were received within three months of the end of NPC's fiscal year
except for FY76 when NPC changed its fiscal year from July 1/June 30 to the
calendar year. On this occasion, the report was received about six months
late.
4 12      The reports of the corporation auditor were generally satisfactory
and contained comprehensive information supporting the auditor's opinions.
Shortly after the loan was signed, however, the Bank questioned the
independence of NPC's auditor with its general manager and the National
Economic Development Authority primarily on the grounds that the auditor was
engaging in executive duties. The Bank raised this question during
processing of the Seventh Power Loan in the context of the auditor's
preaudit functions. At negotiations for the Seventh Power Loan, it was
agreed with Government that it would review its auditing procedures at NPC
and implement a program to improve them in agreement with the Bank by
September 30, 1978. Changes in the auditor's duties to reaffirm his
independence were instituted effective January 1983.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMLANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Organization and Management
5.01      Under the Fourth Power Loan (6491-PH), NPC engaged consultants
to organize its management on a sound basis. Although the recommendations
1/ OED Note: See also item 6 on page 3 of Annex 13.



- 13 -
of these consultants were implemented, the Fifth Power loan included a
provision for a follow-up review by the consultants of the accounting systems,
reporting procedures and staffing. During supervision of the project, Bank
staff noted that the quality of NPC-s accounting and finance staff raised
doubts as to their ability to use the systems which had been installed by the
consultants to best advantage. It was also recorded that NPC management
needed improvement to cope adequately with the rapid expansion of TPC s
facilities. This expansion was facilitated by Presidential Decree No. 40 of
November 7, 1972 which gave NPC responsibility for planning and operating all
generating facilities in the country. In 1977, government decided to turn
over to NPC the thermal power plants previously operated by Meralco.
Fortunately this takeover process was not finalized until 1979, giving NPC
time to make adequate preparations for the takeover by strengthening its
organization and staff.
5.02      The strengthening of NPC's management by consultants under the
Fourth and Fifth Power loans was continued with further reorganization of
management staff, project implementation and planning systems under the
Seventh power loan. Also, under that loon NPC agreed to establish and fill
the position of Vice President Finance.-1
5.03      Under the guarantee agreement (Section 3.03) the Government agreed
to submit to the Bank by December 31, 1972, a plan for the effective
coordination of the planning of power development and its implementation
among power suppliers. Although the Bank was not given any opportunity to
comment on the proposed changes the enactment of the Presidential Decree
No. 40 met the intent of the covenant in the Guarantee Agreement.
NPC's Charter
5.04      NPC had a new Charter approved by the Government in September 1971
primarily because of legal difficulties in implementation of tariff increases.
The new charter gave NPC power to fix its own tariffs. In practice, NPC
has not been able to implement tariff increases approved by its board without
first obtaining the approval of the President. The increases approved have
not been sufficient to meet the 8% rate of return target since its intro-
duction in FY74 (paras. 4.01 and 4.02).
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project was part of the Government's four-year development
plan for Luzon. It was intended to accomplish the objective of bringing
electricity to as many inhabitants as possible, a process assisted by
/1 Meralco (Manila Electric Co.) had 1,270 MW of thermal plant in 1972
to NPC's 615 MW of which only 75 MW was thermal.
1/ OED Note: See also item 8-B on page 4 of Annex 13.



- 14 -
connecting as many of the provincial population to the national system of
electricity supply as soon as possible. This objective was met by the
extension of the transmission facilities making possible connection of the
local private franchises and the rural electric cooperatives thus reducing
the overall system cost of electricity supply in the country.
Load Growth
6.02      Actual NPC energy sales in the 1972-78 period in the Provincial
areas of Luzon were 10% lower than those estimated at appraisal as shown in
detail in Annex 10 and summarized below:
LUZON GRID - ENERGY SALES
(GWh)
1972    1973     1974    1975    1976     1977    1978    Total
Appraisal    1,370   1,650   1,930    2,110   2,400   2,630    2,930   15,020
Actual       1,377   1,608   1,718    1,989   2,269   2,182    2,362   13,505
Energy sales for 1977 decreased by 87 GWh from 2,269 GWh in 1976 to 2,182 GWh
due to load shedding caused by lack of water in the reservoirs during the year
and also because of the effects of the tariff increases in November 1976. The
average price per kWh rose from P 0.1099 in 1976 to P 0.1468 in 1977 or an
overall increase of 34%. Because of the reduction in the load growth, the
delay in the completion of the Bataan No. 2 did not seriously affect the
reliability of service.
Least Cost Solution
6.03      At appraisal the additional thermal power plant at Bataan was
considered to be the most econotic means of meeting the increased load
expected in the Luzon grid. The size of the unit (150 MW) was also
considered suitable in relation.to the combined capacity of the NPC-Meralco
system. Development of domestic energy resources to serve the power sector
was at that time at an early stage, with the exception of hydropower develop-
ment. The latter, however, required a longer period of construction and,
furthermore, there was no hydroelectric alternative of suitable size. Because
of the low utilization factor (about 32%), small reservoirs and priorities for
irrigation which characterized existing hydropower plants, a thermal power
plant was the only solution capable of safely meeting the accelerating load
growth.
6.04      The transmission subprojects in Southern Luzon were based on
studies made by Electricite de France in 1965 and were considered to be the
most economic proposals on the basis of the "present value comparisons" of
the various alternatives analyzed.



- 15 -
Internal Financial Rate of Return
6.05      The rate of return on the project had been estimated at appraisal at
15%. On the basis of actual investment costs, tariffs and operating expenses
(in constant 1977 prices) a similar analysis to the calculation in the
appraisal report shows a negative return (Annex 11). This difference from the
appraisal forecast is due in part to the cost overruns on the project, but
more importantly to the extremely large fuel oil price increases. These rose
from about US$2.40/bbl in 1972 to US$34.00/bbl in 1981 which, if expressed in
USe/kWh, is now higher (6e/kWh) than the present average power rate in the
Luzon grid (4.55e/kWh).   However, it is important to note that average power
tariffs are not a true measure of the economic merit of the Project since
these tariffs understate the value of the benefits accruing to the
beneficiaries (consumer surplus).
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      The project was completed about 2 1/2 years late at a total cost
of $68.25 million which is 42% above the appraisal estimate. The 150 MW
thermal powerplant at Bataan financed under the loan/credit has operated
satisfactorily. The transmission component of the project, however, was
substantially changed; works with a foreign exchange cost of US$8 million
were transferred and financed under the Sixth Power Project due to lack of
funds under the Fifth Power Project and all subtransmission works at 34.5 KV
and 13.8 kV were erected and financed by the National Electrification
Administration (NEA)./1
7.02      The internal financial rate of return on the Project was negative
due to the extremely large increases in the cost of fuel used by the plant
(USc/6/kWh) and to a lesser extent to the cost overrun on the Project.
These increased costs were greater than the increase in average power rates
over the period 1977-1981. The increase in fuel costs could not have been
foreseen. At the time of appraisal the addition of an oil-fired thermal
unit was the least cost means of meeting the growth in the Luzon system and
its construction was fully justified.
7.03      For a number of reasons, some beyond NPC's control, it was common
for the award of contracts to be delayed well beyond the date stipulated in
the tender documents. This caused not only delay in the completion of works,
/1 NEA was made responsible in 1972 for coordinating and financing
electricity supply in rural areas through electricity cooperatives.

but equally importantly, cost overruns. The Bank has addressed this
question to 1TPC, encouraging it to take the necessary steps as soon as
possible to speed up its procurement procedures. NPC has eventually made
some improvements in this matter. Additionally, revised government
procedures for contract review and approval introduced in 1978 and 1981 will
alleviate causes of delay external to NPC.
7.04      NPC's sales growth was not as rapid as expected (10% lower than
projected) but this slower growth did not significantly affect its financial
performance. NPC failed to achieve the 8% rate of return target agreed for
FY74 and future years primarily because tariff increases were not
sufficiently frequent to match increases in costs (other than for fuel). Up
to 1976 its debt service coverage was adequate but at the end of 1977, NPC
debt service coverage fell to unsatisfactory levels and self-financing was
zero. The additional funds required during the project construction period
were provided by the Government through additional equity contributions.
7.05      Because of NPC-s poor financial position at the end of 1977, the
Bank took steps in the Seventh Power loan to address NPC's financial
problems by including an undertaking to consult with the Bank on higher
rates of return than 8% and measures requiring NPC to obtain the Bank-s
agreement to any new investment projects (costing more than US$50 million),
its financing plan and limitations on the level of short and medium term
borrowing.
7.06      Todate NPC has not achieved an 8% rate of return, and this failure
has become an important issue betwen the Bank and the Government of the
Philippines. However, Government, NPC and the Bank are agreed on the
underlying need to mobilize increased funding for NPC from its customers
through higher rates. Appropriate measures to address this have been
adopted in the context of the SAL II energy component and satisfactory
progress should b,e a condition to the Bank preparedness to consider further
lending to NPC.i
7-07      The measures included in the Project for strengthening NPC's
organization and management were adequate at the time of the Bank's appraisal.
However, if the Bank had known about the Government's plans to give NPC
responsibility for all generation (which it did about six months after the
loan/credit was signed), the Bank could have included measures for providing
training for NPC staff in thermal plant operation and maintenance and
assistance in planning and organizing the takeover of the Meralco plant.

Attn:   Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director
Operations Evaluation Dept.
Re:   Project Completion Report on
Philippines Fifth Power Project
(Credit 296 and Loan 809-PH)
Dear Mr. Kapur:
Thank you for your 23 November 1982 letter regarding
the draft of the World Bank's Project Completion Report
on Philippines Fifth Power Project. As you requested,
the following comments are submitted:
In general, the draft report did not provide an
adequate perspective of the economic environment during
the period covered. The loan agreement became effective
on June 30, 1972. Fifteen months later, the first oil
crisis occurred; the second oil crisis struck in January
1979. It was only in page 15 (para. 6.05b) that the
report recognized the large fuel oil price increases from
about US$2.40 per bbl in 1972 to US$34.00 in 1981.
In the difficult economic environment spawned by the
oil crises, NPC's average selling price country-wide was
raised 198% from the 1977 level of P0.147/KWH to P0.429/
KWH in 1982. During the same period, the cost of
imported oil went up by a smaller 168% from US$12.70 in
1977 to a price of US$34.00/bbl by 1982.
Also between 1977 and 1982 (including Meralco's
output in the earlier year) the share of oil-based power
plants was reduced from more than 80 per cent to less than
60 per cent.



- 32 -           ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 13
Our comments on specific items in the draft report
are as follows:
1. Procurement, Para. 3.05 - In addition to the require-
ment on the prequalification of prospective suppliers,
government policy in effect at the time required that
all publicly-bidded or negotiated contracts with
values exceeding P2.0 million be submitted to the NEDA
Contracts Review Committee for review and subsequent
endorsement and approval by the President. This
contributed to delays which were beyond NPC's control.
The government has subsequently remedied this situation
with the enactment of PD 1594 in June of 1978 and
approval of the implementing rules and regulation in
February of 1980. Under these rules, authority was
delegated to the Infrastructure Ministers, among them
the Minister of Energy, to approve locally-funded
contracts awarded by competitive bidding up to P15.0
million and contracts for foreign-assisted projects
which are awarded through internationally competitive
bidding up to P60.0 million.
2. Project Cost, Para. 3.13 - As you have noted, the cost
of consulting services was four times the original
estimate and accounted for 40% of the $20.2 million cost
overrun on the project (para. 3.11). However, it
should be stressed that the reason for this was the
consultants' revision of the design of the transmission
projects which of course prolonged their engagement and
increased the scope of their work.
3. Operating Results
A. Para. 4.01 - We wish to point that 1977 return on
rate base was unusually low at 4.1% due to the
sudden increase in rate base as a result of the
start-up of Bataan II and Pantabangan. Note that
return subsequently increased thereafter.
B. Para. 4.02, 4.05 - See comments regarding para. 7.05
and 7.06.
C. Para. 4.04 - There was no inconsistency in the
depreciation method used in 1972 and 1976 as the
same composite method of straight line depreciation
was used. However, please note that under the compo-
site method, the depreciation is computed on a group
basis by major functional account based on a) the
average lives of each primary component in the



- 33 -
ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 13
functional category and b) the mix of these compo-
nents in that category at the time of computation/
evaluation. Thus while still maintaining the same
depreciation method, a change in any of these
factors would result in revised depreciation rates.
4. Financing Plan, Para. 4.06 - The substantial increase
in working capital for year 1976 was due to the current
portion of the notes receivable due from the U.S. Exim-
bank and not the 30 billion lire loan from Interbanca.
This represents a part of the proceeds of the $367.2
million bond issue for the nuclear plant deposited with
Citibank N.A., the escrow agent of U.S. Exim.
5. Financial Position, Para. 4.08 - The increase in debt
service charges from 1976 to 1977 is not attributable to
the nuclear loans or the Italian credit mentioned in
para. 4.06 and 4.07. The increase was due to the
coincidence of the start of principal amortization on
several loans whose grace periods had lapsed like the
ADB loans for Agus VI, Agus V and the 138 KV and 69 KV
Mindanao transmission lines, the Export credit loans for
various diesel generating units installed in the Visayas
and Mindanao and the Tiwi geothermal plants. Therefore,
the low debt-service coverage for 1977 should be
considered as abnormal. Please note that in subsequent
years the debt service coverage was well in excess of
the 1.3 times ratio (1979 - 2.55, 1980 - 1.57, 1981 - 1.60)
using the definition agreed upon with the Bank which
excludes interest during construction funded out of term
loans.
6. Collection of Unpaid Electricity Accounts, Para. 4.10 -
The covenant on power receivables was met not only in
1977 but in 1974 when the amount outstanding was reduced
to 89 days sale. It should also be mentioned that from
1977 onwards, NPC has consistently exceeded the require-
ments of this covenant with receivables dropping to 71
and 42 days sales in the years 1978 and 1981, respectively.
7. Audit, Para. 4.12 - On the contrary, there has in fact
been substantial progress achieved in the manner of COA's
audit of NPC. As a result of bilateral discussions with
the Bank's various supervision missions particularly with
Mr. Cordukes, the COA audit report now contains more
comprehensive and relevant information regarding NPC's
operation. Additionally, effective January 1, 1983, the
Commission on Audit has given up its pre-audit functions
and is now acting purely as an external auditor.

8. Institutional Performance and Development
A. Para. 5.01 - The Meralco thermal power plants
were sold by Meralco to the government and the
latter turned them over to NPC to operate. This
was done to arrest the deteriorating electricity
service in Metro Manila and establish the insti-
tutional framework for the government's program
of reducing the country's reliance on imported
oil through the development of indigenous
alternative energy resources. As a result, the
share of oil-based power plants in the total
output of NPC and Meralco was reduced from more
than 80 per cent in 1977 to less than 60 per cent
in 1981.
B. Para. 5.02 - As part of the strengthening of
its management, NPC had undergone an exhaustive
reorganization process starting in 1978 with a
complete revamp of its management staff. In
addition, the engineering group adopted the Project
Management and Matrix organization concept to
strengthen the project implementation process.
A system planning group was created under Corporate
Planning to undertake the development and review
of the power expansion program. Sophisticated
optimization methods such as packaged softwares
like WASP, PECO and mathematical models for systems
analyses are used extensively by this group. Overall
institution building has been initiated and compre-
hensive training program has been developed for such
purposes.
9.  Internal Financial Rate of Return, Para. 6.05    -  As
pointed in said paragraph and reiterated in para. 7.02,
the negative project financial return was due primarily
to the extremely large increases in the cost of fuel
and to a lesser extent the cost overruns. The last
sentence of para. 6.05 contradicts this by attributing
the low return to the inadequate tariff policies of NPC.
Suggest that this last sentence be omitted as it seems
to have been added only as an aside or an editorial
comment without sufficient basis.
10. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
A. Para. 7.02 - The last sentence of this paragraph
starting with "The economic attractiveness of



- 35 -
ANNEX 13
Page 5 of 13
retiring some of existing ..." again seems to be
an editorial comment which has no bearing on the
subject at hand. For one thing, no previous
mention was ever made in the report of NPC's
intention to retire existing oil-thermal plants
and to replace them with geothermal or coal-fired
power plants which could have formed the basis
for questioning the viability of such intentions.
Granting however that sufficient basis has been
put forth for the inclusion of this comment, may
we refer you to the report of the Bank's special
task force created to review NPC's power expansion
program particularly with reference to the oil-
substitution feature of such a program. As conveyed
to us in their letter of November 20, 1981, the
task force indicated that NPC's proposed program
was economically viable and was equally a possible
least cost solution like several alternative programs
drawn up by the Bank. Given the foregoing, NPC's
ability to pursue its program will hinge on its
ability to raise the necessary finance to support
the project and its institutional capability to
organize, implement and supervise such an ambitious
program.
B. Para. 7.03 - Please note our comments on para. 3.05.
C. Para. 7.04 - Please note our comments on para. 4.08.
D. Para. 7.05 and 7.06 - The issue of the 8% rate of
return covenant has been the subject of various
discussions and correspondence between NPC and the
Bank. NPC has requested the bank to review the
applicability of this criterion, which has been
established in private utility economics, to a
government utility company of a less developed country.
This criterion requires NPC to operate like a profit-
oriented private utility company and to forego projects
that extend electricity to depressed areas since these
would not yield acceptable returns for a number of
years. This runs counter to NPC's role as an imple-
mentor of government policy to extend the benefit of
electricity to all areas in our country and the Bank's
thrust to provide developmental assistance to
depressed sectors or DMC's. Since the ultimate aim
of the return criterion is to insure that NPC gene-
rates sufficient funds to cover portions of its
capital expenditures, NPC has suggested that in lieu



- 36 -
ANNEX 13
Page 6 of 13
of this criterion, a more direct covenant using
a cash-flow criterion or a targetted self-
financing ratio be used. ADB has agreed to this
change from the return criterion to a 20% self-
financing ratio, i.e., NPC's internal cash
generation net of debt service requirements shall
cover 20% of its capital expenditure. It is hoped
that as a result of the SAL II discussions where
NPC has committed to a program of phasing out
government equity contributions by 1986, the Bank
would be more inclined to follow ADB's example.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director
Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
1818 H. Street
Washington, D.C., U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Kapur:
With reference to the draft project completion report on the
Philippine Fifth Power Loan (Credit 296/Loan 809-PH), following are
our comments on the report findings:
Severe cost push inflation in the world economy prevented the
National Power Corporation (NPC) from attaining the 8 percent return
on rate base. As a countermeasure, NPC raised its power rates by 197
percent be been 1977 and 1982, even higher than the increase in fuel
oil price.!   In consideration of continuing cost inflation and to
enable NPC to internally finance greater portions of its investments,
NPC has been granted authority by the Philippine Government to imple-
ment a series of rate adjustments. Initially, this consists of seven
quarterly rate increase of 0.75 centavos per KWH commencing July 1982.
Further, NPC has agreed with the Asian Development Bank to ensure
that starting 1984, at least 20 percent of NPC's capital expenditures
shall be financed internally.
NPC has also taken steps to improve collection of receivables
through stricter enforcement of its disconnection policy for which
full government support has been given.
In addition, the government has directed an interagency committee
to conduct a policy study on electricity pricing, the terms of reference
of which is under discussion with the World Bank.
Regarding NPC's plan toretire some oil-fired power plants, this
is deemed necessary in view of these plants' continued poor perform-
ance, thus seriously impairei-g reliability of the Luzon Grid.
The cost of fuel oil to NPC increased from PO.618 per liter in
1977 to P1.65 in 1982 or by 167 percent.
OED Note: The substance of this letter is repeated in more detail in the
letter dated January 27, 1983 from NPC (pages 1-6 of this Annex).

Finally, sustained efforts at improving project management
include institution of organizational reforms within NPC's Engineering
Group, the streamlining of internal procedures for contract awards,
development of a Project Management Information System and partial
computerization of the procurement function.
Sincerely,
GABRIEL4 .)ITCHON

RE: PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT ON PHILIPPINES
FIFTH POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 296 AND LOAN 809 PH)
…-----------------------------------------------
HAVE AIRMAILED TODAY OUR DETAILED COMMENTS ON YOUR DRAFT REPORT
ON ABOVE CAPTIONED SUBJECT, HIGHLIGHTS OF WHICH ARE:
1) DRAFT REPORT DID NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE PERSPECTIVE OF THE
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT PREVAILING DURING THE PERIOD
COVERED PARTICULARLY THE OIL CRISIS IN 1973 AND 1979,
PERHAPS A SHORT PARAGRAPH ON THIS IS NEEDED.+
2) PARA. 3.05, 7.03 - DELAYS IN BID AWARDS WERE PRIMARILY
DUE TO GOVERNMENT POLICY REQUIRING NEDA REVIEW OF CONTRACTS
WITH VALUES EXCEEDING PESO 2.0 MILLION FOR SUBSEQUENT ENDORSEMENT
AND APPROVAL OF HIGHER AUTHORITIES.-THIS IS BEYOND NPC'S CONTROL.
3) PARA. 3.113 - INCREASE IN COST OF CONSULTING SERVICES WAS DUE TO
DESIGN CHANGES INITIATED BY CONSULTANTS WHICH OF COURSE PROLONGED
THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND INCREASED WORK SCOPE,l



- 40 -
ANNEX 13
Page 10 of 13
4) PARA., 4.01 - 1977 RETURN OF 4.11 PERCENT WAS ABNORMALLY LOW DUE
TO SUDDEN INCREASE IN RATE BASE DUE TO PANTABANGAN AND BATAAN II
START-UP.4 RETURN IN 1978 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS NORMALIZED TO
6-7 PERCENT.;
5) PARA.- 4.102, 4.005, 7.*05, 7.906 - EXHAUSTIVE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN
HELD WITH THE BANK REGARDING RATE OF RETURN ISSUE.' NPC'S
CONTENTION IS THAT THIS CRITERION IS APPLICABLE TO PRIVATE
UTILITY AND NOT GOVERNMENT OWNED UTILITY IN A LESS DEVELOPED
ECONOMY.' THIS CRITERION RESTRICTS NPC'S ABILITY TO EXTEND
SERVICE TO DEPRESSED AREAS IN VIEW OF LOW EXPEC-TED RETURNS AND
THEREFORE SEEMS COUNTER TO NPC'S ROLE AS IMPLEMENTOR OF
GOVERNMENT POLICY AND THE BANKS AIM OF GIVING DEVELOPMENTAL
ASSISTANCE PRIORITY TO DEPRESSED SECTORS OF DMCS.' SUGGEST A
MORE DIRECT COVENANT BASED ON CASH FLOW CRITERIA OR
SELF-FINANCING RATIO TARGET.' ADB HAS AGREED TO THE LATTER.*
6) PARA.4 4.104 - DEPRECIATION METHOD USED IN 1972 AND 1976 IS THE
SAME QOMPOSITE STRAIGHT LINE DEPRECIATION METHOD., CHANGES IN
COMPOSITE DEPRECIATION RATES WERE DUE TO MOVEMENT IN THE
MIX OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS IN EACH FUNCTIONAL GROUP.i THEREFORE,
THERE IS NO INCONSISTENCY'.'



- 41 -
ANNEX 13
Page 11 of 13
7) PARA'j 4'.06 - INCREASE IN 1977 WORKING CAPITAL WAS DUE TO THE
EFFECT OF THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE NOTES RECEIVABLE DUE FROM
THE U~.SS.' EXIMBANK RESULTING FRON THE DEPOSIT OF THE PROCEEDS
FROM THE DLR 367.12 MILLION NUCLEAR PLANT BOND ISSUE WITH
CITIBANK N.'Ar. AND NOT FROM THE 30 BILLION LIRE LOAN.4
8) PARA'.- 4'.408, 7'.104 - INCREASE IN 1977 DEBT SERVICE WAS NOT DUE TO
LOANS CITED IN PARA-. 4.106 AND 4.i07 BUT THE RESULT OF
SIULTANEOUS START OF AMORTIZATION ON SEVERAL LOANS LIKE THE
ADB LOANS FOR GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION PROJEOTS MINDANAO
AND EXPORT CREDIT LOANS FOR DIESEL POWER PLANTS IN THE
VISAYAS AND MINDANAO AND THE TIWI GEOTHERMAL PLANT.,
9) PARA.i 4.110 - tOVENANT ON POWER REGEIVABLES WAS MET NOT ONLY
IN 1977 BUT ALSO IN 1974 WHEN REeEIVABLES STAND AT 89 DAYS SALES_i
REeEIVABL'ES DROPPED TO 71 AND 42 DAYS SALES IN 1978 AND 1981
RESPEG'TIVELY'§.
10) PARAb1 4'i12 -SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS HAS IN FAeT BEEN MADE IN QOA'S
AUDIT OF NPt.*4 PLEASE NOTE THE LATEST AUDIT REPORTS WHIOH NOW
IONTAIN MORE EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSES AND DATA`' FOR INFO, EFFECTIVE

11) PARA-'.m 5.'01 - THE MERALCO PLANTS WERE SOLD BY MERALCO TO THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE LATTER TURNED THEM OVER TO NPt TO OPERATEi
NPC BOARD AtTION WAS IN PURSUANCE OF THIS ACTION'. THIS WAS
DONE TO ARREST DETERIORATING ELECTRICITY SERVIeE IN MANILA AND
PROVIDE THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
TO REDUGE RELIANOE ON IMPORTED OIL'1
12) PARA.o 6.405 - NEGATIVE FINANCIAL RETURN WAS DUE LARGELY TO
EXTREMLY LARGE INCREASES IN FUEL COST AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT.
THE LAST SENTENCE SEEMS TO CONTRADICT THIS BY ATTRIBUTING IT
TO NPQ TARIFF POLICIES"it SUGGEST THIS SENTENCE BE OMITTED AS IT
SOUNDS MORE L-IKE AN EDITORIAL COMMENT'*'
13) PARA'.i 7.'02 - LAST SENTENeE OF THIS PARAGRAPH WHICH QUESTIONS
EFFICAeY OF RETIRING OIL-FIRED POWER PLANTS AND REPLAOING THEM
WITH GEOTHERMAL OR COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS DOES NOT SEEM TO
BELONG IN THIS PARAGRAPH OR THIS REPORT OONSIDERING THAT NO
MENTION OF THIS HAS BEEN MADE PREVIOUSLY TO LAY THE BASIS OF
MAKING SUCH A 09N#LUSION.* SUGGEST THIS BE DELETEDj HOWEVER FOR
THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, MAY WE REFER YOU TO THE QONCLUSIQN OF
THE BANK'S SPECIAL TASK FORCE HEADED BY MRP O'BRIEN AND
BALDWIN WHO STUDIED PRECISELY THIS ISSUE4 NOTE THAT THEIR
