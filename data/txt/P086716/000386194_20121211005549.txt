I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1. Country context. At the time of Project appraisal, Nigeria ranked low on the human
development scale of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). With a population of
133 million people and an annual population growth rate of 2.6 percent, it was the most populous
country in Africa (Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Second Rural Access and Mobility
Project (RAMP-2), p. 24). About 67 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, and
the majority of the 80-90 million Nigerians in dire economic conditions lived in rural areas. In
2002, the country ranked 151 out 177 countries on the Human Poverty Index (HPI). In 2004, at a
per capita income of US$320 per year, Nigeria experienced one of the lowest per capita Gross
Domestic Products (GDP) in the world (PAD, p. 24), despite the fact that Nigeria was the second
largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (after South Africa). While Nigeria’s per capita GDP
increased to low middle-income country level at about US$1,541 in 2011 as a result of the
positive economic performance over the past decade, its Human Development Index remained
low at 156 out of 187 countries. Nigeria is currently behind its target to meet most of its MDGs,
including halving poverty to 31 percent by 2015, given that the poverty rate was 54 percent in
2008) (PAD, RAMP-2).

2. Overdependence on the oil sector. In Nigeria, overdependence on oil-driven growth had
constrained pro-poor growth since the mid-1970s. While oil export earnings had increased to
about US$300 billion between the 1970s and Project appraisal in 2004, Nigeria’s per capita
income had dropped by 20 percent between 1975-2004 (Sustainable Management of Mineral
Resources Project (SMMRP) PAD, p. 1). In addition, macroeconomic mismanagement, weak
governance and corruption, a hostile business environment, and social conflict and insecurity
contributed to the decline of the non-oil part of the economy and the persistence of poverty within
Nigeria (PAD, p. 24). The macroeconomic instability had disproportionately impacted the poor,
given that opportunities for rural populations to improve their livelihood declined as export
agriculture contracted, productivity of subsistence agriculture weakened, and non-farm income
generating activities became limited. Achieving pro-poor growth and attaining the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) thus required a special focus on rural poverty, as well as significant
growth and productivity gains outside of the oil sector (PAD, RAMP-2).

3. Sector background. Organized mining in Nigeria began around 1903, and until the 1960s
coal and tin were extracted and exported on a large scale (PAD, p. 2). However, with the
emergence of the petroleum industry about forty years ago, the Government shifted its attention
away from the mining sector. The sector’s decline, which was exacerbated by macroeconomic
and socio-economic instability and poor management of state-owned enterprises led to a large-
scale withdrawal of foreign investments in the sector. Existing mining operations declined, and
new investment, in particular by foreign mining companies was constrained by the “absence of a
comprehensive geological survey, the lack of adequate proven deposits, an unfavorable fiscal
regime, and an uncompetitive legal and fiscal regulatory framework? (PAD, p. 25). At the time
of appraisal, despite its substantial and widespread mineral endowment, Nigeria gained about 0.4
percent of its export earnings from solid minerals, compared to more than 20 percent in Namibia,
Botswana and Zambia, and more than 50 percent of export earnings were generated in the
Democratic of Congo (Eyre, 2007).

4. Industry structure. At the time of Project appraisal, there were no medium- or large-scale
mining operations in Nigeria. Active mining in the country was primarily carried out by small
entrepreneurs and artisans, working deposits of precious, semi-precious stones, construction and
industrial minerals. 1 Typically, these miners were not licensed or operating outside of the
parameters of the licenses they held (PAD, p. 2). Government estimates available at the time of
appraisal suggested that as many as 500,000 households (potentially 2-4 million people)
depended directly or indirectly on informal mining for their sustenance. Common problems
associated with informal Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) 2 operations included: (i)
environmental degradation; (ii) social problems, including child labor and poor working
conditions; (iii) national security risk due to migrations of cross-border labor; (iv) low
productivity and waste of minerals due to inefficient mining methods; (v) poor health and safety
conditions; (iv) high level of smuggling and loss of Government revenue? (PAD, p. 25). Given
that mining was the only cash-generating activity for subsistence farmers it represented the most
immediate and promising means of poverty alleviation for rural communities (PAD, p. 2).

5. Sector Reforms. In 2002, in order to correct the poor performance of the mining sector, the
Government constituted a Committee under the auspices of the Ministry of Solid Minerals
Development 3 to draft a reform strategy for the sector. The Committee published a seven-year
strategic action plan to outline the framework for renewal and growth for the sector. Nigeria’s
agenda for the development of the solid minerals sector, considered one of six priority sectors
crucial for economic diversification away from oil dependence was outlined in the 2003-2007
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) (NPC, 2004). The
NEEDS pursued the dual aims of fostering the development of a modern, private sector driven
solid minerals sector (and thus the exploration of base metals and precious and semi-precious
stones) as well as formalizing the ASM sector (NPC, 2004, p. 79). To this end, at the time of
appraisal, the Government had embarked on several key sector reforms: (i) the Ministry of Mines
and Steel Development (MMSD) had begun to draft a new Mining Code and competitive fiscal
regime to attract new private sector investment; 4 and (ii) it had prioritized the integration of
artisanal and small-scale mining into the formal economy, as part of its broader poverty reduction
and rural economic renewal program.

6. Rationale for Bank assistance. The Project was the first Bank-funded mining project in
Africa following the World Bank Group’s Management Response to the July 2001 Extractive

  A variety of minerals occur across Nigeria, with different types of mineral deposits clustered in different
parts of the country. The main Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM) mining areas include: PlateauState
for tin and columbite; Niger, Zamfara, Kebbi and Kaduna States for gold; Benue and Cross River States for
barites, Gombe and Yobe States for gypsum, and Oyo; Plateau and Kaduna States for gemstones; and Cross
River, Ogun and Benue States for limestone for us in the manufacturing of cement (PMU).

  According to the 2007 Minerals Act, Artisanal Mining refers to mining operations that utilize non-
mechanized methods of reconnaissance, exploration, extraction and processing of mineral resources within
a small-scale mining lease area. Small-scale mining refers to artisanal, alluvial and other forms of mining
operations involving the use of low level technology or methods not requiring substantial expenditure for
the conduct of mining operations within small-scale lease areas (MMSD, 2007).
3
  In 2007, the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development (MSMD) was restructured and renamed Ministry of
Mines and Steel Development (MMSD). Designated departments were created for: (i) Mines Inspection,
(ii) Artisanal and Small-scale Mining, (iii) Mining Environmental Compliance, and (iv) Legal Advisor. In
the remainder of this ICR, this Ministry will be referred to by its new name or acronym.
4
  MSMD had also initiated work on an airborne geophysical survey, which was to cover about 35 percent
of the country’s land area of interest (PAD, p. 1).

Industries Review (EIR), 5 which affirmed the Bank’s legitimate role in the mining sector
provided these interventions allowed extractive industries to contribute to poverty alleviation
through sustainable development (PAD, p. 3). The Bank’s Management’s response further
emphasized the need for selectivity in the Bank Group’s involvement in the extractive industries,
and for greater focus on the needs of the poor, and increased focus on governance and
transparency, as well as environmentally and socially sustainable development. These “rules of
engagement? were fully embraced by the Project’s focus on ASM activities as well as its intent to
establish a rule-based system for the administration of mining rights as well as enforce the
industry’s compliance with sustainable development guidelines (PAD, p. 3). To this end, the
Project was the first attempt to adopt a new governance centered approach to mining sector
development, which provided valuable lessons learnt for other projects that followed.

7. The Project responded to all three strategic goals outlined in the World Bank Group’s 2004
Joint Interim Strategy (JIS) for Nigeria: (i) improvement of economic governance; (ii) creation of
the conditions for rapid private-sector led, poverty-reducing growth; and (iii) enablement of local
communities to take charge of their own development (World Bank, 2003). The Project further
aimed to support the JIS’s goal to assist the Government, and the Bureau of Public Enterprises
(BPE) in particular, in advancing the privatization of the Nigerian Mining Corporation (NMC)
and the National Coal Corporation (NCC), in accordance with the 1999 Privatisation and
Commercialisation Act. The Project was also fully aligned with the main themes of the Bank’s
2005-2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Nigeria, which was completed one year after
the Project became effective. 6

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8. Project Development Objectives. The Project Development Objectives (PDO) as stated in the
PAD Results Framework (PAD, p. 30) and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), were to:
“(i) improve governance and technical capacity in the solid minerals sector to enable the
Government to manage Nigeria’s mineral resources in a sustainable way; and (ii) establish a basis
for poverty reduction and rural economic renewal in selected areas of the country 7 via the
development of non-farm income generating opportunities through small-scale and artisanal
mining and to diversify away from oil sources of income.? The PDO statement followed
standards applied to World Bank financed projects at the time of project preparation, which were
focused on broader economic Project outcomes.

9. Part (i) of the wording of the PDO stated in the main text of the PAD differs slightly from
that in the Results framework and the DCA, given that it aims to “increase the Government’s
long-term institutional and technical capacity to manage Nigeria’s mineral resources in a


5
  The Extractive Industries Review entailed an independent stakeholder review process which produced a
number of recommendations, to which a Bank Group’s Management response was prepared (World Bank,
2004).
6
  The CAS was developed on the basis of the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, i.e. the National
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), which aimed to reduce poverty, create
wealth and human development through reforms and initiatives in three key areas: (i) overhauling the way
government works; (ii) growing the non-oil private sector; and (iii) implementing a social charter to
achieve improvement in human development. Under the NEEDS the government planned to vigorously
promote the exploration and exploitation of solid minerals to provide inputs for local industries as well as
for exports (NPC, 2004).
7
  The only minor difference in wording between the PDO in the PAD’s Results Framework and the one in
the DCA is that the latter refers to the “territory of the Borrower? instead of “the country.?


                                                      3
sustainable way? (PAD, p.5). The wording in Part (i) of the PDO in the Results Framework of the
PAD and the DCA is more explicit as it refers to “governance and technical capacity? instead of
“long-term institutional and technical capacity“. The former more appropriately reflects the
Project’s focus on the socio-political, economic and institutional dimensions of governance.8 Part
(ii) of the PDO is essentially identical in all three references. Given the legal status of the DCA
as an official document signed between IDA and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and the
relatively minor difference in the wording, the assessment of the Project’s performance in this
ICR will be based on the DCA version of the PDO.

10. Key Performance Indicators. A total of fourteen Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were
listed in the Results Framework of the PAD (see left column of Table 1 below). The indicators in
the PAD’s Results Framework and those in the DCA were rather similar, and the DCA included
additional indicators to measure the increase in solid minerals production and new private
investment, and to track to what extent sustainable environmental practices were “functional in
artisanal and small-scale mining communities, as measured by environmental impact assessments
in all pilot areas? (DCA, Schedule 5, p. 35). The DCA further included two different sets
indicators, which were to be monitored: (i) after Year 1, and (ii) at Midterm Review and Project
completion. The assessment of the Project’s achievements in this ICR will be based on the Project
completion indicators in the DCA, which are listed in the right column in Table 1 below, given
that they: (i) do not differ significantly in substance from the ones in the PAD; (ii) are the legally
binding indicators; and (iii) were tracked particularly during the later stages of Project
implementation.

  The World Governance Indicator (WGI) Project reports aggregate and individual governance indicators
for six dimensions of governance: (i) voice and accountability; (ii) political stability and absence of
violence; (iii) government effectiveness; (iv) regulatory quality; (v) rule of law; and (vi) control of
corruption (World Governance Indicators, 2012).

  The indictors in the DCA were numbered but not categorized as PDO and Intermediate Outcome
indicators. However, they were divided into PDO and Intermediate Outcome indicators as shown in the
right column of Table 1 during Project implementation. PDO and Indicators followed standards applied by
the World Bank financed project at that time.

1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

11. The PDOs and the Key Performance Indicators were not revised. However, it was noted that
the Performance Indicators were to be updated in accordance with the new format for project
result frameworks, which was adopted after the Project became effective and to be aligned with
the indicators that were used in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), which followed the
new standards. This update was expected to be done concurrently with the Additional Financing.
However, since the Bank dropped the proposed Additional Financing in May 2011, and since by
that time the more than 90 percent of the Credit proceeds had been disbursed, the indicators were
left unchanged.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

12. The Project’s direct beneficiaries included:
    • 200,000 artisanal and small-scale miners whose employment was to be formalized and
       whose capacity to manage the environmental, health, and social impacts of their own
       extractive activities was expected to improve; and another 300,000 people working in the
       supply of goods and ancillary services to the 200,000 ASM operators (PAD, p. 73); and
    • The Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (MMSD) and its delegated authorizing
       agencies such as the Geological Survey of Nigeria Agency10 and the National Institute of
       Mining and Geology (NIMG) which were to benefit from improved institutional and
       regulatory capacity, which was needed in order to deliver services to private investors
       and artisanal miners in accordance with the proposed theme of the new proposed
       Minerals Act.

13. The project’s indirect potential beneficiaries included:
    • About two million people living in mining communities, including disadvantaged
       population groups, who were to benefit from the expansion and creation of economic
       opportunities;
    • The people of Nigeria, who were envisaged to benefit from a more robust economic
       position resulting from the removal of potential impediments to new private investments
       in the mining sector; and
    • Private investors.

14. These primary target groups were not revised.

1.5. Original Components (as approved)

15. The Project objectives were to be supported by four components (see Table 2 below): (i)
economic development and livelihood diversification in Artisanal and Small-scale mining (ASM)
areas; (ii) strengthening governance and transparency in mining; (iii) private sector development;
and (iv) Project coordination and management. Components 1 to 3 were to address the industry’s
key constraints concurrently from three different angles, while Component 4 supported the
attainment of the PDO indirectly by orchestrating Project activities to be undertaken under
Components 1, 2 and 3.




10
  The Geological Survey of Nigeria Agency’s (GSNA) name was later changed to the Nigerian Geological
Survey Agency (NGSA).


                                                 6
•   Component 1: Economic development and livelihood diversification in Artisanal and Small
    scale-mining Areas (US$48.9 million at appraisal). In support of Part (ii) of the PDO,
    Component 1 was to empower artisanal and small-scale miners to increase the extraction and
    production of solid minerals in an environmentally and socially sustainable way. Key
    activities to be undertaken under this Component included: (i) analytical work to characterize
    the nature and extent of small-scale mining and associated socio-economic, community,
    gender and health aspects; (ii) community-driven pilot projects aimed to improve technical,
    environmental and social conditions of small-scale mining operations; (iii) rehabilitation and
    resuscitation of the Jos School of Mines located in Nigeria’s Plateau zone; (iv) creation of a
    Small Scale Mining Unit at the Federal level with ASM satellite field offices; (v) improved
    access to credit and financing in particular for medium and small-scale mining operations;
    (vi) support for mining-related private sector trade associations and professional interest
    groups; and (vii) the promotion of small-scale mining of specific commodities with emphasis
    on important substitution and sector development (PAD, p. 6).

•   Component 2: Strengthening Governance and transparency in Mining (US$33.3 million at
    appraisal). In support of Part (ii) of the PDO, Component 2 sought to address governance and
    transparency issues, notably an unfavorable fiscal regime and an uncompetitive legal and
    fiscal regulatory framework that had previously deterred private investments (see paragraph
    3). Nigeria’s attractiveness to private investors in mining was to be enhanced through the
    following activities: (i) revision and modernization of the legal and fiscal frameworks for
    mining; (ii) strengthening of public mining institutions to provide for transparent
    management of the sector; (iii) development of a computerized registry and mining Cadastre
    system in accordance in accordance with international best practice; and (iv) development of
    good environmental and social management practices within the mining sector (PAD, p. 8).

•   Component 3: Private Sector Development (US$26.1 million at appraisal). Component 3
    sought to support Part (i) of the PDO by addressing a key constraint to the development of the
    mining sector, i.e. the absence of a comprehensive geological survey and the lack of adequate
    proven deposits (see paragraph 3). This was largely to be achieved through the following
    Project activities: (i) restructuring of the State-owned mining corporations (NMC and NCC –
    see paragraph 6); and (ii) undertaking geophysical, geological mapping, and mineral
    assessments, as well as compiling and completing a large number of maps prepared by GSNA.
    The resulting geodata was to be made available to potential investors through a national solid
    minerals information system.

•   Component 4 – Project Coordination and Management (US$6.9 million at appraisal).
    Component 4 essentially represented the anticipated overhead costs for implementing the
    Project. These included the operating expenses of a Project Management Unit (PMU) within
    the MMSD, which was to coordinate and manage Project activities and functions, including
    procurement, monitoring and evaluation, financial management and record keeping, accounts
    and disbursement. The PCU was further responsible for coordinating Project activities with
    other stakeholders, i.e. other ministries and institutions at the Federal and State levels,
    stakeholders from the public and private sectors, and civil society (PAD, p. 8).

following activities were reduced in scope or cancelled altogether. Cost savings realized through
these reductions were used to cover cost overruns incurred under other components (see
paragraph 19).

    •        At the request of the Minister in 2005, it was agreed that the scope of the rehabilitation
             and resuscitation of the Jos School of Mines activity be expanded to upgrade the Jos
             School to the Nigerian Institute of Mining and Geosciences (AM, December 2005
             mission) which was to play the role of a Regional Center Excellence. The Project
             provided more support to the infrastructure of the NIMG.
    •        In 2005, the number of ASM pilot studies in support of the demonstration projects to be
             undertaken under Component 1 was reduced from six to two, with focus on barites and
             gypsum (AM, October 2005 mission). The two studies were completed, but
             implementation of the pilot demonstration projects was subsequently dropped. This
             decision was motivated by the notion that the methodology was too complex and not a
             cost effective use of credit proceeds (as expressed reportedly by the Minister of Mines
             and Steel Development at the time). These changes did not adversely affect the
             achievement of Part (i) of the PDO, as they were offset by higher allocation for small
             grant programs as well as the addition of activities aimed at fostering value added in the
             gemstone industry by establishing a lapidary school in Jos and providing training in
             dimension stone quarrying – all contributing to improved ASM value addition and
             improving ASM efficiency and productivity following good standards.



                                                        8
     •   The number of ASM field offices to be established under the Project was reduced from
         six to two in Ogoja (barites) and Nafada (gypsum) to meet the demands of artisanal and
         small-scale miners in the areas where the demonstration pilot projects were to be
         implemented (AM, October 2005 mission). Activities aimed to improve access to credit
         and financing in the mining sector, especially for mid-tier and small scale miners, were
         intentionally postponed by the Project to await the completion of the small grants
         program to provide lessons learnt. (Draft PP for AF, 2011). This sub-component was
         envisaged to be implemented under the proposed Additional Financing Credit, which did
         not materialize due to the Bank’s new selectivity criteria for lending in Nigeria (see
         paragraph 20)
     •   The privatization of state-owned mining enterprises was carried out solely with
         government funding 11 (Draft PP for AF, 2011);
     •   The development of a National Solid Minerals Information System was postponed until
         the acquisition and organization of geodata was completed and could be linked to the
         database (preparatory work for this sub-component was to be completed under the
         original financing, but implementation was to be funded under the proposed Additional
         Financing (Draft PP for AF, 2011).

18. Changes in Implementation Schedule. The Project was approved by the World Bank’s
Board of Directors on December 14, 2004 and became effective on April 25, 2005. The Project
was originally scheduled to close on June 30, 2010. However, due to implementation delays (see
paragraphs 33 and 34) that were actively addressed jointly by the Bank and the client but which
had caused a 21-month disbursement lag by December 2008, the Midterm Review (MTR)
mission recommended that an extension of the closing date be requested. This conclusion was
endorsed during the review of the Project by the Bank’s Quality Assessment of the Lending
Portfolio (QALP) exercise, which took place in October 2008. A 23-month extension until May
30, 2012 was subsequently requested and granted on November 24, 2009. The Project closed on
May 30, 2012.

19. Changes in Funding Allocations. In 2008, the Government requested a reallocation
pertaining to about US$65 million of undisbursed and uncommitted Credit proceeds, in order to
raise the amounts in certain categories to enable the Project to accomplish its intended objectives
(ISR No.8, December 2008). Several disbursement categories of the project, such as works, were
overdrawn, while others remained underutilized, such as consultancies, due to the cancellation of
the envisaged pilot projects and a reduction in the number of studies to be undertaken under the
Project. A first reallocation was approved on December 5, 2008. Following a formal request by
the Government, a second reallocation of Credit proceeds was approved by the Bank’s Vice
President for the Africa Region on November 24, 2009, along with the above-mentioned
extension of the closing date. A third reallocation of funds was requested and approved shortly
before closing, on May 8, 2012, “to prepare the credit for closing and to allow the recipient to
utilize all credit proceeds within the agreed work program? (Restructuring Cover Memo). This
last reallocation shortly before the closing date solely represented a “cleanup? effort to advance
disbursements under overdrawn categories (AM, April/May 2012 mission).



11
  There was no formal assessment of the privatization of these SOEs. While the Project could have
potentially helped to improve outcome of the privatization (the companies privatized remained
nonperforming), given high sensitivity and political issues around the privatizations, the Government took
the lead and full responsibility for this sub-component, thus freeing up the earmarked credit funds for other
activities.


                                                      9
20. The reasons for the overutilization of certain disbursement categories included: (i)
underestimation of the cost of the airborne geophysics surveys, whose actual contract value
amounted to about US$23.5 million versus the budgeted amount of US$10 million due to a sharp
increase in commodity and fuel prices associated with the global mining boom (the estimate was
based on per line-kilometer cost at the time of appraisal; the sharp increase in cost of surveying
resulting from the commodity boom affected all surveying projects globally and was not Nigeria
a specific issue); (ii) the addition of civil works, based on the incumbent Minister’s directives, for
the rehabilitation of MMSD headquarters in Abuja and regional office in Jos; (iii) increased
funding requirements as a result of the decision to upgrade of the Jos School of Mining to the
Nigerian Institute for Mining and Geoscience (NIMG); and (iv) the allocation of additional
funding to promotional activities, training/workshops and operating costs in recognition of the
strategic importance of the activities to the Project’s achievement of its objectives.

21. While amount wise the changes were significant, on balance, they did not have negative
impact on the achievement of the PDO and were made based on the business needs revealed
during Project implementation. The large size of the credit and flexibility of the design, combined
with dropping of some of the activities, allowed such decision to be made on as needed basis. It
was noted that the Government had expressed interest in obtaining additional financing to finance
some of the cost overruns and expand the scale of ASM support, enhance capacity building and
institutional strengthening, expand activities carried out by the NGSA, and conduct additional
work related to the seven strategic minerals (ISR No. 9, June 2009). While preparatory work for
an additional IDA credit was completed in February 2011, the World Bank withdrew the
proposed Additional Financing in May 2011 due to the Bank’s selectivity criteria, which
determine the sectors that can be supported by the Bank at the same time (AM, August 2011
mission).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
22. Soundness of background analysis. Project preparation took place between November 2003
(Project Concept Note Review) and November 2004 (appraisal). For the most part, the prevailing
conditions were correctly diagnosed during Project preparation, in particular regulatory and
governance factors that constrained the growth of the minerals sector and that adversely affected
the environment, social fabrics and the health of miners and their families (PAD, pp. 24f.). The
Project assessed the geological potential and sector development needs based on the existing data,
such as past mining operations and geological data available at that time, global trends, and
prevailing conditions in Nigeria. To comply with the safeguards’ requirements, the project
prepared a Mining Sector Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) (Wardell Armstrong,
2005), which characterized Nigeria’s mining sector and its mining potential, and appropriately
identified key environmental and social management issues, notably institutional shortcomings in
the implementation of environmental regulations, monitoring, and the evaluation of socio-
economic impacts of mining projects.

23. It further provided specific recommendations for remedying these deficiencies such as: (i)
setting up and capacity building of an environmental management unit at the Mines Department
in collaboration with the EIA division of the Federal Ministry of Environment for the review and
approval of EIAs; (ii) setting up of an Environmental Management and Information System
(EMIS); and (iii) completion of Environmental and social baseline studies of selected mining
areas (Wardell Armstrong, 2005, p. 21f.). As a precautionary measure, a Resettlement Policy and




                                                 10
Process Framework (RPF) and a Process Framework (PF) were prepared to identify alternative
sources of income in the event of displacement of small-scale miners.

24. Incorporation of lessons learned. According to the PAD (p. 9), Project design adequately
incorporated lessons learned from Bank-supported community development as well as micro,
small and medium enterprise projects that were operational in Nigeria at the time of appraisal.12
It also reflected lessons learned from ongoing similar capacity building operations for mineral
sector technical assistance projects in other countries in the Africa region.13 Furthermore, findings
from the World Bank’s Management Response to the Extractive Industries Review (EIR), the
World Bank/DFID global Communities and Small Scale Mining initiative (CASM), and Bank
supported small-scale mining projects in Mozambique and Madagascar were taken into
consideration. In addition, Project design incorporated previous policy level experience with
project implementation, which had highlighted the importance of “involving Government
counterparts at an early stage of project preparation [as] an important factor in future project
success? (PAD, p. 9). Accordingly, officials from the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development,
Ministry of Finance, the (Federal) Ministry of Environment, the National Assembly, the Office of
the President as well as representatives of the private sector, civil society and non-governmental
organizations had been consulted at various stages of Project preparation (PAD, pp. 9f.). It was
noted that the SMMRP was the first project following the Extractive Industries Review and as
such became a valuable source of lessons learnt for future projects itself.

25. Assessment of Project objectives, design and components. The PDO was highly relevant at
the time of appraisal, as evidenced by the fact that the mining sector was fully aligned with all
three pillars (see paragraph 6) of the World Bank’s 2004 Joint Interim Strategy for country
assistance and the three poles (see paragraph 6) of the Government’s 2003-2007 National
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). The PDO’s continued relevance
was confirmed during the MTR. The focus on improving the technical capacity under Part (i) of
the PDO was appropriate, given that strengthening the capacity of key institutions was a
prerequisite to the effective enforcement of legislation and regulations and sound management of
the minerals sector. Regarding Part (ii) of the PDO, it is commendable that it aimed to create a
basis for poverty reduction rather than the, at the time, customary higher level objective of
poverty alleviation, even though the concepts of “basis for poverty reduction? and “rural
economic renewal? could have been more clearly defined to make them more readily measurable,
and there could have been some qualification as to which extent the Project could be held
accountable for achievement (or not) of this part of the PDO. The PDO, as noted, was designed
following standards at the time of appraisal and was in compliance with those.

26. Project design was consistent with the Project’s stated objectives. While the PAD did not
specify a particular theory of change upon which Project design was based, it is commendable
that it implicitly embraced the World Bank’s – at the time of appraisal – novel value chain
approach for supporting extractive industries. The value chain approach, which marked the
evolution from the historic emphasis on “merely? increasing investment to promoting sustainable
development (McMahon, 2010) posits that sustainable sector development requires the following
interlinked elements: (i) confidence-instilling mineral legislation and award of licenses; (ii) a


12
   Annex 2 of the PAD (pp. 28f.) contained a thorough review of potential linkages of the SMMR with
contemporary projects, such as the FADAMA 2 (an irrigation project), Community-Based Urban
Development Project (CBUDP), Local Empowerment and Economic Management Project (LEEMP).
13
   These included Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Tanzania
(PAD, p. 9).


                                                 11
clear regulatory framework and adequate capacity for monitoring and enforcement; (iii)
transparent and efficient collection of taxes and royalties; (iv) efficient management and
allocation of fiscal revenues; and (v) the sector contributing to sustainable socio-economic
development (McMahon, 2010).

27. Implementation arrangements. Implementation arrangements were appropriately designed.
The Project was to be housed in the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, and a Project
Management Unit (PMU), comprised of a combination of Ministry staff and consultants, was
responsible for the day-to-day management of Project implementation. The Project relied on the
Project Steering Committee at the Ministry level, which comprised director generals and heads of
the departments and agencies affected by the Project. The Steering Committee was tasked with
higher-level decisions and oversight of implementation. The records indicate that the PSC
meetings were well attended and steered project related decision-making.

28. While it was preferable for the PMU to be staffed by permanent public sector officers rather
than consultants who were likely to leave the PMU after the closing date (and jeopardizing
sustainability and continuity of the “institutional infrastructure? created under the Project), the
unequal pay scales for public sector staff and individual consultants have been the cause of
discontent and conflict among PMU members in the case of similar Projects elsewhere. In order
to harmonize the two payment scales, the Government supported the payment of “salary top ups?
to public sector staff employed by the PMU through Government’s counterpart funding (ISR No.
3, April 2006).

29. The PMU was generally responsible for the procurement of all goods, services, and works
under the Project. However, in the case of the envisaged pilot projects (which did not materialize),
procurement was to be undertaken by local Mining Community Associations, i.e. local
implementation committees, and funds were to be disbursed directly to these entities (PAD, p.12).
In regards to the small grants program on the ground, the PMU engaged local NGOs and
provincial departments to carry out outreach, dissemination of information and supervision of
grant utilization.

30. Adequacy of Government commitment. At the time of appraisal, the Government’s
commitment was inferred from its preparation of a new Minerals Act to replace the 1999
Minerals and Mining Decree, which was considered inadequate in terms of improving Nigeria’s
investment climate (PAD, p. 3). This action indicated a clear commitment of the Government
during Project design and preparation to implement the strategic action plan of the NEEDS
Agenda related to the solid minerals sector reform (see paragraph 6 and 29). The Project
objectives, components and activities were designed to contribute to the government’s objectives.

31. Stakeholder involvement and participatory process. Recognizing the need to involve
Government counterparts as well as other stakeholders in all stages of project preparation Project
preparation appropriately entailed a comprehensive consultative process and workshops – much
in line with the Government’s own regulations for consultations – on the topics of small-scale
mining, fiscal reform, and legal and regulatory issues, which culminated in “the formulation of
project development objectives, a comprehensive Mining Code, and the piloting of ASM projects?
(PAD, p. 10). About 700 stakeholders comprised of “individuals from the private sector, (Federal
and State) Government, NGOs and civil society, participated in this National Policy Dialogue.
Furthermore, according to the PAD, the Project was expected to select pilot sites through public
consultation (PAD, p 10), but since this activity was dropped, the consultations on this particular
issue were no longer relevant. For small grants purposes, there was no selection of sites per se –
the entire country was eligible – but the Project successfully involved elements of public outreach


                                                12
and information dissemination in each mining district to ensure that communities and miners
were aware of the opportunities.

32. The outreach was conducted through local NGOs under contract with the project, regional
ASM officers and extension officers, as well as the PMU staff as appropriate. Primary
stakeholders likely to be disadvantaged by a project activity, “due to an unavoidable loss of
access to resources upon which their livelihoods depends? (PAD, p. 19) were to be identified
through a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) in accordance with the Project’s Resettlement
Policy Framework and Process Frameworks (RPF and PF) and to be involved in the design and
implementation of compensatory measures. Since the project did not cause any involuntary
resettlement, these provisions of the RPF and PF remained a recommendation and did not apply.
The Project files retain appropriate documentation and proof of land transfers and acquisition
documenting that there was no negative loss of land or access because of Project activities.

33. Assessment of Risks. Overall, the list of identified risks was comprehensive and the risk
ratings appropriate. In light of the Bank’s experience with similar operations elsewhere (while the
ICR notes that the Project was to test a new approach and as such had to rely on its own
judgment), the High risk rating associated with the risk of insufficient knowledge and experience
with IDA’s procurement procedures was prudent (and the mitigation measures proved to be
appropriate), as was the high risk rating associated with the complexity of the ASM component.
Two risks were not identified at the time of appraisal, but were perhaps less unique given the
nature of the government service: (i) the risk of implementation delays caused by the high
turnover in high-level Ministry officials, given that during the 7-year life of the Project, eight
Ministers and nine Permanent Secretaries had held appointments at the MMSD (PMU, 2012, p. 3)
and by bureaucratic delays; and (ii) security-related risks particularly in the Northern parts of the
country, given that Jos (location of a large regional office of MMSD, the National Institute of
Mining and Geosciences (NIMG), the gem stone / lapidary school, and ASM community center),
Kaduna (location of the National Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) laboratory and center for
dimension stone cutting) and some of the ASM areas were strongly affected by religious and
sectarian violence and rioting in 2010 and 2011. These risks were beyond the control of the
Project, and the Bank’s supervision team and the PMU diligently and candidly addressed, to the
extent possible, these unforeseen risks during the regularly conducted supervision missions.

2.2. Implementation

34. Extension of Closing Date. In order to ensure sufficient time for the completion of Project
activities, which had been delayed by the frequent ministerial changes, the Midterm Review
(MTR) mission as well as a review by the Bank’s Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio
(QALP) recommended an extension of the closing date. In November 2009, a 23-month
extension until May 30, 2012 was granted. The Project closed on May 30, 2012. It was noted that
while a seven-year implementation period appears to be on a high end and is two years longer
than the originally anticipated implementation period, this is a relatively standard actual
implementation period for mining (and many other) technical assistance projects. In fact, the
Project disbursement rate (US$120 million over seven years) was much higher than that of other
SIL/TAL operations.

35. Temporary Disruption of Project implementation. For a brief four- to six-month period
during the second year of implementation the Project experienced a temporary setback due to
political interference. While the Project had made satisfactory progress related to the promotion
of large-scale mining investment in Nigeria (Components 2 and 3), it had temporarily been
unable to focus on poverty-reducing activities, such as the small grants program under


                                                 13
Component 1, which accounted for about eight percent of total estimated Project baseline cost at
appraisal (AM, March/April 2007 mission). In order to remedy the situation, in March/April 2007,
the Bank’s task teams and the PMU promptly agreed on an Action Plan to improve project
progress and performance. As observed during the subsequent mission the Government had made
substantial progress towards rectifying14 the shortcomings previously observed, thus putting the
Project back on track towards achieving its development objectives (AM July/August 2007
mission).

36. Midterm Review. In view of the above-mentioned temporary implementation challenges
particularly in regards to ASM-related activities in the first years, the Mid-term Review (MTR)
was postponed from November 2007 until May 2008 to allow the Project time to reach its mid
point to make the review more relevant. The main recommendations identified during the MTR
included the need to:
    • formally revise the disbursement projections since the project had a disbursement lag of
        20 months;
    • discuss with the counterparts how activities related to EITI++ agenda could be covered
        under the project;
    • develop actions to improve and upgrade the Moderately Satisfactory rating for M&E,
        procurement and counterpart funding (ISR No. 7, April 2008);
    • recruit external and internal support to address capacity deficiencies in the PMU and the
        Ministry’s ASM department;
    • consider replacing the pilot demonstration projects with more practical and cost-effective
        measures aimed at promoting value added in the ASM sub-sector, in particular with
        regard to strategic minerals, such as gemstones and dimension stones (see paragraph 16);
    • consider requesting an extension of the closing date to accommodate the slower than
        expected implementation of Component 1 activities at the beginning of the Project.

37. The Project was also randomly selected for a review as part of the Bank’s Quality
Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP) exercise in October 2008; it found “no significant
issues or weaknesses? but emphasized the necessity of an extension? (AM, October 2008
mission). The final (QALP) report appropriately “gave a satisfactory rating only noting the delay
in implementing the ASM component which is now underway? (ISR No. 9, December 2008).

38. Implementation arrangements. Upon the successful implementation of the above-mentioned
Action Plan, the Project promptly resumed the implementation of the ASM component in March
2007. In order to ensure a swift implementation pace during the remainder of the Project’s
lifetime, it was recommended that external and internal support be recruited 15 to enhance the
capacity in the PMU and the MMSD’s ASM department. While the pilot activities, which had
envisaged CDD-type implementation arrangements involving direct involvement of and
disbursements to Mining Communities, did not materialize, the CDD-approach was embraced by
the small grants program. Procurement under small grants was done by recipients and
subsequently inspected by the PMU and assigned NGOs. The arrangement worked well with the
vast majority of small grants, which were carried out in accordance with the agreed schedules and
plans. However the cost of supervision was perhaps on a high side due to the multiple layers


14
   For example, the Project Consultative Committee, which had been suspended for more than a year met in
March 2007 and approved the 2007 budget (AM, March 2007 mission).
15
   These included external consultants, such as an M&E consultant, the National Coordinator for the small
grants program, and extension officers to facilitate capacity building for ASM operators, and experts in
information technology, procurement, financial management, and geophysics.


                                                   14
involved. To some extent the higher cost of supervision of this community driven development
(CDD) program can be justified by the need to test this innovative approach, which was to be
used in similar projects, to better understand the risks involved, and to ensure demonstration
effects on other ASM operations.

39. Project Risk status. Throughout its lifetime, the Project carried a country record and a
country environment flag. The Project risk status did not reflect the security risk (as mentioned
earlier in this section) as warranted.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

40. M&E Framework Design. While the M&E system for the Project had deficiencies as
mentioned in paragraph below, the majority of the performance indicators in the PAD and the
DCA included end of Project target values as well as baseline values, although the latter mostly
equaled zero, since “most of the available information about the social, economic, and
technological character of artisanal and small-scale mining in Nigeria, as well as its scope and
extent, was anecdotal in nature (PAD, p. 31), including the estimated value of Nigeria’s minerals
production (PAD, p. 73). At the end of the project, the volume of mineral production was
estimated based on royalties collected. To measure poverty alleviation results, an extensive
program of socio-economic profiling and baseline assessments was to be undertaken during the
first year of the project (PAD, p. 41). However, with reduction of pilot areas to two (as
mentioned in the earlier sections) and a delay in start of the ASM components in general, the
approach had to be revised later in the Project, which however still did not produce much reliable
socio-economic data due to deficiencies of methodology used by the consultants and insufficient
time to remedy the survey. In part compensating for this deficiency, the PMU was tracking
socio-economic data related to the Project grantees which indeed was correlated with the Project
(this data was used in the reporting of performance indicators) 16.

41. The performance indicators used in the DCA and PAD followed an older format which was
discontinued after the Project was launched. Due to the faults of earlier format, some of the
Project’s Intermediate Results indicators were de facto outcome indicators, and vice versa (i.e. the
offices staffed and equipped; number of associations formed and operational; and adoption of
regulation indicators) (ISR No. 13, December 2010). One of the main shortcomings of the M&E
framework was that it contained only one PDO and one Intermediate Results indicator pertaining
to Part (ii) of the PDO.

42. Despite these shortcomings, the individual indicators demonstrated an implicit connection to
the PDO, except for the “basis for rural economic renewal? aspect of Part (ii) of the PDO. The
Project was able to monitor the indicators through supervision missions (see section below,
paragraphs 43-44) and adjusted the Indicators to better fit with the newly adopted at that time
Implementation Status Report format. As mentioned in the earlier sections, the Performance
Indicators were expected to be amended to comply with the new requirements, but the amended
did not happen since the the proposed Additional Financing with which it was linked was not
supported in the end (as explained in paragraph 11 above).



16
  Going forward, the MMSD’s new M&E department which was formed between 2011-2012, will be in charge of
M&E data collection and analysis which will sufficiently improve MMSD’s reporting and analysis functions, but it will
require time to build its capacity and will come too late for the purpose of this Project evaluation.




                                                        15
M& E Framework Utilization

43. During the first five years of the Project’s lifetime, the supervision reports partially monitored
three out of five PDO indicators (ISR No. 10, October 2009). The full set of key performance
indicators, which contained a blend of PAD and DCA wording of indicators was tracked for the
first time in May 2010 (ISR No. 11). In order to intensify monitoring efforts, an M&E expert was
recruited in 2007 (AM, October 2007 mission) to “assist in establishing an appropriate system to
monitor and evaluate the performance of the project as well as preparing the necessary report on
the progress of the project as well as the mid-term review mid-term review? (AM, July/August
2007 mission). Of particular concern at the time was the measurement of the Project’s progress
towards achieving Part (ii) of the PDO, pertaining to poverty reduction and rural economic
renewal (ISR No. 14, October 2011).

44. The Task Team was urged to track the outcome indictor “[50 %] increase in per capita
income in pilot project areas, as measured by village income surveys which shall set the baseline,?
given that it represented the most directly related poverty reduction outcome indicator (ISR No.
15, May 2012). While baseline studies were completed for barites and gypsum, the socio-
economic profiling did not materialize as discussed in earlier sections of this ICR. However,
baseline and follow-up data has been collected diligently for the 245 small grants recipient
entities, and an evaluation of the short-term impact on a sample of 15 ASM cooperatives was
conducted in 2012. While these data are not statistically significant given the small sample and
short time period, it shows a positive trend and is accurate being based on actual reports. With
continued monitoring by the Government after the Project’s closure together with data from new
projects under Government financed programs, it will provide valuable information for measuring
results in the future.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45. Safeguard Compliance. The Project was categorized as an Environmental Category B
Project; it triggered safeguard policies OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and Involuntary
Resettlement (OP 4.12). 17 Throughout Project implementation, both environmental and social
safeguard compliance were complied with and consistently rated Satisfactory in supervision
reports, 18 and no major safeguards issues were observed during supervision missions. Compliance
with environmental and social safeguards was monitored by two Abuja-based Environmental and
Social Specialists on the Bank’s supervision team. With the Social Specialist’s relocation in 2010,
social safeguards oversight was transferred to a HQ-based Bank staff. On the PMU’s side, two
qualified Environmental and Social Specialists/Safeguards Officers trained in environmental and
social issues in mining projects as well as World Bank safeguard policies, carried out site visits at
least five times per year. In addition to the diligent monitoring of compliance with safeguards


17
   The Project’s intention was to avoid causing any resettlement or restricting access to the extent possible.
Potentially, resettlement or restriction of access could have occurred in conjunction with the
implementation of the originally planned six pilot projects, small grants program and civil works, but the
Project was able to avoid causing any resettlement.
18
   Three safeguard instruments were prepared and disclosed in 2005 for safeguarding Project activities
during Project implementation: a Sector Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA); a Resettlement
Framework; and a Process Framework. All three documents were updated and re-disclosed in 2011 prior to
the appraisal of the proposed Additional Financing credit (Draft PP for AF).


                                                     16
policies through regular supervision missions, a one-week environmental safeguard
implementation support mission was carried out in July 2010 (ISR No. 14, October 2011), and an
independent environmental and social safeguards audit was conducted in 2010.

46. A 2011 implementation support mission commended the PMU for their “exemplary effort? in
supervising the implementation of the small grants program, in accordance with the
recommendations of the previous year’s safeguards audit (AM, August 2011 mission). Several
minor safeguard concerns were observed during the July 2010 safeguards mission in relation to
the small-grants program, which were promptly addressed. While the mission noted the small
grants beneficiaries’ high level of awareness on occupational health issues (AM, July 2010
mission) it noticed that “some of the workers [did] not use ear musters and hand gloves,
reportedly because of cost and discomfort (AM, July 2010 mission). In addition, the 2010
safeguards mission revealed that some land acquisition documentation associated with
involuntary resettlement for several grants was missing in project files. By the subsequent
mission this shortcoming had been remedied (ISR No. 14, September 2011). Furthermore, in
2010, a social and environmental checklist was prepared and used as mandatory documentation
for small-grant applications (in case the check-list was triggered, adequate management plans
were to be developed).

47. Financial Management. All audits were unqualified, and no cases of misdemeanor or fraud
were uncovered in the Financial Management system. The Project’s Financial Management
performance was rated Satisfactory in supervision reports throughout the Project’s lifetime, with
the exception of two Moderately Satisfactory ratings at the beginning of implementation (ISRs
Nos. 1 and 2), for the following reasons: a 2006 Financial Management mission had pointed out
the need to upgrade the Project filing system and to pay the Project’s suppliers directly, rather
than through an intermediary (AM, March 2006 mission). Several remedial measures were taken
in due course: the record keeping was revamped; receipts retiring was managed in a proper
manner; and the Project no longer issued payments through intermediaries (AM, March 2006
mission). Secondly, deficiencies in the maintenance of the asset register were observed. Remedial
action was promptly taken in the form of the recommended embossment of fixed assets (AM,
October 2008 mission). The final supervision mission in May 2012 concluded that “the project
did not have any material financial management accountability and internal control issues “except
for NGN81.06 million, which was trapped in the defunct Hallmark bank for over two years? (ISR
No. 15, May 2012). As confirmed by the team’s financial management specialist and reflected in
the audit, these funds have since been released.

48. Procurement. During implementation, two-thirds of the Project’s procurement performance
ratings in supervision reports were mostly Satisfactory, and one-third of the ratings were
Moderately Satisfactory or, in one instance, Moderately Unsatisfactory. The latter was related to
the above-mentioned brief period of political interference, which was beyond the PMU’s control
and did not have any adverse impacts on the Project beyond this period. Several minor
shortcomings were observed primarily during the early stages of implementation when “a lack of
attention to detail in preparation of procurement documents and poor filing (AM, March 2007
mission) was noted. To address these concerns, an additional Procurement Consultant was
recruited in September 2006, and a filing procurement clerk was hired in April 2007 (AM March
2007 mission). As a result, procurement performance improved considerably after December
2006. A procurement review undertaken shortly before the Project closing date confirmed that all
procedures were followed. Procurement implementation was satisfactory except that the project
did not comply with the requirement for publication of NCB contract awards. This shortcoming
was remedied prior to the closing date (ISR, No. 15, May 2012). There were no cases of mis-
procurement under the Project.


                                               17
2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

49. The Government is committed to sustaining and expanding Project-funded investments, as
evidenced, for example, by the fact that it expressed its intent to maintain the PMU going forward
and progress made in setting up of the Solid Minerals Development Fund (SMDF) 19 to support
sector reforms. The continued development of the ASM sub-sector, as well as the continued
development of human and fiscal capacity, geoscientific data gathering, and the equipment of
mining institutions will be funded by the Solid Minerals Development Fund, as stipulated by the
2007 Minerals and Mining Act. With respect to the ASM sub-sector, the Government intends to
finance an expansion of the small grants program and providing support to mid-tier operators.
The Government has further raised the profile of the Mines Inspectorate Department, which is
mandated to monitor the activities of information miners, by setting up a high-level inter-
ministerial Task Force to ensure inter-agency cooperation in this matter. In addition to
Government’s own initiatives, there is a strong commitment from other donors, the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), Australian International Aid (AusAid) and
Department for International Development of UK (DfID) to provide immediate support on most
important topics ranging from update of fiscal regime for mining, preparation of the spatial
analysis of potential mineral resources corridors, to other activities “in supporting the
Government in its effort to consolidate the reforms in the minerals sector? (AM April/May 2012
mission, p. 2).

50. The PMU is envisaged to become the implementing entity for the Solid Minerals
Development Fund and coordinate other donor aid given its excellent experience and track record
in managing the Project since its launch in 2005 (AM, September 2012 mission). The SMDF, in
turn, at least initially while sector revenues are still modest, is to be funded by the President-
approved Natural Resources Development Fund (NRDF), which is based on the road map
developed for the mining sector. The purpose of the NRDF is to provide funding for the longer-
term development of the sector by: (i) funding the establishment and operation of the Solid
Mineral Development Fund; and (ii) provide a financing mechanism for the Nigerian mid-tier
operators (AM, September 2012 mission). Progress towards establishing the SMDF has been
made but its actual start up date remains to be determined.

51. The Government is also demonstrating commitment to Project-supported investments by
fully funding the budget of the autonomous Mining Cadastre as well as that of the Nigerian
Institute for Mining and Geoscience through the annual National Budget Appropriation. In order
to achieve the full benefits of Project-supported reforms “MMSD has requested continued support
from the Bank – ideally through a project, but at a minimum through a non-lending TA/policy
advice following the project completion in May 2012? (ISR 15, May 2012).




19
   The SMDF was envisaged under the updated Mining Act 2007. The SMDF is not yet fully established, but enabling
documents are drafted and are being processed through the legislation. The SMDF will have a Board and will carry out
its activities in accordance with the procedures that are being developed.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

52. The Substantial overall Relevance rating is based on the following observations:

•   Relevance of Objectives. The continued Substantial relevance of the Project objectives is
    evidenced by the fact that “positioning Nigeria’s mining sector to take advantage of the world
    wide minerals boom? is one of the key elements of Pillar I: Achieving Sustainable and
    Inclusive Non-Oil Growth of the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for FY2010-
    FY2013 (World Bank, 2011). Both parts of the PDO are highly relevant to core focal areas of
    the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2010-FY2013 (World Bank, 2011),
    such as capacity development in the minerals sector, promotion of non-oil growth, and
    community participation. Furthermore, Nigeria’s Vision 20:2020 (NPC, 2009) identified the
    solid minerals sector as one of the strategic industries in the diversification of Nigeria’s
    largely petroleum dependent economy increasing job creation in rural areas. The Vision
    20:2020’s specific objectives to which both Project objectives are highly relevant are: (i)
    entrench sustainability as a fundamental principle in the exploration of mineral resources; (ii)
    strengthen institutional and human capacity across every aspect of the metals sector; and (iii)
    sustain stable and attractive legal and regulatory framework for the minerals sector (NPC,
    2010, p. 120).

•   Relevance of Design and Implementation. The continued Substantial relevance of the
    Project’s design to the Project’s objectives is evidenced by the fact that the Project’s
    ambitious set of activities, sub-components and components were, for the most part,
    implemented as planned and contributing, as intended, to the achievement of both PDOs.
    Overall, Project design was sound, and given that the Project: (i) supported the right activities,
    some of which are explicitly referred to in the Government’s Vision 20:2020 in relation to the
    objectives that are very similar to the two parts of the Project’s PDOs; (ii) targeted the right
    beneficiaries, i.e. public sector staff and institutions in charge of mining sector governance
    and administration; artisanal miners and communities; and potential larger scale investors
    benefiting from improved services and environment; and (iii) the Project design remained
    focused on development outcomes and was revised appropriately to maintain its relevance
    and mitigate initial M&E shortcomings. The Project’s activities, sub-components,
    components and the two parts of the PDO could have been tied together more explicitly and
    the Results Framework could have reflected more clearly how the Project’s elements were to
    support especially Part (ii) of the PDO. However, despite these presentational shortcomings,
    which were in line with the Project’s “trailblazing? nature as the first Bank-supported mining
    sector operation following the Extractive Industries Review, Project design was solid from all
    technical and sector specific perspectives.

•   Feedback from central and local decision-makers confirmed that Project activities and
    outcomes continue to be highly relevant to the federal and state-level development strategy
    (ISR No. 15, May 2012). Project design was well-aligned with client needs as well as global
    best practice since the Project combined support to local economic development with focus
    on training and education of the next generation of sector professionals. Furthermore, the
    Project design’s continued Substantial relevance during implementation is evidenced by the
    fact that the Project was one of the central World Bank-supported operations cited in the



                                                 19
    2005-2009 joint Bank-DFID Country Program Strategy under Pillar II (and Pillar II of the
    Government’s strategy for growth and poverty reduction (NEEDS) (World Bank, 2005).

•   On balance, the overall Project relevance is Substantial.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

53. At the time of approval, the Project was considered one of the most important Bank-
supported operations in the sector, especially since it was the first Project to be approved
following the Extractive Industries Review (see paragraph 5). At the time, Nigeria did not have
any medium- or large-scale operations, and mining of precious, semi-precious, construction and
industrial minerals was mainly carried out informally by artisanal and small-scale miners in
environmentally and socially unsustainable ways (see paragraph 3). The Project was instrumental
in initiating the sector dialogue and elevating its prominence and significance and launching a
new era in solid minerals development in Nigeria. Had it not been for the Project, Nigeria’s solid
minerals would not have enjoyed the level of attention they are presently receiving from the
investors, and most ASM operations would have remained informal and unrecorded. The Project
strong positive impact on the sector is evidenced by the fact that it features prominently in the
Bank’s CPS and the Government’s Vision 20:2020.

54. The Project’s Development Objective comprised two parts: (i) Part (i) of the PDO focused on
strengthening the capacity of key institutions to better manage the minerals sector and improve
transparency in order to attract increased investments in and generate revenues from mining; and
Part (ii) aimed to increase the socio-economic benefits from artisanal and industrial mining in
project areas. There is a certain level of cross influence between the first and second Part of the
PDO as improved sector governance contributes to the improved livelihoods in mining areas. In
accordance with the Bank’s ICR guidelines, the two sub-objectives will be assessed separately
below. The achievements by indicator are summarized in Table 3 below.

3.2. Achievement of the PDO:

3.2.1. Part (i) of the PDO: “improve governance and technical capacity in the solid minerals
sector to enable the sustainable management of mineral resources?
Rating: Satisfactory

55. The Project achieved the following improved governance and transparency outcomes:

• Well-performing state of the art Cadastre (PDO indicator 3). In 2006 a “world-class Mining
Cadastre Office? (CPS Progress Report, 2005), based on transparent, non-discretionary, publicly
available procedures, was established in Abuja and granted autonomous legal status as stipulated
in the 2007 Minerals Act (PDO indicator 2). It is remarkable that Nigeria, which has historically
had a high incidence of corruption in oil and many other industries, now has one of the best
performing cadastre systems in Africa, which instills confidence in potential investors. The
mining cadastre system was audited by an international expert in 2011 and passed with flying
colors. The Cadastre Office’s operating budget is now fully funded through the Federal budget
(AM, April/May 2012 mission). In light of the growing volume of applications received by the
Mining Cadastre’s head office in Abuja, a regional Cadastre office was opened in Jos and, with
support from the Project equipped and staff trained.




                                                20
• Efficient management of mining licenses (PDO indicator 2). The original backlog of 3,000
licenses was cleared in 2005, and the final clean up was completed in July/August 2011. At
Project closing, out of a total of 14,110 applications that had been received during the Project’s
lifetime, a total of 10,056 licenses, i.e. more than twice the end of Project target of 5,000 licenses
had been granted. Licenses are processed on an ongoing first come first served basis, and about
1,000 licenses were being processed at time of Project closing, reflecting the high demand and
healthy turn-over of properties. It is also worth noting that the system maintains its regulatory
integrity and that licenses are indeed revoked in the event that license holders fail to follow the
stipulations. The names of revoked license holders are published quarterly on the Cadastre’s
website as well as in newspapers. This represents a major transparency gain, which resulted from
Project-supported activities carried out under Component 2.

• Strengthened institutional and technical capacity. After nearly 40 years of inattention in the
mining sector, the newly restructured Ministry of Mines and Steel Development was housed in
debilitated physical premises and lacked adequately skilled staff. The Project supported extensive
capacity building activities about 2,000 staff from the Ministry’s departments, the Mining
Cadastre Office, the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency and the National Institute for Mining
and Geosciences who were enabled to effectively perform their mandates, as evidenced by the
smooth functioning of these offices, In addition to the enhancing staff’s competencies: (i) the
Ministry headquarter office in Wuse II/Abuja, and the Zonal Offices in Jos, Sokoto, Kano and
Kaduna were rehabilitated, refurbished and equipped with modern information and
communication technology infrastructure, including the installation of an internet facility (PMU,
2012); (ii) 50 vehicles were provided to facilitate field work and mine inspections; the vehicles
are being put to use as was evidenced through a tracking system that was used by the MMSD to
monitor their movements and locations; and (iii) more than 2,000 Government staff benefited
from extensive capacity building activities carried out under Component 2 (PMU, 2012). This
combination of capacity building of the ministry’s staff and modernized equipment and upgrade
of premises enabled MMSD to provide better services to the industry and put sector development
back on track.

• Legal and regulatory framework (PDO indicator 5). The creation of an investor-friendly
legal and regulatory framework, supported out under Component 2, was one of the Project’s key
accomplishments. A new Minerals and Mining Act was passed into Law by the National
Assembly in 2007; and (ii) mining regulations were adopted in 2011 (ISR No. 15 May 2012).
Environmental regulations were issued as part of the mining regulations. The 2007 Minerals and
Metals Policy, which is embedded in the 2007 Minerals and Mining Act (MMSD, 2007) also
contains provisions pertaining to the fiscal regime for mining, notably royalty payments and
deductions and exemptions to incentivize investors, which partly overlap with (but not contradict)
other fiscal laws.

56. The Project accomplished the following private sector development outcomes:

• State of the art geoscientific data (Intermediate Outcome indicator 2). Nigeria now has one of
the best and modern geophysical databases in Africa, which is a considerable achievement. At
appraisal, the absence of geodata was considered the key constraint to the development of the
sector. As planned, an airborne geophysical survey of the entire country was completed in 2010,
of which 56 percent were Project-funded; (ii) about 3,600 geo-physical maps, including radio-
metrics, gravity and magnetics, were completed in 2012, as well as radio-metric, gravity and
magnetic map interpretations; and geochemical maps of various scales were produced for 49
substances; and (iii) the National Geosciences Research Laboratory (NGRL) has renewed mineral



                                                 21
analysis capabilities as a result of the Project-funded refurbishment, staff training and twinning
arrangements with specialist institutions in the UK and Canada. Sustaibility of the NGRL
however remains an issue and will have to be addressed by the Government after the Project’s
closure – including preparation of a business plan and commercialization strategy.

• Increased mining activities. The available data strongly suggests that private investment in
the Nigerian solid minerals sector increased over the lifetime of the Project. As mentioned above
(see paragraph 55) the Mining Cadastre Office granted more than 10,000 mining titles during the
Project’s lifetime, and the number of active licenses -- a proxy indicator for new private
investment in the mining sector (Intermediate Outcome indicator 4) -- increased from 1,000 to
over 6,300 over the Project’s lifetime (2,000 were mining licenses and more than 4,300 -
exploration licenses). At the time of closing, up to 60 international companies were exploring
different mineral deposits in Nigeria. While the increase in solid mineral exploration and
production is influenced by many other factors (such as commodity markets and global demand)
in addition to Project investments, the governance and transparency gains as well as the state of
the art geodata certainly contributed to the enhanced investment activity.

• The annual royalty collection value – a proxy indicator for the annual increase in solid
mineral production in the sector (Intermediate Outcome indicator 3) – increased by about US$7.7
million, from US$1.4 million in 2005 to US$8.8 million in 2011 in nominal terms. The
(nominal) value of mining royalties collected in 2011 was thus more than six times the royalty
revenues in 2005 (see Figures 1 and 2 below). The total official sales value of solid minerals (as a
proxy for mineral production) increased from about US$35 million in 2005 to nearly US$129
million in 2011 (see Figures 3 and 4 below).

57. In sum, the Project’s achievements under Part (i) of the PDO are rated Satisfactory, given the
remarkable results as explained above, especially considering the sector’s long history of neglect
The Project-generated transparency and governance gains are significant, especially given that
this the first Project to tackle governance in the mining sector in Nigeria, which at the time of
approval, ranked 154 out of 159 in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index
(Transparency International, 2012).

3.2.2. Achievement of Part (ii) of the PDO
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58. Recognizing the important role attributed by the Government to artisanal and small-scale
mining in reducing poverty and accelerating sustainable rural development, the Project
contributed significantly to the development and formalization of the Artisanal and Small Scale
Mining sector in Nigeria, as a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic renewal. as
evidenced by the following accomplishments:

  •     Improved governance and capacity achieved under Part (i) of the PDO directly contributes
        to better services to the ASM sub-sector and communities through formalized employment,
        training and extension services and better infrastructure.

  •     About 251,500 miners who had previously engaged in informal and illegal mining became
        formally employed. The total number of formal jobs created under the Project was thus 25
        percent higher than the targeted number of 200,000 jobs at Project completion
        (Intermediate Outcome Indicator 7). This outcome was the direct result of effective
        application of new tools and approaches by MMSD’s staff in both Abuja and in the field
        (Component 1 of the Project).

  •     Improved livelihoods of ASM operators (PDO indicator 4 and Intermediate Outcome
        Indicator 5). A total of 245 grants amounting to about US$9 million were extended 147
        ASM cooperatives as well as 98 community entities. The ASM grants supported sub-
        projects to enhance granite, sand, gravel and laterite quarrying, and nearly 85 percent of the
        community grants supported the construction/rehabilitation of classroom blocks and water
        schemes (see Annex 2 for more detail). The number of ASM and communities reached
        under the Project is remarkable and by far exceeds achievements of other mining Projects
        implemented in sub-Saharan Africa (see for example mining projects in Uganda, Tanzania
        or Mozambique). Preliminary results based on the first batch of 15 grant-supported ASM
        cooperatives suggest, on average, a 49 percent increase in annual cooperative incomes from
        about US$4,150 in 2010 to about US$6,160 at the end of 2011. At an average cooperative
        membership of 50 miners, this translates into an increase in annual income from about
        US$83 to about US$123 per cooperative member.


                                                  23
  •   Formation of ASM associations and cooperatives (PDO indicator 4). During the Project’s
      lifetime, 1,030 ASM licenses were issued, out of which 475 licenses had been certified as
      of Project closing. This was twice the number the end of Project target value of 200 fully
      compliant associations. (The remaining 555 associations and cooperatives had received
      their licenses and were awaiting certification, given that the MMSD’s ASM department
      was not able to keep with the high volume of license applications.)

  •   Development of gemstone and dimension stone industries. The Project was instrumental in
      the creation of the now flourishing gemstone and dimension stone industries, both of which
      are of high priority to the Government due to their high potential for import substitution
      revenue generation, and employment creation (PMU, 2012, Proposal). A Lapidary school
      established in Jos with Project support succeeded in training 15 commercial cutters as well
      as nine trainers who, in turn, are expected to train 500 commercial cutters within the next
      five years. Similarly, training in dimension stone quarrying (from primitive blasting to
      cutting of square slabs) led to the opening of six new dimension stone processing plants
      (PMU, 2012). These activities have this significantly advanced the potential for local value-
      addition, especially in the gemstone sector.

  •   Resuscitation of professional mining education. The project was addressing two levels of
      professionals - direct mining and geology professionals in pursuit of employment in
      Nigeria’s mining sector, as well as accounting and finance professionals pursuing
      employment with financial institutions and Government agencies focusing on mining
      industry. In addition to the set up and rehabilitation of the National Institute of Mining and
      Geosciences the Project supported mainstreaming mining related courses in business
      schools and universities. The practical post–graduate instruction in NIMG has become
      operational; the first batch of 33 students graduated in late 2011, half of who succeeded in
      finding relevant employment by now; a second batch enrolled in February 2012 and is
      expected to graduate in April 2013 (ISR 15, October 2011 and AM, September 2012
      mission). The number of graduates is being rationed to be in line with the industry demand.
      In addition, the project developed courses and trained university lecturers, who have
      subsequently mainstreamed the mining accounting, governance, taxation and finance into
      the curricula of several educational institutions in Nigeria.

59. In sum, the Project’s achievements under Part (ii) of the PDO did establish a basis for poverty
reduction and rural economic renewal given that, among other results, the Project accomplished
the following results: (i) the small grants program supported artisanal and community sub-
projects, which, based on preliminary results, improved productivity, occupational safety and
livelihoods in ASM communities; (ii) significant progress was made in the development of two
strategic industries, i.e. the production of gemstones as well as the local mining of dimension
stones, which play an important role in the development of local commercial and residential
construction markets. While these achievements are significant, a Moderately Satisfactory rating
was chosen, given that, due to shortcomings in the initial design and utilization of the M&E
framework, the collected data does not fully capture the results in terms of the actual increase of
incomes and livelihoods among ASM operators and communities even though they are tangible
through project support and are visible on the ground. This is evidenced though increasing
number of ASM operators registering and forming cooperatives (the on-going process that can be
tracked through the Mining Cadastre Office), number of ASM receiving services from ASM
departments in the districts, and improved mining practices as evidenced by environmental audits
carried out by the Environmental Department of MMSD. Better mining practices in dimension



                                                24
stone sector can also be seen through the quarries that received training in particular in Kaduna
area.

Given the Satisfactory rating of the Project’s achievements of the Part (i) of the PDO, and a
Moderately Satisfactory rating for Part (ii) of the PDO, the Project’s overall achievement of its
PDO is rating Moderately Satisfactory.

Table 3: PDO indicators, as stated in the DCA (Schedule 5, pp. 34ff.)
PDO indicators, as stated in the DCA (Schedule 5, pp. 34ff.)
1. Adoption into law of new mining law and regulations,
including environmental regulations for sector, by Midterm Review.
Baseline: No; Project Completion: Yes
   Achieved. Mining law and mining law regulations were adopted and gazetted in 2007 and 2011,
    respectively. Environmental regulations have been prepared and were issued as part of the mining
    regulations.
2. Establishment and effective operation of Mining Cadastre
Baseline: No Mining Cadastre Office; Project Completion: Mining Cadastre office established
    Achieved: A central Mining Cadastre Office was established in Abuja in early 2006 and is fully
    operational. The Cadastre Office’s operating budget is now fully funded through the Federal budget.
3. Backlog of pending applications cleared by Midterm Review, and number of new mining titles issued
in a transparent and efficient manner, as evidenced by compliance with procedures and timelines set out
in new mining law and regulations
Baseline: backlog of 3,000 pending licenses (PAD, p.37); Midterm Review: 1,000;
Project Completion: 5,000).
    Exceeded: The original backlog of 3,000 licenses was cleared in 2005, and the final clean up to cancel
    inactive licensees was completed in July/August 2011. At Project closing, out of a total of 14,110
    applications received during the Project’s lifetime, a total of 10,056 licenses had been granted, twice as
    many as the target value of 5,000. At closing, mining operators held a total of 6,300 valid licenses. In
    light of the growing volume of applications received by the Mining Cadastre’s head office in Abuja, the
    mining cadastre functions required decentralization to improve quality of service and efficiency. The
    regional office in Jos was therefore supported through staff training and equipment under the Project.
4. Number of artisanal mining associations established and operating in accordance with the law
Baseline: x Midterm Review: 85; Project Completion: 200).
    More than fully achieved. 1,030 associations/cooperatives were established, of which 475 have been
    certified and inspected, which more than twice the targeted number of 200 associations/cooperatives.
5. Increase in per capita income in pilot project areas, as measured by village income surveys which
shall set the baseline
Baseline per ASM cooperative: NGN 651,844
Midterm Review: 10%; Project Completion: 50%
    Achieved based on sampled collectives. The planned socio-economic survey was not carried out due to
    its overly complex design. However, a sample of 15 ASM cooperatives (out of a total of 147 ASM
    cooperative grant recipient entities) tracked over a 1.5 year-period experienced, on average a 49 percent
    increase in cooperative income from about US$4,150 in 2010 to about US$6,160 at the end of 2011. At
    an average cooperative membership of 50 miners, this translates into an increase in annual income from
    about US$83 to about US$123 per cooperative member.

3.3. Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

60. The Project was essentially a technical assistance/capacity building operation with investment
components (civil works construction of relevant to the sector, such as Government buildings and
facilities), which, as such, did not lend itself to an economic and financial investment analysis.
Similar to other World Bank-supported projects of this nature the economic and fiscal analysis


                                                     25
section in the PAD did not contain Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return or cost
effectiveness calculation, The efficiency assessment in the PAD was based on “economic
indicators that can be projected and compared, such as the estimated value of mineral exports,
fiscal revenues coming from the sector, and the amount of new investment in the near future? (p.
15). 20 According to the PAD: (i) the value of the solid minerals annual gross production from
artisanal and small-scale mining was to increase to US$75-125 million by 2010; (ii) foreign
investment was to boost mineral production to US$500-700 million by 2015; and (iii) fiscal
revenues were to increase to US$10 to $20 million per year (p. 16). In actuality, revenue from
royalties increased by about US$ 7.7million from US$1.4 million in 2005 to US$8.8 million in
2011 in nominal terms. While this indicator did not meet the projected value of US$10 to US$20
million per year, the (nominal) value of mining royalties collected in 2011 was more than six
times the royalty revenues in 2005. Given that there was no medium or large-scale mining in
Nigeria at the time of approval, that mining investments typically take 10 years to materialize,
and that they are influenced by many external factors and market conditions, it was difficult to get
a realistic royalty projection at appraisal.

61. The value of mineral production from artisanal and small-scale mining was difficult to
discern as revenues and production are aggregated among all producers; there is no separate
category for ASM licenses in Nigeria. However, marked increases were observed in the quantity
of mineral production between 2004 and 2010: (i) the recorded production of gold increased from
30 to 600 kilogram; (ii) the production of barite more than tripled from 6,000 to 19,000 metric
tons; and (iii) production doubled in cement production (from 2,300 to 5,400 metric tons) -- and
there was an increase in mining of kaolin (from 58,000 to 100,000 metric tons), gypsum
(from160,000 to 320,000 metric tons) and limestone (from 2,100 to 4,300 metric tons) (Mobbs,
2011 and Mobbs, 2010). In addition, more than 6,300 active licenses were held by private mining
companies at the end of the Project, compared to 1,000 at the beginning of the Project. These data
suggest a positive trend in the development of the solid mineral sector, which is assumed to be at
least partially attributable to the Project’s contribution. It is further likely that the Project was able
to partially redress “informal exports? of gemstones and reduce imports of dimension stones by
making available locally mined granites. At the time of Project approval, the value of smuggled
gemstones was estimated at US$100 million, and 90 percent of dimension stones used in
domestic construction were imported (MMSD, 2012).

62. Operating costs are another indicator of efficiency of implementation, particularly the ratio of
actual operating cost to total actual Project cost, which, at first glance, seemed to amount to
nearly 21 percent under this Project. While this ratio is on the high side, it is important to note
that the increase in the operating costs to total Project cost ratio compared to the appraisal
estimate of six percent is not an indication of administrative inefficiencies. Rather, in addition to
operating costs as defined in the DCA as “incremental expenses incurred by the PMU on account
of Project implementation, management, and monitoring? (DCA, p. 15), the Project was covering
operating expenses of the Nigerian Institute for Mining and Geosciences, the Mining Cadastre
Office, and the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (for surveys) as well as for the Ministry



20
   In accordance with the NEITI Act, the first solid minerals EITI audit report for 2007 to 2010 will be
released by December 2012, and is expected to provide an insight into the operations of mining companies
in the country.




                                                   26
(including utilities and maintenance) – all of which were bundled into the operating cost category
under Project coordination component. At appraisal, it was assumed that these agencies’
operating costs would be charged to respective Project Components and corresponding
disbursement categories. However, during implementation the Bank’s Financial Management
experts advised the Bank’s supervision team to include these expenses as operating costs under
Component 4 and its corresponding disbursement category.

63. These “non-DCA? operating expenses amounted for nearly 60 percent of the “gross?
operating costs of US$15.9 million. The remaining “real? operating costs, as defined in the DCA,
amounted to US$11.39 million or the equivalent of about 8.4 percent of the total actual Project
cost. In light of the fact that: (i) the “real? overhead cost ratio was reasonable; (ii) the Project
accomplished most of its intended objectives within its allocated budget; (iii) no misprocurement
was observed; (iv) the financial management under the Project was sound; and (v) out of total of
245 small grants sub-projects, there were only four reported cases of misuse of funds, all of which
were settled in court and the money was recovered is a remarkable achievement in a country that
ranks low on the ease of business and perceived corruption indices.

64. The Project followed the World Bank procurement and consultants’ selection guidelines and
awarded vast majority of contacts’ on competitive basis. Least cost principle was thus
consistently applied to procurement of all goods, works and consultants services as well as to
small grants (which followed CDD practices for efficiency as mentioned in the paragraph above).
In consideration of explanations provided in this section, on balance, efficiency is rated
Substantial.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65. The Overall Project Outcome was rated Moderately Satisfactory, given that (i) the relevance
of the Project objectives and design was Substantial; (ii) the overall achievement of Project
Development Objectives was rated Moderately Satisfactory; and (iii) the Project efficiency was
considered Satisfactory.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

66. Poverty Impacts. Activities carried out under Component 1 resulted in improved livelihoods
of artisanal and small-scale miners in the form of increased incomes, improved occupational
safety, and access to Project-funded community infrastructure, such as health facilities, schools,
and water supply. In addition, investments in productivity- and value-enhancing capacity building
activities enhanced gemstone identification, testing, cutting and selling at Project-supported gem
buying and trading platforms, as well as the identification, processing and marketing of
dimension stone.

67. Gender Aspects. About 25 percent of the Project’s 12,250 beneficiaries who benefited from
the small grants program were women; and about 40 percent of beneficiaries from ASM training
activities were women. In accordance with the National Gender Policy, the Project was gender
sensitive in that it successfully promoted the participation of women in diploma programs offered




                                                27
at the National Institute for Mining and Geosciences. It further proactively supported the
formation of six women’s ASM cooperative societies (see Box 1 for a case example).

         Box 1: Example of Project-supported women’s cooperative society




                 Source: Ifeadiro, 2012

68. A Gender Assessment was conducted in 2011 - at a time when ministerial structures
(Environmental Compliance Division) were adequately equipped to engage in gender assessment
and strategizing. Women interviewed as part of the Project-commissioned gender study observed
that ASM capacity building and extension services provided under the Project did not include any
trainings that were tailored to specifically promote gender mainstreaming. In addition,
interviewees noted a low representation of women in the management, i.e. decision making, of
the ASM sub-projects (Ifeadiro, 2012). Respondents further emphasized the importance of
developing general community infrastructure, including water and sanitation, health services,
food security and road access. Women were thus one of the key groups to benefit from the 98
community sub-projects supported by the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening N/A

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) N/A

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops.
A stakeholder workshop was prepared at Project closing. It reviewed the Project’s achievements and
challenges. However, a workshop report was not prepared.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

69. As noted in Section 2.5 above, the Government has demonstrated significant commitment to
setting up mechanisms, such as the Solid Mineral Development Fund, aimed at ensuring the
availability of sufficient funding to sustain and expand Project-funded investments and
implementation structures, such as: (i) the retention of the PMU; (ii) the continuation of the small
grants program and other ASM activities with the added support of several extension service
consultants; and (iii) the operating budgets of the Mining Cadastre and the Nigerian Institute for
Mining and Geoscience through the annual National Budget Appropriation. The following
modest risks to the sustainability of Project investments were identified at the time of Project
closing:

•   Legal status of the National Institute of Mining and Geosciences (NIMG). At the time of
    closing, the NIMG Bill had not been presented to the National Assembly for enactment in



                                                   28
    order to reconfirm the legal status of the Institute. However, as of the time of writing of this
    ICR, the Bill for the legal establishment of the Institute is before the National Assembly for
    consideration and passage. A positive and encouraging recent development is the Institute’s
    accreditation by the National Universities Commission.

•   Operating cost for decentralized institutions. The July 2009 mission observed a shortage of
    funding and support for the decentralized institutions and their personnel/ equipment. For
    example, the ASM officers based at the ASM offices in 23 states of the Federation, who were
    trained by extension services consultants and NGOs, are faced with major funding constraints
    and lack vehicles needed to provide extension services to ASM operators (correspondence
    with PMU, October 2012). This situation was being somewhat improved towards the end of
    the Project with MMSD committing higher overall budget and, going forward, allocating a
    part of the Solid Minerals Development Fund towards ASM related activities. Follow up
    assessment of sustainability and current solutions will be undertaken under forthcoming
    funding from other donors.

•   Ease of access by investors to geophysical survey data. As was flagged in a number of ISRs
    and mission Aide-memoires between 2010 and 2012, the access to geophysical survey data
    by potential investors was calling for being streamlined. The bottleneck was mitigated
    through MMSD’s publication of procedures to access data and the recent set-up of the
    Mineral Information Center tasked to assist investors and researchers with facilitating
    information access and promotion of Nigeria’s mineral wealth. While good steps have been
    made and there is evidence that investors purchase the data, there is still some risk that data
    will be kept less accessible than was intended.

70. While two out of three of these risks have yet to be mitigated, the overall risk to the
sustainability of other achievements, such as the data produced by the geophysical airborne
survey, the institutions established with Project support, the formalization of the artisanal and
small scale mining operators and continuation of ASM activities is considered low and are likely
to have a lasting positive impact on the development of the sector. Therefore, the risk to
development outcome is rated Modest.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Satisfactory

71. Overall, the Project’s conceptual approach was appropriate and in line with international
good practice experience at the time even though its presentation in the PAD, and in particular the
linkages between the miscellaneous sub-components of Component 1 could have been presented
more clearly. Project design would have further benefited from a clearly articulated theory of
change, which would have also provided valuable guidance to the design of the results framework
and the formulation of key performance indicators. Similar to many of its contemporary projects,
the scope of the proposed activities was very ambitious but most of them were indeed
implemented. Furthermore, as mentioned above, some of the Project activities were not
implemented, such as the pilot projects and the socio-economic village survey, because their
design was reportedly too complicated. Lastly, some of the Project activities, such as the airborne
survey, were under-budgeted, given that the preparation team did not seem to have anticipated the


                                                29
extent of the increases in the prices of goods and services, given that the minerals boom was
already occurring at the time of appraisal. As mentioned above, under-budgeting for surveying
and mapping was a common occurrence in similar projects implemented in other parts of Africa
during the same time period. The M&E design in the hind-sight could have been more robust, but
the Project followed formats for result frameworks at the time of appraisal. On substance, the
selected indicators were relevant and adequately linked with PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory

72. As appropriately pointed out by the 2008 Project review, conducted as part of the Bank’s
Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio the quality of supervision by “an experienced task
team, with strong support from the country office? (QUAL, 2008), was high throughout
implementation. As evidenced by the fact that most of the envisaged Project activities were
completed on time, the Bank’s supervision “kept the Project reasonably on track, and despite
frequent changes at the top in the ministry.? Furthermore, the Bank intervened effectively “at a
critical juncture in implementation “when the Project threatened to go off-track due to political
interference.? The supervision of safeguards policies as well as, financial and procurement
aspects of the Project appears to have been carried out in a timely, diligent and thorough manner.

73. The only shortcoming in the quality of supervision was its inconsistent tracking of key
performance indicators. In the first seven ISRs a maximum of two PDO indicators and four
Intermediate Outcome indicators were tracked; the last five ISRs contained a set of four PDO and
nine Intermediate Outcome indicators, whose wordings were taken partially from the DCA and
partially from the PAD. It was noted in the last ISR (No. 15, May 2012) that a few indicators,
such as “the socio-economic indicators and investment figures? were not captured.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory

74. Overall, Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory, despite the above-mentioned design and
M&E shortcomings, given that the Project’s innovative design emphasized the need for
environmentally and socially responsible sector development. The supervision team’s firm stance
and insistence on compliance with obligations outlined in the DCA and procurement guidelines
during the time of political interference prevented the Project from derailing. As a result, a
significant portion of the envisaged scope of activities was accomplished, utilizing international
best practice approaches.

5.2. Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75. Government support was rather strong at the time of Project design. However, at the end of
the first 26 months of Project implementation the Project was operating under its fifth Minister
(ISR No. 5, May 2007), which slowed down the implementation pace. The Government’s
commitment over the lifetime of the Project was rather volatile, ranging from a high level of
commitment and full understanding of Project objectives and components and close cooperation
(ISR No. 2, November 2005) to “a lack of adequate attention of the Ministry to small scale
mining, the Jos school for excellence, and hiatus in passage of the mining law? (ISR 5, May
2007), which put the Project at risk of not achieving its objectives as it caused a the ASM



                                               30
component to be two years behind schedule (QALP, 2008). In addition, the release of counterpart
funding was rated Moderately Satisfactory in six out of 15 ISRs, which contributed to further
implementation delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

76. Despite the above-mentioned multiple disruptions and considerable constraints the Project
Management Unit continued to function well (ISR 5, May 2007). The PMU staff was commended
“for their dedication and perseverance 21 […] and on the manner in which they have moved
forward under trying circumstances. The mission does not wish to underscore the importance of
continuity of project staff? (AM July/August 2007 mission). The PMU’s capacity was reinforced
during Project implementation, e.g. through the recruitment of a Procurement Advisor, Project
Management Assistant, Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant (ISR No. 3, April 2006). It was
noted that the results of financial management and procurement post reviews were positive and
audits unqualified.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77. In light of the above-mentioned shortcomings in the Government’s performance, which
caused significant delays in the implementation of Project activities in support of Part (ii) of the
PDO; and the strong performance of the PMU, the overall Borrower performance is rated as

Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

78. Key lessons learned from Project implementation include:
    • Keeping Project design relatively simple when operating in countries with complex
       environments, limited capacity, and a weak country implementation record (QALP,
       2008).
    • Making the stability of Project Management or Coordination Units a covenant can be an
       effective means of avoiding adverse consequences of political interference in complex
       policy environments.
    • While acquisition and development of geo-data (geological, geo-physical, magnetic, etc.)
       is instrumental in attracting investors, there is a parallel demand for designing adequate
       systems and modalities for dissemination (and sale) of the data to a wide international
       audience. Web-based solutions have proven most efficient but constrained by national
       security concerns and limited band-with in developing countries;
    • When the Project is supporting the start up and initial operating expenses of new
       institutions, such as the Nigeria Institute of Mining and Geosciences or the Mining
       Cadastre Office, it is important to build a plan for phasing out subsidies for operating
       expenses into Project design.

   Given the exceptionally long working hours, private sector demands and overall challenges posed by
implementation of this large project the Bank’s supervision team “was strongly supportive? of giving PMU
staff salary top-ups (AM, March 2006 mission).



                                                  31
   •   The importance of Government commitment to budgeting sufficient funds to cover
       recurrent cost in order to sustain Project investments beyond the Project closing date;
   •   The necessity to approach mining sector development from different interrelated angles,
       such as looking to reform, in parallel, the mining sector’s regulatory framework and
       institutional set up; capacity building of the lead agency to improve governance; increase
       transparency through computerization of the mining cadastre; promote the mineral sector
       through high quality data and integrated data management; and to redress adverse
       environmental, social and economic conditions typically associated with informal mining
       by incentivizing the legalization of and giving a “leg up out of poverty? to small scale
       miners.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
The Outputs/Intermediate Outcomes produced by the Project were to be measured by the
following indicators, as stated in the DCA (Schedule 5, pp. 34ff.)

Component 1

Indicator 1. Volume of formal employment created during the life of the Project
 (Midterm Review: 50,000; Project Completion: 200,000)

More than fully achieved. About 251,500 miners who had previously engaged in informal and
illegal mining became formally employed. The total number of formal jobs created under the
Project was thus 25 percent higher than the targeted number of 200,000 jobs at Project
completion. In addition to extension services, and training of trainers in productivity enhancing
mining techniques and other topics covered in the ASM Handbook produced under the Project,
200 ASM operators benefited from training in cooperative management and conflict resolution

Indicator 2. Number of mining operators benefiting from financing and business development
assistance and number of mining communities or associations receiving Subproject Grants
under the Project
Baseline: 0; Midterm Review: 25% of artisanal mining associations and formal artisanal miners;
Project Completion: 50% of artisanal mining associations and formal artisanal miners).

Fully achieved. As a result of the Project-supported small grants program, a total of 245 grants
amounting to about US$9 million were extended, which financed 147 sub-projects implemented
by ASM cooperatives as well as 98 community sub-projects (see Tables 1, 2 and 3 below for
more details). About one third of the ASM grants supported the enhancement of granite quarrying
operations, another third supported improvements in sand/gravel/laterite quarrying. Nearly 85
percent of the community grants supported the construction/rehabilitation of classroom blocks
and water supply schemes. This is a remarkable accomplishment, especially given its late startup
in August 2008.

Indicator 6. Sustainable environmental practices functional in artisanal and small-scale
mining communities, as measured by environmental impact assessments in all pilot areas
Baseline: 0% ; Midterm Review: 50%; Project Completion: 100%

Achieved. All ASM grant recipients have completed the required safeguards screening. According
to an environmental audit carried out in 2010, all recommendations had been followed.

Component 2

Indicator 3. New private investment in the mining sector since Effective Date
Baseline: 0; Midterm Review: $12 million; Project Completion: $100 million

Partly achieved. Contrary to expectations at entry, it was reportedly not feasible to track the value
of new private investment in the solid mining sector. However, the fact that more than 6,300
active licenses were held by private mining companies at the end of the Project, compared to
1,000 at the beginning of the Project, suggests that significant new investments occurred in the
solid minerals sector. In addition, a total of more than 4,000 exploration and reconnaissance
licenses were granted during the Project’s lifetime.




                                                  35
Indicator 4. Increase in annual solid minerals production in the sector
Baseline: 0; Midterm Review: $12 million; Project Completion: $100 million

Achieved. Given that data regarding the value of annual solid minerals production quantities was
not readily available, the value of collected royalties was used as a proxy indicator. According to
data provided by the Mines Inspectorate Department of MMSD, in nominal terms, the annual
royalty collection value increased by NGN 1,162 million (about US$ 7.7million) from NGN215
million (about US$1.4 million) in 2005 to NGN1,377 (US$8.8 million) in 2011 in nominal terms.
The (nominal) value of mining royalties collected in 2011 was thus more than six times the
royalty revenues in 200. Given that royalties represent 4 percent of the total mineral sales value,
the official sales value (as a proxy for mineral production) is 25 times the royalty collected.

Component 3

Indicator 5. Area covered by new geological maps, as percentage of total area of the
Borrower’s territory
Baseline: 40%; Midterm Review: 50%; Project Completion: 100%

Achieved. The airborne geophysical survey of the entire country was completed in 2010. The
interpretation of survey data and production of geo-physical maps, including radio-metrics,
gravity and magnetics, was also completed in 2012. Geochemical maps of various scales were
produced for 49 substances, and the geo-physical analysis has produced radio-metric, gravity and
magnetic map interpretations. The National Geosciences Research Laboratory (NGRL) received
equipment. A planned consultancy to prepare the road map for the full commercialization of the
NGRL was not carried out under the Project, reportedly due to time constraints. However,
however, the “MMSD has confirmed that savings on counterpart funds will finance this
consultancy. Execution will be carried without Bank involvement? (ISR No. 15, May 2012).

In addition to the above-mentioned outputs, the Project carried out extensive capacity building
activities to enable Government institutions to acquire the capacity to manage the sector. Training
programs targeted staff in the technical departments of the ministry - the Mines Inspectorate,
Mines Environmental Compliance, Legal, Mining Cadastre Office and the Nigerian Geological
Survey Agency. Additional trainings were conducted to build the technical skills of non-
Government actors, such as ASM operators and journalists.

The following overview of training activities undertaken with Project support was taken, with
minor editing, from MMSD’s publication “Mining in Nigeria. Breaking New Grounds. The Story
of SMMRP Intervention? (MMSD, 2012):

Mines Inspectorate Department
o Fifty (50) staff from the department and three each from Mines Environmental
    Compliance and ASM Departments were trained on GIS at the Obafemi Awolowo
    University, Ile-Ife.
o Eight (8) Senior Officers of Mines Inspectorate Staff on Mines Health and Safety
    Inspection Procedures at the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, with the objective of
    enhancing the capacity of the staff in discharging their mandate in ensuring safe and
    healthy mineral development activities as contained in the Minerals and Mining Act and
    the Minerals Regulations.
o The Project also organized three sets of short courses for 60 senior mines officers of the
    Mines Inspectorate Department at the University Of Mines And Technology, Tarkwa
    Ghana. The courses are intended to train the staff of the Mines Inspectorate Department to


                                                36
     effectively supervise and monitor the activities of Mining and exploration companies to
     ensure compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions.
o    The project also sponsored a course for Eight (8) Senior Staff of the Mines Inspectorate
     Department on Safe and Efficient Blasting Course at Orica Mining Services Stockholm,
     Sweden for of the Mines Inspectorate Department in February, 2012. The course is meant to
     build capacity of the participants to the latest state of the art techniques and technology in the
     blasting process. It will also enable the participants to make informed decisions on how to optimize blasting
     operations and the "Mine to Mill process.

 Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining Department
The project has organized courses that for staff of the ASM department. in November 2011,
senior officers of the department attended a training programme at the Indian School of Mines.
The objective was to provide the participants with sound and quality knowledge as well as the
skills necessary to enhance the quality of their output.

Nigerian Geological Survey Agency
NGSA staff have benefitted from various training programmes both in Nigeria and abroad. In
January 2009, The Project facilitated a training programme in Geochemical Mapping in Kaduna
and Minna. The programmed was conducted by the British Geological Survey and the Finish
Geological Survey. Over 50 geologists of NGSA took part in the training programme. The
NGSA also benefitted from various training programmes in airborne geophysics, airborne data
interpretation, and technical report presentation.

As part of the capacity building of the staff of the NGSA in Airborne geophysical survey data
acquisition and interpretation, the following courses were delivered to about 30 Staff of the
Geophysics Department of The NGSA by Messrs FUGRO Airborne Surveys and Peterson Grant
and Watson (PGW) the consultants on the Airborne geophysical survey data acquisition and
interpretation respectively. A two-weeks course was conducted on
    • Modelling of geophysical data for interpretation.
    • Regolith mapping and Geophysical Interpretation
    • Cartographic and GIS Application related to Geophysical Interpretation
    • Aero-gravity and Aeromagnetic interpretation applied to sedimentary basins: structural
         framework and configuration
    • Daily checks of the airborne data
    • Quality control processes for airborne geophysical survey data acquisition.

 Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners
Both ASM operators and the Ministry staff have benefitted from the following capacity building
programmes:
   i.   Gemstone awareness and identification
  ii.   Gemstone cutting and faceting
 iii.   Fundamentals of gemstone mining
 iv.    Co-operative management and finance
  v.    Basic book keeping for artisanal miners.

Environmental Management Capacity Building Program for the Nigerian Mining Sector
The Environmental Management Capacity Building Programme addresses the strategic needs to
improve environmental management capabilities in the mining sector in Nigeria and to improve
the system's effectiveness by building capacities in the relevant departments and agencies
responsible for the formulation of environmental policies and also responsible for the



                                                      37
enforcement of the legal and regulatory framework as it affects mining. The departments/agencies
that benefited from this programme are;
• Mining Environmental Compliance Department of MMSD
• Mines Inspectorate Department (MID) of MMSD
• Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) of MMSD
• National Environmental & Regulatory and Enforcement Agency

Other courses organised were:
• Environmental auditing, Environmental risk assessment, Environmental Management
   Systems, EIA processes summary.
• Detailed EIA processes: screening, scoping, monitoring, community consultation:
• Mitigation measures for mining sector, remediation of abandoned mines;
   decommissioning/closure of mines, sectoral/strategic environmental assessment;
• Study Tour of South Africa: Environmental enforcement approaches in mining, water and air
   quality monitoring techniques in mining, and waste management techniques in the mining
   sector

Training on Governance, Accounting, Finance, Taxation, Environment and Mining
The Governance Education Trust of New Zealand was engaged by the project to train the
trainers from the Nigerian tertiary institutions on basic concepts of internationally accepted
practices on the management of mining revenues.
The following topics were selected for the training:
• Finance for the mining industry, including project finance;
• Accounting for the mining industry;
• Taxation for the mining industry;
• Elements of mineral economics;
• Mining project cycle: exploration, development, operations, closure;
• Mining in the International context;
• Environmental and social considerations;
• Governance, Transparency and Accountability.

The ultimate outcome of the training is that the institutions involved in the training have
introduced the courses in their curricula for sustainability. The participating Universities are:
University of Jos, University of Nigeria, University of Technology, Akure, Ahmadu Bello
University, University of Calabar, Lagos Business School, University of Ife and the Nigerian
Institute of Mining and Geosciences. Their participants include the National Universities
Commission, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, Zenith
Bank Plc, Skye Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria Plc, Guarantee Trust Bank Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc
and the United Bank for Africa Plc.

Capacity Building Programme for Journalists
To facilitate a proper appreciation of the Minerals and Metals sector, a two-day technical
workshop was organized for journalists covering the beat. Over 60 journalists from both the print
and broadcast media took part in the programme.

Two Nigerian professors of Mass Communication, Professor Lai Oso from the Olabisi Onabanjo

achievements of the project in concrete terms to various stakeholders. There were
exhibitions of the products from the lapidary and grantees as well as the numerous
publications and baseline studies funded by the project. There were presentations by
beneficiaries from the MMSD (MCO, ASM, Environment, NIMG, and NGSA), other
beneficiaries (for example geodetic network and universities) and grantees.

Overall, the comments by stakeholders were balanced on the impact of the project with
the running theme being for continuity of the project to sustain the reforms and in the
case of grantees support to advance to the mid-tier level. Many participants expressed
concern over closure of the project and the need to continue the reform. The World Bank
was strongly commended for its role in the process of the reforms.

    1. SECTION ONE: INTRODUCTION ON THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
       OF MINERAL RESOURCES PROJECT (SMMRP)

Prior to the discovery of oil, Nigeria had a flourishing mining industry as world largest exporter
of Columbite and ranked as eighth highest producer of Casiterite (Tin). A large number of
Nigerians earned their livelihood from this sector.

However, with the rise in government’s revenues from crude oil and the collapse of tin in the
world market, the mining industry declined to very low levels where operations were reduced to
only artisanal and small scale mining (ASM). With the return to democratic governance in 1999,
the Federal Government of Nigeria identified the development of solid minerals as a major sector
for the diversification of the economy away from the dominant oil and gas sources of income.
Consequently, the President constituted a Committee to produce a Seven-year Strategic Plan for
the development of solid minerals in Nigeria. The report of the Committee provided a basic
framework to grow the sector, build both infrastructural and human capacity and provide pro-
poor strategies for ASM operators. In its mission to quickly implement the recommendation of
the Committee, the Federal Government invited the World Bank to intervene and lay a solid
foundation that will propel the sector to full realization. The Project Development Objectives of
SMMRP were in tandem with the strategic direction of both the Federal Government of Nigeria
and the World Bank as regards poverty reduction, wealth creation, employment generation, and
additional revenues to government. The Federal Government’s economic blueprints –National
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), Seven-Point Agenda/Vision 20-
2020 and Vision 20-2020/Transformation Agenda represent the policy thrusts of successive
administrations since the return to democracy in 1999. All these economic strategies placed
strong emphasis on poverty reduction in the country.

The World Bank/IDA Project: The Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project
(SMMRP) is a home-grown intervention conceptualized after a National Mining Policy Dialogue
held in 2004. The Project became effective on April 25, 2005 and was implemented through a
period of 7 years (closed on May 30, 2012). The original Closing Date was June 30, 2010 but a
23-month extension was granted by the World Bank to compensate for some implementation
delays which occurred earlier in the life of the Project.

The SMMR Project was suspended for a few months in the second year of implementation
because of interferences by political office holders. The stoppage led to loss of momentum.
Again, activities (pilot projects) relating to poverty reduction, were ignored up to mid-term
review in April/May 2008 because the political leadership at the time did not consider them
important. Another implementation bottleneck encountered was the frequency with which
political and career leadership of the Ministry changed through the life of the Project. During the
7-year life of the SMMRP, 8 (eight) Ministers and 9 (nine) Permanent Secretaries had held
appointments at the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (MMSD).

Project Development Objectives: The dual Development Objectives of the SMMRP were to:
  i.    Increase government’s long-term institutional and technical capacity to manage Nigeria’s
        mineral resources in a sustainable way; and
 ii.    Establish a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic renewal in selected areas of
        the country through the development of non-farm income generating opportunities
        through small-scale and artisanal mining, and to diversify away from oil sources of
        income



                                                46
Project Components: The Project had the following Components: (i) Economic Development
and Livelihood Diversification in Artisanal and Small Scale Mining Areas; (ii) Strengthening
Governance and Transparency in Mining, (iii) Private Sector Development, and (iv) Project
Management and Coordination

Implementation Arrangements: The SMMRP was implemented by establishing a Project
Management Unit (PMU) with a team of experienced public and private sector technocrats. The
set up and mode of operation made the PMU less susceptible to the bureaucracies of the Public
Service. The operation of the PMU was guided by covenants and guidelines of the World Bank.
The overall supervision of the Project with the apex organ of the SMMRP, which was the Project
Consultative Committee (PCC) which was required to meet at least once every quarter. The PCC
was chaired by the Permanent Secretary with some Directors-General (of Agencies) and Directors
(MMSD), and the Project Coordinator, as members. The Assistant Project Coordinator doubled
as Member and Secretary.

2. SECTION 2: STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY IN
   MINING

Institutional Reforms and Reorganization: The Project facilitated the restructuring and
reorganizing of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development in 2006 as a necessary step toward
addressing hitherto prevailing institutional weaknesses. One of the most important features of
this exercise was the change in the role of Government from being a Regulator/Operator to
Regulator/Administrator. In the restructuring exercise, three technical Departments were created
as follows: (i) Mines Inspectorate (MI), (ii) Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM), and (iii)
Mines Environmental Compliance (MEC).

Legal and Regulatory Framework: The Project facilitated the creation of legal and regulatory
instruments to guide the development of the solid minerals sector. Some key features of the
Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act, 2007 include: Guarantee of tenure for mineral titles, Creation
of the Mining Cadastre Office as an autonomous institution, Removal of discretionary powers of
political heads, Transparency in the issuance of mineral titles, Transferability of mineral titles,
and Provision of model agreements. As part of regulatory instruments, the Nigerian Minerals and
Metals Policy, 2008 was developed from the provisions of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2007.
The Nigerian Minerals and Mining Regulations, 2011 was concluded and adopted after wide
consultations with, and input from relevant stakeholders. It was formally presented to the public
in a Stakeholders’ Forum in 2011.

Establishment of the Mining Cadastre Office: Prior to the SMMRP intervention mineral title
administration was fraught with opaque processes and discretionary powers of political office
holders. The project facilitated the conversion of the Mining Cadastre from a standard paper
files and analog-based to digital, computerized system. In 2007, a new computerized
cadastral system was set up.

Mining Governance, Accounting, Taxation, and Finance Curriculum Development: A group
of professors from the New Zealand, Governance Education Trust, were engaged to develop the
capacity of Nigerian Lecturers to effectively deliver courses specifically in mining accounting
and governance at their various universities and other tertiary educational institutions. The course
was structured with 60% commercial (finance, accounting, taxation and governance) and 40%
technical (mining and environment).



                                                47
3. SECTION THREE: DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

The MMSD Head Office Complex, Zonal, and State Offices were renovated and equipped in line
with the new institutional model and re-designed work procedures. The Project also financed the
renovation of the premises of the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency and the alteration and
modification of the Nigeria Institute of Mining and Geosciences, Jos and the Mining Community
Resource Centre (MCRC). It also established a Lapidary & Gemology Laboratory, financed
rehabilitation of laboratories, Work Shops and external works within the Nigeria Geological
Survey Agency (NGSA) facility in Kaduna. The Laboratories were also equipped with highly
sensitive and up-to-date instruments. The project also facilitated the establishment of the Mining
Cadastre Office through the purchase and renovation of the building structure.

4. SECTION FOUR: PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

Geological Data Acquisition and Dissemination: In order to support private sector-led
development of the Nigerian mining sector, the Project carried out extensive geological
information gathering (airborne geophysical survey and geochemical mapping) with the view to
establish Nigerian mining/mineral potential at the international level.

Some of the activities undertaken by the Project include the following: (i) Following the success
of the Phase 1, financed by the Federal Government, the Project financed the balance of 56% of
the country land space with airborne geophysics, (ii) Interpretation of Airborne Geophysical Data
generated in Phase II. (iii) Geochemical mapping of two cells, (iv) The Project was jointly
executed with the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) as part of capacity building
program of the project.

Revision of Geodetic Network and Completion of Cartographic Coverage of Nigeria: The
outcomes of the reinforcement of the vision of the technical capability for the management of the
mining titles through modern cadastre system A included: (i) Provision of additional high
accurate international cartographic controls in the country, (ii) Upgrading of the Nigerian
geodetic information, provision of the platform for a conflict free cadaster system operations,
among others.

5. SECTION FIVE: TRAINING AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING

At the inception of the Project, training needs assessments were conducted round the Ministry
with the view to identify skill gaps. . Between 2005 and 2012 when the Project came to a close,
over 2,000 personnel had benefited from various training programs both within and outside the
country.

The Nigerian Institute of Mining and Geosciences, Jos: The Ministry upgraded the Jos School
of Mines School to a Centre of Excellence for postgraduate training. The training curricula and
delivery methodology emphasize more of practical work than academic, in line with the
operational needs of the mining sector. The Project facilitated the recruitment of the provost,
management, and staff of the Nigerian Institute of Mining and Geosciences (NIMG), Jos. The
curriculum from Pen State University was reviewed and adapted to the local context by a team of
professors and senior lecturers in Nigerian tertiary institutions. In April 2010 the NIMG
commenced 18-month postgraduate diploma programs in (1) Mineral Exploration, (2) Mining
Engineering, and (3) Minerals Engineering.




                                               48
6. SECTION SIX: ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE MINING DEVELOPMENT

The Project completed four ASM baseline studies on Gold, Barites, Gypsum and Gemstones.
Two pilot project studies on Barite and Gypsum were concluded between 2005 and 2006, but
were subsequently not executed due to a change in policy and sector policy priorities at the
Ministry.

Gemstone Industry Development and Establishment of the National Lapidary Centre: The
Project established an International Standard Lapidary, with well stocked machines. The Lapidary
Centre is housed in the Administrative Block of the Mining Community Resource Center. The
Project facilitated the training of 9 Master Trainers and 15 Commercial Cutters. The training
courses were all conducted at the Lapidary Centre, Mining Community Resource Centre,
Nigerian Institute of Mining and Geosciences, Jos. It was estimated that the Lapidary Center
would turn out about 500 commercial cutters within 5 years through organization of short courses
in Lapidary.

Outcomes: The early result of the promotional activities at local and international fora
undertaken by the Project is the stimulation of interest of potential local and foreign investors.
By Project closing, there was already an influx of investors into the subsector, and operators were
opening up new mines with semi- mechanized mining methods.

Dimension Stone Industry Development and Establishment of Dimension Stone Laboratory:
The Project facilitated the formation of Association of Dimension Stone Operators of Nigeria,
using similar steps applied for the Gemstone Industry development in coordinating the formation
of the, with full complement of executives to run the Association in place.

Outcomes: Various activities implemented in pursuance of the development of Dimension Stone
subsector in Nigeria have begun to yield some fruits, some of which are: (i) Huge awareness on
the potentials of the DS industry, (ii) International visibility, (iii) 5 new processing plants being
installed across the country, (iv) New DS quarries springing up. (v) Existing investors are
expanding operations and processing plants, (vi) Establishment of ancillary industries in the
increase, and increased job creation

7. SECTION SEVEN: ADMINISTRATION OF MICRO GRANT TO ARTISANAL AND
   SMALL SCALE MINERS (ASM) AND MINING COMMUNITIES

Grants of not more than US$50,000 equivalent per Grantee were given to 245 Beneficiaries
comprising ASM (Cooperatives) and Community Development Associations (CDAs). The grants
were given to enable the ASMs improve their mining operations by using better tools and
equipment. The CDAs utilized their grants for the provision of social infrastructure in the
mining communities they represented. Both the ASMs and CDAs were required to provide
counterpart contribution of 50% and 10% respectively. Such contributions were made either in
cash or kind or a hybrid.

Monitoring Structure: The SMMRP had a monitoring structure in place with the following
functionaries: (i) Non-Governmental Organizations: for monitoring the performance of the
Grantees and presenting quarterly reports to the Project Management Unit. (ii) Extension Service
Consultants: for providing technical support to the Grantees vis-à-vis production, maintenance,
record keeping. (iii) 6 State Coordinators: for the general administration of the scheme in their

8. SECTION EIGHT: OUTCOMES FROM PROJECT ACTIVITIES

However, within the 7-year life of the SMMR Project, short- to medium-term outcomes were
already showing, which is an indication that with sustained effort, the future holds high prospects
for mining in Nigeria. Some of these Outcomes are discussed below.

Increased Investment in the Solid Minerals Sector: Nigeria has witnessed a preponderant influx
of investors into the local mining sector since the passage of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining
Act, 2007. The increasing number of applications received by the Mining Cadastre Office is a
clear attestation to investors’ interest in Nigeria’s solid minerals sector. At project closing, over
37 foreign companies were involved in solid minerals exploration activities.

Improvement in Minerals Title Administration: The cadastre system established by the SMMR
Project has, over the years, engendered transparency and efficiency in minerals title
administration process in Nigeria. The Mining Cadastre Office has greatly improved in
operational effectiveness, with short transaction cycle time and feedback system for applicants,
which, has also contributed to investors’ confidence.

Access to Geological Infrastructure: The huge geological data sets generated by the SMMR
Project are now available to potential investors. Many investors have been able to access
geological maps and other information relevant to their needs. The Minerals and Metals
Investment Centre now facilitates improved access to investment information, geological data and
other ancillary services required by potential investors.

Higher productivity at the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development: The restructuring and
reorganizing of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development in 2006 has made the Ministry
relatively more focused and effective with the division of functions among the three new
technical Departments. Hitherto, the original Mines Department was rather omnibus and hydra-
headed in its operations.

The current organization structure of the Ministry and specialization among the technical staff has
brought in its wake enhanced productivity, and different levels of mine site supervision are now
better linked to the responsible Department, for accountability.

Enhanced Capacity for Execution of Statutory Mandate: Ministry of Mines and Steel
Development is arguably a leading ministry in terms of capacity to deliver on statutory mandate.
This can be traced to the massive investment which the Project has made in staff training,
creation of favorable working environment and provision of ICT equipment and know-how. As a
technical and research department of Government, the infrastructure provided for MMSD by the
Project has enhanced productive capacity. As a result, the Ministry generated over N1.6 billion in
2011 compared with about N200 million recorded for 2005.

Capacity Building for Artisanal and Small Scale Miners: The Project supported the Ministry to
register over 400 ASM cooperatives. Many of them benefited from the micro grant scheme that
enabled them to acquire improved mining tools, equipment and services. The training which
some of them received has enabled them to imbibe better mining practices, keep record of
business and financial transactions.



                                                 50
Reduced Poverty/Improved Income of ASM Grantees: Many of the grantees have recorded
increase in income from mining operations as a result of higher production achieved with better
tools and machinery. The households represented by membership of the beneficiary cooperatives
now enjoy improved livelihood with more disposable income accruing from mining business.

Production of relevant Manpower for Mining Sector by the NIMG: The first set of 34 students
at the NIMG completed their postgraduate diplomas and the second set has been admitted. This
presents a new crop of available manpower for the mining industry. The process for admitting
the next batch of students into the Institute was being concluded by the time of Project closing.

Promotion of Mineral Endowment: Many foreign investors are coming to Nigeria today as a
result of the extensive investment in mineral promotional activities over the years. Many investor
companies are involved in exploration activities in parts of the country.

Developing Dimension Stone Industry: The dimension stone industry development activities
undertaken by the Project have given rise to some early positive outcomes. The activities of the
Project have led to increased awareness of the huge potential of the dimension stone industry.
Nigeria’s Dimension Stone industry is now contributing more to the economy in terms of
employment generation and Gross Domestic Product.

Developing Gemstone Industry: With the training of Master Trainers and commercial cutters, the
Gemstone industry is set on the path of growth. If development activities are sustained, this
industry would witness the creation of numerous private mini-Lapidaries nationwide. This will
create jobs and build skills in gem cutting, polishing and marketing.

Management Skills Transferred to ASM Cooperatives: With the training and technical
assistance extended to the beneficiaries, their capacity has been greatly improved to manage
business operations. This is demonstrated in improved record keeping, conflict management,
maintenance of machinery, financial management and profit sharing.

Incremental Employment Generated: Evidence shows that many of the Grantees have witnessed
increased direct and indirect employment at the mine sites. For example, their workforces have
expanded in line with higher levels of operation and production

Gender Empowerment and Mainstreaming: The Project deliberately targeted some women
groups or cooperatives: They were given grants to upgrade their mining operations and this
scheme brought about economic empowerment for those women who otherwise would have been
vulnerable. The study on Gender Mainstreaming was already being used as a complement to
focus government toward social inclusion in solid minerals development efforts.

Reduction of Child Labor at Mine Sites: The Project embarked on campaigns against Child
Labor at Mine sites by educating ASM operators on the danger and legal implications of child
labor.

Strengthened ASM Cluster: During the implementation of the grant scheme, Beneficiaries of
crushing plants formed a production cluster by pooling their resources together, with joint efforts
in management, production, maintenance and marketing of their products.

Value Addition to Solid Mineral Products: There are instances of beneficiaries who are engaged
in value addition to minerals mined. The Project provided some communities with access to
health, good water and educational services.


                                                51
Reduction in Water Borne Diseases in Contaminated Communities: Fifteen (15) boreholes were
provided in Yar Galma, Dareta and environs, Zamfara State, where the incidence of lead
poisoning occurred in 2010. This contributed to the reduction of water contamination in the
communities.

Social Accountability and Inclusion: In terms of social accountability and social inclusion, great
improvement was recorded. Many of the communities visited had various developmental
associations that organized their activities democratically and were quite inclusive.
