MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN HIV/AIDS AND STDS PREVENTION MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the The Republic of Indonesia for US$24.8 million to help finance the HIV/AIDS and STDs
Prevention and Management Project. The loan would be at the standard amortization term, grace
period and interest rate for fixed rate US dollar, single currency loans with expected disbursement
periods of three to six years.
2.    Country and provincial background. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) represent a
serious but neglected health problem in Indonesia. Conventional STDs can result in chronic ill
health, withdrawal from the labor force and even death. But of special concern in respect of these
diseases is their role in facilitating transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and
hastening the onset and increasing the severity of the symptoms of those who are [IV seropositive
and who will eventually get the deadly Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
3.    HIV was first diagnosed in Indonesia in 1987. As of December 1995, 364 [lIV cases had
been documented through the Ministry of Health's reporting system, with a third of these
individuals located in Jakarta. Unfortunately, these figures seem to understate substantially the
number of Indonesians with HIV. Both the routine reporting system and sentinel surveillance are
faulty and miss many of those who are infected or most likely to be vulnerable to this disease. Also
pointing to underenumeration of HIV cases are features of the Indonesian social and economic
scene. For example, economic growth and social mobility have raised demand for commercial
sexual services and thereby increased exposure to STDs and HIV in metropolitan areas such as
Jakarta and in special economic zones such as Batam. The commercial sex sector is estimated to
employ up to 40,000 persons in Jakarta, while Batam, the industrial and tourist center in sight of
Singapore, and nearby Tanjung Pinang, both in Riau province, together may have over 5000 sex
workers.
4.    Development Implications. Conventional STDs can lead to withdrawal from the work force
and other economic effects. Accordingly, treatment of STDs can yield significant economic
benefits, since most of those affected are of working age. Moreover, establishing effective control
over STDs is likely to have further beneficial impacts by slowing transmission of HIV. Indeed, the
economic effects of HIV are potentially more serious because AIDS leads to eventual (as opposed to
periodic) withdrawal from the labor force, growing incapacity and death.
5.    The benefits of reducing HIV transmission include treatment costs which are averted. For
Jakarta, the costs per AIDS patient were estimated at US$2,700 in 1995 depending on whether
treatment was obtained in public or private facilities. Since fewer than 10 percent of the population



- 2 -
are covered by health insurance, the costs of the HIV epidemic will be absorbed largely by affected
households and the government budget. A major concern is that the government system will have to
allocate increasing resources to curative care in response to a rising number of AIDS patients. In
addition, significant expenses will have to be met by affected families, largely from savings, loans
and/or liquidation of assets. This will prove to be very difficult for poorer households who as in other
Asian countries likely make up a disproportionate share of AIDS patients. The benefits of reducing
HIV transmission also encompass income losses which are averted. For Jakarta, these income losses
(forgone earnings) were estimated at US$29,132, on a discounted basis per AIDS case.
6.    Government Strategy. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has acknowledged Indonesia's
vulnerability to HIV and the negative economic effects of a possible epidemic. A May 30, 1994
Presidential decree created an AIDS Prevention and Coordination Commission (NAC), and an
accompanying Ministerial decree and subsequent policy statements highlighted prograrn design
issues and imperatives. These include the importance of focusing on high risk behavior; entrusting
AIDS programs to provincial entities beginning with some pilot efforts; involving NGOs in key
aspects of the program; enhancing MOH's coordination and technical support activities;
strengthening treatment of conventional STDs; enabling blood banks to screen donors and helping
laboratories to diagnose STDs and HIV; strengthening surveillance of STDs and HIV; upgrading
monitoring and evaluation; and coordinating initiatives funded by different donors.
7.    Lessons from World Bank Projects and Other Initiatives. Completed and ongoing health
and population operations in Indonesia point to lessons that should be incorporated in HIV/AIDS
policy development. These indicate that: (1) blanket approaches have only limited impact given the
diversity in health status and determinants across the country; (2) community participation and
political and religious support are crucial in such programs; (3) the ability of government programs
to reach minority and/or hard-to-reach groups has been limited and better collaboration with NGOs
and the private sector is needed to deliver services to such groups; (4) addressing institutional issues
and building capacity at all levels is needed to ensure sustainability; (5) phased implementation can
be effective if a comprehensive package of services is provided and areas are selected to maximize
program impact; (6) monitoring and evaluation should be an integral part of each project component;
and (7) projects can be an effective tool for policy development.
8.    Looking beyond Indonesia, there are at least 40 ongoing Bank projects with AIDS and STD
components. In addition, Bank-funded AIDS operations are underway in Zaire, India, Brazil,
Zimbabwe, Uganda and Kenya. One review of early project results called on Country Departments
to focus increased attention on countries with high STD levels but low HIV incidence which can still
slow the epidemic. There are other emerging findings: (1) government programs are often
unprioritized and spread too thin; (2) the private sector and NGOs are better equipped typically than
governments to reach many communities; (3) understanding determinants of behavioral change in
different settings is crucial for prevention; (4) mass media are more effective if linked with
community and interpersonal initiatives; (5) STD prevention and management should be an integral
part of HIV/AIDS programs; (6) operational research is often needed to identify effective approaches;
(7) good monitoring and evaluation systems should be developed within HIV/AIDS programs; and
(8) such programs usually help to strengthen health policy and disease control overall.



9.    Bank Strategy and Rationale for Involvement. The proposed project is fully consistent
with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 21, 1995. The CAS
notes that considerable scope exists to improve health service quality through better resource use.
Bank-supported lending and sector work in Indonesia have addressed health service quality by
tailoring interventions to local epidemiological patterns; involving local authorities and communities
in program design and implementation; improving availability and use of skills, drugs and materials
at the facility level; and enabling central units to provide technical support.
10.   The proposed project extends this approach to the specific health circumstances now
emerging in a metropolitan region (Jakarta) and special economic zones, for example, Batam and
other localities in Riau. In this regard, the rationale for Bank involvement is to provide the flexible
resources and planning framework needed for the emergence of locally grounded responses to a
possible HIV epidemic. Currently, donors such as AusAID and USAID are supporting various
AIDS-related initiatives which typically reflect preferences to work on specific areas or activities.
None of these donors has introduced an overview approach useful for organizing governmental
efforts. Unlike the grants provided by other donors, Bank funds will be available to finance
indispensable training, capacity building, institutional development and outreach activities. In
addition, this Bank initiative will introduce a broad framework, based on comprehensive local pilot
programs, which will allow local and central level activities, including those funded by different
donors, to be prioritized and coordinated. The project also supports the establishment of a central
HIV/AIDS and STDs Program Management Unit which will be responsible for the Bank-supported
project along with other donor-assisted AIDS interventions involving the Ministry of Health (MOH).
11.   Project Objectives. The project is intended to help operationalize and implement the AIDS
strategy presented in the 1994 Presidential and Ministerial decrees. These policy statements are aimed
at slowing transmission of HIV and STDs, and the goal of this "first phase" project is to develop
institutional responses capable of eventually reducing incidence of STDs and HIV in Indonesia. This
will entail careful, intensive pilot testing. These trials need to include efforts involving specific target
groups and delivery mechanisms, as well as the assembling of cost effective, mutually reinforcing
packages of interventions. To this end, a core program for STDs and HIV prevention in two pilot
areas would be designed and implemented in partnership with local NGOs; extensive monitoring and
evaluation would identify which trial interventions were promising.
12.   Performance evaluation. Due to measurement challenges and lags in changing behavior,
progress toward the ultimate goal of reducing HIV transmission may not be discernible within the
three year duration of the project. Accordingly, the project is designed to attain proximate objectives
such as promoting behavior change among those involved in risky behavior; improving the
capabilities of health providers and the laboratory system as regards STDs and HIV and establishing
effective surveillance and monitoring and evaluation systems. A number of impact measures will be
used to rate project performance in terms of these proximate objectives. Baseline values for these
indicators will be calibrated during the first six months of project implementation.
13.   A participatory approach. During project preparation, different beneficiary groups were
consulted through the interviews and focus group discussions. Close interaction with target
beneficiaries and other stakeholders will continue during the implementation. In particular, NGOs



- 4-
will train and deploy peer educators and counselors, drawn from different target groups. And
beneficiaries will be consulted periodically on different aspects of implementation.
14.   Project Description. The project consists of provincial level components and
complementary central level activities. The provincial interventions would introduce simultaneously
and in the same localities the behavior change and service delivery measures needed to achieve
significant outcomes. These steps would be accompanied by intensified surveillance, monitoring and
evaluation efforts and backed by appropriate coordination, management and funding arrangements.
The project will also provide assistance to MOH for the development of guidelines, standards and
materials needed at the provincial level; technical support to the pilot projects; strengthening
surveillance and health laboratories in preparation for the extension of the pilot initiatives to new
areas; and research to improve interventions and to gauge program impacts.
15.   Provincial Pilot Programs. Project activities and outlays in the two pilot provinces are
described below. Base costs are shown in parentheses.
16.   Jakarta (US$8.8 million equivalent). The project will finance behavior change, STD service
delivery, STD and HIV surveillance, laboratory strengthening, NGO capacity building, monitoring
and evaluation and management activities in Jakarta province. Behavior change activities will be
directed at various target groups. For each such group, the project will support training of local
trainers, counselors and peer group educators; needs assessments; dissemination of educational
materials; and purchase and distribution of condoms. NGOs will be contracted to develop and
implement various outreach activities. The project will strengthen STD service delivery by
supporting skills need assessments; training of local trainers; production of educational materials;
dissemination of guidelines and techniques to public and private doctors, nurses and laboratory staff;
purchase of laboratory equipment, condoms, test kits and reagents; and development, testing and
dissemination of infection control and waste disposal techniques. In addition, the project will finance
stepped up surveillance of HIV and STDs and extensive monitoring and evaluation.
17.   Riau (US$7.3 million equivalent). The project will finance behavioral and service delivery
initiatives and associated surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, and management activities in
Batam and several other places in Riau province. Behavioral interventions will be directed at health
workers whose work makes them susceptible to HIV, and at commercial sex workers and the groups
who form the clientele for the sex industry and at the community at large. Activities to be supported
include production and distribution of educational materials; counseling by telephone and on a person
to person basis; and training of local trainers, peer group educators and counselors. STD services will
be strengthened through project support for skill needs assessments; training of district and local
trainers; dissemination of educational materials; and purchase of equipment, reagents, test kits and
condoms. Blood screening will be improved by assisting training of laboratory and blood bank
staff, facility renovation and purchase of equipment and reagents. As in Jakarta, the project will fund
intensified surveillance of STDs and HIV and monitoring and evaluation activities.
18.   Central activities. The project will support coordination, technical assistance, media
development, monitoring and education research and other activities carried out by central MOH



-5-
units as well as review and related functions performed by the NAC. The main activity categories are
described below. The amounts in parentheses are base costs.
19.   STD service delivery (US$1.5 million equivalent). The project will support development
and testing of procedures relating to (i) the syndromic approach to STD case management at the
clinical level and though antenatal service delivery, (ii) infection control, (iii) care of HIV and AIDS
patients, and (iv) appropriate disposal of infected materials.
20.   Surveillance (US$ 2.9 million equivalent). The project will finance improvements in the
capacity and effectiveness of the routine and sentinel surveillance systems for HIV, AIDS and STDs.
Resources will be provided for the identification of sub-populations and sentinel groups of interest
and for the development of objectives, key indicators and standard methods for each type of
surveillance activity. Through this sub-component, technical support will be provided for
surveillance in the pilot provinces, and other provinces as per the recommendations of an assessment
of experience during the first year of implementation.
21.   The health laboratory system (US$ 6.0 million equivalent). The project will strengthen the
health laboratory system through development of standard testing procedures for STDs; introduction
of quality assessment and assurance mechanisms; staff training; increased screening for different
STDs and HIV; and testing private laboratory services. The project will support strengthening of the
National Reference Laboratory in Jakarta and establishment of four regional Centers of Excellence
for STDs and HIV, and improved performance and expansion of HIV and STD testing at the
provincial, hospital and district levels.
22.   Behavior change (US$3.1 million equivalent!. The project would finance activities which
support provincial level behavior change interventions. These include design of prototypes for needs
assessments, preparation of health education materials, training of provincial trainers, technical
assistance, NGO capacity building, fellowships, and various monitoring and evaluation activities.
23.   Project Implementation. The project would be executed by the Ministry of Health and by
the provincial governments of Jakarta and Riau. The project cost is estimated at $35.2 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$11.4 million and taxes and duties estimated at
US$1.5 million equivalent. The Bank would finance US$24.8 million, 70 percent of total project
costs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. In Jakarta and Riau, the project would be directed by the
provincial governor's social welfare assistant, supported by a Project Manager and Project
Implementation Unit with expertise in key areas. The Provincial AIDS Commission (PAC), which
is chaired by the Governor and includes representatives from key government departments and
NGOs, would set priorities, coordinate interventions and review progress. Within MOH the project
would be headed by the Director General for Communicable Disease Control and Environmental
Health (CDC/EH), and implemented by an HIV/AIDS Program Management Unit placed within
CDC/EH and responsible for all technical work on STDs and HIV. Finally, NGOs will be



- 6 -
contracted to carry out various behavior change, service delivery, training and monitoring and
evaluation activities, and will have the further option of submitting unsolicited proposals.
24.   Benefits. Development and replication of an effective program can slow HIV transmission
and lessen significantly the cumulative impact of HIV/AIDS. An early start would save many lives.
For example, it is estimated that successful project execution in Jakarta would result in 5000 fewer
AIDS cases by 2005 and 22,500 fewer cases by 2010. This projection is based on conservative
assumptions about the impact of the project on risky behavior. In this scenario, the net present value
of project outlays and benefits amounts to US$140 million by 2005 and US$551 million by 2010.
This calculation excludes such benefits as reduced morbidity and death from STDs. A further benefit
will be the impact on the health status of a vulnerable group in Indonesian society which is largely
female, commercial sex workers.
25.   Risks. Several risks arise in designing public policy in response to an unprecedented health
challenge like AIDS. First, the potential for rapid transmission of HIV may have been exaggerated.
For this reason, the government is well advised to invest initially in improving surveillance and
laboratory facilities, and in trials in areas of known incidence. On the other hand, HIV could spread
so rapidly that public and private response mechanisms prove inadequate. Here, the steps proposed
in this project are also appropriate since surveillance, laboratory testing and locally tailored, pilot
initiatives will be key elements in an eventual Indonesian response. A second risk relates to possible
difficulties in persuading different audiences, including those not part of the social mainstream, to
modify what has been a very private aspect of behavior. This eventuality will be addressed in the
proposed project through unobtrusive coalition building, and reliance on NGOs in reaching out to
target groups. This points to a third risk, that of overburdening often small, recently formed NGOs.
This latter risk will be overcome through use of pilot initiatives, careful monitoring and evaluation
and phased expansion in light of demonstrated NGO capacities. A fourth risk is that HIV initiatives
will overwhelm GOI's policies towards other health problems--this contingency can and should be
avoided by integrating HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment with ongoing efforts to respond to other
health challenges. Moreover, this risk is more likely to eventuate if program efforts are delayed.
26.   Financial Benefits and Risks. The Borrower has selected a single currency loan is US
dollars in order to better manage its external liabilities, in view of i) the weight of US dollars in
Indonesia's foreign exchange receipts, and ii) the current high exposure to the Japanese yen. The
choice of a fixed interest rate reflects the Borrower's preference to manage its interest rate risk in
view of its current exposure to floating rate loans.
27.   Environmental Impact. Safe disposal of contaminated blood, bandages and needles is of
special concern as regards HIV. Accordingly, appropriate guidelines with respect to removing and
disposing of hazardous materials will be developed and introduced during project implementation.
28.   Sustainability. The raison d'&re of this project is to identify cost effective and sustainable
ways of slowing HIV transmission in Indonesia. This objective is addressed through the emphasis on
monitoring and evaluating all components and activities; delegation of planning and operational
decision making in pilot areas to local officials; assignment of priority setting, review and
coordination functions to Provincial AIDS Commissions with wide representation; extensive



- 7 -
involvement of NGOs, and the large share of project expenditures allocated to one-time outlays, e.g.,
training and laboratory upgrading, which will not need to be funded at similar levels in later years.
29.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, GOI provided assurances that:
*  the governments of Jakarta and Riau provinces will maintain the provincial Project
Directors and Managers and District Project Directors until the project is completed;
detailed terms of reference covering the roles, functions and staffing of the provincial
Project Implementation Units were also agreed at negotiations;
*  the government will maintain within MOH a Project Director who shall be the Director
General of Communicable Diseases, a Project Manager who shall be responsible for
day-to-day implementation of the Project, and a HIV/AIDS and STDs Program
Management Unit of agreed size and skill mix; the role, functions and terms of reference
of the Program Management Unit were agreed at negotiations;
*  the process of selecting and contracting with NGOs, including but not limited to the
NGO fund, will be on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank; regarding the NGO
fund, agreement was reached on the criteria to be used in reviewing proposals and
making grants and on contracting procedures; GOI presented guidelines and supporting
legal documents defining the mechanisms to be used to ensure the fullest possible use of
NGOs;
-  the vehicles required for the project will be provided according to an agreed schedule;
by December 31 in each year, plans for central and provincial training activities,
workshops and use of fellowship funds will be presented to the Bank for review and
approval.
- agreed indicators would be used to assess project performance.
30.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

HIV/AIDS AND STDs PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
TIMETABLE OF KEY PROCESSING EVENTS
Time taken to prepare the project:        12 months
Project prepared by:                     Government with JGF assistance
First IBRD mission:                      October 17, 1994
Appraisal mission departure:             October 16, 1995
Date of negotiations:                    January 16, 1996
Planned date of effectiveness:           April, 1996
Relevant ICRs and PPARs:                 None
This project is based on the findings of a July, 1995 pre-appraisal mission comprised of S. Lieberman
(Task Manager) and F. Saadah, and an October, 1995 appraisal mission made up of S. Lieberman, F.
Saadah, N. Mattson and E. Iswandi. F. Saadah led the October, 1994 identification mission, while S.
Lieberman and F. Saadah visited Indonesia in February 1995 for project preparation. During the project
development, significant assistance was provided by the following JGF-funded consultants -- K. Parker,
L. Gelmon, N. Constantine, M. Moore, C. Campbell, M. Linnan, and J. Moran -- who worked closely
with the Ministry of Health preparation team. Tracee Williams handled the processing and production of
this report in every respect. This project has been endorsed by Marianne Haug (Director).
