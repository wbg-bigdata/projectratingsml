BARBADOS
TOURISM PROJECT
I. THE TOURISM SECTOR
A. Tourism Assets
1.01      The tourism assets of Barbados have long made it a popular holiday
destination. The most easterly of the Caribbean Islands, its 166 square
miles of territory offer the visitor extended stretches of attractive beaches,
beautiful water and a pleasant tropical climate with no pronounced rainy
season and tempered with constant sea breezes. The attraction of Barbados
comes too from its social and political stability, its relative accessibility
and its diverse range of accommodations appealing to all income levels. One
of its major assets is the old fashioned courtesy and friendliness of its
people, which has led to a high level of repeat visitors.
B. Tourism Flows
1.02      Prior to the 1960s the tourist industry in Barbados catered largely
to small numbers of wealthy winter visitors. It was only in the early 1960s,
with the widespread use of jet aircraft, that major growth in the sector
occurred. Excluding cruise visitors, visitor arrivals 1/ rose at an average
annual rate of 17.4% between 1961 and 1970, gradually slowed to an average
growth of 10.2% annually from 1970 to 1974 (Annex I, Table 1), and, due to
the energy crisis and the worldwide economic recession, declined for the
first time in 1975 to 222,000 from the 1974 peak of 231,000. In 1976, the
number of visitors again increased and by 1977 reached a record level of
269,000. During 1978, an estimated 315,000 visitors came to Barbados, an
increase of 17% over 1977 arrivals.
1.03      Visitor arrivals to Barbados have expanded faster than elsewhere
in the Caribbean and its share of arrivals has steadily increased. Average
annual growth from 1970-1977 was 8.1% for Barbados compared with 3.5% for
the Caribbean as a whole and consequently its share of total arrivals to
the Caribbean rose from 4.2% in 1970 to 5.7% in 1977 (Annex I, Table 2).
1.04      The relative accessibility of Barbados in comparison with other
eastern Caribbean islands has been a contributing factor to its tourism
growth although the airlines have had trouble meeting all high season demand
for flights to the island. Barbados' Grantley Adams International Airport
can accommodate all aircraft types. It is served by 12 scheduled airlines
and is only 4-1/2 to 5 hours by air from New York and Toronto, the two
largest tourist generating markets. Connections to US cities are via direct
flight to Miami, New York, Boston, San Juan and, recently, via Caribbean
Airways, Barbados' national airline, to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. In
1/   Visitor arrivals can be equated with tourists, as 99% of visitors to
Barbados come on holiday.



- 2 -
the winter as many as 24 direct weekly flights connect Barbados and the US.
Some charter flights have been operating but account for no more than 10% of
US visitors. The Canadian market is served through ten weekly flights to
Montreal and Toronto and additional numerous charter flights which are
arranged by tour operators, especially in the winter season. Europe is
served via 14 weekly flights to London, Luxembourg, Copenhagen and Zurich.
A German charter airline also operates a weekly flight to Barbados.
1.05      Barbados also actively caters to cruise ship visitors.  During the
period 1963-1977, the number of cruise ship passengers to Barbados increased
at an average annual rate of 10% and in 1977 numbered 103,000. However, the
growth of this traffic has been erratic and it is of less economic importance
than other tourism.
1.06      Canada and the United States are the chief tourist generating
markets for Barbados, accounting for 57% of total arrivals. Barbados is,
however, attempting to diversify its market and has managed to increase
the proportion of UK, German and Venezuelan visitors to Barbados from 11% of
total visitors in 1973 to about 16% in 1977. Caribbean Commonwealth countries
are the source of 18% of the 1977 visitor traffic and other countries account
for 9% of total arrivals.
1.07      In 1977, US arrivals numbered about 70,000 and accounted for 26%
of total visitors, compared to 34% in 1973 (Annex I, Table 3). In contrast,
while the US continued to be the dominant tourist supplier to other Caribbean
islands, Canadian visitors to Barbados rose from about 18,000 in 1967 to a
record 84,000 in 1977 accounting for 31% of total traffic. The UK is a more
important market for Barbados than for other Caribbean islands. From 1967 to
1977, UK visitors grew at an average rate of 10.3% annually, reaching about
26,000 in 1977 and accounting for about 10% of the total traffic.
Seasonality
1,08      Seasonality is not an acute problem in Barbados.  About one half of
Barbados tourists arrive during the "'high season" months of December to April.
A secondary peak in July-August coincides with school vacations in the major
tourist-generating markets (Annex I, Table 4). Canadian arrivals are largely
concentrated in the winter months, US flows are heavy in winter and in the
months of July and August, and Caribbean, European and Venezuelan visitors
arrive mainly in the summer months.
Length of Stay
1.09      Between 1970 and 1977, average length of stay of tourists in Barbados
has increased from 5 to 9 days (Annex I, Table 5) and is longer than the one
week average for the Caribbean as a whole. This is largely because of the
expansion in self-catering fac:lities where the average stay is longer than
in conventional hotel accommodations. Also, Europeans and Canadians stay an
average of 15 and 10 days respectively, compared to 7 days for US visitors.
n 1977, the average stay ranged from 12 days in apartments, to 7.7 days in
class "A" hotels and 304 days in guest houses,



C. Tourist Expenditures
1.10      Official data on tourist expenditures in 1977 indicate that those
tourists who stayed in recognized accommodations spent an average of BDS$124
per day in winter, BDS$84 in summer and BDS$102 on an annual basis. Visitors
staying in luxury hotels spent an average BDS$240 per day in winter and
BDS$160 in summer, and expenditures for those staying in Class I apartels
were BDS$182 and BDS$116 in winter and summer respectively. It is estimated
that 55% of total expenditure is spent on food and lodging in the hotels and
apartels, and the rest on transportation, shopping, entertainment and meals
outside the hotels.
D. The Hotel Industry
1.11      In October 1978, there were 179 accommodation establishments with
over 11,000 beds (Annex I, Table 6). Capacity is concentrated on the west and
south coasts of the island with the west coast catering primarily to the upper
income market and the south coast to lower income tourists. Between 1968 and
1978, accommodation capacity doubled. While much of the expansion in the
sixties was in hotel rooms in response to the growth in US arrivals who
preferred full service accommodations, the emergence of the more cost-conscious
charter package tour Canadian market during the early seventies brought a
surge in apartment-type establishments, which now account for almost 50% of
total capacity, up from about 25% in 1968. During the 1968-1978 period, guest
house bed capacity has decreased and the number of middle and lower class
hotel beds has remained at roughly the same level.
1.12      Tourist accommodation in Barbados is diversified in type, size and
category and appeals to all income levels (Annex I, Table 7). Barbados does
not have large hotels, the largest hotel having less than 200 rooms. Only
17% of establishments have more than 100 beds while 57% have 40 beds or less.
Seventy-three percent of luxury hotel capacity and 57% of the highest class
apartel rooms are foreign owned while seventy-one percent of lower class
hotels and seventy-nine percent of lower class apartels are locally owned.
Management of the five largest hotels, which account for approximately 60% of
total luxury hotel capacity, is in foreign hands. The foreign role in owner-
ship and management represents a possible focal point upon which anti-tourism
feelings could center.
1.13      The Government has effectively encouraged construction of accommoda-
tion facilities through the Hotel Aids Act which provides income tax relief
and exemptions from certain custom duties for new hotels. In the light of
developments during the past ten years, however, a revision of the Act is now
being prepared which would control the supply of new capacity by granting the
Minister of Tourism discretionary powers in approving applications for the
construction of new tourist facilities, and would encourage primarily middle
and upper category hotel and apartel construction, which Government conducted
studies have shown to have a more favorable impact on foreign exchange
earnings and employment creation than do lower category hotels and apartels.



-4-
Occupancy Rates
1.14      Estimated total arrivals to Barbados in 1978 indicate that the
average occupancy rate may exceed the record level of 1974 (Annex I, Table 8)
when bed occupancy reached a peak of 55.6%. Certain luxury establishments
expected bed occupancy in 1978 to be as high as 65%. Occupancy rates for
first class accommodation indicate a need for expansion of capacity in this
category in the near future. Because of more effective international market-
ing programs, the luxury hotel 1977 average annual bed occupancy rate of 61.3%
was the highest of any category. Apartels averaged 53.4% and guest house
occupancy rates averaged only 25.4%. Distinct hotel preferences among the
different nationalities visiting Barbados partially account for the variation
in occupancy rates among the different types of accommodation.
Tariffs and Profitability
1.15      Luxury hotel room tariffs, which vary between US$70 and US$136 per
day for the 1978 winter season, are about twice those of other accommodations.
Apartel daily tariffs range from US$40 to US$110 for the same period and over-
lap with hotels in the lower price range. Summer rates are as much as 30-70%
lower than winter rates (Annex I, Table 9). A comparison of prices of tours
to different Caribbean destinations (Annex I, Table 10) indicates that Barbados
has one of the widest ranges of accommodation prices in the area and that,
although Barbados prices are quite competitive in the lower range, they are
among the most expensive in the upper range.
1.16      The Barbados hotel industry is one of the most profitable in the
Caribbean region; a regional hotel survey indicated an average house profit
of 19% of sales in Barbados compared to 13% for the region. Payroll costs
average a relatively low 22% of sales, while overhead expenses amount to 30%.
Profitability of hotels, however, varies considerably on the island. In
general, well managed apartels achieve a house profit of 30-40% of sales,
and luxury hotels a house profit of 20-25% of sales.
E. Transportation, Handicrafts and Other Services
1.17      Most of the areas of tourist interest in Barbados are easily
accessible. A main highway runs along the coast around most of the island
and other roads lead into the interior. Barbados has some 2,000 taxis which
mainly serve the tourist industry. Recently, some taxi operators were per-
mitted to purchase minibuses, particularly for use between the airport and
certain hotels, to cater to groups. In addition to taxi tours of the island,
tourists may visit neighboring islands on air or sea excursions. Sporting
activities include deep sea fishing, sailing, scuba diving, golf and tennis.
1.18      Although production is limited to souvenir items made from straw,
clay, wood, cloth and shells, tourists are buying local handicrafts in
increasing volumes. Production levels are increasing and quality is improv-
ing with the assistance provided by the Handicraft Division of the Industrial



- 5 -
Development Corporation (IDC). The Handicraft Division has a center which
produces and markets handicrafts, and offers training programs. It currently
has five retail outlets which in 1978 had total sales of about BDS$300,000
and profits of about BDS$48,000 or 16% of sales. Because of the additional
employment opportunities in handicrafts, the IDC is taking further steps to
assist the industry. It has drawn up a handicraft development plan that calls
for an increase and diversification of local craft skills, development of an
effective marketing system, improvement of the quality of products, finding
new local sources for raw materials, and the formation and development of
craft cooperatives.
1.19      In addition to handicrafts, Barbados has some 20 duty-free shops
in Bridgetown and outlets elsewhere on the island which sell tourists many
different products. Although there are no specific data on the volume of
sales of duty-free goods, 1977 statistics indicate that total re-exports of
goods, much of it representing visitor duty-free shopping, amounted to BDS$44
million. It is estimated that about one third of total duty-free sales is
retained in Barbados to cover wages, overhead and profits to shop owners.
Duty-free shops employ an estimated 1,000 persons. Moreover, the Government
benefits from receipt of customs duties on goods consumed in Barbados and from
interest accrued on import duties withheld from importers until subsequent
re-export of duty-free goods.
F. Organization and Planning of the Sector
1.20      Because of the importance of tourism to the economy of Barbados,
major decisions relating to the tourism sector are taken by the Cabinet.  Of
the Government agencies involved in tourism on a day-to-day basis, the most
important is the Division of Aviation and Tourism located within the Ministry
of Caribbean Affairs, External Trade, Industry, Aviation and Tourism (Ministry
of Tourism). The Division is responsible for collecting statistics, monitor-
ing the development of the sector, supervising studies, and administering the
Hotel Aids Act which provides incentives to investors.
1.21      Other agencies involved in tourism include the Board of Tourism, the
Barbados Development Bank (BDB), the Ministry of Housing and Lands and the
IDC. The Board of Tourism, established as a statutory body in 1958 to handle
promotion and marketing, includes members representing hotel owners, tour
operators, airlines, taxi owners, retailers and the press. Board functions,
in addition to promotion, include registration and classification of hotels,
collection of information about the industry and promoting understanding among
the local population of the importance of tourism to the island. The Ministry
of Housing and Lands through its Town and Country Planning Department concerns
itself with zoning regulations, while a Parks and Beaches Commission attempts
to preserve the parks and beaches of Barbados, advises on beach control and
maintenance and draws up and enforces regulations regarding the use of parks
and beaches.



- 6 -
1.22      The Government's sector planning capability has recently been aug-
mented by the establishment of a Tourism Planning Committee which is chaired
by the Minister of Tourism and whose members represent the Ministries of
Tourism, Finance and Planning, Communications and Works, and Housing and
Lands, the BDB and the Board of Tourism. The Committee has responsibility
for defining objectives for the sector and advising the Minister on the for-
mulation of tourism policies and strategies. In contrast to the relatively
unplanned development of the sector in the past, the Government plans to guide
future investment and growth to assure that the interests of Barbados are
better served. The major objectives of the Government in this regard are:
(a)  controlling the quantitative and qualitative growth of the sector
to maintain a socially acceptable balance between the number of
tourists and the indigenous population and to optimize employment
and to minimize diverse environmental impact;
(b)  increasing visitor arrivals and expenditures;
(c)  increasing local ownership and management of the island's hotels
and other tourist facilities;
(d)  establishing better linkages with agriculture and other
sectors of the economy in order to decrease external
leakage of benefits; and
(e)  using tourism investment to stimulate development of the northern
part of the island.
1.23      In collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism, the Organization of
American States (OAS) prepared a preliminary five-year tourism development
plan for the island in 1976/77. The plan, which has been informally endorsed
by the Government, calls for the expansion of first class hotel accommodation
and the upgrading of medium priced hotel and apartel facilities to further
the general objective of increasing visitor numbers and expenditures while
preserving the physical environment. The emphasis is toward higher grade
facilities and away from mass tourism, and as a corollary, toward hotels and
away from self-catering tourism. Priority is placed on developing the Hey-
woods Village project, the modest expansion of four existing hotels and the
provision or improvement of amenities such as public recreation centers and
national parks. The plan also suggests regulatory, planning and organiza-
tional measures covering collection of statistics, zoning, conservation,
marketing, handicraft production, licensing and financing.
1.24      In the private sector, the Barbados Hotel Association, which was
formed in 1957, represents hoteliers in matters of mutual interest, most
notably tax policies and wage negotiations. It also takes on various promo-
tional activities such as exhibitions and conferences, and works in close
cooperation with the Board of Tourism in the public relations and promotion
areas. Taxi and restaurant owners also have their own associations to
protect and promote their interests.



- 7 -
1.25      The Barbados Development Bank was established in 1969 and lends to
several sectors including tourism which, as of March 1977, accounted for
two-thirds of its total loan portfolio of about BDS$9 million. In the year
ending March 1977, the BDB made new loans totaling BDS$4.9 million to the
tourism sector, mostly for construction or refurbishing of small hotels,
apartels or apartments. Loans of not more than BDS$950,000 are presently
made for periods of up to 15 years at an interest rate of 10-1/2%.
1.26      The staffing of and overall coordination between the various
organizations and institutions is adequate, especially when considering the
small scale and informal contacts on the island. The Government has prepared
a statement expressing its general intentions relating to the proposed revi-
sion of the Hotel Aids Act, and its tourism development plans.
G. Training
1.27      Basic training in tourism in Barbados is conducted both through
on-the-job training and through a hotel school operating under the Ministry
of Education. The hotel school was started in the mid-sixties primarily as
a vocational school for low-level employees. It was expanded in 1973/74 to
include training of supervisory and middle-management staff. It now trains
cooks, waiters, maids, bartenders, receptionists, cashiers and other front
office staff, food service and catering staff and middle-level hotel manage-
ment personnel.
1.28      The school is turning out more graduates than needed because of low
staff turnover, the growing tendency towards building apartments and apartels
rather than hotels, and the emphasis of the schools is too much on skills that
are not currently required by the sector. The Government is weighing several
options to improve the situation. Among other things, it plans to strengthen
the management and raise the status of the school, place less emphasis on
''new entrants," concentrate on upgrading existing staff and gear the number
of graduates to available employment opportunities. These changes when
implemented should enhance the school's usefulness. During negotiations it
was agreed that the Government will provide a timetable by December 31, 1979
for implementing the above measures.
H. Social and Economic Aspects of Tourism
1.29      Barbados is a medium-income developing country with a per capita
GNP of US$1,760 in 1977. The island's major natural resources include soil
and climatic conditions which favor the cultivation of sugarcane and tourism.
The quality of the country's human resources is unusually high for the region
and adult literacy is estimated at 99%. A poor economic performance in the
mid-1970s is attributable to the world recession which led to a decline in
tourism and investment. Economic growth picked up in 1976 (to about 5%)



although the fall in international sugar prices in that year slowed down the
recovery, illustrating the economy's vulnerability to external disturbances.
In spite of substantial improvements in the employment situation from the
end of 1975, unemployment is still serious in Barbados, amounting to 12.5%
of the labor force in mid-1978; reduced emigration may further aggravate this
problem over the next few years. Employment in agriculture has fallen by
over 60% since 1960 due largely to the increasing mechanization of sugarcane
cultivation. The industrial sector, including construction, retained about a
quarter of the labor force, while employment in services (including tourism
and government) increased from 46% in 1960 to nearly 66% in 1976.
1.30      Total direct employment in all hotels and restaurants is estimated
at 6,000 in the low season and 7,000 in the high season. In addition, at
least an equal number of people are employed in other activities that serve
the tourist industry, such as duty-free shops, handicrafts, transportation
and water sports. Therefore, the tourism sector employs an estimated total
of between 13,000 and 14,000 persons or about 15% of the total labor force.
Earnings within the tourism industry of over BDS$400 per month for wage
earners and over BDS$800 for salaried employees are higher than average
earnings in manufacturing. Among ten main sectors, the hotel industry ranks
first as regards the level of female wages and third for male wages and second
and fourth for salaried female and male employees respectively. Women consti-
tute 45% of the work force in hotels and restaurants. The percentage of women
among total employees is higher among professional (49%), clerical (68%), and
skilled groups (49%) than among unskilled labor groups (30%).
1.31      The ratio of number of persons employed to rooms is consistently
higher (i) for hotels than for apartels, apartments or guest houses, (ii) for
higher class hotels, and (iii) for all accommodation with 30 or more rooms.
Since hotel accommodation has not increased as rapidly as other accommodation
facilities in recent years, total employment in the sector has increased at a
slower pace than has the number of rooms.
1.32      Tourism is the key sector of the Barbadian economy.  It contributes
approximately 10% of GDP, but this portion increases to 30% when tourism-
generated services are included. Foreign exchange earnings are also heavily
dependent upon tourism. Gross receipts from tourism increased from US$40.5
million in 1970 to US$111 million in 1977, an increase of 15.5% annually. By
1978 earnings from tourism amounted to an estimated 44% of total exports of
goods and non-factor services. There is ample room for increasing the con-
tribution of tourism to the Barbadian economy, although there is also concern
regarding excessive reliance on this single sector. The Ministry of Tourism
has estimated that there is scope for at least doubling the number of hotel
beds on the island from the present capacity of around 11,000 beds. The north
and east coasts of the island are virtually undeveloped and even on the more
heavily developed west and north coasts there is space for some expansion.
The sector's contribution could also be increased by capturing a larger pro-
portion of the high income tourist market and reinforcing the linkages of the
sector with the rest of the economy.

1.33      While the attitude of the Barbadian people toward tourists remains
friendly and positive, the Government is becoming increasingly concerned about
regulating the quantitative and qualitative growth of the sector to maintain
a socially acceptable balance between the total number of tourists and the
local population, minimize the negative environmental impact of tourism
development, and optimize benefits to the economy from future development.
1.34      While limitations on quantitative growth will probably become more
important in the future, the qualitative aspects of tourism development and
the benefits and linkages that can be developed between tourism and other
sectors of the economy are of greater importance at this juncture. In con-
trast to the past, the Government has now decided that it should play a more
active role in future tourism development. It has already concluded that:
(a)  catering to the higher income segment of the tourist market would
increase the earnings of the sector;
(b)  developing hotels of more than 30 rooms has a greater impact on
employment than developing other types of accommodation;
(c)  use of land must be better controlled, so that only certain types
of facilities can be built in various parts of the island;
(d)  existing facilities need to be upgraded and marketed more effec-
tively;
(e)  future expansion should be determined after careful consideration
of occupancy rates of existing facilities;
(f)  active measures are needed to foster stronger linkages with other
sectors; and
(g)  selective Government investments in the tourism sector could help
achieve these objectives.
1.35      The Government has collaborated on the preparation of, and informally
endorsed, the OAS Tourism Development Plan which places high priority on the
Heywoods Village proposal. Also, as previously mentioned, the Hotel Aids Act
of 1967 is being revised to provide the Government with both guidelines and
necessary powers. Hotels with less than 24 rooms are no longer eligible for
hotel credit from the BDB. Restrictions have been placed on the import of
meats, vegetables and other products that are produced and available locally.
Agricultural, fishery and handicraft projects are being developed that will
cater specifically to the tourist population. Although all beaches are public,
the Government is taking additional specific steps to ensure that the public
has easy access to the beaches as well as other recreational areas on the
island. The Board of Tourism conducts regular seminars for the local popula-
tion on the benefits of tourism on the island. It has also initiated a very
successful program entitled "Evening on Us" under which tourists are invited
to the homes of local residents on occasion for a "soiree."



- 10 -
1.36      Given the acute awareness of both the Government and the relatively
well educated population as to the importance and benefits of tourism, and
given the efforts to regulate and guide development of the sector, it appears
likely that the anticipated expansion of tourism can be carried out in a way
that will not be harmful to the social or physical environment of the island.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Background and Objectives
2.01      In accordance with its tourism sector objectives (para. 1.22), the
Government, with the assistance of consultants, has prepared an innovative
308-room hotel village project comprising a cluster of seven hotels and
apartels which would have individual Barbadian management and would preserve
the individuality of decor and intimacy of small hotels. The hotels together
could also support the investment required for the kind of amenities and
facilities now enjoyed only by large luxury hotels, including a meeting hall,
common recreational facilities, bulk purchasing and an international marketing
program.
2.02      The proposed project would be located at Heywoods, the site of an
old plantation in St. Peter's Parish just north of Speightstown and near the
northern end of the west coast of the island some 12 miles from the capital
of Bridgetown (Map 14043). Speightstown is an old settlement which for many
years was the only harbor from which sugar, molasses and rum were shipped, but
its commercial and economic importance declined with the construction. of harbor
facilities at Bridgetown. While remaining the second largest urban nucleus
in Barbados, Speightstown now has a population of only about 2,500 and is
essentially a rural and fishing community. The town has some fine architec-
turally and historically valuable properties that are of interest to tourists.
2.03      The Government plans a revitalization of Speightstown, so that it
can become an important center serving the northern part of the island. With
this in mind, the Government has engaged consultants to prepare a development
plan for the town and is planning several projects, including the tourism
village at Heywoods, that should have a significant impact on the area.
2.04      The Heywoods Estate is fronted by a mile-long beach of good quality
sand, with the sea offering excellent opportunities for swimming and water
sports. Given its tourism potential, the Government took an option on about
28 acres of land of the estate in 1976. The purchase of the land was com-
pleted in December 1978.
2.05      The Heywoods Village project would add a new dimension to Barbados'
tourism product, increase room capacity and further several specific objec-
tives. It would increase local ownership of tourism facilities, particularly
of those catering to the upper end of the market. It would encourage purchas-
ing linkages with agriculture and fisheries. It would provide more employment



- 11 -
opportunities per room than much of the recent expansion of other types of
accommodation on the island. The project would increase management opportuni-
ties of tourism facilities for Barbadians, particularly of those catering to
the upper end of the market, and serve as a vehicle for the financial partici-
pation of Barbadians with limited funds for investment, many of whom already
have substantial managerial experience in foreign owned hotels. It would
demonstrate the advantages of grouping small hotels where operators share
common services and facilities. The project would help to stimulate the
growth of economic activities in the northern part of the island and would
set examples for future tourism development with respect to protecting the
physical environment and public access to it, while making optimal economic
use of a prime tourism location.
B. Project Description
2.06      The project would consist of the following major elements:
(a)  the construction, furnishing and equipping of five Heywoods
Village hotels and two apartels totaling 308 guest rooms;
(b)  the construction, furnishing and equipping of common buildings
and other facilities for the Heywoods Village, including an
administration building, shopping area, central restaurant,
discotheque, meeting hall, beach market, internal roads, parking,
public access to the beach, landscaping, utilities including
solar water heating, laundry, small sports center, central
swimming pool, nine-hole golf course, tennis courts and main-
tenance facilities;
(c)  the construction of a bypass road around Speightstown and the
Heywoods Village which would divert traffic from the present
road through the town and along the beach;.
(d)  a marketing program for the Heywoods Village;
(e)  technical expertise for central management of the village; and
(f)  project administration.
Buildings and Facilities
2.07      The five hotels and two apartels have been planned in the form of a
fairly dense "village" roughly parallel to the beach alongside a landscaped
footpath in a north-south alignment (Map 14044). Each building will have a
view of the sea. Of the hotels, three would have 32 guest rooms each and
two would have 48 guest rooms each. The two apartels would each have 58
apartments. Room plans have been designed to provide convenient space com-
mensurate with the intended market for the village. The hotels would include
a reception office, lobby, bar, lounge, restaurant and a manager's apartment.



- 12 -
Apartels would have rooms large enough to provide for additional sitting
space and would have a kitchenette. No restaurant would be provided in the
apartels.
2.08      An administration and shopping arcade would be located in the
center of the village and would house the central administration offices, a
sick bay, a small supermarket, car and cycle rental office, five shops and a
beauty parlor.
2.09      The beach market has been designed as a flexible structure to be
used by hotel/apartel guests, day visitors and the general public. The
primary purposes, however, would be to provide space for the production,
display and sale of local handicrafts, and space for a beach bar which would
serve both tourists and the local population.
2.10      Laundry and maintenance facilities would be incorporated into a
general service area for the whole village, and would include space for
maintenance staff and security guards and a waste collection yard.
2.11      Facilities to be provided under the project for the recreation and
entertainment of tourists and the local population would include:
(a)  a small building with a floor area of about 700 sq ft to be built
near the main entrance to the village at the edge of the golf
course to serve as a small sports and equipment hire center;
(b)  retention of the basic structure of the former Heywoods House (a
plantation house) with its coral stone outbuildings as part of the
central facilities housing a bar, restaurant and discotheque;
(c)  a meeting hall to provide an area within the village suitable for
entertainment purposes or for holding meetings and seminars. The
main seating hall, with a capacity of 206 seats, would include a
projection room, small stage and dressing rooms. The hall would
also serve the local population since no such facility is currently
available near Speightstown;
(d)  five tennis courts, including one exhibition court with open
seating to accommodate up to 200 spectators, a small pro-shop, a
swimming pool with changing rooms and shuffle board courts; and
(e)  an attractively designed nine-hole par-3 golf course which will
occupy an otherwise less useful and less attractive part of the
site.
Infrastructure
2.12       Infrastructure would include a 22 ft. wide main access road into
the Heywoods Village from a bypass road (para. 2.20) to be built around the
village. From this main access road, smaller cul-de-sac streets would provide



- 13 -
vehicular access to the hotels and common buildings. A network of footpaths
would be built connecting the various buildings and recreational facilities.
About 200 car parking spaces would be provided within the village and 110
additional spaces would be located at the southern and northern ends of the
beach for the use of the local population. An external lighting system would
be installed in all public areas for safety purposes and to enhance the over-
all appearance of the village at night.
2.13      Safe, good quality water is available in sufficient quantity from
two existing nearby well sites. The Barbados water supply system operated by
the Ministry of Communications and Works, would serve the village using a
new 12" diameter main to bring in water. Distribution within the site would
be by means of a 6" diameter incoming supply line and a 4" diameter ring
main. The water supply to each hotel/apartel, to concessions and to common
facilities would be metered separately.
2.14      A sewerage system would be constructed for the village and would
include 6" diameter gravity drains, 4 pumping stations and a sewage treatment
plant located at the end of the site. In view of the limited availability of
land, the sewage treatment plant would use an activited sludge process. It
would be designed for a final effluent having 30 mg/l suspended solids and
a 5 day biochemical oxygen demand of 20 mg/l at 20 C. The effluent would be
discharged into drainage wells located about 2,000 ft. inland. The wells
would be drilled to a sufficient depth to assure that they would reach below
the fresh water lens. There is no danger of polluting the water supply
sources as all water well fields are well identified and protected.
2.15      Storm water would be drained through a system of concrete box drains
and would be discharged through outfalls into the sea. Since the site is low,
the outfall points would be within reach of the waves and would require regular
clearing of sand from the drains.
2.16      Electric power would be supplied by the Barbados Light and Power
Company from its distribution network. Entry of the high voltage supply
(11 kv) would be made at two locations and an underground system of PVC ducts
in the form of a ring would be provided for the high voltage cables. Company
owned transformers would be installed in transformer rooms provided under the
project. Buildings and other facilities would be metered separately. To
provide power for essential services during a power failure, a 190 kva standby
generator would be installed.
2.17      Telephone service would be provided by the Barbados Telephone
Company from an existing exchange located about one mile south of Speightstown.
Individual Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) systems would be used for
each hotel/apartel and for the central administration. Through an internal
distribution system, one extension per room plus other extensions for support
services would be installed. Telex facilities would be provided to the
central office.
2.18      Solid waste from hotels and public areas would be collected daily
by electric carts and transported to the service complex. After sorting, all



- 14 -
organic matter would be shredded and reused for landscaping purposes. Other
waste would be stored in bulk storage bins and removed to a designated dump
or sanitary landfill area by a commercial operator. This practice is used
by other hotels, is approved by the Sanitation Department of the Ministry of
Health, and works satisfactorily.
2.19      To conserve fuel resources and to take advantage of Barbados' sunny
climate, solar energy would be used to meet the hot water requirements of the
village facilities. Four solar heating "banks" mounted on simple structures
over parts of the car parking lots, with storage tanks at ground level along-
side, would be provided. Each solar heating bank would supply two or more
buildings. A separate booster system would be installed for the laundry with
solar panels located on the roof. Auxiliary electric heating elements within
the storage tanks would be used to help meet peak demands or during consecu-
tive cloudy days. It is estimated that about 75% of village hot water needs
could be supplied by solar energy.
Other Components
2.20      The existing Highway 1B, which is a major thoroughfare passing
through the center of Speightstown, follows the coastline in a south-north
direction and separates the Heywoods Village site from the beach (Map 14045).
To alleviate traffic congestion in Speightstown and allow for a natural and
safe integration of the Heywoods Village with the beach, through traffic must
be diverted. Under the project, a 1.8 mile bypass road would run along the
eastern boundary of Speightstown and Heywoods Village and would rejoin the
existing Highway 1B at the northern end of Heywoods Beach. The existing
road along most of the beach would be removed, thus allowing the beach to be
widened and improved. The remaining parts of the existing highway on the
project site would become cul-de-sac and would continue to provide direct
public access to the beach. The present road at the southern end of the site
would be upgraded and would connect the existing highway with the bypass.
The bypass would have a 24 ft. wide carriageway in accordance with Government
standards. As the land is generally fairly low-lying, particularly near the
the Heywoods Village, appropriate drainage would be provided.
2.21      The project also includes a three and a half year marketing and
promotional program for the village, technical expertise for central manage-
ment of the village during the pre-opening period and the first two years
of operation, other pre-opening expense and working capital for the central
corporation and a project implementation unit.
C. Project Cost
2.22      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.2 million
equivalent (including duties and taxes estimated at US$0.7 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of US$10.9 million. The estimated costs and
foreign exchange components are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 with details
provided in Annex I, Table 11.



- 15 -
2.23      Cost estimates for civil works, furniture, fixtures and equipment
for the Heywoods Village are based on actual, recent costs of constructing and
equipping hotels and apartels in Barbados, and on preliminary architectural
and engineering studies prepared by the consultants, Robertson Ward Associates.
Cost estimates for the bypass road are based on engineering studies carried
out by the Ministry of Communications and Works.
2.24      Base costs of civil works were estimated in September 1978 prices
and updated to March 1979. The average construction cost per square foot of
gross floor area of project structures varies from about US$19 for common and

sport buildings to about US$27 for hotels and apartels. Furniture and fix-
ture costs have been estimated at about 22% of the value of construction.
The average total cost per hotel/apartel room in constant prices is about
US$44,500. Cost of internationally recruited specialists for the technical
assistance included in the technical assistance expenditures component is esti-
mated at an average of US$5,560 per man-month for a total of 75 man-months.
2.25      Directly imported building materials, equipment, furniture and
fixtures would be exempt from customs duties and have been costed accordingly.
However, some of the building materials to be used and fuel and vehicles for
transport would be acquired by contractors on the open market and would be
subject to duties and taxes that are estimated at US$0.7 million equivalent.
2.26      For physical cost increases, 10% has been added to the base cost of
construction, furniture, fixtures and equipment of the project buildings and to
professional services, and 15% to the base cost of infrastructure. Estimated
price increases are based upon the application of annual percentage rates of
price escalation (Annex I, Table 12). Total contingencies amount to US$3.9
million, equal to about 32% of the base cost estimate.
D. Project Financial Plan
2.27      The financial plan (Table 3 and Annex I, Table 13) provides for:
(a)  a Government contribution of US$6.0 million equivalent, representing
about 35% of the total project cost of US$17.2 million;
(b)  a CDB loan of US$3.2 million equivalent, representing about 19% of
total project cost, for financing 80% of the investment cost of:
(i) civil works and equipment for village infrastructure, sport
facilities and landscaping;
(ii) all furniture and fixtures; and
(iii) project administration.
(c) an IBRD loan of US$8.0 million equivalent, representing about 46%
of total project cost, for financing the foreign exchange component
of:
(i) civil works and equipment of all buildings and the solar water
heating system;
(ii) civil works of the bypass road;
(iii) professional services; and
(iv) marketing and technical assistance expenditures.

2.28      CDB would provide parallel cofinancing for clearly identifiable
components of the project (para 2.27) which can be readily grouped for pro-
curement purposes. In accordance with its regular policies, the CDB loan
would be repayable at 8% interest for a period over 15 years including a
3-year grace period. CDB Board approval for its participation in the co-
financing of the loan will be a condition of effectiveness.
2.29      IBRD and CDB funds would be lent to the Government of Barbados.
The loan funds required to implement the Heywoods Village project would be
passed on to the Ministry of Tourism, while the funds for the bypass road
would be channelled to the Ministry of Communications and Works.

E. Project Implementation
Project Execution
2.30      Responsibility for executing the project would rest with the Ministry
of Tourism. It plans to delegate responsibility for the bypass road to the
Ministry of Communications and Works. Both Ministries have the requisite
experience and competence to execute their respective responsibilities for
the project. A Project Implementation Unit is being set up within the
Ministry of Tourism to ensure proper supervision of design and construction
and to coordinate between the Ministries. The Project Unit would have a
manager, an engineer, an accountant, a procurement officer and other support
staff. An airport project, which the Ministry of Tourism is currently in the
process of implementing, is expected to be completed by mid-1979, and the
Ministry plans to transfer several of the staff including the already desig-
nated manager from this project to the Project Implementation Unit. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that the unit's key staff will be
appointed by June 30, 1979 whose qualifications and experience and terms and
conditions of employment would be satisfactory to the Bank.
2.31      Inappropriate development of about 100 acres of undeveloped land
adjacent to the project site could have a negative impact on the project.
Accordingly, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Govern-
ment will ensure that any future development of this adjacent land will be
controlled in a manner consistent with sound town and country planning con-
cepts with due regard to the requirements of the project. Under the Land
Development Duty Act the private owners of this land will be subject to taxes
on possible windfall gains which may result from the project.
Procurement
2.32      Contracts for civil works and the procurement of equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. However, equipment which cannot be grouped into packages
of at least US$50,000 equivalent, and civil works contracts of less than
US$100,000 equivalent, would be procured on the basis of local bidding pro-
cedures which are acceptable to the Bank. A maximum of US$200,000 in the
aggregate for equipment and a maximum of US$500,000 (excluding force account
expenditures) in the aggregate for civil works would be procured in this
manner. In the case of procurement under international competitive bidding
procedures, domestic manufacturers tendering under international procedures
would receive a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. cost or the applic-
able customs duty, whichever is lower, and regional preferences for other
members of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) would be limited to 15%
of the c.i.f. price of nonregional goods or the difference in the amount of
tariffs, payable by CARICOM and non-CARICOM suppliers, whichever is lower.
2.33      Consultants would be employed for the preparation of design and
bidding documents and for supervision of construction of the Heywoods Village
components and the contractor-executed part of the bypass road. In total,



- 20 -
professional services for final design and supervision would amount to 250
man-months. The Ministry of Communications and Works would design and con-
struct the part of the bypass road to be executed by force account.
2.34      The construction of an 0.8 mile section of the bypass road which
goes around the project site would be carried out on force account. The road
must be constructed and traffic diverted to it from the existing road through
the project site by early 1980, if construction of other project facilities
is to take place as scheduled. The construction of this portion of the bypass
road, on which some work has already been done and which can be used in the
new construction, would be undertaken by the Ministry of Communications and
Works. Quantities for work are difficult to establish and competitive bidding
would be unsuitable and unattractive to contractors. The Ministry has pres-
ently adequate force account capacity and equipment at its disposal to execute
this work effectively. The value of works to be carried out by force account
is estimated at about US$540,000 equivalent for road construction. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that as soon as the bypass road around the
project site is completed, the existing road through the site will be closed
and the traffic permanently diverted to the bypass road.
Disbursements
2.35      Disbursements of the proposed IBRD loan of US$8.0 million equivalent
would finance the following estimated foreign exchange expenditures:
(a) 70% of total expenditures of civil works on buildings and solar
water heating systems;
(b) 60% of total expenditures of civil works on the bypass road;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported and 85% of expenditures
for locally procured equipment for buildings and solar water
heating;
(d) 70% of total expenditures for professional services; and
(e) 100% of foreign expenditures for marketing and technical assistance
expenses.
2.36      Disbursements would be made against standard documentation except
for civil works for the construction of the bypass road to be carried out by
force account, which would be made against statements of expenditure, docu-
mentation for which would not be submitted to the Bank but retained by the
Project Unit for review during project supervision missions. These statements
of expenditure would be supported by quarterly progress reports duly certified
by the Project Unit. Assurances were obtained that annual accounts for the
Project iJnit will be,audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and will be furnished to the Bank.



- 21 -
2.37      The IBRD loan would be disbursed over a period of 5.5 years through
December 31, 1984 (Annex I, Table 15). Construction is scheduled to be com-
pleted by March 31, 1982 with technical assistance and marketing expenditures
continuing until June 30, 1984. In order not to delay implementation of the
project, retroactive financing of up to US$200,000 is recommended for expendi-
tures for architectural and engineering consultants' services incurred after
December 1, 1978. An estimated schedule of disbursements for the CDB loan
of US$3.2 million equivalent is shown in Annex I, Table 16.
III. MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPECTS
A. Caribbean Region
3.01      The Caribbean region offers excellent beach-oriented vacations
catering during the winter season (mid-December to mid-April) mainly to the
more affluent North American and European visitors and during the summer to the
more budget-minded tourists. The total number of tourists to the Caribbean
increased from 3.7 million in 1970 to 4.7 million in 1977 (Annex I, Table 17)
and is estimated to have exceeded 5 million in 1978. The annual growth rate
in tourist flows in the 1970-77 period was about 3.5%. As a result of the
severe recession in Europe and North America, traffic slowed substantially in
1974 and decreased in 1975 (-2%). In 1976, tourist traffic to the Caribbean
increased, but by less than 1%, reflecting competition from the US bicentennial
celebrations and the Olympic Games in Canada. Traffic picked up substantially
in 1977 (+6%) and partial figures for 1978 indicate an even higher growth rate,
attributed to the continuing economic recovery and to recent introductions of
discount fares on regularly scheduled flights.
3.02      The main sources of tourists to the Caribbean are the US, Canada and
Western Europe. The most recent data show the US accounting for 48% of total
tourist arrivals in the Caribbean, Canada for about 9% and European countries
for 6%. The high US share is explained partly by the inclusion among Caribbean
destinations of Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and the US Virgin Islands, which have
a disproportionate share of American visitors, both tourists and businessmen.
3.03      Canadian vacation visitors to the Caribbean comprise mainly singles
and middle-age couples from the lower-middle to upper class and require a mix
of accommodations from self-catering apartels to the more luxurious hotels.
By comparison, the US visitors tend to be somewhat older and more affluent and
tend to demand high quality accommodations. The advent of cheaper travel
resulting from the introduction of charters and promotional fare systems on
scheduled airlines is expected, however, to increase the percentage of middle
and lower-middle income groups among US visitors. European holiday visitors
typically are relatively affluent, travel mostly in couples and look for good
quality hotels.



- 22 -
3.04   ,  Future prospects for tourism in the Caribbean are considered favor-
able provided the economic recovery in the originating markets is sustained.
The Canadian and the US markets are expected to grow at a modest rate reflect-
ing increased market penetration of low cost group vacation travel, offset
somewhat by4slower economic growth.  By comparison, the number of European
visitors to, the Caribbean is expected to grow at a faster pace reflecting
higher economic growth, and increased vacation demand for long haul destina-
tions. Travel sources estimate the likely overall growth in tourism to the
Caribbea~n region over the long-term at 5 to 6% per annum or slightly below
ttht 6.5% growth rate observed prior to the 1974/75 recession.
B. Barbados
3r05      Barbados, as a sea, sun and sand resort destination with interesting
restaurant and cuisine styles, adequate entertainment and sport facilities,
duty-free shopping and, most importantly, an unusually friendly population,
appeals to a broad sector of the market. Relatively easy air access serves
as a major stimulant to tourism growth on the island. Price levels vary
widely but are essentially on a par with other developed tourist destinations
in the Caribbean.
3.06      Visitor traffic to Barbados reached 269,000 in 1977 (and an estimated
315,000 in 1978), in addition to over 100,000 cruise tourists. Between 1967
and 1977, tourist traffic increased three-fold or over 11% annually, substan-
tially higher than the growth rate for the region as a whole. Tourist flows
declined in 1975, reflecting the recession, and due to the Olympic Games and
US bicentennial celebrations, grew by only 1% in 1976. However, traffic has
revived with 20% growth in 1977 and an estimated 17% growth in 1978. The
relatively high tourism growth in Barbados can be attributed to:
(a)  increased supply and variety of accommodation;
(b)  adequate air access;
(c)  preservation of the natural setting of the island; and
(d)  lack of hostile feelings towards tourists which has affected tourism
to some other Caribbean destinations.
3.07      Canadian tourism which in 1977 was the most important originating
market for Barbados and accounted for 31% of total tourists (Annex I, Table 3),
is likely to continue growing, albeit at a less rapid pace than in the last
decade. A major stimulating force is expected to result from planned promo-
tional drives by Barbados in the western provinces of Canada which until now
have provided only a minor proportion of the Canadian visitors. For the US
market, which accounted for 26% of the visitor arrivals to Barbados in 1977,
increased frequency of scheduled and charter flights and recent availability
of various promotional fares enhance the potential for tourism to Barbados,



- 23 -
while the expected slower growth of the US economy has a restraining impact.
The UK accounted for 10% and Germany for 4% of total visitors in 1977 with
the German share increasing in recent years with the general increase in
German tourism abroad reflecting increased holiday entitlements and disposable
income. The prospects for increase in European arrivals are bright due to
expected sustained economic growth and the present low level of market pene-
tration by Barbados.
3.08      A regression analysis was conducted relating the past number of
visitors from the three largest markets (Canada, US and UK) to the level
of economic activity in these markets (as measured by the GDP) and to the
relative price indexes in Barbados and the originating markets, after adjust-
ment for exchange rate fluctuations (Annex I, Tables 18-20). The analysis
shows that each 1% growth in GDP has been associated with a 2.1% growth in
Canadian visitors, a 2.7% increase in US visitors and a 3.1% increase in UK
visitors. Furthermore, a 1% increase in relative prices in Barbados has been
associated with a 1% decline in US visitors but had no significant impact on
the number of Canadian or UK visitors. Assuming (i) an increase of 3% per
annum in GDP in each of the originating countries, (ii) no increase in rela-
tive prices in Barbados in the future after acccounting for exchange rate
adjustments and (iii) a GDP demand elasticity of 2 for markets not accounted
for by the regression analysis, the projected rate of growth of tourism
arrivals would be 7% per annum which has been adopted in the market projec-
tions for Barbados. This is substantially in line with the 6.5% growth pro-
jected in the Tourism Development Plan for Barbados prepared by the OAS in
1977.
C. Heywoods Village
3.09      The potential demand for the Heywoods Village originates from two
sources: (i) the increase in tourism to Barbados in general and (ii) the
specific demand generated by the village concept.
3.10      Total hotel guestnights (excluding apartels, apartments and guest-
houses) in Barbados in 1977 amounted to about 634,000, of which 560,000 were
spent in the higher Category I and II hotels. Total guestnights spent in
apartels and apartments amounted to 892,000, of which 374,000 were in the
higher Category I and II apartels and Category I apartments (Annex I, Table
21). Assuming an overall 7% annual growth in tourists, plus the specific
demand generated by the village concept (para. 3.11), and no change in the
average length of stay, by 1985 an additional 430,000 guestnights in higher
category hotels and 290,000 guestnights in higher category apartels will need
to be accommodated. Since 225,000 additional guestnights would, in principle,
be absorbed by existing hotels and apartel facilities through an increase in
average room occupancy from about 60% in 1977 to 70% in 1985, only the demand
for 300,000 hotel guestnights and 195,000 apartel guestnights will have to be
accommodated through construction of new accommodation. This requirement--at
70% room occupancy--translates into some 630 new hotel rooms and 400 apartel
rooms in the higher categories. The proposed Heywoods Village would provide



- 24 -
192 hotel rooms and 116 apartel rooms or about 30% of this additional capacity
required by 1985. Since few high quality beach sites on the west coast are
still undeveloped, the remaining supply gap is expected to be provided for
mainly through expansion of existing hotels and apartels.
3.11      The Heywoods Village is expected to generate additional demand for
its village concept which aims to combine demand for accommodation in high
quality small hotels and apartels with the demand for central facilities
usually provided only by large luxury hotels. A market research study con-
ducted in 1978 by consultants (the Economic Intelligence Unit) concluded that
by 1985 about 6,100 visitors or one third of total annual visitors projected
for the Heywoods Village can be attributed solely to the village concept.
3.12      Present trends of hotel expansion in Barbados and the adoption of
new policies toward hotel development indicate that accommodation capacity
will increase over the intermediate-term future at about 5% annually. Such
expansion, together with the expected increase in demand projected for
Barbados, implies a 70% room occupancy by 1985 for the Heywoods Village as
well as for existing and newly constructed hotels on the island. Taking into
account the marketing difficulties encountered in the early years of opera-
tions, the room occupancies for the Heywoods Village are assumed to be only
40% in 1982, rising to 55% in 1983, 65% in 1984 and 70% in 1985.
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization
4.01      The Government plans to form a wholly-owned statutory corporation,
the Barbados Tourism Investment Corporation (BTIC) to own the assets of the
Heywoods Village and to provide overall management and coordination for its
operation. In addition to managing the village, the Corporation would own
and maintain principal fixed assets, and would own and operate the central
restaurant, beach bar, discotheque, and golf course. The hotels and apartels,
laundry, gift shops, beach handicraft market, minimarket, cycle rentals and
the water sports facilities would be leased to private operators and conces-
sionaires who would supply the working capital and would pay fees to the
Corporation for facilities and services. Services to be provided by the
Corporation would include management and maintenance of common facilities
such as internal roads, sewerage, tennis courts, other recreation facilities,
grounds, and the village hall. In addition, the Corporation would coordinate
the operations of the hotel/apartel operators and concessionaires and provide
them with central marketing, central purchasing, financial guidance, training
and quality control assistance. Draft legislation acceptable to the Bank for
the establishment of the Corporation assuring administrative and financial
autonomy to the Corporation along with a satisfactory organization plan for
the village have been submitted to the Bank. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that future changes in the organization plan would require prior
consultation with the Bank. Enactment of the legislation in a satisfactory
form will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.



- 25 -
4.02      The Corporation's Board of Directors will have overall responsi-
bility for establishing policy and reviewing management performance and will
report to Government through the Ministry of-Tourism. The Government plans
to appoint representatives of the Ministries of Tourism and of Finance and
Planning, a hotel/apartel-operator from the village on a revolving basis, and
persons from various professional backgrounds in the private sector as members
of the Board. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that at least one
hotel/apartel operator from Heywoods Village will be appointed to the Board
and that a majority of the Board members will be drawn from the private
sector.
4.03      Government contributions to village investment (including interest
during construction and other charges) of about BDS$12.5 million (US$6.25
million), representing about 38% of total village investment cost of about
BDS$32.7 million, will be invested in the Corporation as equity. Funds lent
by the Bank and the CDB for the village, adding to about BDS$21.5 million,
will be passed on to the Corporation as a long term loan. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that Government contributions will be in the form
of equity and that funds provided by the Bank and by CDB will be repaid by
the Corporation to the Government over a twelve-year period including three
years of grace at an interest rate of 10%. These terms are consistent with
prevailing loan terms in Barbados. The average inflation rate in Barbados in
the 1976-1978 period was 7%. The inflation rate for the 1979-1981 period is
expected to average 7.5%.
4.04      The innovative project design involves some unique aspects--
especially the relatively autonomous entrepreneurial role of the individual
hotel/apartel operators, as compared with a traditional resort--which tend
to increase certain operating costs, reduce the share of profits received by
the ownership corporation and increase risks. The Heywoods Village therefore
would be unlikely to attract the interest of private investors until it is
successfully established. At that time, the Government will formulate its
views with respect to possible sale of village assets or equity to private
investors to produce liquid funds which could be utilized in new development
activity. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government
will submit a completion report to the Bank on the execution and initial
operation of the project and containing its views on the possible sale of
the whole or part of Heywoods Village in the form of shares or otherwise to
Barbadians without jeopardy to the project's objectives.
4.05      The proposed organization of the BTIC is shown in Chart I.  Author-
ity and full responsibility for management of the village in an efficient,
commercially-oriented fashion will be delegated to a General Manager who will
be retained on a management contract initially of at least five years' dura-
tion. He and the other senior management of the Corporation, including a
Food and Beverage Manager, Financial Manager and Marketing Manager would be
responsible for providing technical assistance and training to hotel/apartel
operators and concessionaires as well as for Corporation management functions.

To the extent that these senior management personnel may not be Barbadian,
local staff would be trained to take over these functions eventually. Funds
to finance the services of key senior personnel during the preopening period
and the first two years of operation are included in the project. It was
agreed during negotiations that the qualifications and experience and terms
and conditions of employment of the General Manager, Financial Manager, Food
and Beverage Manager and Marketing Manager shall be satisfactory to the Bank.
It was further agreed that the General Manager would be employed no later than
January 1, 1981.
B. Management
4.06      The Heywoods Village organization and management structure is
designed to provide an appropriate degree of control over marketing, food and
beverage operations, quality control and village management, while allowing
a significant degree of management autonomy for the individual hotel/apartel
operators and concessionaires in the operation of their businesses. To
achieve this objective, the General Manager would be responsible for preparing
an operations manual outlining the policies and standard operating procedures
which the Corporation and the operators and concessionaires of the leased
businesses would be expected to follow. In addition, the Government plans to
establish a Village Management Committee (VMC) to provide a forum for partici-
pation of hotel/apartel operators and concessionaires in decision making and
to improve coordination and communication. The VMC would be chaired by the
General Manager and would include, as members, the senior management of the
Corporation, all hotel/apartel operators and at least one representative of
the concessionaires. VMC responsibilities would include:
(a) establishing tariff and discount structures and policies for room
and hotel restaurant sales;
(b) providing guidance to the central marketing department on promo-
tional policy and programs and on selection of and negotiation with
sales representatives, wholesalers, and tour operators;
(c)  dealing with labor disputes and recommending terms, conditions and
pay scales for non-managerial persons employed within the village;
(d) making recommendations to the management of the Corporation
regarding policies, procedures, and quality standards including
proposals for modifications of the operations manual;
(e) formulating training programs and training standards for employees;
and
(f) resolving disputes involving operators and concessionaires and, if
unable to effect settlement, forwarding recommendations through the
General Manager to the Board.



- 28 -
4.07      The Central Marketing Department, under the direction of the mar-
keting Manager, would with guidance from the VMC, have responsibility for
planning marketing programs, conducting marketing promotion activities,
negotiating with sales representatives, wholesalers and tour operators,
and processing bookings from these sources on behalf of the hotel/apartels.
Hotel/apartel operators would allocate the number of their rooms to be sold
through the Central Marketing Department. This Department would assign
bookings when preferences for individual units are not expressed, as well
as overflow bookings, through a rotational system based on unsold allocated
rooms. The operators would individually market their unallocated and unsold
rooms through travel agents and individuals.
4.08      The initial marketing campaign, including proper planning, design
of materials, selection of target markets and intensive and skillful pre-
selling are crucial for the success of the project. Accordingly, the task of
planning and, as necessary, implementing the overseas marketing program during
an 18-month preopening period and at least the first two years of operation
should be undertaken with the assistance of experienced marketing firms with
an established reputation in Barbados' principal markets. The Marketing
Manager would work closely with the firm or firms and would perform all
central marketing functions upon completion of the contract. Assurances were
obtained that marketing consultants will be retained whose selection and terms
and conditions of contract will be acceptable to the Bank to assist in the
preparation and the strategic design and promotional aspects of a marketing
program. Assurances were also obtained that the marketing program will be
submitted to the Bank for its approval no later than March 31, 1981.
4.09      The Food and Beverage Manager, in addition to overseeing the
directly operated central food and beverage activities, would be responsible
for training restaurant employees, setting and enforcing minimum quality
control standards for all food sold in the village, providing technical
assistance on menu preparation and restaurant management and operating a
central purchasing service.
4.10      Central purchasing would be done on the basis of orders submitted
by all food sales operations in the village and hotel operators would be en-
couraged, but not required, to use this service. The objective would be to
use the resulting substantial volume of business to negotiate better prices
and improve the quality and priorities in obtaining supplies. It should also
help to raise the quality of food served in village restaurants. While the
village would of necessity have to purchase from sources providing acceptable
quality, service and prices, it is anticipated that these volume purchases
would assist the Speightstown fishing industry and the small farm cooperatives
growing vegetables which are proposed in IDB and CDB projects for the area
(para. 7.01).
4.11      The Financial Manager, in addition to his corporate financial
responsibilities, would provide some technical assistance to the hotel/
apartel operators and, to a lesser extent, the concessionaires. He would
assist each operator in setting up the original books of account based on the



- 29 -
uniform system of hotel accounts 1/ and would train the operator and his
accountant or bookkeeper to keep the books and prepare financial statements.
He would assist in reviewing annual budgets and would review hotel/apartel
financial performance on a quarterly basis against budgets and the performance
of other hotels. He would meet periodically with each operator to discuss
performance, financial condition, trends, problem areas and means of dealing
with them.
4.12      The seven hotels and apartels would be leased to experienced
operators who would be chosen under selection criteria listed in the organi-
zation plan for the village which would include:
(a) at least five years' senior management experience in hotels
of at least 25 rooms;
(b) at least one full year of study at a recognized hotel training
institution or equivalent on-the-job training;
(c) an undertaking to work personally as the full-time manager of the
hotel/apartel;
(d) financial capability to provide sufficient capital to open and
adequately maintain the operations of the leased hotel/apartel;
and
(e) Barbadian nationality.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that criteria for the selection
of hotel/apartel operators will be acceptable to the Bank.
4.13      Ten year renewable lease agreements would be signed with hotel/
apartel operators under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. On
renewed leases the Corporation should raise rents to reflect market rates for
space in well established hotel/apartels. Provisions of a draft model lease,
acceptable to the Bank, between the Corporation and the individual hotel/
apartel operators have been submitted to the Bank. Some general terms and
conditions of these leases are listed in Annex III and relate to participation
in the VMC, employment policies, pricing and discount structure, role of the
operators in relation to the central marketing function, maintenance of
standards and facilities, working capital levels, rental payments and terms,
financial reporting and conditions for sale or possible termination of leases.
Assurances were obtained that terms and conditions of lease agreements with
hotel/apartel operators will be acceptable to the Bank.
4.14      The concessions including the laundry, gift shops, beach handicraft
market, minimarket, water sports and cycle rental will be leased to qualified
concessionaires in agreements with similar terms and conditions to those of
the hotel/apartel leases, as appropriate. They will, however, generally be

for shorter time periods. Assurances were obtained that the beach handicraft
market will be leased on terms that will promote its use as an effective handi-
craft production and marketing center for the northern part of the island.
Assurances were also obtained that terms and conditions of lease agreements
with concessionaires will be acceptable to the Bank.
4.15      The taxi concession, as is the practice elsewhere in Barbados, will
be assigned to a taxi association for a fixed fee. With respect to transpor-
tation, the proposed project is located some 21 miles from the international
airport and 12 miles from Bridgetown. It is essential, therefore, that ade-
quate transportation services be provided. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the taxi concession agreement will include provisions
requiring the concessionaire to transfer tourists in groups to and from the
airport and Bridgetown on a regular basis at reasonable cost.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Barbados Tourism Investment Corporation
5.01      BTIC income projections for the 1982-1989 period are shown in
Table 4. After experiencing large losses in the first three years of opera-
tion, primarily as a result of high fixed interest and high depreciation and
amortization expense relative to house profit, the Corporation is expected to
operate on approximately a break-even level in 1985 and on an increasingly
profitable basis thereafter.  Profits before tax in current prices grow from
about BDS$0.4 million in 1986 to about BDS$3.5 million in 1989. In 1989,
profits before tax represent a return of 24% on the Corporation's sales, 23%
on equity and 12% on total assets employed (Annex I, Table 22). Despite the
initial losses, the Corporation is expected to exceed the breakeven point on
cash flow from operations in the second year and is expected to earn a finan-
cial internal rate of return on total investment of about 14% in current
prices and 7% in constant prices . Projections are based on the assumptions
outlined in Annex II.
5.02      For the first typical year, 1985, over 60% of the Corporation's
revenues are composed of charges to hotel/apartels and concessions with most
of the remainder produced by the Corporation operated central restaurant,
beach bar, discotheque and golf course (Annex I, Table 23). For Corporation
direct operations, gross operating income averages 33% of sales, overhead,
excluding allocation of central overhead, is 17% and house profit is 16% of
total sales. However, these businesses contribute only 13% of the Corpora-
tion's total house profit, despite contributing 37% of its total revenue,
because operating costs are higher than those associated with the revenues)
from charges to hotel/apartels and concessions. Central overhead expense of
about BDS$2.8 million in 1985 amounts to 25% of total revenue.
5.03      BTIC income statements do not include the revenues, expenses (other
than payments to the Corporation) and profits of the hotel/apartels and con-
cessions which are independent legal entities. Projected income statements

for the entire Village including these entities on a combined basis (Annex I,
Table 24) provide an indication of overall village financial results and show
1985 total village revenues more than 100% higher and house profit about 25%
higher than BTIC revenues and house profit alone.
5.04      Projected balance sheets and sources and uses of funds statements
for BTIC for the 1982-1989 period (Tables 5 and 6) depict, as do the income
statements, a generally satisfactory and stable financial picture. The
Corporation must borrow about BDS$1 million during the first year of opera-
tions to maintain working capital requirements in the face of large operating
losses. These borrowings, however, can be fully repaid in the second year of
operation as cash flows become positive. Reflecting these short term borrow-
ing requirements, the projected current ratio is a low 0.6 to 1 at the end of
1982, but does not drop below 2.5 to 1 thereafter. Debt service coverage is a
low but adequate 1.5 in 1986, when the first full year of principal payments
on long term debt is scheduled to commence, and improves slowly thereafter.
Equity as a percentage of the long term capital structure drops from an
initial 38% to a low of 25% at the end of 1984 as a result of losses, then
increases steadily thereafter, as retained earnings levels increase. The
Government plans to establish a profit sharing plan for BTIC employees to
distribute a portion of future retained earnings.
5.05      Hotel/apartel accounts should be maintained in conformity with the
Uniform System of Hotel Accounting. Assurances were obtained that annual
audited accounts for the hotels and apartels on a summarized basis, prepared
in accordance with the uniform system of accounts, would be submitted to the
Bank. Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that annual accounts
for the Corporation, audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
will be submitted to the Bank within four months of the end of each fiscal
year.
B. Hotel/Apartels and Concessions
5.06      The financial revenues and the occupancies for the individual
hotel/apartels are an essential determinant of the success of the Corporation
and every business associated with it. Projected income statements for the
seven hotel/apartels on a combined basis for the 1982-1989 period are shown
in Annex I, Table 25. On a combined basis, total hotel/apartel revenues in
1985 are composed of 77% room sales and 23% food and beverage sales. Direct
costs average 19% of room sales, 74% of food and beverage sales and 32% of
total sales. Overhead, including an imputed salary for the operator, is 38%
of total revenue and house profit is 30% (Annex I, Table 26). Operating
results, of course, differ among the types of hotels, as shown in the pro-
jected income statements for a 32-room hotel, a 48-room hotel and a 58-room
apartel in Annex I, Tables 27, 28 and 29.

5.07      Hotel/apartel. operator.. would lease the builc'Q.ngs, equipment, furni-
ture and fixtures from the Corporation but wouid themselves provide the work-
ing capital investment including that for chiLia, linen and cutlery and would
personally manage their respective hotel/apartel on a semi-autonomou3 basis
subject to the lease conditions, operations manual policies and the procedures
and decis.ons of the VMC (para. 4.06). Operators would pay the Corporation a
rental fee amounting to 40% of net room sales for the 48-room hotel and 32%
for the 32-room hotels and apartels. They would also be responsible for pay-
ing the BTIC 15% to 17% of total revenues (depending on type of hotel/apartel)
as reimbursement for the appropriate cost or hotel-related overhead borne by
the Corporation including central marketing, repair and maintenance, gardening
and hot water supplies. The operator's total financial compensation in 1985
is projected at 6.6% of sales ia :he 32-room hotels, 5.6% of sales in 48-room
hotels and 5.7% of sales in anarzels and would be based on performance.
5.08      A 32-room hotel would require initial invescments by the operator
of about BDS$135,000 (US$67,500) and would yield a projected before-tax com-
pensation it, current prices of BDS$121,000 (US$60,500) to the operator in the
typical vear of 1985. Similarly a 48-room hotel would require an investment
by the operator of about BDS$230,000 (US$115,000) and would vield total com-
pensation in 1985 of BDS$153,000 (US$81,500). For the apartels, investment
reouirements would be BDS$170,000 (US$85,000) and total compensation to the
oeprator would be BDS$122,GDO ($61,000). These projected compensation levels
represent returns to the operators of 23 to 27% on 1985 net working capital
investment in addition to equitable imputed salaries ranging from BDSS49,000
to BDS$65,000 (BDS$30,000 to $40,000 in 1978 prices) based on complexity of
management responsibilities. Projected investment requirements and compensa-
tion for hotel/apartel operators are shown in Annex I, Table 30. `
5.09      Under the Hotel Aids Act, during the first ten years, operators
who incorporate would be taxed only on money they take out of the business as
salary or dividends. Earnings reinvested in net working capital, as well as
the operator's option, subject to Corporation approval, to sell his lease,
which can be valued at about five times anticipated annual return would allow
the operator opportunities to accumulate capital assets.
5.10      Projected levels of compensation and opporturities for capital gains
compare favorably with existiag salary levels for Barbadian senior level hotel
management personnel which presently average BDS$20,000 to BDS$40,000 for the
larger luxury hotels and should provide sufficient incentive to attract well-
qualified operators. There are a number of potential operators who, by aug-
menting their financial resources by borrowing from the BDB and commercial
banks, should be able to finance expected investment requirements.
5.11      Concessionaires would also provide the working capital for their
businesses and would pay a percentage of sales as rent. A financial projec-
tion for the various concessions in 1985 shows exrected house profits before
tax ranging from 7% to 21% of sales and from BDS$51,000 to BDS$85,000 in
current pL.es (Annex I, Table 31).

VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Project Benefits and Costs
6.01      The expenditures of Heywoods Village hotel/apartel guests on goods
and services are defined as the economic benefits of the pr-oject.  These
expenditur--s are incurred in the hotel/apartels (room, food and beverage), in
the central facilities (central restaurant, beach bar, discotheque, golf
course) and in the various concessitcns operated within the village (gift shop,
mini-market, handicraft center and water sports).  The benefits have been
calculated from the financial revenue projections (Annex I, Tables 23, 25 and
31) with the following adjustments:
(a) all revenues were calciilated in constant 1978 prices;
(b'  an 8% Gtvernment sales tax and a 10% service charge were added to
hotel and restaurant revenues;
(c) a shadow foreign excnange rate of US$1 = BDS$2.40 was applied to
tourist expenditures
(d) expenditures by Barbadians within the village were excluded since
some of these might be diverted from existing enterprises on the
island. This assumption tends to underestimate benefits since some
of the facilities provide a unique product (e.g. village hall); and
(e)  Heywoods Village guest expenditures outside the village wece added
to project benefits. These include outside expenditures on food
and beverage (US$2.50 per day for hotel guests and US$2 per day for
ap.rtel guests) and internel transportation (US$20 per tourist
stay). Expenditure on air travel with the national airline and on
airport taxes were excluded because the costs associated w.th them
could not be clearly identified. Furthermore, benefits attributable
to the Speightstown bypass road were not taken into account because
of lack ef data on users' time savings and vehicle velocities,
lending additional ccnservative bias to the economic benefits
estimate.
6.02      The costs associated with these benefits are as follows:
(a) initial invesUaent cost (including working capital) and replacpment
cost of buildings, furniture, fittings and equipment;
(b) operating costs of the various village facilities; and
(c) operating costs related to Heywoods Village guest expenditures
outside the village, which have been calculated at 70%. of expendi-
tures for food and entertainment and 50% for ground transportation.



- 37 -
6.03      Revenues diverted from other hotels and associated operating costs
have been excluded from project benefits and costs. Since in the low season
higher category hotels in Barbados are currently operating at only 50% room
occupancy and only one third of the Heywoods Village guests can be considered
a captive market, it is clear that some guests will be diverted from other
hotels and do not represent incremental project benefits. In 1982, two-thirds
of the bednights generated in the low season (or 30% of total revenues) can
be considered diverted. Between 1982 and 1987, the portion of diverted
revenues decreases linearly from 30% of total revenues to zero as the pro-
jected increase in demand for higher category accommodation increases relative
to available supply.
6.04      Operating costs in 1978 constant prices have been derived from the
financial projections (Annex II). Interest, depreciation and amortization,
and internal transfer charges within the village have been eliminated.
Opportunity costs for hotel manager salaries were included.
6.05      The detailed cost and benefit streams are given in Annex I, Table 32.
The economic rate of return on the project is 17.5% (best estimate). Sensi-
tivity tests show how changes in various assumptions are expected to affect
the economic rate of return (ERR) on the project:
Assumption                          Change       ERR (%)
(a)  Best estimate                                    --          17.5

2         13.9
B. Project Beneficiaries
6.06      Project beneficiaries include (i) the Government, (ii) individual
hotel, apartel and concession lessees, (iii) employees in hotel/apartels and
other tourist facilities, and (iv) producers of goods and services consumed
by Heywoods Village guests. In 1985, about 55% of the direct benefits from
the project are retained by the village employees, 30% by the Government, and
15% by village hotel/apartel operators, concessionaires and outside restaurant
owners.
6.07      Total employment within Heywoods Village is estimated at about
500 employees at an average annual wage/salary (1978 prices) of BDS$10,000
(US$5,000). An additional 300 jobs will be created outside the village in



- 38 -
related enterprises such as transportation, restaurants, entertainment, handi-
crafts, shops and travel agencies. The investment cost (excluding price
contingencies) per permanent job created in the village is estimated at
US$29,000. About 600 man-years of employment will be required for construc-
tion during project implementation.
C. Balance of Payments Effect
6.08      In 1985, when the Heywoods Village is in its first typical year
of operations9 expenditures of village guests in Barbados are expected to
approximate US$8.7 million (in 1978 prices). It is estimated that the for-
eign exchange costs associated with these expenditures will amount to US$2.3
million leaving net foreign exchange flows at US$6.4 million before, and
US$4.9 million after debt service. In other words, a net 56% of 1985 Heywoods
Village guest expenditures is expected to be retained in Barbados and an
additional 18% will be utilized for project debt service.
D. Project Risk
6.09      There are inherent risks in the project due to its innovative
nature, In addition to being the largest hotel complex in Barbados, with
its normal hotel management requirements, BTIC will have the additional tasks
of attracting seven qualified Barbadian operators and organizing them into a
smoothly operating and cooperative group controlling seven hotels and apartels
and seven food and beverage facilities. The project must also recruit a
capable General Manager who can exercise full authority and responsibility for
providing central management, as well as coordinating the activities of the
hotel/apartel operators and concessionaires.
6.10      Marketing the village during the early years will be a more complex
task than marketing a single hotel as different hotel/apartels will have
individual decor and different operators rather than one clearly focused
image. The marketing will be difficult until the travel industry, which is
traditionally conservative and skeptical of experiments, is convinced by
experience that the service and quality of the product offered by Heywoods
Village is at least comparable to the conventional hotel/apartel product
offered elsewhere in Barbados and the Caribbean.
6.11      Failure in dealing effectively with the innovative elements of
the project will reduce benefits significantly. Even with such failures,
however, the project would remain an attractive hotel complex with a strong
demand base and satisfactory tariff levels relative to investment cost.
Government could as a fallback position, sell the complex or retain a
well-known international hotel operating company to manage and market it.

VII. SOCIAL ASPECTS
7.01      Speightstown is a small rural and fishing community.  According to
the 1970 census, 19% of male and 58% of female Barbadians between the ages of
14 and 65 in Speightstown and surrounding St. Peter's Parish were unemployed,
reflecting the rural character and an absence of significant industry. The
Speightstown area is currently the focus of Government policy to emphasize
development of the northern part of the island and the following steps have
already been taken:
(a) consultants have been engaged to draw up an urban development plan
for Speightstown. Work on the plan has been initiated and is
scheduled for completion by September 1979;
(b) a uniform bus fare throughout the island has recently been intro-
duced. This has contributed to an increase in business in
Speightstown from adjoining parishes to the north and the east;
and
(c) there are, in addition to the Heywoods Village, three other projects
under consideration for the Speightstown area including:
(i)  a fish processing and storage plant.  There are currently 26
fish landing points on the island which the Government plans
to consolidate into three or four fish processing and storage
plants, including one at Speightstown, by providing needed
facilities; and
(ii)  two projects being prepared in agriculture are directly
related to Speightstown and the development of tourism; they
are an integrated rural agricultural development project which
is expected to be financed by IDB and the Spring Hall agricul-
tural project which is expected to be financed by CDB. The
IDB project, involving 2,100 acres owned by 1,500 small
farmers, and aimed at increasing the production of vegetable,
fruit and other agricultural products, is scheduled to be
appraised in February 1979. The Spring Hall project is located
in nearby St. Lucy's Parish to the north of Speightstown,
involves 208 acres and 20 farmers and has similar objectives
to the IDB project.
7.02      The above measures and projects as well as Heywoods Village will
have a significant positive economic and social impact on the Speightstown
area. The population expects employment and income to rise for local
residents. A sidewalk will connect Heywoods Village and Speightstown and
businesses are already developing plans to take advantage of the expected
increase in tourist spending in the area.  Potential negative aspects of the
project are:



- 40 -
(a)  the project will increase traffic flows through the Speightstown
area;
(b)  the Droject will, to some extent, reduce public access to a portion
of the Heywoods beach which has traditionally been a popular picnic
and bathing spot; and
(c)  the expectations of the local population with respect to employment
and income may be higher than what the project may deliver.
7.03      The project attempts to minimize such potential negative impact by:
(a)  including in the proposed project a bypass road for Speightstown
which will reduce traffic congestion generated by the project;
(b)  designing the village tourism facilities to allow the public con-
tinued direct access to the beach and to parking, much as they had
previously; and
(c)  including beach facilities, a village hall and recreation facilities,
that will be available both to tourists and the local population.
7.04      In addition, the Government intends to:
(a)  hold discussions and meetings to prepare the local population for
the influx of tourists and to provide them with a realistic assess-
ment of the benefits of the proposed project; and
(b)  proceed with the implementation of the fisheries and agricultural
investment proposals outlined above, and to encourage Heywoods
Village to purchase its fish and agricultural product needs from
these projects.
7.05      From a more general point of view, the project, by limiting itself
to local operators and concessionaires, provides Barbadians with opportunities
to play a more important role in the island's hotel industry. The intimacy of
the hotels and apartels will also allow greater social interaction between
the local population and the tourists than would be likely in a single larger
facility.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS AND CONDITIONS TO BE FULFILLED
8.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached and assurances obtained

require prior consultation with the Bank (para 4.01);
(f) at least one hotel/apartel operator from Heywoods Village will be
appointed to the Board of the BTIC and a majority of the Board
members will be drawn from the private sector (para. 4.02);
(g) Government contributions to village investment will be in
the form of equity; an amount equal to the funds provided for
village investment by the Bank and by CDB will be transferred to
the Corporation as a long term loan to be repaid to the Govern-
ment over a twelve-year period including three years of grace at
an interest rate of 10% (para. 4.03);
(h) the Government will submit a completion report to the Bank on

(para. 4.15); and
(p) annual accounts for the hotel/apartels on a summarized basis and
prepared in accordance with the uniform system of accounts will
be submitted to the Bank annually; financial statements for
the Corporation prepared in accordance with acceptable accounting
principles will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and will be submitted to the Bank within four months of the end
of each fiscal year (para. 5.05).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan will be:
(a) obtaining CDB approval for its participation in the cofinancing of
the loan (para. 2.28); and
(b) enactment of legislation acceptable to the Bank establishing the

Hotel/Apartel Income Statements
3.        The assumptions are as follows:
(a) revenue projections assume annual room occupancy rates rise as
shown in part B, para. 1 of this Annex. Double occupancy rates
in 1985 are 1.9 for hotels in the high season, 1.8 for hotels
in the low season and 1.9 for apartels throughout the year. In
1985, tariffs for a double room are US$75 (in 1978 prices) for
hotels and US$70 for apartels in the high season and US$40 and
US$35 respectively in the low season. Commissions average 10%
of gross room sales. Food and beverage revenues for hotels are
derived from the assumptions in 2(b) above. Apartels have no
food and beverage business. There are no other revenues;
(b) direct room costs assume high season room department payrolls
of 16 employees for 32-room hotels, and 20 employees for 48-room
hotels and apartels. Other direct room costs are 11% of sales
for hotels and 12% of sales for apartels;
(c) direct food and beverage department costs are based on high
season payrolls of 17 employees in 32-room hotels and 22 employees
in 48-room hotels; material costs are 45% for food and 26% for
beverages. Other direct cost is 10% of sales.

ANNEX II
Page 4
(d) administration and general overhead expense in 1985 is 6.1% of sales
for 32-room hotels, 6.3% for 48-room hotels and 11.4% for apartels
based on high season payrolls of seven, eight, and six employees
respectively. These expenses exclude about six staff members
ordinarily hired by a hotel whose services for security, maintenance
and gardening will be supplied by the Corporation and also exclude
the manager's imputed salary which is retained in house profit and
as part of the operator's total financial return. Total adminis-
tration and general expense adjusted for these excluded costs would
be 11.5%, 10.5% and 16% of sales respectively;
(e)  total marketing expense is 7.5% of sales of which 5% is included
in the overhead charge (see para. 2(k) above) by the Corporation
for central marketing and 2.5% is the estimated cost of the
operator's individual marketing activity;
(f)  utilities expense is 7.8% of sales for 32-room hotels, 6.9% for
48-room hotels and 10.5% for apartels. A portion of total estimated
air-conditioning costs for the complex is assigned to hotel/apartels
on a per room basis. Telephone costs are based on telephone com-
pany quotations for PABX and extensions plus 25% for long distance.
Gas costs are 1.8% of food and beverage sales, .9% of apartel sales
for kitchen fuel, plus about BDS$300 per room for hot water less
about 75% in estimated saving3 from solar energy.  Water and other
electricity adds an additional 2% of sales for hotels and 3% for
apartels to utility costs;
(g)  total repair and maintenance expense is 6% of sales for hotels and
7.5% of sales for apartels of which about 75% is incurred by the
central Corporation and charged to hotel/apartels in the overhead
charge while 25% is incurred by the individual unit; and
(h)  hotel and apartel operators will pay rent and overhead charges to
BTIC as outlined in para. 2(k) above on net 45 day terms. Scaled
down rental fees will be charged to the operators during the 1982
opening year.
Concessionaire Income Statements
4.        The assumptions in 1978 prices are as follows:
(a)  the central laundry would be leased on a long-term basis to a
concessionaire who would supply the investment for equipment
other than the boiler and hot water tank, as well as working
capital. Projected revenues assume sales of BDS$1.50 per bednight
for guests, BDS$1.25 per bednight for commercial business from the
hotels and restaurants and no outside business. Cost of sales and
overhead including the manager's salary, is projected at about 73%
of sales. The Corporation's rental charge would be 15% of sales
leaving profits to the concessionaire of 12% of sales or about
BDS$50,000;



- 79 -
ANNEX II
Page 5
(b)  the six gift shops including a newsstand/bookstore, duty-free
shop, men's boutique, women's boutique, pharmacy and beauty shop
would be leased to concessionaires for a rental fee of 7% of
sales. Projected revenues assume sales of BDS$4 per bednight
to guests plus an additional 10% in outside business. Profits
are projected at 8% of sales or about BDS$52,000;
(c)  the minimarket would be leased for a rental charge of 7% of
sales. It is conservatively assumed that its revenues would be
derived solely from apartel guests as outlined in assumption
2(b) above. Profits before tax are projected at 7% of sales or
about BDS$38,000;
(d) the IDC would rent the beach handicraft center f or handicraft
promotion for a fee of 5% of sales. Revenues of BDS$1 per
bednight are assumed. Profits of 21% of sales remain after
cost of sales of 60% and labor costs of BDS$31,000; and
(e)  water sports would be rented to one or more concessionaires at a
rent of 20% of sales. Revenues assume BDS$2 per guest bednight
plus 10% for outside business. Costs include labor at 50% of
sales, fuel at 10% and maintenance and repair at 6% of sales.
Profit to the operators would be about BDS$45,000 or 14% of
sales.
Barbados Tourism Investment Corporation Balance Sheets
5.        Working capital requirements assume minimum cash balances of 30
days expenses, accounts receivable of 30 days direct sales and 45 days on
payments due from hotel/apartel operators and concessionaires, an annual
inventory turnover of 6x and 30 days accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Working capital deficits during the first two years are funded by short-term
borrowings.
6.        All fixed assets provided by the Corporation remain on the Corpo-
ration's books on a cost less depreciation basis. One third of furniture,
fixtures and air-conditioning is replaced every fourth year and one third
of equipment is replaced every fifth year at the same real cost as initial
investment. China, linens, supplies, etc., are expensed annually as pur-
chased. Expenses amortized over five years include preopening expense,
project administration expense, preopening interest and the costs of the
portion of the road around the project site.
7.        Government contributions to the project, amounting to about 38% of
the capital structure, will be in the form of equity. World Bank and CDB
loans amounting to the remaining 62% of the capital structure will be set up
as a 12-year loan including a 3-year grace period with interest at 10% per
annum from the assumed opening date of July 1, 1982. Preopening interest
expense and commitment fees will be capitalized on the Corporation's books
as preopening expense and as equity contributions by the Government.
