PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BARBADOS TOURISM PROJECT
(LOAN 1685-BAR)
PREFACE
This report is based on the work of a PCR mission which Mr. Thakoor
Persaud made in October 1984 to Barbados. Other sources of information for
this report include the Appraisal Report and Legal Agreements, BTO reports,
quarterly reports and Project File Communications. The mission held discus-
sions with representatives of the Government, the primary contractor, the
consultants and Caleaonian Hotel Management. CDB officials were very
cooperative in providing information and discussing issues affecting the
project. Appendix 1 was prepared by Ms. Sandra Joss who also provided
research assistance.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting pro-
cedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion Report
was sent to the Borrowpr for comments; however, none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BARBADOS TOURISM PROJECT
(LOAN 1685-BAR)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was well conceived and planned, given the environment
and needs of the country during the late 19709. However, during the imple-
mentation phase, two far-reaching unfavorable changes occurred and these
have resulted in significant negative impact.  The first of these changes
was a steep decline in worldwide tourism activity which resulted in short-
term overcapacity in Barbados.  The second was an overactive construction
sector which led to contractors seeking and receiving substantially larger
sums than normal for their work (paras. 34-44).
The combined effects of these problems led to fundamental changes
in an innovative concept which was being proposed for the project, viz.,
having several small individual Barbadian owners operating their separate
units but sharing the various recreational, dining and shopping facilities
and receiving centralized marketing, financial and technical assistance.
In this way, the beneficial scale features of larger operations would be
achieved while small owner-operators gained access to the affluent tourist
market. With the difficulties described above, the attractiveness of this
arrangement disapppeared and so the government was forced into contracting
a single expatriate company to manage the operations (paras. 63-72).
Ex-post analysis indicates that in spite of these negative
factors, the investment can break-even under prevailing conditions. If, as
expected, world tourism flows increase once again, this may actually result
in a modestly profitable operation within the next few years (paras.
73-78).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BARBADOS TOURISM PROJECT
(LON 1685-BAjR
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        General. Barbados, the most easterly Caribbean island has an area
of 431 sqkm and its 1984 population was estimated at about 253,000 people.
Extensive stretches of white sandy beaches along the greater part of the
island's coastline combine with a pleasant tropical climate, and constant
sea breezes to make it a very attractive tourist destination. Additional
tourism assets are its social and political stability, the eourteous and
friendly attitude of the people, lack of any pronounced rainy season and
its accessible location.
2.         Tourism Flows.  From the early days of the steamship until the
1960s, tourists who visited Barbados were primarily wealthy, winter visi-
tors from Europe and North America.1/ Tourist. accommodation during this
period were high-quality, full-service, establishments.  As the use of jet
aircrafts became widespread during the last three decades or so, worldwide
tourism flows increased, and along with this came increases in the number
of visitors to Barbados.  From a total of just under 18,000 tourists in
1956, Barbados had almost 304,000 air arrivals in 1982, a seventeen fold
Increase over the period.   Cruise ship passengers, who numbered about
27,000 in 1963, were 111,000 in 1982.2
3.         The enormous increase In tourism flows to Barbados over the past
decades have been rather uneven. During the 1960-1970 period, for example,
the annual growth rate was about 17%. This dropped to about 92 during the
following decade, and for the 1980-1982 period it showed an annual decline
of about 10%.  Figures for the last two years are still being prepared.
Initial indications are that they would show a slow-down in the decline for
1983 and a turn-around for 1984.
4.          Among the primary factors responsible for the decline in the
growth rate of tourism to Barbados over the last decade were the two oil-
price increases during 1972 and 1979. These increases had both direct and
1/ -Neighbouring Commonwealth Caribbean countries have also had a large
share of visitors but these consist mainly of relatives and friends of
Barbadians, or shoppers who do not generally stay in tourist accommo-
dations.
2/   Cruise ship passengers are important, but because of the nature of
their itinerary, their impact is relatively more in duty-free sales
and transport than in hotels.



- 2 -
indirect effects as the world economy began to make adjustments to higher
energy costs and there were recessions in various major supplier nations.
Tables I and 2 present details on the origin, flows and growth rates for
tourism in Barbados over the past three decades while table 3 of Annex 1
contains other key indicators for the sector.
5.         Economic Impact of Tourism.  Tourism has consistently occupied a
prominent position in the Barbadian economy in terms of its direct and
indirect impact upon employment, foreign exchange earning, and industrial
acd agricultural linkages. In 1976, for example, it accounted for about 8%
of GDP at factor cost, while in 1980, this figure rose to about 12%. For
1982, it fell to about 10%.  After taking account of indirect effects, the
impact upon the economy becomes even more pronounced since there are so
many linkages to the other sectors.
6.          It is estimated that about 15 to 18% of the work force (i.e.
about 16,000-20,000) people are directly or indirectly employed in tourism
related activities.   In terms of foreign exchange earnings,  tourism has
been the single most important source.  It averaged US$225 million in 1982
and has been increasing annually at about 19% in nominal terms over the
1961-1980 period. However in real terms, the growth has not been as spec-
tacular, averaging just over 9% between 1961 and 1980.  Table 3 (b) pro-
vides greater de-ail on foreign exchange earning from tourism in Barbados.
7.         Tourist Expenditure Pattern.  Tables 4 and 5 show visitor expen-
ditures by category of purchases for 1980 and the percentage distribution
of these expenditures. For hotel guests, accommodations occupy first place
in both winter and summer, followed by meals and beverage, duty-free
purchases, entertainment,  taxis, boutiques and handicrafts.   Cruise ship
passengers have the greatest share of their expenditures going for duty-
free purchases, with taxis, boutiques and meals and beverage following.
8.         In general, the British and West Germans have, on average, spent
about 50% more per capita than North American tourists. This is perhaps a
reflection of the higher class accommodation selected and the greater
affluence of these visitors.
9.        Tourist Accommodation and Occupancy.  Table 6 contains details of
the build-up of available beds by category of establishments between 1972
and 1982.   As with many other tourist destinations,  classification of
hotels has been rather subjective.   However,  even though the class of
establishment may not be comparable over time, the total rooms available do
give an indication of the extent of growth.   Over the 1972-1982 period
hotel capacity almost doubled. Two noteworthy features are the predominant
number of guest houses and cottages and their small average size which
ranges between one and fourty rooms.
10.         Bed-occupancy rates have fluctuated both over time (seasonally
and over the years)  and between establishments.   For the higher class
facilities and the apartment hotels the occupancy rate has, on average,
been higher than for the lower class ones.   Table 7 presents greater
details on occupancy rates between 1966 and 1982 while table 8 indicates
the average length of stay by type of accommodation between 1977 and 1982.



11.         Government's Role in the Sector.  During its early years, the
tourism industry of Barbados involved ownership and operation primarily by
non-Barbadians.    Organized  marketing  efforts  were  negligible  and  the
Government exercised minimal control or coordination over the sector.  As
the importance of tourism became more pronounced, the Government passed the
Hotels Aids Act of 1956 which provided various tax incentives for owners
and operators of tourist facilities.  In 1958, the government established
the Barbados Tourist Board to promote Barbados as a tourist destination.
12.           The pre-independence3/ philosophy of the Government was to
provide fiscal incentives and faciTitate tourist infrastructure development
(e.g. through provision of roads, water, electricity, and other services)
with the aim of having private development generating employment and other
increased direct and indirect economic activities. After gaining indepen-
dence, the strategy of the Government became more focused.  Major issues
affecting the sector are now dealt with at the Cabinet level while day-to-
day operations are handled by the Civil Aviation and Tourism Division of
the Caribbean Affairs Ministry.4/ The Tourism Division is responsible for
collecting statistics, monitoring the development of the sector, supervis-
ing studies, and administering the Hotel Aids Act.   Greater details on
public and private Institutions in the sector are presented in the apprais-
al report, pages 5-7.
13.       The Government's focus has gradually expanded over the years, and
between 1979 and 1983, it enacted several legislative measures aimed at
registering, classifying and, in general, providing for an orderly system
of documentation and management of the sector with increasing incentives
for local ownership of tourism facilities. The 1983-1988 Barbados Develop-
ment Plan contains more details on Government's current policies.
[I. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
14.       Prolect Origin and Design.  The Bank conducted a study of tourism
in the Caribbean during November, 1973, and early in 1975, discussions were
held with the Barbadian Govarnment on possible Bank financing for a tourism
project in the island. Th.e Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) was also ac-
tive in the sector during th!s period. However, because of its relatively
small resource base, it was P>ot -e'"sidering any large-scale operations.
After extensive discussions among the Bank, CDB, and the Barbadian Govern-
ment, it was agreed that a tripartite group would be formed to prepare a
project proposal. Fiaancing for the engineering and other preparatory work
was obtained from CDB and various alternative solutions were considered.
3/   Barbados gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1966.
4/ The Tourism Division has now been merged with the Environment
Division to form a new Ministry.



- 4-
15.         Based upon the studies done by the committee, the Government
received Cabinet approval to continue project preparation works.  Indica-
tions at that time were that the project being considered would cost ap-
proximately US$10 million. The Government agreed to take an option on 25
acres of land known as the Heywoods Estate in Speightstown, about fifteen
miles north of Bridgetown.
16.        Design of the project was influenced by several factors.  The
Government wanted to expand higher class accommodation facilities in the
country in order to increase capacity and capture a share of the tourism
market which was averaging a 13% annual growth throughout the previous
decade. The Government also wanted to increase local ownership of facili-
ties catering to the upper end of the market and it wanted to generate
increased employment and other economic benefits. Linkage effects and de-
velopment of the northern section of the island were also two important
factors influene~ing project design and site selection.
17.       Several alternatives were considered during project preparation.
Among these were rehabilitation and upgrading of existing hotels and tour-
ist facilities and construction of new hotels.  The Government wanted to
expand the available range and number of facilities.   Consequently, it
opted for having new hotels built.   In order to combine several goals
including local participation in higher class facilities, employment
generation, and linkages to other sectors, the Government proposed having a
cluster of hotels each of which would be separately owned and managed by
Barbadians, although such tasks as marketing, accounting and certain public
facilities would be provided on a shared basis with technical assistance
from the Government.
18.       The cluster hotel concept was a novel one and its potential costs
and benefits were intensively discussed by the Bank, the Government and
CDB. If it worked, it could be a model for the country and the region,
whereby local participation at all levels would be assured and the product
offered would improve both in range and quality. At the same time, there
was the risk that these facilities would not appeal to tourist and may end
up crowding out existing ones with many problems occurring in such areas as
coordination and administration.  These concerns were felt to be legiti-
mate. However, the Government believed that their effects could be mini-
mized with proper preparation, and the potential benefits justified the
risks Involved.
19.         Project Preparation and Appraisal.   The Barbadian Government
prepared the project with assistance from consultants, the Bank and CDB.
After agreeing in principle to go ahead with the cluster hotel concept and
buying the land at Speightstown, the Government invited consultants in
April, 1976, to submit proposals for preparation of the design and market-
ing studies. Terms of reference were agreed upon between the Government,
the Bank and CDB, and in December, 1976, the Government selected the Eco-
nomic Intelligence Unlt, Ltd., for the marketing studies while Robertson
Ward Associates (RWA) were appointed for the technical and design works.



20.       The pace of project preparation was rather slow because of sever-
al factors, chief among which were the novel approach of the hotel works,
coordination and communication delays among the Bank, CDB, the Government
and the consultants, and the then ongoing election campaign and subsequent
change in Government which occurred in September, 1976.  About two years
were taken to prepare the project, during which time the Bank sent three
preparation missions.5/
21.         In spite of the delays, the tripartite steering committee did
provide a system for guiding project preparation and keeping participants
informed of developments. As a result of interactions at various levels,
several design modifications were made, the most notable being construction
of a by-pass road to avoid public vehicular traffic accross the hotel com-
plex.
22.          Appraisal of the project was conducted during September and
October of 1978 by the Bank and CDB.  By that time the general scope of
works and extent of participation of the Bank, CDR and the Government were
defined.  CDB focussed upon providing partial financing for some land and
infrastructure work and for furnishing and equiping of the hotels, while
the Bank provided partial funding for the other hotel works and the by-pass
road.
23.        In general, a combination of circumstances and factors led to
delays in the preparation process.  It took a while for the nature of the
project and its characteristics to be defined; there were delays in coordi-           do
nating activities and cormmnicating viewpoints of the various parties
involved, and the Government was involved in other matters including an
election campaign.  The Bank tried to overcome some of the causes of the
delay by sending frequent preparation missions to the field. However, the
problems in dealing with another international agency (CDB) and the Govern-
ment were more of a bureaucratic nature.
24.       Prolect Objectives and Description.  Consistent with the goal of
the Government in maximizing its overall gain from tourism within the
framework of minimum social and economic costs, the project objectives, as
described in the appraisal report (pp 10-11) were to "add a new dimension
to Barbados' tourism product, increase room capacity" and "increase local
ownership of tourism facilities, particularly of those catering to the
upper end of the market. It would encourage purchasing linkages with agri-
culture and fisheries. It would provide more employment opportunities per
room." Also, it would increase management opportunities for Barbadians and
provide a vehicle for financial participation by Barbadians.   It would
serve as a demonstration case for shared facilities and it would help to
stimulate the growth of economic activities in the northern part of the
island, setting an example in conservation consistent with Lourism develop-
ment.
5/   There were also one reconnaissance and three identification missions
preceeding these preparation missions.



- 6-
25.       Major elements of the project were as follows:
(a)   the construction, furnishing and equipping of five Heywoods Vil-
lage hotels and two apartels totaling 308 guest rooms;
(b)   the construction, furnishing and equipping of common buildings
and other facilities for the Heywoods Village, including an ad-
ministration building, shopping area, central restaurant, disco-
theque, meeting hall, beach market, internal roads, parking,
public access to the beach, landscaping, utilities including
solar water heating, laundry, small sports center, central swim-
ming pool, nine-hole golf course, tennis courts and maintenance
facilities;
(c)   the construction, of a bypass road around Speightstown and the
Heywoods Village which would divert trafic from the present road
through the town and along the beach;
(d)   a marketing program for the Heywoods Village;
(e)   technical expertise for central management of the village; and
(f)   project administration.
26.           Total project costs were estimated at US$17.2 million with
US$10.9 being foreign exchange.   Table 9 contains a breakdown of these
costs. The Bank was supposed to provide US$8 million or about 46% of total
project costs (including land cost) while the CDB share was to be about
US$3.2 million with the Government finan,cing the remaining US$6 million.
27.       Although the Ministry of Tourism was to be the overall implement-
ing agency, it was agreed during appraisal that there would be a Project
Implementation Unit (PU) in charge of project execution. This unit was to
have a project manager, an engineer, an accountant and a procurement offi-
cer. Also, consultants were to be employed to assist in project implemen-
tation and marketing analyses.
28.        There was also agreement to have a corporation formed to manage
the Heywoods project after completion.   This corporation,  the Barbados
Tourism Investment Corporation (BTIC) should have representatives from the
private sector and at least one hotel or apartel operator from Heywoods as
a member of its board.
III. LPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
29.         Start-up Period:  The three conditions for negotiations were:
(a) appointment of PU director; (b) preparation of a draft model lease to
be used for project hotels, and (c) formulation of an organizational plan
for operating the hotels along with preparation of draft legislation for
establishing BTIC.  These were all met by March 7, 1979.   Before Board
approval on April 10, 1979, the Government had also received title to the
Heywoods site and the CDB Board had approved its US$3.2 million co-
financing  package.    On August 24,  1979,  the loan was declared fully
effective after the Government enacted legislation establishing BTIC.

30,         Contracting.   In May, 1979, construction work on a part of the
by-pass road began by force account and pre-qualification of contractors
for the hotel works was underway. During project preparation it was agreed
that tendering of the construction work would be broken down into several
contract packages in order to allow local contractors to bid on works with-
in their financial and managerial capabilities, while at the same time,
permitting international and local contractors to bid on one or a combina-
tion of packages.   The work was broken down into six major construction
packages and four sub-contract packages, and international and local insti
tutions were invited to submit pre-qualification data.
31.       The pre-qualification period occurred during the second semester
of 1979, and there were thirteen local and thirty-two foreign firms re-
sponding. In May, 1980, one month before tender documents were issued, the
pre-qualified firms were contacted and asked to reconfirm their interest in
the works. Respondents numbered nine local and twenty-four foreign firms.
The tendering period was initially between June 23 and August 20, 1980.
However, because of delays in preparation of some document by the consult-
ants, there was an extension until September 17, 1980.
32.         A summary of the bidding packages, number of interested firms
and details of bids is presented below.

33.         The small number of tender offers and the high prices quoted
relative to the appraisal estimates led the Bank to initially suggest
cancellation and re-tendering. The Government responded that re-tendering
would be time consuming and costly since there would be additional delays
in project start up.   Moreover, given the then existing high employment



- 8 -
situation, there was no guarantee that the response by flrms or bids would
be better than those on band. In light of the Bank's estimate of project
costs which were felt to be rather low, Government consultants had made
their own estimates of project costs during early 1980, and as table 2
indicates, it was substantially larger than the Bank's estimate but not as
large as the tender offer of the lowest bldder. After extensive discussion
and assessment of the situation, it was agreed to have the Government
negotiate the price with the contractor using the consultant's figures as a
guideline.  As a result of negotiations of contracts A, R, C and D, the
Government awarded a contract to a foreign firm for BDS$ 37,476,7376/ a
reduction  of  about  BDS$10  million  from  the  tendered  price.    The
contractor's implementation proposal for 28 months was negotiated down to
24 months. Contracts E and F (for landscaping and a section of the by-pass
road respectively) were within the consultants estimates and these were
awarded at the tendered price to local contractors.

34.          Cost Analysis.   World Bank appraisal cost estimates for this
project were substantially lower than those of the contractor and the
consultant. Detailed examination of the reasons for such wide differences
indicates several factors, among which the effects of inflation and delays
in project implementation are prominent. Also, changes in the scope of the
work and the level of parallel construction activities in the country have
been important elements.   The following chart illustrates some of the
underlying factors which could explain some of the variations noted above.

35.         As the chart illustrates, the physical construction period was
expected to begin in January, 1980, and extend for 27 months until March,
1982.  The actual case indicates that construction began 12 months later
and continued for 38 months, with the majority of investments taking place
toward the latter half of the period.   Whereas the appraisal assumptions
included an Inflation factor of 22%, the actual figure was at least about



- 10 --
60-70Z.7/ Thus, if the appraisal figures were adjusted for actual
inflation, this alone would account for about 40% of the cost overrun of
the project.
36.        Physical changes in project design also were a major factor in
explaining differences between appraisal and actual cost figures.  Design
changes ranged from minor items (e.g. installation of gates) to major ones
(e.g. addition of swimming pools and increasing discotheque space by
100%).  Table 10 provides greater details on these changes.   According to
a CDB analysis, almost 14% of the cost overrun could be attributable to
this factor alone. The 10% physical contingency allowed on the base price
was therefore not sufficient for covering actual changes. The table below
summarizes some of the important factors which could explain the difference
betwen appraisal and actual cost figures. 8/

7/   There is no official construction price index in Barbados and so the
retail price index (RPI) is used here. During the period of intensive
construction activity, the price of material, labor, etc., increased
at a much greater rate than the RPI.

Lybrand study on project cost overrun.



- 11 -
37.       Officials of CDB, the project unit and Government consultants all
claim that there were enough indications for the Bank to note that its
appraisal cost estimates were not correct.   For inflation estimates for
example, it was noted that since costs rose about 5.5% in the first quarter
of 1978, Bank rates should have been modified, especially in view of the
increased construction work in the island. The Government stated that the
Bank mission's response was that its world-wide experience did not indicate
a need for changing its inflation assumptions.
38.        During appraisal, the Government claimed that the Bank's system
of estimating floor areas and project costs for the appraisal report was a
source of under-estimation of these figures.  For example, based upon the
Bank mission's method, during appraisal, it was estimated that the floor
area was 198,556 sqft. Upon remeasuring the area, the consultants found it
to be 237,260 sqft, a difference of almost 20%. The consultants claim that
they had two days in September, 1978 to calculate the floor areas, and they
were instructed to use only one prototype hotel which was supposed to re-
present the other hotels.  In other areas, it was claimed by the consul-
tants that the Bank mission recommended substantial expansion of the beach
works (necessitating almost $2.5 million additional cost), and for the
phase I road works, the Bank mission recommended drainage by surface drains
although the Ministry of Works never approved the designs and it actually
later rejected them, causing larger drains and underground culverts, to be
built at a higher cost.
39.       With no interior design consultant appointed by appraisal, there
were no design work on furniture and fittings (FF&E). It was then decided
to use a percentage of building cost to estimate FF&E costs. Consequently,
with underestimated building costs, the FF&E costs were also underestimat-
ed.
40.         It is difficult to fully ascertain to what extent the above
assertions of the consultant and CDB are true. However, there is evidence
indicating that various errors and miscalculations did occur.   As a matter
of background information, the Tourism Department in the Bank was being
phased out at about the time this loan was being processed. The effects of
this action are not very clear. However, one implication is that there was
need in the Bank to finish with the work underway and prepare for the
change-over of staff to other divisions.  Bank contact with project offi-
cials, as indicated by letters and missions, continued at a normal level.
Still, in light of the claims mentioned above, it appears as if there was a
large communication problem among the various parties.
41.       The Bank missions continued their work based upon data and other
information which may bave been representative ones at the time they were
compiled. However, in view of the absence of much prior experience in the
Caribbean region, and in light of the updated information and specific
queries from CDB, the Government, and the consultants, it may have been
advisable to conduct a more detailed review of the situation before pro-
ceeding with final figures.



- 12 -
42.         During the construction period for this project there were at
least eleven other hotels undergoing renovation and/or expansion. Further-
more, there were many other multi-million dollar construction works planned
or underway.9/ Consequently, contractors were not too keen on having the
works of this project. In many cases, the shortage of skilled construction
labor necessitated higher salaries to bid workers away from existing sites
or to get them from overseas. The location of Heywoods about fifteen miles
away from Bridgetown was also a disadvantage to many workers who could
obtain employment closer to their homes.   Being aware of all of these
factors, the contractors demanded a premium for doing the project.
43.       While there appears to have been miscalculations by the Bank team
in appraising the cost of evaluating the project, there also appears to
have been coordination and communication problems among the other partici-
pants. The records indicate several design changes were made and thelater
modified again, and there were many cases of redundant work e.g., the prep-
aration of technical drawings in both imperial and metric units. Many of
these occurrences are indicative of the need for clearcut terms of refer-
ence with definition of tasks and lines of responsibility.
44.        In reviewing the project cost overrun (see Table 11) it may be
noted that the term "cost overrun" should not be used here in the normal
sense or at least, it should be qualified. Once the adjustments weremade
at the bidding stage, the final costs10/ were well within estimates. The
final cost of BDS$63.1 million was about 4% higher than projections madeby
the consultants in 1980.  Most of this increase is attributable to the
costs involved in making substantial design changes after it was decided to
change the management system of the hotels (see paras. 66-68 below).  It
maybe instructive at this juncture to mention that for many of the projects
referred to in the footnote of paragraph 42 above, in many cases there have
been substantial cost increases over the contract prices and there were
significant time overruns also.
45.          Implementation Period.   Work began in January 1981 and was
expected to be complete twenty-four months later. However, a combination
of factors caused delays of about fourteen months, and it was not until
February, 1984, that the final units were handed over.11/    With the
9/   Examples are the Central Post Office, Bridgetown Sewage project, the
Central Bank, Oistins Fisheries Wharf, Spring Garden Highway, the
cement plant, the Wildley Road expansion and the Samuel Jackman Poly-
technic.
10/ Both the Government and the primary contractor are claiming damages
for delays in construction of the hotels.   These claims are still
being litigated but they are not expected to significantly affect
final costs.
11/ 170 units were finished by August 1983.



- 13 -
project implementation delayed by a year, the total time overrun was about
twenty-six months (see chart 1 above).
46.       Delays in project implementation were caused by several factors,
among which contractor mobilization, inclement weather, labor disputes,
scarce or inadequate materials,  and design changes are prominent.   A
summary of thereasons for delay, as claimed by the contractor, is presented
below:

47,       While the contractor requested a fourteen month delay because of
various reasons, only about two months were considered justified by the
Government. Consequently, the Government regarded all delays beyond March
14, 1983, as extraordinary ones.
48.        At the outset, it is obvious even to the casual reader of the
quarterly reports and other communications on project matter that serious
labor problems existed during project implementation.   These resulted in
significant delays which were compounded because not much subcontractiug
was done initially.
49.        Some of the low level of initial subcontracting was due to the
lack of available subcontractors in the full employment construction
sector at that time. In several instances, basic materials such as cement
were unavailable at critical moments when foundations were being laid, for



- 14 -
example.   Apart from the above problems,  inclement weather was causing
difficulties at crucial times. Also, many basic design changes were being
made In response to the changed syster of operation of the hotel complex
and to unforeseen structural weaknesses in buildings which were to be
renovated.
50.          In summary, a review of available documents and discussions
indicate that the causes of implementation problems are rather complex.
Several start-up problems did arise, and to these were added periodic
material and labor scarcities.   There appears to have been eommunication
problems at all levels of operation.  In many cases, serious efforts were
made to resolve several of the problems. For example, in labor relations,
very competitive wages were paid to the workers and their labor union was
recognized by the workers.  However, even with these actions, there were
frictions as workers made demands for higher wages and more Barbadians to
be in supervisory positions. Inter-union rivalry on the project site also
led to work stoppages and slowdowns.   In order to minimize labor-related
delays, the company appointed a negotiating consultant who was a Barbadian
and who was formerly the Chief Labor Officer.   Earlier efforts aimed at
addressing these issues may have helped to improve the situation. However,
it should be noted that this project was not the only one suffering from
such problems; the cement plant and the Ladymeade Polyclinic were two sites
experiencing similar problems.  A commentry on the construction scene at
that time in a local newspaper stated, "Bad work, high costs, broken
promises, extended dates, pilferage seem to be the norm in this
country.12/
51.       A review of the communication and manner of interaction among the
various parties indicate that the system was not functioning as efficiently
as it should.  The project manager was appointed in March, 1979, and the
project unit was established in October of the same year. However, because
of difficulty of getting the National Housing Corporation to erect on-site
offices, site accommodation for the project was not provided until June,
1981, six months after construction began. The temporary site for the unit
was not conveniently located, and so full on-site presence of the unit was
not being utilized at a crucial juncture.
52.         Reporting.   Quarterly project progress reports were prepared
using the format decided upon between the Bank and the Government.  These
reports were circulated to the Ministries of Tourism, Finance, and Works,
with  copies  also  going to the Bank,  CDB  and  the Tourism  Investment
Corporation.   The reports were informative and they provided details on
physical implementation, compliance with Loan Conditions, disbursements,
and  tourism  rctivities.       During  the  initial  phase   of  project
implementation, the quarterly reports were especially helpful in document-
ing and summarizing the progress of works.   However, toward the latter
part, the data presented were not updated in a timely fashion and the re-
ports tended to voice criticisms without presenting objective analyses and

evaluation from which recommendations could be made to improve the
situation.
IV. PROJECT OPERATIONS
53.        Financing.  Among the key goals of the project were to capture a
greater share  of regional  tourism and  to provide  local  ownership  and
management of the facilities with technical assistance from the Barbados
tourism Investment Corporation (BTIC), which was established specifically
for this purpose.   With the higher project cost accompanied by declining
tourist inflows, there was need to review the situation.
54.        Both the Bank and CDB expressed concern to the Government about
the continued viability of the project, given the higher cost and decreased
tourist trarfic.   Although it was not  directly mentioned as a primary
factor, all of the participants were aware of the political and economic
implications which would have arisen from a decision to halt the project.
55.         Nevertheless, the question of economic and financial viability
needed to be addressed, and so it was agreed to hire the firm of Coopers
and Lybrand to carry out a revised financial and economic appraisal of the
project in light of the changed circumstances.  The report of the company
was presented to the Government in August, 1981, and although it found that
both the cost and benefit streams would be negatively affected by the then
recent developments, it suggested that the project might still be viable if
sufficient care was taken to employ managers of the highest calibre in the
hotels and in BTIC.
56.          The Bank also conducted its own reassessment of the project
during this period and indications were similar to the Coopers and Lybrand
review, if it was assumed that there were no sunk costs.  If, however, it
was assumed that all costs incurred up to that moment were sunk costs, then
the results were relatively better.
57.        As the analyses proceeded, the implications for local operators
became clearer.   For example, whereas it was projected that individual
operators originally had to raise about BDS$135,000 in initial investment
for a 32-room hotel, a CDB study indicated that the amount had to be about
1a1S$267,000 after the cost increase.   The CDB staff conducted extensive
studies on the implications of the cost overruns.  However, there was the
general feeling that the political need for continuing with the project was
paramount and, as such, the approach had to be one of maximizing gains (or
minimizing the losses) of the project consistent with the condition that
the project could not be stopped. Although this was not stated explicitly,
it was implicit in all actions.
58.       The Government at first sought Bank and CDB assistance in meeting
the additional project cost.       Given the Bank's disengagement from the
sector and the specific circumstances of the Barbadian case, no additional
assistance was possible from the Bank.  CDB's small resource base and its



- 16 -
questions about the costlier project also caused no additional funds to be
provided, so finally, the Government assumed all of the extra financing
cost.   In order to assure Bank participation throughout the life of the
project, the Bank's share of financing was reduced from about 70% to 37%
for all expenditures. Table 11 contains details of actual final financing
costs.
59.           Management.   With  the diminishing economic and financial
attractiveness of the project becoming clearer, the Government began to
realize that local operators would be hard to find.   This became more
obvious when, in October, 1982, there were only seven serious local
candidates submitting applications to lease the hotels.   After reviewing
their applications, it was decided that only one was a viable candidate
meeting all of the requirements.
60.        The alternative was to seek an established foreign operator to
manage the complex as a single entity. With this decision taken almost one
year after construction began, there was need to have the contractor make
various design alterations, some small and some substantial. Bank approval
of Government's request for a changed management concept was sent to the
Government  in  December,  1982,  and  negotiations  tegan  with  several
international firms including Caledonian Hotel Management (CHM), Club Med,
Oberoi and Hotel and Tourism Consultants (Barbados) Ltd. The wide experi-
ence, strong marketing record and established affiliation of CHM with the
Blue Sky Holidays tour operator gave it the advantage in these negotiations
and in July, 1983, an agreement was reached whereby CHM was appointed to
market and manage the hotels as a single operation.   During each of the
first two years CHM was to receive a fixed fee of US$250,000, while for the
subsequent years, the compensation would consist of 22.5% of Gross Opera-
ting Profits.
61.       CHM personnel arrived on the site in June, 1983, with the under-
standing that the hotel would be ready for guests by the end of 1983. In
line with the changed concept of operating the hotels, several modifica-
tions -were made.  These include centralization of administrative offices,
installation of computing equipment and expansion of reception areas.
Electricity, telephone, water and other services were installed during the
latter half of 1983. However, even with the hectic pace of work, the con-
tractors were not able to hand over all ef the units by the December 1,
1983, date. CHM thus began operations with 170 rooms available and workmen
were evc._ywhere trying to finish various tasks.
62.        The marketing and promoting efforts of CHM attracted guests but
the degree of incompleteness of the facilities caused several critical
c-mments Prom trade journals and tour operators and guests.  The initial
promotion outlay was therefore counterproductive and CHM had to spend a
great deal of resources to improve its image. January 17, 1984, was the
official opening date of the hotel. However, it was not until a month later
that all 308 rooms were handed over to CHM.



- 17 -
63.         For CHM, there were start-up problems which were compounded by
the rather chaotic environment and uncertain handover date during late
1983. Managerial and other support staff were recruited by October, 1983,
but there was only a short orientation period before the hotel began oper-
ations.   Debugging of the computerized accounting system took several
months and the external auditors noted several areas which needed to be im-
proved. Among the weak areas were:   billing and collections,  inventory
controls and purchasing.   It was admitted by the auditors that start-up
problems were to be expected. However, it was also noted that adequate
back-up systems were not initially in place to reduce some of these start-
up problems. Additionally, the auditors noted the problems inherent in co-
ordinating the activities of facilities dispersed over the 30-acre complex.
64.       Modified Role of Barbados Tourism Investment Corporation (BTIC).
Initially, BTIC was designed to be the technical assistance and coordinat-
4ing arm for the individual operators of the hotels.  With the appointment
of CHM to manage the hotel, the need for many of the specialized personnel
of BTIC (e.g. for food and beverage manager and marketing) was eliminated.
Consequently, BTIC's staff was adjusted and it now has a general manager,
an assistant general manager (vacant), an administrative officer and two
clerical staff. A seven person Board of Directors is responsible for long
term policy planning.
65.       The Government requested that the Bank modify the legal documents
to reflect the changed status of BTIC.   The Bank has agreed to this re-
quest13/ and the modified legal documents are currently awaiting Govern-
ment's final approval.  In the meantime, BTIC has also assumed management
functions for the Dover Convention Centre and it monitors leasing arrange-
ments for the Hilton Hotel.
V. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL REEVALUATION OF THE PROJECT.
66.          Benefits mentioned in the Appraisal Report included tourist
expenditures  for:   (a) food and beverage,  (b) room,  discotheque,  golf
course and the various concessions in the complex. Appraisal assumptions
for the economic analysis involved adjustments to benefits as follows:
(a)     Revenues and costs were in 1978 prices.   Hotel and restaurant
revenues had an 8% Government sales tax and a 10% service charge.
(b)     Tourist expenditures were shadow priced at US$1 - BDS$2.4.
(c)     Barbadian expenditures in the facilities were excluded since it
was felt that these could be diverted from other local facili-
ties.
13/ Basically, the new document provides for either hiring of a manager
for the hotel or using the original concept of local operators with
BTIC assistance.



- 18 -
(d)     Guest expenditures outside project were assumed as US$2.5 per day
for hotel guests and US$2 per day for apartment guests for food
and beverage, with a total of a $20 per day per tourist stay.
Expendiltures for air travel and airport taxes were excluded
because associated cost were not known. The bypass road benefits
were also excluded because of lack of data and time savings
benefits.
67.          Costs were for:   (a) initial investments (including working
capital) and replacement cost of buildings, furniture, fittings and equip-
ment, (b) operating costs of the various facilities, and (c) operating
costs related to guest expenditure outside the project facilities i.e. 70%
of expenditure for food and beverage and 50% for ground transportation.
68.        It was also assumed at appraisal that during the first year of
operation about 30% of total revenues would be diverted from existing
facilities in Barbados and so should not be counted as project benefits.
This figure was expected to decline annually by six points until it becomes
negligible five years later. Greater details of the appraisal assumptions
are on pp 36-37 of the appraisal report.
69.       Tables 12-14  contain details of both the financial and economic
analyses of the project along with the assumptions used. As indicated in
the financial projections table, the first two years of operation have net
operating losses.  The start-up period is expected to last through 1985,
after which it is expected that a positive net profit would be earned.
Because of the changed concept of operation of the hotel, it is not
possible to make realistic comparisons between most of the appraisal
assumptions and current ones. However, in terms of occupancy rates, it was
being projected that these would be 40, 55, 65 and 70 percent for the first
four years of operation.  The actual figures and current projections are
41, 50 and 60 percent at full development of the project. During apprais-
al, it was assumed that all guests were going to eat in the hotel. Current
projections are that only between 50 and 60 percent of these guests would
do so.  The others are expected to buy supplies from nearby markets and
prepare their own meals.
70.       The re-estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the
project averages 9%.  During appraisal, it was estimated to be about 18%.
This re-estimated IERR is about two points lower than the currently
estimated opportxs),ty cost of capital (OCC).  The increased project costs
(from BDS$34.4 mtllion to BDS$63.1 million) Is the most important single
factor explaining the reduced IERR of the project. Lower occupancy rates
(see above) and a two year delay in project implementation are also
important contributors to the low re-ectimated IERR.
71.         Mission assumptions have been rather conservative in both the
financial and economic projections. This is especially true in estimates
for food and beverage expenditures of guests in the hotels and also their
expenditures outside the hotels.   Exclusion of all purchases of local



- 19 -
residents from the exercise also tends to reduce the stated benefits of the
project. Thus, the true IERR of the project may be at least equal to the
OCC.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
72.        General.  Many lessons can be drawn from the analysis of  this
project.   The project began as a venture aimed at capturing a greater
portion of an increasing  tourism market.   At  the same  time,  it was
formulated to incorporate a model which was aimed at providing local
operators with an opportunity of working in coordination to reduce costs
and yet cater to the higher class of tourists.
73.        The relatively long period of project preparation and subsequent
modifications attest to the difficulty of conceptualizing and presenting a
workable proposal. Nevertheless, after detailed discussions and analyses,
a satisfactory project was prepared with appropriate considerations given
to its inherent  risks.   One of the fall-back positions  (noted in the
appraisal report) was that if problems arose in managing or marketing the
project, the Government could easily hire one company to operate the
complex or it could sell it.  Unfortunately, these options were based on
the premise that tourism inflows would continue to increase and that
project costs would not be much different from those calculated at
appraisal.
74.           Meeting of Projlect Goals.   One of the major goals,  i.e.
increasing management opportunities for Barbadians through a novel concept
of cluster hotels has not been met, and even though there are provisions
for this system in BTIC regulations, it appears rather unlikely that this
would occur in the short-run.   The basic problem here is caused by the
project  cost  overrun  and  the  weak  tourist  market.    The  goals  of
diversifying the type of facilities and developing other parts of the
island are being achieved. The hotel complex has generated a great deal of
linkages to other economic sectors (e.g. fishing and agriculture), and
between 300 and inO new jobs have been created directly, with a smaller
amount being indirectly created.
75.       Whether the long-run overall costs of the project would be lesser
than its associated benefits is not easy to determine because of difficulty
in projecting many of the crucial variables. However, the projections of
operations of the hotel using conservative estimates indicate that it can
become a viable operation if it is properly managed.
76.           Performance of the World Bank.   As indicated before, the
Government, CDB and the consultants all expressed concerns about the manner
in which the Bank conducted its appraisal work. In reviewing the specific
observations of these groups, the mission noted that the Bank preparation
and appraisal teams should have given more feed-back on its methodology to
them.    Actually,  the  issues  of  inflation  assumptions  and  method  of



- 20 -
estimating physical quantities and cost were the main problem areas. The
Bank teams did try to discuss the rationale for their methodology.  How-
ever, these efforts were not successful.   For the inflation factor, for
example, upon seeing a first quarter surge in prices in 1978, the consult-
ants and the other groups insisted on using a rate 'in excess of 15%" for
that year with appropriate upward increases for later years.  The actual
inflation for 1978 turned out to be 9.5%.   Thus, both the Bank and the
other participants took either too conservative or too liberal positions
regarding inflation.
77.       The termination of Bank lending for tourism, which occurred while
this loan was being processed, also may have contributed to the Bank's
efforts to continue using basic data gathered earlier and update these
rather than conducting new investigations. Given the relatively long prep-
aration period for the project, it may have been advisable to conduct a
systematic review of the assumptions and methodology in light of the
current situation.   The time constraint facing Bank staff may also have
contributed to Bank assumption of a more direct role in project preparation
with various short-cut approaches used in quantifying works and estimating
costs.
78.        Once the contracts were awarded and the works began, it became
more and more difficult to halt or drastically change the project even
though its economic and financial viability became less certain.
79.        Performance of the Government.  The Government helped to formu-
late the project concept and it was aware of the inherent risks it was
willing to accept.   Because of various activities in the country (e.g. the
election campaign), the preparation period was rather lengthy. The Govern-
ment claimed that its preparation team noted many deficiencies ia the
Bank's assumptions during project appraisal. As noted above, on the main
issues of inflation and quantity estimations, both sides were either too
conservative or too liberal. However, the Government should have insisted
that there be a detailed review and analysis before it proceeded with the
project. After the poor bidding response, the Government should also have
called a temporary halt to the project in order to undertake a joint in-
depth analysis of the project with the aim of cancelling the works if the
results of the study suggested this.
80.        Once the dimension of the problem was recognized, the Govern-
ment's response was prompt.   It at first sought external assistance, and
then decided to use its own resources to have the project completed. Also,
it agreed to modify the management arrangement and it is working closely
with CHM to assure maximum project benefits.
81.       It would have helped if the Government had reviewed the level of
construction activity in the country and made conscious efforts to plan its
new projects in a scattered pattern in order to avoid the high bids
received from contractors working in a full employment environment.
Another more long-lasting and widespread effect of such "bunched' construc-
tion work is the resulting high wages being sought by unionized workers



- 21 -
and their reluctance to having wage reductions even in the currently high
unemployment economy.
82.         Performance of the Project Unit.  The PU functioned well as a
technical and monitoring entity. However, in its coordinating and imple-
menting role, it was rather passive, allowing the consultants and the con-
tractor to become the primary actors, and perhaps, leading to friction and
diversion of resources away   from the main task of problem solving for
project implementation.
83.              Performance  of  the  Caribbean  Development  Bank  (CDB).
Although this was a jointly financed project (Bank-CDB), each external
agency had defined areas of participation.  There were intensive interac-
tion during project preparation. However, these were not extended through
project implementation. Each agency had close contacts with the PU and the
Government, and CDB also had a representative on the board of BTIC.
84.        Perhaps, the limited Bank-CDB implementation contact was due to
the nature of the works being financed. With CDB involved in minor infra-
structure work and financing of furniture and equipment, and the Bank, in
other works, the need for day-to-day inter-agency contacts was not great.
Nevertheless, cooperation between these agencies was excellent and the CDB
conducted extensive monitoring and follow-up studies. Also, the CDB's role
In trying to have the Government conduct a mid-term review of the project
and to change the project design wheai necessary, was very commendable.
85.        Performance of BTIC.  BTIC's role was to become prominent after
the hotel complex was handed over to individual operators.   With the
changed design of the project, BTIC now has a reduced but still very impor-
tant role to play.   It must cooperate fully with CHM and there must be
careful review and analysis of both the short and long term operation of
the facilities. The manager should have full day-to-day operating respon-
sibilities of BTIC with the Board of Directors being responsible primarily
for policy decisions.
86.       Performance of CHM.  CHM faced many start-up problems whech were
compounded by delays in handover of the project and design difficulties.
It has now passed the start-up phase and it will have to intensify its
marketing and management skills in order to maximize the benefits of this
project.   This is especially true for the summer season when occupancy
rates and revenues usually decline.
87.        Overall, the concept of the project was innovative insofar as it
offered a potentially viable alternative for increasing local participation
in a  cooperative  effort.    Unfortunately,  cost  overruns  and declining
tourist inflows worked against it from the start, and so many of the inter-
esting marketing and management innovations were not implemented. Future
tourism increases may make this a more profitable operation, in time. How-
ever, from the macro-economic point of view, and based upon the re-
estimated economic analysis, the question of maximization and use of avail-
able resources would linger.



- 22 -
88.         In future cases such as these, there may be need to take hard
decisions such as restructuring or aborting projects, if new evidence
indicates that significant factors (e.g. cost, projected revenues and
goals) undergo substantial changes after initial designs and preparation
are completed.

struction delays due to the poor nature of the
soil (extensive landfills required).

Manager                     negotiations with lowest bidder do not produce
Barbados from               better  estimates,  and  possible  changes  in
LCP Urban                   specifications  and  slicing  of  contracts  to
attract more biders.
Cable from             2.      An immediate response from the Bank regarding
Project Manager                contract award was imperative since the main
to LCP Urban                 contractor had stipulated as a condition that a
decision must be given by the weeke'xd to ensure
completion of the works by December 1982.
Cable to Project    1.      Approval  of  award  of  coutract  packages  for
Mauager,                    buildings and infrastructure to Bernard Sunley
Barbados from               and Sons; landscaping and bypass road phase I to
LCP Urban                   Parks and Beaches Commission and Rayside Asphalt
December 12, 1980           respectively.
Internal             1.    Concern that due to the high prices returned by
memorandum                  contractors on the building and infrastructure
LCP Urban to                works, even with the negotiated reductions the
Controllers                 consultants fees will ultimately result in a
April 27, 1981              much tigher remuneration than anticipated in the
SAR of March 1979.
Supervision Report   1.    International tenders on six major civil works
January 8, 1982             p&bckages produced insufficient number of partic-
ipants and quotations in excess of SAR esti-
mates.
2.    Bank  recommended  inviting new  bids,  however,
Borrower did not welcome due to resulting imple-
mentatino delays.   Bank, therefore, agreed to
Borrower entering into direct negotiations with
two lowest bidders on condition that a full
report on their procedures and results be sub-
mitted to Bank before contracts award - condi-
tion partially met by Borrower.
3.    Authorization  by Bank  of  award  of  contracts
despite cost overruns of 118% on these packages.
4.    Contractor's performance appears to be poor in
quality and timeliness.
5.    Borrower claims cost overruns due to obligation
of following ICB procedures and unforeseen
inflation. Project costs at appraisal of
BDS$34.4 m had to be revised to BDS$'.6.6 m and
are now forecasted at BDS$62 m.
6.    Government asks for reappraisal of project by
Coopers and Lybrand.   Their financial rate of
return was estimated at 18% in current prices at
4.8% in constant terms.

Update as of           1.    Using same assumptions at appraisal, expected
February 13, 1982            ERR  for  project  has  fallen  from  17.5%  at
appraisal to 11.8% (about equal to shadow cost
of capital in Barbados which is 11%).
2.    Using only the additional costs to be borne in
conjunction with expected benefits, resultant
ERR is 26.4%.
3.    Recommendation that every effort be made to con-
tinue  the project.   There  is a need for the
Government to carefully monitor costs and con-
struction schedules.
Supervision           1.    Quality and timeliness of contractors perform-
Report                       ance has improved.
July 9, 1982          2.    While project's general trends show considerable
improvement since the last review, expenditures
already have reached US$13 m and the projects
financial viability remains questionable.
3.    Appointment of marketing consultants has taken
place.
4.    Disbursement level has been brought up to 51% of
loan proceeds.

November 22, 1982    3.    Request for IBRD  to  agree  to  extend  Closing
Date to December 31, 1985 (Loan Agreement:
Closing      Date     December       31,     1984).
Supervision           1.    Project currently 60% completed (9 months behind
Report                       schedule).
December 19, 1982    2.    Contractors performance poor in terms of quanti-
ty of work produced, quality of execution, works
organization and labor relations.
3.    Government  proposal  (and  IBRD  agreement)  to
lease resort to a single hotel management com-
pany.
Note:  current  downward  trends  of  Barbados
tourism market and increased costs of project
raise serious doubts over viability of previous
concept (individual leasing to seven Barbadian
operators and management of central facilities
and marketing through a public corporation).
4.    Organization, staffing and financial projections
for BTIC (Barbados Tourism Investment Corpora-
tion) may have to be revised.
