I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Industrial Growth
Background
1.01      Paraguay is a landlocked country endowed with large areas of unutil-
ized land well suited for agriculture, and substantial hydroelectric potential
largely of the Parana River, which forms the country's eastern and southern
border. During much of the twentieth century Paraguay's economic development
had been limited by remoteness from foreign markets, scattered population, a
weak transport network and political instability. GNP, per capita income and
employment grew slowly, and it was not until the 1970s, with the rapid expan-
sion of land under cultivation, the introduction of new cash crops, and the
construction of hydroelectric plants on the Parana River, that the country's
economic potential began to be tapped on a larger scale. Employment opportun-
ities have expanded, and rising per capita income, growing at an average of
5.2% during 1972-78 compared to 1.2% p.a. for the previous 30 years, has been
accompanied by improvements in the standard of living, a higher literacy rate,
and decreased infant mortality.
1.02      Agricultural development has been a most important component of
economic growth in the seventies. Based on 1972 national census data, almost
one-half of the employed population are agricultural workers, and agriculture
accounts for one-third of GDP. A rise in external demand and more favorable
prices were instrumental in accelerating agricultural growth from about 2.5%
p.a. between 1962-72 to over 7% between 1972-78. The industrial sector, 1/
which contributes about 16% 2/ to GDP and employs 14% of the labor force, is
heavily dependent upon agriculture, as two-thirds of the sector's value added
is derived from processing agricultural products. The relative abundance of
agricultural raw materials is reflected in the importance of agroindustries,
many of which are located in rural areas. Most other industrial firms are
located around the capital city, Asuncion.
1.03      The industrial sector has been an important growth sector in the
1970s, and during 1971-78 industrial value added grew at an average annual
rate of 7.7% (Annex 1). During 1971-74, it grew at 7.4% p.a. The main growth
subsectors were those with export potential, and industrial growth in the
period was oriented toward external markets. In 1975-78, industrial growth
(8.1% p.a.) was more closely related to developments in the domestic markets.
A drop in traditional exports was compensated somewhat by an increase in new
exports (para. 1.04) and increased industrial activity associated with the
construction of the Itaipu dam (the largest hydroelectric facility in the
world) and the growth of local demand resulting from increased disposable
income helped to maintain a continued high rate of growth.

-2-
Industrial Exports
1.04      The total value of exports (in current prices) grew sharply from
US$65.3 million in 1970 to US$281.5 million in 1978 (Annex 3). Industrial
exports, mainly beef, wood products and vegetable oils, which had accounted
for three fourths of the total value of exports at the beginning of the
decade, were replaced in importance by agricultural exports, which increased
from 15% of the total in 1970 to 55% in 1978. The biggest factors in the
growth of agricultural exports were cotton exports, which grew from US$4
million in 1970 to US$100 million in 1978, and soya and other seeds, which
increased from US$11 million in 1970 to US$42 million in 1978. By 1978,
industrial exports accounted for only one-third of the total value of exports.
This decline was due principally to the closure of the EEC market to beef ex-
ports and of the Argentine market to sawn wood exports (paras. 1.10 and 1.14).
These two products had accounted for about two-thirds of the total value of
industrial exports at the beginning of the 1970s. Meat and sawn wood receipts
fell in real terms by 41% between 1970-76, but in 1977-78 they experienced a
modest recovery mainly as a result of increased sales to Brazil. However, the
emergence of processing activities for crops whose production has grown, due
to the government's colonization programs and to rapidly increasing external
prices, has counteracted part of the fall in the traditional industrial
exports. Increased exports of such products as vegetable oils and cake were
the result of the fast growth of soybean and cotton production, in spite of
the fact that, largely as a device to raise revenue, the government levies
duties on processed agricultural goods (manufactured goods are exempted).
Normal duties range from 1.5%-11%, but other taxes and fees (para. 1.24) can
amount to an additional 6%. Prospects for continued growth of industrial
exports appear bright, although continuing high levels of inflation may cause
a problem for exports, depending on the level of the exchange rate in the
future.
1.05      It should be noted that the distinction between agricultural and
industrial exports is rather arbitrary in the case of some major subsectors,
and leads to difficulties in establishing clear trends between these two
spheres of production. When distinguishing between the two sectors it should
be kept in mind that industrial exports consist largely of processed agricultural
products. Consequently, although the government's statistics list the ginning
of cotton as an industrial activity, the exports of the ginned cotton are con-
sidered as agricultural exports. Since at least two-thirds of the value added
of exported cotton represents value added from ginning, the exclusion of this
item from industrial exports (given its rapidly increasing importance in total
exports) distorts the overall growth trend of industrial exports. Conversely,
while not important, exports of wooden logs, which involve a very low level of
processing, are accounted for as industrial exports.
1.06      A significant indicator regarding the role of industrial exports is
the relationship between the value of exports and the gross value of industrial
output. As indicated in Table 1.1 below, exports have not been a significant
factor in relation to total production and amounted to about 19% of the latter
in 1970 and 1974. The decline in industrial exports is clearly indicated by
the fact that by 1978, they amounted to only 10% of the gross value of output.
The important role of ginned cotton is also evident, as its inclusion under



- 3-
industrial exports would have kept such exports at about 20% of gross
production over the whole 1970-80 period.
1.07      Overall trends in industrial export performance, the changing role
of industrial exports in relation to gross value of industrial output and the
influence of ginned cotton exports are shown in Table 1.1 below:

Industrial exports and cotton to

1.08      The exchange rate of the guarani to the dollar has been pegged to
the dollar at 0126 = US$1, since the 1960s. A dual exchange system has been
in operation since 1973, with official transactions taking place at the
0126 rate and other transactions at a free market rate. Although Paraguay
has had a remarkable record of price stability, with the recent acceleration
of inflation (para 2.12), the official rate of ¢126 at which most exports and
imports are required to be transacted, may impair export possibilities.
Industries which have to take into account rising domestic production costs
and sell their output at prices determined in international markets, may find
themselves unable to compete in foreign markets.
Major Subsectors and their Performance
1.09      Industry in Paraguay is characterized by a low level of processing
and value-added and is highly dependent on local raw materials. It is only
modestly diversified, and eight subsectors represent 80% of total value-added
(Annexes 1 and 2). Table 1.2 indicates the relative share of major subsectors
in value-added in 1970, 1974 and 1978, and the growth rate of these subsectors
in 1970-74 and 1974-78.

1.10      Food Processing.  Although food processing is still the most import-
ant subsector in terms of value added, its relative importance has dropped by
10% of the sector's total between 1970-78 and its growth rate (1.5% p.a.
between 1974-78) is now nominal. The decline in food products resulted largely
from a sharp drop in beef exports (meat products amount to over 50% of value-
added of food products), due to import restrictions in the EEC. To some extent
the lost markets were compensated for by increased exports to the US but the
main problem facing Paraguay's beef processors has been the sizeable demand for
live cattle from Brazilian slaughterhouses (they are operating at only 50-60%
of capacity due to a severe reduction in Brazilian herds), which have been
able to pay high prices for live beef and have diverted cattle from Paraguayan
slaughterhouses. As hides and skins processing is a by-product of cattle
slaughtering, this subsector suffered a similar decline. As a result, a
significant over-capacity exists in beef processing, and a number of meat-
packing plants have closed.
1.11      Within the food processing subsector, the production of edible
vegetable oils and cakes (mainly soya oil and flour, cotton seed oil and cake,
mixed oils, coconut cake) has been a small but growing area of production.
Total annual value of output (in 1972 prices) of edible vegetables and cakes
increased by 80% during 1970-78, rising from 8% of total output of the food
processing subsector in 1970 to about 15% in 1978. A major reason for the
dynamism of this industry has been its ability to develop exports, which now
account for about one-half of output. Other food processing industries, such
as flour milling and bread products, are oriented toward the domestic market,
and did not grow significantly in the 1970s. Food canning has never developed
into an important subsector, mainly due to difficulties arising from a limited
supply and low quality of raw materials, rising costs and loss of exports to
Argentina. However, several other food processing industries have favorable
1/   Including cigarettes, footwear, printing, metal products, transportation,
equipment and handicrafts.



prospects for further growth. As meat production declined and prices of avail-
able beef rose, the processing of poultry expanded rapidly, and possibilities
for further growth are quite favorable. Also, although sugar production has
suffered from a lack of efficiency (most sugarcane is grown on small farms
where yields are quite low and sugar mills lack modern equipment and
techniques, causing low output and capacity utilization) the rising price of
sugar in the world market should stimulate increased production and exports.
1.12      Textiles.  Cotton ginning accounts for about 50% of the value added
of the textiles subsector and about 70% of the gross output, and the rapid
recent growth of the subsector is due mainly to increasing exports of ginned
cotton (para. 1.04). About one-fourth of textile production is devoted
to cotton cloth, and most of the balance to the production of clothing and
carpets. The production of finished textile goods has been insufficient to
meet local demand, and during the 1970s about 60% of domestic needs were met
by imports. It appears that much of the cloth exports may have returned as
finished goods in the form of registered and unregistered imports. However,
the increasing price differential between the prices of consumer goods such
as textiles in Paraguay, and in Brazil and Argentina, has led to a rapid
growth of the local clothing industry which seems largely oriented toward
Brazilian and Argentine tourists. In fact, the boom in regional tourism has
been stimulated in part by the cheaper prices of Paraguayan goods. 1/
1.13      A consumer goods industry that has grown rapidly, reflecting the
boom that has been occurring in the Paraguayan economy, is the production
of beverages. Growth of this industry has been in response to rapidly rising
domestic demand due to rising incomes and increased purchasing power associa-
ted with the high level of economic growth of the 1970s. Production consists
mainly of soft drinks and beer, although there is also some production of
alcohol, wine and mineral water. Output of soft drinks has increased at 25%
p.a. between 1970 and 1978. While beer production increased at 14% p.a.
during the same period, it actually doubled in 1974-78 and is expected to
continue to expand at about the same rate, since the two existing breweries,
which have a combined capacity of 600,000 hectoliters, plan to expand their
capacity by 500,000 additional hectoliters within the next 2-4 years. The
share of soft drinks and beer together accounted for 83% of subsectoral output
in 1978.
1.14      Wood products.  During 1971-74 wood products was the fastest growing
industrial subsector, due primarily to uncut wood exports to Argentina. How-
ever, although wood products managed to retain (and slightly increase) their
share in value added in 1975-78, the subsector's growth rate fell drastically
due to a curtailment of sawn wood exports to Argentina (apparently largely due
to Argentine retaliation to Paraguay's earlier decision to prohibit exports of
1/   About 50% of Paraguay's tourist receipts have been attributed to the
purchase of consumer goods and, although many of these goods are imported,
local production of textiles, clothes, shoes, leather goods and artisan
products has increased rapidly to help meet this demand.



uncut wood--almost all of which were going to Argentine sawmills). Production
began to recuperate in 1977-78, as sawn wood exports to Brazil began to compen-
sate for the loss of the Argentine market. Prospects for growth are good, given
the country's extensive forest reserves and the expected continued growth of
domestic and external demand for wood products. The industry, however, faces
several constraints. It is characterized by the presence of small sawmills
using rudimentary technologies which utilize only the most valuable species,
with little attention given to reforestation. Elaboration of the sawn wood
suffers from deficiencies such as poor drying processes. Thus, the sector
offers ample scope for improvements in technology, resource management and
further processing of output.
1.15      Other important subsectors.  The production of petroleum products
in Paraguay's sole refinery has been increasing in response to rapidly increas-
ing demand since 1973. Production has now almost reached installed capacity
of 10,000 barrels per day, and Paraguay will soon have to resume imports of
petroleum products. The non-metallic minerals subsector consists mostly of
construction materials such as cement (40% of value of subsectoral output in
1978), bricks and tiles (22%), concrete pipes and tubes (18%) and other pro-
ducts such as lime, plaster, clay pipes and tubes, and mosaic floor tiles.
The rapidly increasing growth of value added by the sector (6% p.a. from
1970-74 and 12.2% from 1974-78), has been due mainly to the construction needs
of the Itaipu dam and related infrastructure and housing growth in CPS, Asun-
cion and other cities which have participated in the construction boom. Dom-
estic cement production has not been sufficient to meet domestic demand (includ-
ing the requirements of the Itaipu project), and imports have risen from 4,500
tons in 1977 to about 58,000 tons in 1979. Demand for cement should continue
to increase, in view of the boom in the construction industry.  In addition,
future hydroelectric projects will require substantial additional amounts of
cement. Based on these expectations, a doubling or tripling of domestic
production is being considered. Production of essential oils (principally
peppermint, of which Paraguay is the only world producer) and quebracho extract,
a tanning agent, accounted for 45% of value of output of the chemicals subsector
in 1978. Prospects for increasing production of peppermint oil, which is
almost entirely exported, are favorable due to steady demand in world markets;
quebracho production has stagnated, as it is being increasingly replaced by
synthetic products.   Production of other chemical products, such as pharmaceuticals,
soap, detergents, matches and cosmetics, which are produced for the domestic market,
has grown slowly, and expansion of output for these products should not be a
major factor in the future growth in the subsector.
1.16      The two most important trends in the industrial sector during the
1970s have been (i) the steady 7-8% p.a. overall growth in value added during
the period and (ii) major shifts in the importance of subsectors. During the
first half of the decade, the dominant growth subsector was wood products
(20% p.a.), while food processing (mainly meat products), textiles, and
non-metallic minerals also showed rates of growth (6-9% p.a.) as high or
higher than that of the economy as a whole. In the latter part of the decade,
the decline of the meat industry and slowdown in the rate of growth of wood
products was counteracted by rapidly rising production of beverages, textiles,



petroleum products, and non-metallic minerals (principally construction
materials), which grew at rates of 12-20% p.a. The subsectors with the
likeliest prospects for future expansion are those which are linked to
(i) large-scale development projects within Paraguay (construction), (ii)
rising consumer demand resulting from larger disposable income (beverages,
textiles), or (iii) processing activities linked to rapid expansion of agri-
cultural production (vegetable oil and cake).
B. Structural Characteristics
Size and Distribution of Enterprises
1.17      Available data regarding the number and size distribution of firms
are inconsistent. A major problem is that the most recent industrial census
was made in 1963. A more recent source, the UNDP Industrial Development Report
of 1976, lists the total number of industrial establishments at 22,648 employ-
ing 130,666 workers, but it apparently included many simple family processing
installations which are unregistered. On the other hand, a 1977 joint IDB/
Ministry of Industry survey of Asuncion and 37 other towns, which was estimated
to cover 90-95% of industrial enterprises, lists only 7,001 enterprises with
39,560 workers. Since the 1977 survey included actual enterprises visited and
covered all urban areas with significant levels of industrial activity, the
results can be considered as representing a reasonably accurate picture of the
structure of industry in Paraguay (bearing in mind that perhaps up to 15,000
very small processing operations exist in rural areas, whose efficiency, output
and contribution to the sector cannot presently be measured with any degree of
accuracy). Table 1.3 summarizes the findings of the 1977 survey.
Table 1.3: STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
Size of Enterprise   No. of Estab-  Percentage of          Total        Percentage
(No. of employees)    lishments       Establishments    Employment    of Workers
1 -  4             5,677             81.1            11,548          29.2
5 - 19             1,048             15.0             7,956          20.1
20+                  276              3.9            20,056          50.7
While most industrial firms in Paraguay are small scale, 4% of the firms employ
about one-half of the urban industrial work force. Based upon a comparison of
total employment and assets of enterprises, average assets (based on original
book value) per worker would amount to US$9,650 (in 1977 US$) for firms with
five or more workers.
Employment and Wages
1.18      According to a population census of 1972, the manufacturing sector
accounts for about 14% of the work force. Tentative estimates made by the
National Planning Secretariat (STP) indicate that employment in the sector
increased by 7.7% p.a. between 1976-79, compared to 7.2% for the economy as a



- 8 -
whole. The minimum wage is US$4.70 equivalent per day and it is applied mostly
in industrial enterprises in the formal sector. In comparison with countries of
similar size and level of industrial development--US$3.26 in Costa Rica (1977)
and US$2.80 in El Salvador (1979)--wages are relatively high in Paraguayan In-
dustry. However, this level compares favorably with Paraguay's larger and more
highly industrialized neighbors (US$4.00 in Argentina and US$5.23 in Brazil).
While the minimum wage legislation was not consistently enforced in the
smaller firms, more recently, as the economic boom developed, a growing number
of workers were reportedly raised to and beyond the minimum level.
Regional Distribution of Industry
1.19      Industrial development has occurred mainly within and around Asun-
cion. The 1963 industrial census shows that Asuncion and the surrounding area
accounted for over 40% of establishments. While the 1977 survey showed that
61% of all industrial firms were located in Asuncion and vicinity, and that of
the larger firms (20 employees or more), 70% were located there, the survey
covered only firms in urban areas. The concentration of industry primarily
reflects the concentration of population and markets in Asuncion, access to
export outlets and limitations on the availability of transport infrastructure
and other services outside the capital area. In recent years, the government
has been providing incentives for establishing new industrial plants outside
of the Asuncion area, but these efforts have been only partially successful
(para. 1.29).
C.   Industrial Policy
Industrial Policy Goals
1.20      The government's industrial policy is stated in the 1977-81 develop-
ment plan prepared by the STP and the Ministry of Industry. The plan establishes
the sector's objectives which include (i) the acceleration of industrial and
employment growth; (ii) increasing the productivity of industry; (iii) improving
the regional distribution of enterprises; (iv) promotion of export-oriented
industry, particularly of agroindustry; and (v) development of new industries
based on utilization of local raw materials. The government aims at achieving
these objectives largely through the granting of fiscal incentives, credit,
and the provision of infrastructure and public services to foster private
sector investment in industry. Thus, only in exceptional cases would the
government participate through direct investment in publicly owned industrial
enterprises.
New Industries
1.21      In addition to the expansion of cement production (para. 1.15), the
government has plans to develop a steel industry in association with Brazilian
interests (including private participation), who will provide financing, tech-
nology and marketing services. The plant will have an annual capacity of
100,000 tons of pig iron and will cost approximately US$86 million. The only
important local input is charcoal; iron scrap is to be imported from Brazil.
Because of the present small size of the Paraguayan market, initially a large
part of the plant's output will be exported to Brazil.



1.22      Anticipated availability of large supplies of electricity from
Itaipu after 1983 has raised the issue of how best to use this resource.
Although there is general agreement on the need to conduct studies to determine
the feasibility of energy-intensive industries, these have been uncoordinated
and partial. The carrying out of properly coordinated studies is essential,
if a decision is to be made between the option of promoting such industries or
selling the electricity to Brazil. The government is now attempting, with
Bank support, to establish a policy in connection with the possible development
of electric-intensive industries and the Bank is also considering the possibility
of providing technical assistance to the government in determining if other
studies are needed.
Industrial Incentives
1.23      The government's industrial sector strategy has aimed at the creation
of a favorable investment climate for private investors. The main instrument has
been Industrial Promotion Law No. 216 of 1970, which was replaced in 1976 by
Law No. 550 (Annex 4). The law specifies two types of industries which qualify
for fiscal incentives: (i) "necessary" industries--those that export or are
based on local raw materials; and (ii) "convenient" industries, which substi-
tute for imports. These definitions are so wide that most investments can
qualify for some benefits under the law. Table 1.4 summarizes the major
incentives provided under the law.
Table 1.4: FISCAL EXEMPTION UNDER LAW 550

Necessary            Convenient

Import Duties on Capital Goods                     100%                 100%
Foreign Exchange Conversion Taxes                  100%                  70%
Preimport Deposits                                 100%
Income Taxes                                50% for 5 years        35% for 5 years
Import Duties on Other Goods               100% for 3 years        75% for 2 years
Tariff Protection
1.24      Paraguay has established a complex system of import duties which
includes formal tariffs (including basic, additional and complementary duties)
and fees and taxes (such as exchange rate tax, consular fee, stamp tax,
port tax, statistical tax, customs clearance fee). According to the Ministry
of Finance's data, the average nominal tariff is 40%; however, actual nominal
protection as a result of other fees and charges averages 90% (on machinery,
for example, the nominal tariff is 27% and the nominal protection 77%). This
tariff system is comprised of a series of levies that date as far back as
1924, and are basically designed to raise tariff revenue. By 1970, the
government had realized that the system was not conducive to the nation's
industrial sector developmental needs, and the above-mentioned industrial
promotion laws were promulgated as a means of granting tariff exemptions based
on the capacity of individual enterprises to meet the established developmental
criteria.



- 10 -
1.25      By 1978, however, the government had recognized that the approach
undertaken under the industrial investment laws was still inadequate, particu-
larly in regard to the limited tax exemption on imported raw materials and
other inputs. Consequently, by Decree No. 40840 of 1978, a flat 12% duty was
levied on all raw materials and inputs used by industries (necessary and con-
venient) without time limitation. Although the 12% duty considerably reduces
the level of protection, the fees and other taxes mentioned above raise the
actual duty paid to about 19.5% on raw materials and other inputs and to 15.45%
for capital goods. Industrialists prefer paying these taxes rather than being
exempt from the full duty for a period of 2-3 years only. Thus, the degree
to which firms benefit from tariff reduction depends on the option exercised
by the individual industrialist.
1.26      With a low tariff level on inputs and a relatively high tariff on
manufactured goods, it would seem that effective protection 1/ for manufactured
imports was high overall, but in reality, the Paraguayan economy is basically
"open," and many manufactured imports enter the country without paying tariffs
and other costs (i.e., as unregistered imports). Paraguay's geographic isola-
tion, and the high costs associated with transporting some goods, have provided
Paraguayan industry with a varying degree of natural protection. Nevertheless,
many local manufacturers have to compete with unregistered imports, and a number
of goods are being traded at close to their world market prices.
Regional Development
1.27      Background.  In Eastern Paraguay, the emergence of substantial eco-
nomic opportunities--due to the rapid expansion of the agricultural frontier
and the construction of the large Itaipu and Yacyreta hydroelectric projects
on the Parana River--has intensified previously existing flows of internal
and external migration, broadened the regional economy's resource base, and
brought about a closer integration of the area with the rest of Paraguay, as
well as with neighboring Brazil and Argentina. The government's emerging
strategy for the area calls for an integrated approach through investments
that are complementary in nature, and Bank assistance to the area involves
projects for rural development, education and training, and a major highway
project linking the two growth poles of Encarnacion and CPS and providing a
comprehensive network of feeder roads to the area.
1.28      Although the government has not yet developed clear objectives for
regional development or decentralization of industry, priority areas outside
of the central region have been designated, and investment incentives (i.e.,
tax rebates on reinvested profits, low-cost infrastructure services, access to
credit facilities) would be granted to industries locating in these areas.
In particular, there is an ongoing effort to decentralize new industrial
plants outside the municipal boundaries of Asuncion. Total investment of
firms qualifying under industrial incentives legislation showed that during
1974-78 about 45% of total investment approved would locate in or near Asuncion
and in the surrounding Central Department. In the Alto Parana and Itaipu
departments, where the Itaipu and Yacyreta hydroelectric projects have caused
1/   No systematic review has ever been carried out to determine the degree
of actual effective protection under which industry in Paraguay has
developed.



- 11 -
a dramatic rise in economic activity, 29% of total approved industrial invest-
ment would be located during the next few years. Fully 75% of approved
industrial investment is expected to take place along the east-west corridor
bordering the Asuncion-CPS highway, including the central portion of the
departments of Central, Caaguazu and Alto Parana.
1.29      Although a general decentralization policy exists, incentives are
limited and not clearly defined, and they do not appear to have played an
important role in investment decision-making. More important are those fac-
tors which are most critical to an industrialist in making a location decision,
such as the nearness to raw materials or markets and the existence of neces-
sary infrastructure. The factor which weighs most heavily on costs is liable
to determine where a plant will be located. For instance, a large part of
the industrial investment approved for the Itaipu area was associated with
construction involving the hydroelectric project, and in 1978, when construc-
tion activities were well under way, only 8% of total approved investment was
for the Itaipu area, far below levels approved in the previous three years.
Consequently, many new industrial investment opportunities during the next
4-5 years are likely to be found in those areas where (i) economic activity
in general is being rapidly stepped up, and (ii) sizeable expansion in agricul-
tural output is creating new opportunities for processing agricultural products.
Most of this development is taking place in Eastern Paraguay where the govern-
ment is attempting, with Bank assistance, to establish a development strategy
for the region. 1/
1.30      An industrial development strategy.  In developing an industrializa-
tion strategy for Eastern Paraguay, the comparative advantage for each of the
regional development poles of CPS and Encarnacion should be taken into account
in building a local industrial base. In CPS, substantial investment in
industry has already taken place, partly in connection with the Itaipu construc-
tion activities. With construction now well advanced, no additional investments
related to these works are expected to take place. However, other industries
undoubtedly will take advantage of the strategic location of CPS and establish
themselves in that city, although in general, the larger manufacturers of con-
sumer goods will tend to stay near their major markets, which are closer to
Asuncion than to CPS. Already, in response to the expansion of the local
market in CPS, a number of smaller firms in such areas as printing, baking,
clothing, shoes, household furnishings and hardware, and wooden furniture
have been established. No major physical constraints are apparent to prevent
the further expansion of the industrial base in CPS.
1.31      In Encarnacion, additional industrial investment is expected to take
place as a consequence of the development of the city as a major port once
the Yacyreta dam is erected. In addition, because part of the city will be
flooded, 68 industrial plants will have to be relocated in an industrial zone,
in which an industrial estate is planned. Industrialists whose sites are being
flooded have the choice either to be relocated free of charge or to obtain the
market value of their present assets. If the industrial estate is planned,
built and managed efficiently, and if project financing is also offered, many
firms should find the estate more attractive and economical than alternate
1/   See the Bank's report, Regional Development in Eastern Paraguay (1978).



- 12 -
locations. Additional demand will appear as existing enterprises expand or
new enterprises decide to locate there. Consequently, the immediate need
to be met by the estate would be to provide suitable accommodation for displaced
industries, while its longer-term objective would be to meet industrial growth
needs (para 4.10).
1.32      In addition, both cities are located at important points of contact
with neighboring countries, where there is, or will be, easy access across
international frontiers, and where considerable potential for the development
of tourism industry exists. Iguazu Falls is an important international tourism
destination, and with the completion of construction of the Itaipu dam, the
largest in the world, the tourism potential of this area will increase consider-
ably. In addition, much regional tourism involves purchases of Paraguayan
consumer goods (such as textiles, clothing, shoes, leather goods, and artisan
wood products), and so the development of local tourism is linked with the
development of consumer goods production--much of it small scale--in CPS and
Encarnacion.
Industrial Investment and Outlook
1.33      Aggregate investment in the economy has accelerated during the seven-
ties from 12.2% of GDP in 1971 to 20.9% in 1978. Reliable estimates for indus-
trial investment, however, do not exist. The only available indicator would
be the authorizations granted to industrial investments approved under Law
216/550 1/ which, during the five-year period 1974-78, amounted to a total
of US$283 million equivalent. Considerable variation occurred among years,
with approvals averaging US$41.0 million equivalent in 1974-76, rising to
US$84.4 million in 1977, declining to US$75.9 million in 1978 and increasing
to US$101.7 million in 1979. Some of these variations were due to approvals
of very large individual projects in 1974 and 1977; however, overall, a size-
able growth trend in approvals is evident, particularly during 1977-79. An
indication that a level of annual investment in the US$100 million range may
continue over the next several years has been provided by the results of a
survey of a cross-section of industrial enterprises (70 enterprises in all),
which were visited during appraisal in order to obtain an estimate of invest-
ment plans from a sample of firms of varying sizes and representative of all
major subsectors. A majority of firms visited indicated that they were either
in the process of expanding output or intended to do so in the next 1-3 years.
1.34      Perhaps the best potential for growth lies in agroindustrial exports,
due to the sector s leading role as processor of agricultural commodities.  In
addition, rapidly growing domestic demand for basic consumer goods also pro-
vides a favorable outlook for these industries and the de facto openness of
the economy should prevent development of inefficient import substitution
industries. GDP grew at 4.2% p.a. during 1965-70 (industry at 5.6%), 6.5%
during 1971-74 (industry at 7.4%) and 9.5% during 1975-78 (industry at 7.7%),

the law, these data are considered to represent a close approximation of
the overall investment plans of the industrial sector as a whole.

with GDP expected to grow at an average of 8.0% p.a. during 1980-83. It seems
reasonable to expect, therefore, that a growth rate for 1980-84 of about 8%
p.a. could be achieved for the industrial sector as a whole, with some subsec-
tors growing at a faster rate. The degree to which large projects (such as
the cement and steel plants and electric energy intensive industries) can be
identified and implemented will continue to have an important effect on sectoral
growth trends.
II. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. The Banking System
2.01       The banking system in Paraguay is comprised of the central bank
(Banco Central del Paraguay, BCP), two development banks, the Banco Nacional
de Fomento (BNF) and COMDESA (Banco de Desarrollo del Paraguay), and 17 com-
mercial banks (Annex 5). Other financial institutions include the financieras
who grant short-term credit mainly for commercial and personal loans, the
National Housing Bank, savings and loan associations, the agricultural and
cattle funds, the Paraguayan Housing Institute and the Bank Employees Pension
Fund. The operations of the banking system are governed by Law No. 417 of
1973 and Law No. 771 of 1979. BCP is empowered to pass resolutions establish-
ing specific requirements to be met under the general conditions established
by the laws.
2.02      Banco Central del Paraguay was established in 1952 as the govern-
ment's fiscal agent, and is responsible for making monetary, credit and ex-
change rate policies; issuing and controlling currency; establishing and
enforcing legal reserves requirements, interest rate regulations, levels
of rediscount operations, regulating foreign exchange operations; supervis-
ing financial intermediaries; and the management of international reserves.
In recent years, BCP has taken a more direct role in economic development.
The Fondo Especial de Desarrollo (FED) was established by the BCP in 1976
to administer a credit program for rural enterprises. A second FED program,
to provide guarantees for small-scale enterprises, was established in 1978
(paras. 3.32-3.33).
2.03      Banco Nacional de Fomento is a state-owned development bank estab-
lished in 1961 to succeed the bankrupt Banco del Paraguay. It consists of
three departments--Agriculture, Development, and Commercial--each with inde-
pendent sources of funds and specific operating guidelines. With an extensive
network of 42 branches, BNF also provides banking services outside Asuncion,
which are the only such services in many regions of the country. With total
assets of ¢30 billion as of December 31, 1979, BNF is the largest financial
intermediary institution in Paraguay, holding 23% of the banking system's
assets (excluding BCP) and accounting for 30% of the system's total lending to
industry.
2.04      Commercial banks.  As of December 31, 1979, there were 17 privately
owned commercial banks in Paraguay. All except two (Banco Union and Banco



- 14 -
Nacional de Trabajadores) are foreign owned. 1/ Their credit operations are
financed mainly from deposits from the public and to some extent by redis-
counting with BCP. As of December 31, 1979, the commercial banks had total
assets of ¢90.6 billion, equal to 71% of the total assets of the banking
system, and the banks accounted for 69% of industrial loans outstanding from
the banking system.
2.05      Paraguay's only private development bank, COMDESA, has played only
a minor role in the financing of industry, despite financing from USAID and
technical assistance from ADELA Investment Company. COMDESA was established
in 1970 to supplement the credit operations of BNF by granting medium- and
long-term loans to industrial and agricultural enterprises by acquiring equity
participation in such companies. COMDESA had total assets of ¢1.2 billion at
December 31, 1979, of which about two-thirds were composed of loans granted
to industrial clients (i.e., equal to 3% of industrial lending from the
banking system).
B. Monetary Policy
2.06      BCP is empowered under the banking laws of 1973 and 1979 to estab-
lish requirements for legal reserves, minimum capital, ceilings on total
assets, portfolio composition, prior import deposits and rediscount and in-
terest rates to savers and borrowers. After its experience with high rates
of inflation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the government's main objec-
tive has been to follow cautious fiscal and monetary policies which would
help to maintain price stability. The lack of a negotiable securities market
instrument and the openness of the economy restrict the possibility of open
market operations, and limiting the expansion of credit has been the govern-
ment's main instrument for achieving its monetary policy objectives. BCP
has sought to contain credit expansion through: (i) restrictions on redis-
counting by BCP; (ii) maintaining high reserve requirements for commercial
banks; (iii) maintaining strict financial requirements in the form of minimum
capital requirements, low debt/equity ratios and restrictions on distribution
of profits for commercial banks; and (iv) establishing a high withholding tax
(30% of remitted interests) on foreign loans.2/ Under the 1979 banking law,
BCP was empowered to control the credit operations of savings and loan asso-
ciations and financieras, which had not been subject to existing banking
legislation. The government has also attempted to channel a significant
portion of the available credit to productive sectors by establishing minimum
portfolio requirements for commercial banks.
1/   Foreign banks include the following:  Citibank, Bank of America, Bank of
London and South America, Banco do Brasil, Banco de la Nacion Argentina,
Banco Exterior, Banco de Asuncion, Banco Holandes Unido, Banco Paraguayo
de Comercio, Banco Real del Paraguay, Banco Real de Fomento, Banco do
Estado de Sao Paulo, Interbanco, Bank of Boston, and Banco Aleman y
America del Sur.
2/   On March 27, 1980, however, commercial banks under control of local capital
were granted a reduction on the withholding tax on foreign loans.
They are now required to pay only 30% on the spread over LIBOR interest
rates, or alternatively, if foreign loans have a fixed rate, 6.5% of
remitted interests.



- 15 -
2.07      Legal reserve requirements are applicable by law to all banks and
other financial entities which hold private or public sector deposits, and
most recently under the 1979 law to savings and loan associations. The pre-
vailing reserve requirements are 42% against all private sector deposits in
local currency and 15% against all deposits in foreign currency. In May 1979,
BCP established limits on the amount of public sector deposits which banks
could hold, and imposed a 100% reserve requirement on all public sector deposits
exceeding the limit. A reserve requirement of 100% is also applied to prior
import deposits held with the banking system. A penalty is levied on any re-
serve deficiency at the end of each week 1/ equal to 0.25% of the deficiency.
Although other non-bank financial intermediaries, such as financieras, are
presently free of such requirements, BCP is empowered under the 1979 law to
establish legal reserve requirements for all financial system resources, such
as finance company promissory notes, rather than on only banking deposit
liabilities as was the case under the 1973 law. The high reserve requirements
have greatly restricted the capacity of the banking system to increase credit
operations, but have been BCP's most effective instrument in controlling credit
expansion.
2.08      BCP established financial requirements, such as the minimum capital
which must be paid in cash, for each bank and financial institution. In
February 1979, BCP raised the minimum share capital from 0300 million to 0600
million to be paid in by December 31, 1979. Commercial banks must also main-
tain a minimum ratio of capital and reserves to total assets (excluding those
funds which are held by BCP under its reserve requirement) equal to 20%. All
financial institutions must limit their outstanding loans to any one legal
entity to no more than 20% of capital and reserves unless a waiver is granted
by BCP, in which case the percentage limit may be raised to 30%. Contingent
liabilities are limited to 100% of capital. In addition to complying with a
minimum capital requirement, each bank must allocate at least 20% of annual
profits to a reserve fund until this fund reaches the bank's capital. Under
the law, BCP is empowered to establish minimum capital requirements for
branches as well. The limits on the amount of profit that can be remitted
abroad have been established at 20% of annual net profit (after allocation of
capital reserve) for all financial institutions. BCP's policy of requiring a
high level of capitalization relative to borrowed funds has also been effective
in limiting the growth of commercial banks' operations. At the same time, the
30% withholding tax on foreign loans effectively discouraged the banks
from channelling foreign resources into the banking system.
2.09      BCP's present requirements for the composition of commercial banking
loan portfolios for productive activities require that commercial banks must
hold a minimum of 25% of their portfolio in industrial loans, 20% in loans for
export financing, and 5% in agricultural loans. Interest and commissions on
this portion of banks' portfolio are regulated and cannot exceed 11.55% and 3%,
respectively, according to the following formula: annual interest rate of 11.55%
plus commissions of 2% for up to 240 days, 2.5% for 240 days to one year, and
3% for over one year. The BCP does allow commercial banks to rediscount at 5%
1/   Prior to the 1979 law, this was a daily requirement, but it resulted
in banks holding excess reserves in order not to be subject to a fine
in the case of a shortfall.



- 16 -
interest up to 30% of their productive portfolio, comprising loans with
maturities between 240 days and one year. While not more than 30% of their
commercial portfolio can be granted for import credits, commercial banks can
allocate the balance (i.e., up to 50% of their portfolio) to commercial
lending at a maximum interest rate of 12% p.a. plus commissions which are
unregulated and are set according to market conditions. At present, commis-
sions range from 8-12% p.a. and are normally collected in advance, increasing
the effective cost of funds to about 30% p.a. Compliance with the above
requirements is closely supervised by BCP, and it appears that this policy
has been effective in channelling banking system credit to productive purposes.
2.10      Under its rediscount policy, BCP is authorized to make loans to all
banks and credit institutions and to establish the differential between the
rediscount rate it sets and the rate charged by financial institutions to the
public. Until 1977 BCP operated only one general rediscount line, for banks
to refinance 20% of their loans made under the productive portfolio require-
ments, and several special rediscount lines which were established to assist
the agricultural sector to meet its most critical short-term credit needs
(i.e., through financing the marketing of agricultural products and raw mate-
rial exports) and to provide liquidity to BNF. When the government became
increasingly aware that a more direct intervention by BCP was required if
credit resources were to reach producers whose access to the banking system
and to longer-term financing was limited, a new rediscount window, the FED,
was created in 1977 with financial assistance from USAID to encourage banks
to lend for up to 7 years to small farmers and agroindustries. Tn August
1978, the FED was augmented by the PGGP, under which BCP rediscounted and
guaranteed (up to 75%) commercial bank loans to small enterprises which could
not qualify for other financing. By late 1979, both of these facilities had
been fully committed. The FED is expected to play a vital role in the pro-
posed project (paras. 4.05 and 4.07).
Interest Rates and Inflation
2.11      In early 1980, the government enacted a set of regulations aimed
at bringing the level of interest rates cleser to the present and expected
level of inflation (35.7% in 1979, 26% and 22% expected for 1980 and 1981,
respectively). In this connection, deposit interest rates have been increased
from 8% to 11% p.a. While these rates are still highly negative in real terms,
the government expects that, without having a major inflationary feedback effect,
the new rates could permit financial institutions to attract larger amounts of
local deposits and also help to reduce past distortions created when deposits
through local banks denominated in US dollars were paying higher rates (12%
p.a.) than the 8% p.a. permitted on deposits in guaranies. Also, reserve
requirements will be  introduced for deposits mobilized by the finance
companies. While the initial level of financieras' reserve requirements will be
small (5% is expected), the new regulations would enable BCP to make additional
adjustments in the near future to bring the cost of deposits for finance
companies more in line with the cost of deposits for the commercial banks,
reducing the existing distortion under which the finance companies' promissory
notes were growing substantially faster than debt instruments of other entities
in the Paraguayan financial system. In addition, the recent measures permit
the commercial banks to charge higher interest rates for productive loans
(11.5% compared to 10% previously), which, together with commissions, taxes and



- 17 -
other charges, raise nominal financial costs to at least 16% p.a.; however, since
most of these loans involve other costs not reflected in this figure (such as
maintaining compensating balances), effective interest rates are about 19%; and more
in line with inflationary trends in the economy. Under the proposed loan a
minimum onlending rate of 18% p.a. would be agreed upon (para. &-12). The
Bank intends to follow closely the implementation of the recently approved
measures and, in particular, to consult regularly with the government on the
adequacy of the new interest rate structure, which is expected to be in
line with rates charged under the proposed project.
2.12      The government is concerned about inflation and its effects on the
functioning of the financial system, and its response so far has focussed on
reducing the growth of the money supply by limiting credits to commercial banks
and raising reserve requirements on public sector deposits. In order to deal
with the effects of inflation on the mobilization and transfer of resources,
the government has prepared, with IMF assistance, a monetary program. Imple-
mentation of this program should help to correct the distortions that are
emerging and create adequate conditions for the effective utilization of
the proposed loan (para. 4.12). Inflation reached 35.7% in 1979, but should
decline in 1980, as the economy absorbs temporary price impacts such as
the rise in food prices, the recent oil price increase, and the effect on the
prices of construction materials resulting from the peak construction demand
at Itaipu. Although it does not seem likely that inflation rates will soon
return to the 1976 and 1977 period levels of 5% and 10%, respectively, the
rate of inflation is expected to go down to an average of about 26% in 1980,
22% in 1981 and somewhat less in subsequent years. In fact, the inflationary
pressures appear to have eased during the first months of 1980 as a result of
BCP's actions.
C. Mobilization of Resources
2.13      Private sector financial assets increased appreciably during recent
years, as indicated by the rise in the ratio of financial system liabilities
to the private sector to GDP from 22% in 1974 to 32% in 1978. This trend
reflects structural changes such as increased monetization of the economy,
the influx of new capital into the economy as a result of development of new
regional growth centers along the border with Brazil, a rapid growth in per-
sonal income, and relative price stability during that period.
2.14      Deposits.  While both money and quasi-money have expanded rapidly
in relation to GDP over the past four years, the growth rate of quasi-money
has been much faster, mainly because of the variety and higher attractiveness
of savings rates offered by the financial system in recent years, especially
by the savings and loan associations and the financieras (para. 2.11). This
trend has been paralleled by a marked shift in the supply of loanable funds
away from the traditional banking system towards both these types of inter-
mediaries, whose share in total private sector financial savings rose from
11.1% in 1974 to 19.4% in 1978 (Table 2.1 below).

2.15      Acceptances.  In February 1978, commercial banks were authorized to
operate in bankers' acceptances, which consists of the bank acting as guarantor
for two private parties, one with loanable funds and the other with a desire
to borrow them. Acceptances are limited to 180 days, and bear a 10% yield to
maturity. The effcctive annual rate to the purchaser is about 21% (due to six
months compounding) minus the cost of bank guarantee to purchaser, if any. Accep-
tances guaranteed by a single bank originally could reach an amount equal to
the bank's capital, and in 1978 acceptance financing became a major instrument
of bank credit. However, in February 1979, the limit of acceptances was re-
duced to 40% of a bank's individual capital, and acceptance financing fell
sharply during 1979 to that level.
2.16      Although an increasing proportion of financial resources have been
transferred to the private sector since the mid-1970s, most of the increase
involves growth of savings held by non-banking financial institutions. This
reflects the fact that the government's policy of limiting (i) credit expan-
sion and (ii) the ability of the commercial banks to mobilize resources, has
been effective as well. However, the non-bank institutions, which operated
outside the existing banking legislation, were able to respond to lending
demand pressure by offering savers much more favorable returns. The trend
is largely explained by the distortions in the structure of interest rates
and reserve requirements, which limit the capacity of commercial banks to
compete with non-bank institutions for deposits, and raises the effective
cost of bank funds relative to non-banks. The 1979 banking law was designed
expressly to include the non-bank institutions, and BCP is now able to estab-
lish a comprehensive monetary policy covering the entire financial system.
As part of its monetary program (para. 2.12), BCP has developed a strategy
for an improved allocation of resources by establishing more rational system-
atic interest rates for both lenders and borrowers.



- 19 -
D. Financing of Industry
2.17      During 1978, financial system credit to the private sector increased
by 33% (1979 data not available) compared with an average rate of 21% during
the previous five years. Within this total, the commercial banks and BNF
represent the largest share, although the relative importance of the non-bank
financial intermediaries has increased sharply, due mainly to the growth of
credit operations of the savings and loan associations and finance companies.
At the end of 1978, the non-bank financial intermediaries accounted for nearly
30% of total financial system credit to the private sector, compared with 24%
at the end of 1974. Although data for 1979 are not available, it appears that
this trend has accelerated in the past year. The destination of the banks'
credit to the private sector has been largely determined by the minimum port-
folio requirements of BCP, and the slower rate of growth of their lending
reflects the banks' difficulties in competing for resources with the non-bank
financial intermediaries.
2.18      Industrial financing.  Industrial investment in the 1970s was
financed by roughly equal shares of equity and retained earnings (55%) and
credit (45%). In the early 1960s, prior to the establishment of BNF and of
selective credit controls, commercial banks accounted for about 80%
of total industrial financing. Although accurate data are not available
on sources of industrial finance, a reasonable estimate would be that
BNF now accounts for about one-fourth, and commercial banks for about
one-half, of total in,ustrial credit.  Suppliers' credits accounted for much of
the rest, increasing :o almost one-fourth of total industrial credit in recent
years as commercial banks' liquidity tightened. COMDESA has contributed only
a marginal 1%. BNF has been lending mainly for fixed assets purchases, while
commercial banks have been concentrating on working capital financing. What-
ever the sources of credit, terms of most lending to industry range from 90-180
days, with only 10% extending beyond one year. However, in practice loans are
often rolled over. Suppliers' credits provide average terms of around three
years. Medium- or long-term dollar financing or other foreign currency financ-
ing by commercial banks is not an attractive alternative to industrialists in
Paraguay, since virtually all foreign loans contracted by the private sector
(whether directly or through the banking system) require payment of a 30% with-
holding tax on interest payments charged under the loans. Until 1976-77, when the
Bank's first industrial credit was approved and the FED discount window was
established at BCP, long-term financing for industry in Paraguay had been
provided only by IDB and KfW.
The Need for Bank Financing
2.19      The expectation that the industrial sector will grow by at least 8%
p.a. over the period 1980-83 can be justified by strong evidences of demand,
such as: (i) a survey of about 70 enterprises carried out by Bank staff during
the process of preparing the proposed project indicated that over one-half of
these enterprises were actively involved in, or were contemplating expansion
of their production facilities; (ii) the high growth rates in project approvals



- 20 -
of 14% p.a. over 1971-78 under the existing industrial incentive legislation,
is expected to continue; (iii) as of the end of December 1979, BNF had
a pipeline of subprojects requiring about US$10 million in foreign exchange
financing which substantially exceeded the US$2 million available under the
Bank's first industrial credit project; (iv) discussions with the major
commercial banks revealed that none were able to meet the demand for long-term
financing from their industrial clients; and (v) funds available to BCP's FED
have been fully committed.
2.20      Present estimates (para. 1.33) show that the demand for industrial
finance could well range above US$100 million annually during 1980-83. About
one-fourth of these investments would involve large-scale projects which would
be individually financed and would involve foreign investors, in particular
from Brazil or Argentina. Consequently, of a total of US$400 million in
investment financing required during 1980-83, about US$300 million would
represent the total cost of projects which would need to be partially financed
through lines of credit. It is expected that about one-half of this amount
would be financed by investors' own funds, and that financing would be sought
for the balance. On this basis, it seems reasonable to expect that some
US$150 million for industrial investment will be required during 1980-83.
Meeting this need would require much stronger support from the Bank as well as
from IDB (a US$12 million IDB loan to BNF is expected to become effective by
mid-1980) and KfW. The proposed Bank loan of US$31 million would, over the
1980-83 disbursement period of the loan, finance about 20% of the sector's
investment requirements. The remainder would be financed through medium- and
long-term foreign loans (such as IDB, KfW), and by renewati of short- and
medium-term loans made by commercial banks and suppliers' credits. The pro-
posed project would support the necessary strengthening of the system for
financial intermediation.
III. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PARTICIPATING INTERMEDIARIES
A. Institutional Experience and Arrangements
3.01      Institutional goals and achievements of the first loan.  Under the
First Industrial Credit Project (Loan 1419-PA), approved on May 5, 1977, an
institutional rehabilitation strategy was pursued that had two overlapping
phases: the first consisted of ensuring the financial viability of BNF through
improving its decision-making and financial structure. This involved creation
of a new Financial Department (FD), formation of a committee to oversee
portfolio quality, and establishing a loan collection office and of
performance criteria which BNF had to meet to improve its equity base,
arrears, financial spread, administrative costs, and liquidity. The second
phase, which is still under way, is focusing on attempting to improve substan-
tially BNF's data base and its planning and decision-making processes under
a UNDP-financed technical assistance program (TAP) for which the Bank is exe-
cuting agency. Major TAP components include upgrading accounting procedures,
improving electronic data processing systems, establishing a telecommunica-
tions network linking the branch system, establishing a planning and budgeting
capability and reviewing staffing and personnel management policies.



- 21 -
3.02      Under the first project, BNF substantially improved its financial
condition, and made progress towards systematizing its procedures for loan
supervision and collection, particularly of arrears, and upgrading its insti-
tutional capability to handle the many programs for which it is responsible.
By reducing staff by almost 20%, increasing share capital by 507' -nd revising
its lending rates in accordance with policies agreed upon under the project,
BNF was able to cut costs significantly, reduce its extremely high debt to
equity ratio, and improve its leverage, liquidity, financial spread and
profitability (it made a profit in 1977 after 12 consecutive years of losses).
By establishing organizational units specifically responsible for ongoing
supervision of its portfolio and for collection of loans in arrears, and
systematic procedures under which these units could operate, BNF was able to
upgrade substantially its project supervision capability and to make a satis-
factory start in the recovery of its sizeable portfolio of loans in arrears.
The introduction of planning and budgeting procedures and the creation of
the FD have provided the tools with which BNF can improve its resource
management and operational programming.
3.03      In spite of these achievements, BNF's capacity to promote and
appraise projects, significantly reduce its arrears and improve its return
on operations continues to be limited by the poor quality of its portfolio,
the lack of qualified staff, its large and costly branch network, and the
difficulty it continues to experience in carrying out its multiple roles in
financing agriculture, livestock, industry, tourism and commerce. These
problems are dealt with in paras. 3.05-3.27.
3.04      Institutional arrangements under the proposed loan.  The proposed
Bank loan would be made to the Government of Paraguay for onlending not only
through BNF, but also through BCP's FED. The FED would act as a second-tier
financial institution and onlend to qualifying commercial banks, and COMDESA
(or a new DFC) for financing of industrial, agroindustrial, tourism, and indus-
trial estate subprojects. A major effort would be made to widen substantially
financial intermediation, and thus the availability of medium- and long-term
industrial financing, by involving a majority of Paraguay's commercial banks
under the project.
B. Banco Nacional de Fomento
Establishment and Role
3.05      BNF was established in 1961 as a government-owned, autonomous entity
under the authority of the Ministry of Finance with a mandate to promote and
finance projects in agriculture, livestock, forestry, industry and commerce.
With total assets of about US$225 million equivalent at the end of 1979, BNF
provides about four-fifths of all loans for agriculture, one-tenth of livestock
loans (most livestock financing is now provided through the Fondo Ganadero)
and about 30% of all industrial loans in Paraguay.

Organization
3.06      In order to carry out these objectives, BNF has been given a complex
institutional structure composed of three operational departments, each accord-
ing to BNF's statutes with its separate capital, financial resources and account-
ing. The three departments are supported by an Administrative Department and
a Financial Department which, in turn, rely on the services of legal,
internal auditing,and data processing divisions (for BNF's organization chart,
see Annex 7). The Development Department (DD) is responsible for industrial
and agro-industrial development banking functions and also for providing term
lending to the livestock sector. The Agriculture Department (AD), the largest
of the three departments, is devoted mainly to annual crop financing and term
financing of on-farm investments. The Commercial Department (CD) mobilizes
short-term resources (i.e., demand and savings deposits), grants short-term
commercial loans and provides a portion of its resources to the AD for agri-
cultural credit. 1/ The Administrative Department (DA) is responsible for the
operations and management of BNF's network of 42 branches as well as accounting,
loan collection, legal and personnel services, and maintenance activities.
3.07      In connection with the first project and with support from the UNDP-
financed TAP, a number of steps were taken to strengthen BNF's organization.
The Financial Department (FD) was established in 1978 with responsibility for
preparing BNF's annual budget, coordination of resource mobilization and alloca-
tion among BNF's lending departments and branches, preparing financial plans
and forecasts, and managing BNF's liquidity. In addition, a loan collection
office (ONP) to improve collection of loans in arrears, and a Portfolio Coordin-
ating Committee (CCC) were established to improve portfolio quality. Under the
proposed loan, further steps would be taken to strengthen the FD (para. 4.08).
Management
3.08      BNF is governed by a Board of Directors (Administrative Council--
Annex 8) composed of BNF's President (Chairman) and seven members, each of
whom has one vote. Decisions require at least five affirmative votes. The
President, who is BNF's legal representative on the Council, is appointed by
the President of the Republic for a period of five years; the other council
members are appointed only for three-year renewable terms. They comprise one
representative each from the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and Industry
and Commerce; the BCP, and the agricultural, livestock and industrial sectors.
The council is responsible for formulating BNF's general policy, and approving
operations above ¢2 million, as well as all programs, budgets, and accounts.
BNF's current President and Board of Directors were appointed in February 1976.
With some assistance from the Bank, BNF's management has been effective in
carrying out a major restructuring and upgrading of BNF's organization, mainly
through the measures discussed in para. 3.07.
1/   BNF has interpreted the prohibition in its Organic Law against resource
transfers as applying to equity but not to borrowed funds. This has
enabled it to cover the short-term liquidity needs of one department
with available funds from another department.



- 23 -
Staff
3.09      As of December 31, 1979, BNF had 974 employees, about 60% of whom
worked in BNF's headquarters and the remainder in 42 branches and agencies
located throughiut the country.  About one-half of headquarters' staff are
engaged in lending operations, with the balance in accounting, administration
and support functions. While a sizeable reduction in staff was carried out
by BNF in 1977 and early 1978, it has since increased staff to fill positions
in the newly created FD, its new branches and in other areas where new or
better qualified staff were required. However, BNF has not followed a sys-
tematic hiring policy, and staff management and development have received
little attention. In particular, issues such as salary levels, leave bene-
fits, training, career paths, and termination have not been dealt with system-
atically. Largely as a result of this situation, staff quality, productivity
and morale have been low and a personnel management study was initiated as part
of the UNDP-financed TAP. A specialist in personnel management is presently
completing a staff survey of job descriptions, salary structure, present and
projected staff levels, and staff quality. This survey, which is expected to
be completed by July 1980, is to include recommendations to BNF's management
on revising personnel policies, procedures, salary levels and staff positions
with a view towards enabling BNF to attract and retain suitable staff.
Agreement was reached with BNF during negotiations that BNF and the Bank
would review the report's recommendations and would agree on the range and
timetable of their implementation.
Operations
3.10      BNF's operations are guided by its policy statement (Annex 9).  BNF's
most important role is its financing of agriculture, and through its Agriculture
Department, it provides about four-fifths of total credit to the sector.
About 40% of the total Bank and IDA lending to Paraguay (US$179 million) has
been directed to the agricultural sector through BNF, whose total outstanding
agriculture portfolio increased from 03.8 billion in 1971 (43% of total BNF
portfolio) to ¢10.2 billion in 1978 (59% of total portfolio). Its assistance
to a large number of small farmers is particularly important, as BNF programs
for short-term seasonal credit and longer-term credit for on-farm improvements
have permitted them to participate very significantly in the production of
cash crops. However, its large volume of labor intensive and costly agricul-
tural lending exposes BNF to the wide range of risks inherent in agricultural
operations from environmental factors such as inclement weather, natural
disaster, insect pests, and plant diseases, which can result in variable crop
yields and sharp fluctuations in prices. Also, BNF was the financing entity
for government-sponsored programs such as the National Grain Program, which
were unsuccessful and resulted in large portfolio arrears. In addition,
agriculture and livestock production are heavily dependent on processing for
export markets, and the closing of markets has had a drastic effect on
output in some subsectors (para. 1.04).



- 24 -
3.11      To protect BNF from these risks, its Organic Law stipulates that
"the State shall provide BNF with the necessary funds to cover BNF's agricul-
tural losses, should they exist" (Article 12). On July 1, 1976, the Ministry
of Finance, BCP and BNF agreed inter alia, that annual contributions amounting
to 10% of BNF's previous year's paid-in capital would be paid by the government
to BNF, in equal monthly installments, in fulfillment of past commitments under
Article 12. In addition, by a decree-law, the government agreed to make
annual contributions to BNF of 0126 million to cover future agricultural losses.
So far, the government has been making all such contributions that would be
sufficient to cover BNF's expected annual losses arising from its agricultural
operations plus amortization of past losses accumulated in accordance with
Article 12 (01,500 million as of December 31, 1979). A total of 0480 million
were paid in to BNF under these agreements in 1978, and 0500 million in 1979.
It is expected that the government will continue making these contributions
in the future, which would amount to at least 03.7 billion during 1980-84.
Although the government has been reimbursing BNF against the expectation that
losses have been incurred, no study of its agricultural portfolio or a clear
allocation of profits and losses arising from BNF's various activities has
ever been carried out. This situation is reflected in the fact that BNF
continues to have large agricultural arrears, but has no policy for establish-
ing provisions against probable loss on its agricultural portfolio. In order
to develop a rational policy for recognizing losses incurred, improving
collections and reducing arrears, BNF will need to make a detailed study of
its agricultural arrears problem (para. 3.17).
3.12      The Commercial Department.  The CD grants short-term financing for
commercial credits, export/import financing, and overdrafts on current accounts,
and it discounts negotiable paper. The share of BNF's commercial lending did
not grow in importance in the 1970s, with its outstanding commercial portfolio
amounting to 01.3 billion (15% of total BNF portfolio) at the end of 1971 and
to 02.4 billion (14% of total portfolio) at the end of 1979. Although its
operations are similar to those carried out by commercial banks, much of BNF's
staff lacks experience in commercial banking operations. Under the proposed
project, technical assistance would be provided to BNF to upgrade its capa-
bility in this area (para. 4.08).
The Development Department
3.13      The DD is responsible for administering the first industrial credit
project and it would also handle BNF's portion of the proposed loan. The DD
has been engaged mainly in the financing of manufacturing industry and agro-
industrial activities, and at the end of 1979 its portfolio amounted to 04.7
billion (27% of BNF's total portfolio). Much of DD's lending has been oriented
towards medium- and large-scale industrial and service enterprises. This is
reflected in the size distribution of DD's loans outstanding as of December 31,
1979 (of which 60% were for more than 050 million, and 9% for less than 01
million), and its average loan size of about 09 million. On average, DD loans
have been financing some 60% of total project costs. The DD's operations have
been financed mainly with long-term funds from bilateral and multilateral



- 25 -
lenders (mainly the Bank, USAID and KfW). Reflecting the distribution of its
resources, two-thirds of DD's financing has been in foreign exchange and
90% of its funds have been used for purchases of equipment and machinery. In
line with the concentration of the country's industry, about 70% of DD's funds
have been granted to projects located in and around Asuncion.
3.14      Project appraisal.  DD's appraisal division has played too passive
a role in project appraisal. It has relied largely on consultants to prepare
appraisal reports for larger projects, and most appraisals of subprojects above
the free limit under the first project, for example, have been prepared by con-
sultants. DD tends to spend too much effort on data collection rather than on
project review and analysis and has made little promotional effort in identify-
ing priority projects and offering guidance to entrepreneurs in preparing loan
applications. While appraisal of some smaller projects is done in the regional
offices, the bulk of appraisals, including all those for loans over ¢3 million,
are reviewed (when prepared by a consultant) or carried out at headquarters
by DD's appraisal staff of eight. While the present guidelines for reviewing
applications are adequate for large and medium-scale projects, a simpler format
should be developed for small-scale projects. Furthermore, most analysts seem
to lack experience in using the guidelines. This results from high staff turn-
over (BNF lacks a rational rotation policy) and little formal or "on-the-job"
training. In connection with the proposed project, a substantial upgrading of
BNF's project promotion and appraisal capability would be achieved, and
resolving the above problems would be the major function of an experienced
consultant, who would be retained under the TAP for a two-year term.
3.15      Project supervision.  The DD's supervision division has made a
considerable effort to upgrade portfolio supervision, and its performance in
this area has improved markedly in the recent past. DD has been particularly
effective on follow-up of loans during disbursement to ensure proper utili-
zation of funds. Also, DD recently established a procedure to ensure that
firms would receive supervision visits within 30 days of their loan falling
in arrears, and through such visits has achieved collection in all but a few
cases. However, the great proportion of supervision work is currently being
done by staff of the Asuncion office, which results in extensive travel and
limited supervision at the branch office level. Accordingly, BNF agreed
at negotiations to add at least two staff members specifically for DD's in-
plant supervision, who would carry out visits jointly with branch office staff
to train them in supervision. In addition, routine supervision responsibility,
such as loan collections and obtaining financial data on clients, would be
delegated almost entirely to branch offices. A TAP-financed consultant
(para. 3.14) would also assist the DD in ugprading its project supervision
capabilities.
Portfolio Quality
3.16      Under the first project, a major effort was made to deal with BNF's
serious arrears problem. BNF's arrears situation was extremely complex,
because BNF is a multipurpose financial institution, and different approaches
are required in collecting arrears from distinct types (commercial, agricul-
tural and industrial) of clients with often substantially different repayment



- 26 -
capabilities. In addition, differences existed between departments in their
adherence to appraisal and supervision standards and thus in their ability
to cope with arrears; and there was a lack of internal coordination within BNF
in debt collection efforts. Also, some of the oldest arrears represent loans
made in support of government-sponsored programs (such as the National Grain
Program), in which the lending decision was based predominantly on political
rather than technical grounds. Finally, there existed substantial under-
reporting of arrears by branch offices which has now been reduced. Consequent-
ly, BNF was required under Loan 1419-PA to adopt a debt recovery program (DRP)
which (i) established debt collection objectives based on amount and length of
arrears; (ii) set up procedures and a time frame for achieving these objectives;
and (iii) established a goal of reducing arrears to 15% of total portfolio at
the end of 1978 and to 10% in 1979 and subsequent years. BNF was also required
to prepare a debt recovery manual, and to establish the CCC, composed of the
directors of each department, to upgrade portfolio quality.
3.17      Despite extensive efforts, total arrears did not decline between
1976 and 1978, varying from 22.2% of total portfolio at the end of 1976, to
21.7% at the end of 1977, and 23.9% at year-end 1978 (the structure of BNF's
arrears by operating department is shown in Annexes 10 and 11). The first loan
was divided into two portions with BNF's access to the US$6 million second
portion depending in part on BNF's progress in reducing arrears. When it
became clear that the goal of reducing arrears to 15% and 10%, respectively, was
unrealistic, and when BNF indicated that there was a good chance that up to 0700
million, mainly in agricultural loans, would be collected in a relatively short
time, the Bank agreed to a minimum collection level of 0600 million of arrears
of more than 180 days as of December 31, 1978. In July 1979, BNF informed the
Bank that 0625 million had been collected during the first semester of 1979,
and on this basis, access to the second portion was granted. In the second
semester of 1979, however, arrears increased again from 21% to 23%, largely as a
result of a drought that affected soya and sugar harvests, and total affected
portfolio (i.e., total loans outstanding of clients with arrears) rose to 60%
of total portfolio. However, it is important to note that the present overall
level of arrears does not adequately reflect what was achieved by the implemen-
tation of the DRP under the first loan. First, the effect of actual reductions
in arrears was largely cancelled by improved reporting, which resulted in
increased arrears being listed on BNF's accounts. Second, because agricultural
arrears are closely tied to the effect of changes in environmental factors on
crop production, BNF is subject to sudden increases in arrears due to factors
over which it has little or no control. Third, the new system for debt
collection adopted by BNF under the first project is not yet fully implemented
and BNF is reluctant to write off loans of doubtful recovery because of
possible legal implications that could limit BNF's claim should a client
become able to repay. Finally, many of the older arrears representing loans
made in support of government-sponsored programs have proved difficult to
collect. As a result, (i) the largest clients in arrears have not, as a group,
been significantly affected; and (ii) agricultural arrears continue to be a
major problem. These two issues will be the main focus of debt recovery under
the proposed project, and drastic action is required under a second DRP (para.
4.04) if BNF is to solve its portfolio arrears problem.



- 27 -
3.18      Of particular concern with regard to the quality of BNF's portfolio
is the status of FINAP, S.A., 1/ a wood processing firm which had loans over-
due more than 90 days to BNF of 0952 million as of February 15, 1980, and
total obligations with BNF of 01,581 million (including guarantees and
accrued interest) as of that date. Since the terms of FINAP's liquidation are
currently being contested in the courts, 2/ the Bank's concern is twofold:
maintaining BNF's liquidity, and minimizing the loss it could ultimately
suffer. In addition to the capitalization program agreed upon in 1976 (para.
3.11), it was agreed durinr.g negotiations that the Ministry of Finance would
capitalize in BEF part of the first loan up to an amount equivalent to all
overdue payments (capital plus interest) and guarantees by FINAP that exceed
30% of BNF's unimpaired equity at the end of 1975, thus satisfying agreements
reached under the first industrial project. The amount to be capitalized would be
established in the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and BNF.
3.19      Primarily as a result of poor resource planning, lack of financial
management capability and lack of promotion activity, the real growth of BNF's
portfolio has been slow over the past several years. Consequently, while its
cash on hand increased fourfold from 0609 million in 1976 to 02.5 billion in
1979, BNF's total outstanding portfolio increased by only 12.9% p.a. (from
012.4 billion to 017.2 billion) in 1976-79, and did not quite match the in-
crease in average inflation (16.1% p.a.) for the period. BNF's outstanding
commercial portfolio grew at 15.4% in nominal terms in 1976-79, while its
agricultural portfolio grew at 14.2% p.a., and its industrial portfolio
increased in nominal terms only at 9.2% p.a, equivalent to a portfolio reduc-
tion in real terms cs about 10% over the 1976-79 period. In view of the 8-9%
growth rates of the 3ector in real terms in 1976-79, and given the expected
strong demand for industrial loans, BNF will receive technical assistance under
the proposed project to improve further its cash and overall resource manage-
ment, and to increase its ability to promote and process loans (para. 4.08).
Financial Structure and Condition
3.20      BNF's financial position as of December 31, 1979 was substantially
stronger than at December 31, 1976 (Annex 12), when the institution was
appraised under the first Industrial Credit Project (Loan 1419-PA). Since
then, BNF's capital structure has improved substantially due to a 02.2 billion
capitalization program to replenish previous BNF losses that was undertaken
1/   According to Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement for the first project,
the government is required to reimburse BNF for any loan overdue to BNF
for more than three months, if the total of BNF exposure (i.e., loans
and guarantees) should exceed 30% of BNF's paid-in capital. The matter
of compliance with this covenant in regard to FINAP has been a major issue
for some time.
2/   IFC, which had made a loan and equity investment to FINAP, auctioned the
collateral for its loan in November 1979.



- 28 -
by the government in connection with the first credit project. Due to this
program and improved profitability, BNF's equity increased from 01.3 billion
in 1976 to 05.4 billion at the end of 1979, and as a result BNF's debt to equity
ratio decreased from 12.9:1 to 4.2:1. Its liquidity also improved as a result
of the capitalization program to about 1.2:1 at the end of 1979, and BNF is
currently servicing its obligations on time and without difficulties, in
contrast to the situation at the end of 1976. As a result, BNF is well within
its debt to equity limit of 8:1, and liquidity limit of 1.1:1.
3.21      After incurring losses for 12 consecutive years, BNF has been making
profits since 1977 (Annex 13), indicating a major improvement in the institu-
tion's financial situation. Yield on average net portfolio increased from a
6.4% loss in 1976 to a 6.4% positive return in 1979, and return on average
equity increased from a loss of 45.9% in 1976 to a positive 21.1Z return in
1979. Interest and commission income increased from 01.4 billion in 1976 to
02.5 billion in 1979 (commission income increased almost twice as fast as in-
terest income), equal to an average annual increase of 27.5% over the period.
Three-fourths of BNF's operating income was generated by the DD and AD during
1976-79. However, as total outstanding loan portfolio rose by only 12.3%,
BNF was able, through higher effective interest rates (reflected particularly
in higher commissions), to increase income at a considerably faster rate than
portfolio, and to raise its yield on average total net portfolio.
3.22      BNF's operating costs, as a proportion of its total outstanding port-
folio, decreased from 6.5% in 1974-76 to 5.5% in 1977-79 (the target set under
the first loan was 5.4%), as a result of a cost reduction program that included
a major reduction in staff (para. 3.09) undertaken by BNF Ln connection with
the first industrial credit project. While lowering costs to a 5.5% level has
helped to improve BNF's profitability and streamline its organization, it does
not appear possible that expenses can be maintained at this low level. Staff-
related expenditures are by far the most important factor in BNF's cost structure
(about three-fourths of total costs), and although real wages of BNF's staff
have declined in the past few years, it is not realistic to expect this trend
to continue. In addition, there is little scope at present for staff reduc-
tion, as BNF has had to increase staff in several areas to fill new positions,
staff new branches, and attend to an increasing number of operations. In
fact, personnel costs pose a difficult dilemma for BNF, since it can only
attract and keep qualified staff if it pays salaries competitive with other
banks and businesses by adequately compensating staff for rising living
costs.
3.23      Inflation in 1979 reached 36% (as compared with 11% in 1978), and
administrative costs as a percentage of average outstanding portfolio have
begun to rise from the 5.5% achieved in 1978. For 1979, they reached about
6.3%. Administrative costs are expected to continue to increase at an annual
rate of about 20% over 1980-81, rising to 7.1% of average portfolio in 1980
and then levelling off at 6.7% in 1981. The 5.5% target has been important
for establishing cost discipline in BNF, and it was successful in lowering its
costs to the level contemplated. In addition, it must be taken into account
that BNF is a multipurpose development bank with a large branch system and
high overhead costs and, in comparison with similar banks in other countries,
its costs are not excessively high. However, if BNF is to continue to grow,
higher maximum cost levels must be established taking into account rapidly



- 29 -
rising costs and the difficulty of increasing income from operations at the
same rate over the medium term. Based upon an analysis of projected increases
in operating costs and outstanding portfolio, maximum targets of 7.1% in 1980
and 6.7% in 1981 should be set, but thereafter BNF should be able to maintain
costs at or below the 6.5% level. Agreement on these targets wns reached
with BNF during negotiations, and BNF's compliance with them wouia be closely
monitored by the Bank.
3.24      Traditionally, BNF has found it difficult to maintain adequate
liquidity throughout each operating year as a result of its agricultural lend-
ing, which is seasonal in nature and is dictated by the phases of agricultural
production in the country. From about September through March, during the
main planting season, the AD usually faces a large outflow of its short-term
resources, and from April to August, coinciding with the main harvest time,
the institution experiences a reversal in the flow of such funds. The result
of this situation is that BNF has found itself with idle cash on hand which
has amounted to as much as US$25 million equivalent during the period of
greatest inflows, while frequently being strained for resources during the
planting season. There is a clear need for BCP to establish a short-term,
self-liquidating rediscount facility of about US$8 million equivalent,
to enable BNF to resort to BCP financing during the period of peak demand.
This flexibility would be designed to supplement the resources which BCP is
required to provide under Loan 1674-PA (Livestock and Agricultural Develop-
ment Project). This would enable BNF to utilize part of its large cash
balances for long-term production lending. The amount and timing of the
establishment of such a facility was agreed upon at negotiations and
satisfactory implementation is a condition of effectiveness.
3.25      Accounts and audits.  Separate accounts for each of BNF's three
operating departments are maintained and later consolidated. Accounts are
subject to control by BNF's internal auditor, and BNF's records and accounts
are reviewed by the Superintendent of Banks for compliance with banking
regulations. BNF's accounts are audited annually by the Argentinian firm of
Harteneck Lopez y Cia. Prior to the first project, their audit reports were
qualified regarding the carrying value of BNF's main asset accounts and the
level of arrears and interest income. In connection with the first project
BNF agreed to require their external auditors to prepare annually long form
audit reports, in accordance with the Bank's "Illustrative Form of Audit
Report for Development Finance Companies." This has led to a substantial
improvement in the quality and coverage of the auditors' work. Harteneck
and Lopez's 1978 annual audit is satisfactory overall, and the auditors'
opinion contains no major qualifications regarding BNF's financial condition.
However, the report does not indicate BNF's current position on the balance
sheet, and this will be required for the 1979 and future audits.
Future Prospects
3.26      Projections of BNF's operating results and financial condition
are based essentially on the capacity of BNF to continue to improve its per-
formance, and resolve its major financial and operational problems over the
next four years (Annex 14). The strengthening of BNF's project appraisal
capability, and the strong emphasis that will be placed by BNF's management
on project promotion, are expected to reverse the present trend of negative



- 30 -
portfolio growth in real terms, and to result in a real portfolio growth about
equal to the forecast sectoral growth over the period (i.e., 8% p.a.). This
would require BNF to increase its lending in nominal terms at about 30% p.a.
Given the strong evidence of a continuing and growing demand for industrial
financing--particularly investment financing (para. 2.19)--and the expected
doubling of BNF's available long-term resources for industrial lending in
1980, as well as the continuing direct technical assistance that will be given
to BNF by both the Bank (through close supervision and the TAP) and IDB in
identifying, promoting and appraising industrial subprojects, this goal should
be achievable. In addition, with the expected BCP rediscount facility, BNF
should be able to resolve its seasonal financing problem, which hinders the
growth of its agricultural operations. Finally, its expected utilization of
the Bank's Livestock and Agriculture Development Loan, approved in 1979, would
increase its medium- and long-term lending to agriculture. At the same time
that substantial resource transfers (i.e., about US$28 million) are being made
by multilateral lenders, BNF is expected to receive continued capital contribu-
tions from the government totalling about 03.7 billion over the 1980-84 period
(para. 3.11).
3.27      BNF's financial performance is expected to continue to improve (for
a summary, see Annex 15). Even stronger efforts to reduce arrears (particularly
from large borrowers) in connection with a second DRP (para. 4.04) can be expec-
ted to effectively resolve BNF's arrears problem by 1984. BNF's debt:equity
position will continue to be strong, and debt will remain at less than
five times equity through 1984, substantially below BNF's 8:1 limitation.
Interest rates for new lending are estimated at no less than 18%, which
is identical to the rate under the proposed loan, and adequate considering
future expectations regarding inflation. BNF's operations would grow
faster than costs, and would result in a reduction in the rate of cost
increases and in increased returns on outstanding loans. Operating costs as a
percentage of outstanding portfolio would be reduced from 7.1% to 6.4% by
1984, and the average yield on net portfolio would increase from 14.1% to
15.1% during the period. As a result, BNF's profitability, as measured by
return on equity, would increase from 3.1% in 1980 to 7.6% in 1984, which is
acceptable. For details regarding BNF's financial and operational projections,
see Annexes 15-19.
C. The Fondo Especial de Desarrollo (FED)
Establishment, Organization and Management
3.28      The BCP established the FED in December 1976 as a means of channel-
ling credits to productive enterprises through rediscounting term loans of
private banks, with the objective of making credit available to enterprises
with good profit potential which traditionally have had little access to
institutional credit. The FED is administered by a department of BCP headed
by a director and composed of three divisions for day-to-day operations, and
reports through a sub-manager to the President of BCP (Annex 20). Overall
policy decisions and all loan approvals are made by the Board of Directors of
BCP. Coordination on policy issues between the FED and private banks is usually



- 31 -
handled through the Association of Private Banks, although a Coordinating
Committee for FED activities, composed of representatives of various minis-
tries and the private sector, is formally responsible for this function.
3.29      In addition to its director, the FED currently has seven profes-
sional staff members specialized in either economics, finance, or accounting.
Overall, FED staff is considered to be dedicated, well trained and capable of
carrying out its functions. However, in order to strengthen FED's technical
competence, BCP agreed during negotiations to hire at least one industrial
engineer prior to disbursement of FED's portion of the proposed loan. The
FED, although legally a part of BCP, maintains separate financial records on
its operations. Collection and disbursement of funds is handled by BCP's
Credit Department.
Operating Policies and Procedures
3.30      The FED, with the assistance of USAID and several of the commercial
banks operating in Paraguay, has put a substantial effort into preparing system-
atic operating policies and procedures, and training staff for its existing
program. As a result,there now exists a core of trained staff in both banks
and private consulting firms to prepare and appraise investment projects.
Participating banks (i.e., the commercial banks and COMDESA) in cooperation
with subborrowers, are responsible for preparing subproject appraisals and
supervising loans, with the work usually prepared by private consultants for
a one-time fee of 2-4% of project cost, payable by the entrepreneur. While
the banks, which car--y the credit risk, do not rely solely upon the work of
consultants but employ their own technical staff for project reviews, addi-
tional competent technical staff are needed by most banks to ensure a high
quality of appraisals and to supervise projects. Also, due to the newness of
its programs, the FED itself has been extensively involved in many project
appraisals, reviewing loan requests and appraisal reports and in many cases
visiting the enterprises together with the proposed financial intermediary.
Once FED staff are satisfied of a project's viability, the loan request is
presented to BCP's Board of Directors for approval. As a condition of effec-
tiveness, BCP's Board will adopt a statement of operating policies and pro-
cedures for the FED (Annex 21) satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.05).
3.31      To date FED supervision has focussed mainly on overseeing disburse-
ments during project implementation, as few of the investment projects have
actually begun operation yet (most disbursements were made in 1978-79). Ade-
quate credit manuals and procedures were established for the existing programs,
and the FED will establish a credit manual for the proposed project. The
Bank and BCP agreed at loan negotiations on the contents of such a manual,
which would be approved by BCP's board as a condition of disbursement for the
FED. As part of a credit manual, the FED would prepare supervision guidelines
that would ensure adequate project follow-up and reporting by the interme-
diaries under its guidance.

Operations
3.32      To date, the FED has managed two credit programs, one for rural
enterprises and the other for small enterprises, 1/ the latter of which is
supported by a credit guarantee scheme. The rural enterprises program (Annexes
22 and 23) began in early 1977 with a US$2.5 million loan from USATD and a
US$0.85 million capital contribution from BCP. The program was fully disbursed
by mid-1979, and operations are continuing at a substantially reduced pace
through relending the funds recuperated from the amortization of the original
credits. The rural enterprises program financed a total investment of US$11.5
million equivalent involving 52 enterprises, with the loans supplying some 50%
of the total cost. The average loan size was about $US100,000 (maximum allowed
was US$180,000), with an average rediscount amount of US$68,000. Roughly half
of the loans went to manufacturing enterprises, and the rest to grain storage
or commercial enterprises. Over 70% of the 50 subborrowers were located out-
side the Central Department (Asuncion). Project expenditures were divided
relatively evenly among construction, machinery and equipment, and working
capital.
3.33      For the small enterprise program (Annexes 24 and 25), USAID agreed
initially to provide guarantees of up to the equivalent of US$1.5 million
for commercial bank loans to small enterprises which are rediscounted from
BCP's general rediscount funds. The USAID-supported guarantee amount has since
been increased to US$3.5 million. The rediscount is optional, but in all cases
the intermediary has requested it. As USAID covers 50% of the total guarantee
risk, BCP another 25%, and the lender has 25% at risk, the guarantee scheme
would cover loans to small enterprises up to a total of JS$7 million. The
small enterprise program has financed investments totalling about half of the
total investment costs, and guarantees covering about three-fourths of the
loan amount. About half of the borrowers were industrial enterprises, and half
were agricultural. Over 55% of the subborrowers were located outside the
Central Department. The average loan size was about US$25,000; about half of
project expenditures went for machinery and equipment, 30% for working capital,
and 20% for construction costs. Guarantees have been granted for the whole
US$7 million covered by the program, but as yet USAID has not had to disburse
any funds, as the repayment record of the subborrowers has been excellent.
Overall, the FED has been successful in channelling resources for productive
lending in selected priority areas. Under the proposed loan, the FED's role
would be substantially increased (para. 4.05).
Financial Aspects
3.34      The funds utilized by the FED consist of the following:  (i) a
US$2.5 million USAID loan for the rural enterprises program for 40 years
with 10 years grace (the government is obligated to leave these funds with
1/   Rural enterprises were defined as enterprises that buy 50% of raw mate-
rials from or sell 50% of output to small farmers (defined as owners of
20 hectares or less); small enterprises were defined as small farmers
or industrial and commercial enterprises with less than US$60,000 in
total assets.



- 33 -
the FED only for the grace period of the loan), bearing interest at 2% for
the grace period and 3% thereafter; (ii.   US$500,000 BCP contribution as part
of the rural enterprises program, and a US$350,000 allocation by BCP to cover
administrative costs of the FED's operations; (iii) about US$4.2 million
of BCP related to the small enterprises guarantee program loan rediscounts
(equivalent to 75% of total loan amounts); and (iv) accrued net interest
from the rural enterprises program and guarantee fees from the guarantee
program of about ¢23 million (about US$170,000 equivalent) and ¢48 million
(about US$350,000 equivalent) respectively. The accumulated guarantee fees
would be used to repay commercial banks for any unrecoverable loans under
the guarantee program.
3.35      The FED has separate accounting for both programs.  The BCP admin-
istrative costs contributions (see (ii) above) for the rural enterprises
program should cover FED administrative costs through 1983, so the spread
that the FED receives on its lending (i.e., 3% on USAID funds and 5% on its
own resources), which is equivalent to about US$100,000 p.a., all goes to
retained earnings. FED administrative costs were slightly less than
US$100,000 in 1978 (distributed about 45:55 between the guarantee and rural
enterprises components). As the BCP paid these costs from its own contri-
butions, all earnings from guarantee fees have accrued. However, as the
guarantee fee is a one-time charge, no additional revenue from this program
will be obtained. It is too early to estimate the claims against the accrued
fees that could occur through 1983, when the program will expire. However,
it is expected that fees paid should be sufficient to cover any defaults
on guaranteed loans. Thus, even without the BCP contribution, the FED would
break even and should realize a surplus of US$100,000 on existing operations
as long as BCP pays the FED's administrative expenses. As existing resources
are fully utilized except for rollover funds, the additional funds which
would be provided under the proposed loan would enable the FED not only to
continue to provide needed medium- and long-term finance but also to increase
significantly its impact.
3.36      Rediscount interest rates are presently 5% on all loans rediscounted
by BCP, and the rates are set for the FED and other rediscount facilities in
accordance with BCP policy. The guarantee fee is a one-time charge paid by
the subborrower, equal to 5% of the loan amount. Relending rates are fixed at
13%, and the rediscount, therefore, provides a spread of 8% to commercial
banks. However, since the 13% limit also applies to the banks' own funds,
banks only receive an overall spread of approximately 6% as they incur a loss
of up to 3% on their own funds (the effective cost of their funds ranges from
14-16%). The effective spread of 5.0% proposed under the Bank project (para.
4.13) would be acceptable to the banks. Prior to the end of 1979, all of the
FED's resources were committed. Under the proposed loan, the FED would not
only be provided with new resources, but the scope of its operations would be
substantially expanded to include the industrial sector as a whole. In
addition, by using the FED's existing system of financial intermediation, Bank
funds would be expected to finance productive investments of a wider range of
clients than would be the case if the loan were channelled solely through
BNF.

Participating Intermediaries
3.37      Sixteen 1/ commercial banks operating in Paraguay, as well as COMDESA,
have participated in the FED programs. Five of the banks participate actively,
while the rest submit projects occasionally. The FED has sought the partici-
pation of all banks in order to encourage their developmental activities and
foster other short-term lending to enterprises benefiting under the program.
Both the participating banks and the FED have participated actively in the
design and implementation of the programs. The two FED programs have been very
successful in utilizing the commercial banking system for medium- and long-term
productive lending, mainly because banking laws require that the banks maintain
45% of their portfolios in productive loans, but that only 20% of the loan
amount can be rediscounted with BCP. Not only can FED loans be used to meet
the BCP's portfolio composition requirements, but they can be rediscounted for
up to 60% of the loan amount for the guarantee program and up to 70% for loans
to rural enterprises.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives of the Proposed Second Industrial Credit Project
4.01      The main objectives of the proposed project would be to promote the
efficient and regionally balanced growth of industry in Paraguay, alleviate
the scarcity of long-term funds to finance such growth, and improve financial
intermediation for industrial investment by: (i) assisting in the develop-
ment of productive industrial, agroindustrial and tourism projects, particu-
larly of small and medium-scale enterprises; (ii) providing funds on terms
and conditions required to meet the investment needs of industrial enterprises;
(iii) continuing to strengthen BNF, the sole beneficiary under the first
project, by upgrading further its portfolio quality, improving financial plan-
ning and management, strengthening industrial appraisal and supervision capa-
bility, developing a strong industrial project promotion capability, particu-
larly its capacity to support hotels and industrial parks, and improving
coordination and control between the head office and the branch system; (iv)
expanding financial intermediation in support of industry by lending to the
commercial banking system and a privately owned DFC through BCP's FED in
order to meet the expanding need for finance from a wider range of industrial
enterprises; (v) supporting the government's attempt to foster the regional
growth of industry and tourism development through more effective project
promotion in BNF, provision of credit and the establishment of an industrial
estate in Encarnacion; (vi) helping to establish an extension system for
small-scale entrepreneurs through the government's National Vocational Training
Service (SNPP); and (vii) supporting the government's actions aiming at im-
proving the interest rate structure and operations of financial intermediaries.
l/   Paraguay's seventeenth commercial bank, the Bank of Boston, was estab-
lished in Asuncion in November 1979, too late to participate under the
existing FED program.

B. Project Description
4.02      A loan of US$31 million would be granted to the Government of Para-
guay to finance productive industrial, agroindustrial and tourism subprojects,
and technical assistance to BNF, to be repaid in 17 years with 4 years of
grace. As a condition of effectiveness, subsidiary loan agreements satisfac-
tory to the Bank would be signed between the government and BCP and BNF,
respectively. It is not possible to predict the exact breakdown of utilization
of Bank funds as a result of (i) some overlapping of the recent IDB loan to
BNF and the proposed second Bank loan; (ii) a new system for the chanelling of
Bank funds under the FED component; (iii) uncertainty as to how rapidly BNF
can upgrade its performance; (iv) the unforseeable extent of participation of
a private DFC, and (v) the unpredictable amount of financing required for
industrial estate and tourism development. Consequently, specific allocations
of US$15 million for BNF, US$10 million for the FED, and US$1 million for
technical assistance would be made. The adequacy of these allocations would
be reviewed by the Bank not later than March 1, 1982, i.e., about 18 months
following estimated loan signing. Up to that date a US$5 million portion of
the loan would remain unallocated to allow flexible use by participating
institutions that have exhausted their respective allocations prior to that
date. An unallocated balance should also act as an incentive to both BNF, to
make greater efforts to improve its overall performance and its capability to
channel increasing amounts of Bank financing for productive projects, and to
commercial banks and the private DFC to demonstrate their interest in partici-
pating in a program a4med principally at assisting medium- and small-scale
enterprises.
4.03      Banco Nacional de Fomento would receive a US$15 million initial allo-
cation, of which US$10 million for industrial projects in general, and US$5
million for subprojects which would be located in the CPS-Encarnacion Zone.
During negotiations BNF agreed to include in its budget a specific allocation
for US$2.0 million equivalent per year during 1980-82 to complement
the subborrowers' own contributions to cover local currency costs related to
subprojects financed by the Bank. Individual subloans would be limited to
US$1 million or less. The same limit would apply to the private DFC, if the
Bank found it eligible for full participation. The adequacy of these limits
will be reviewed not later than March 1, 1982.
4.04      The US$10 million allocation would be made available in two portions
of US$5 million each, BNF's access to each of which would depend on a series of
actions, many of which are part of a second DRP intended to improve the quality
of its portfolio. Prior to July 31, 1980, BNF would adopt revised procedures
for collecting loans with arrears over 02 million. 1/ Agreement was reached
at negotiations that prior to obtaining access to the loan, BNF would need to: (a)
collect one-third (i.e. 0725,000,000) of the total amount (02.2 billion) of
all loans with arrears over 02 million (excluding FINAP) as of October 31, 1979,
and (b) the Bank and BNF would agree on the content of a second DRP which
1/   Which would include charging loans with arrears between 1-30 days with a
penalty interest rate of one-half the level of the current interest rate,
sending to BNF's ONP all loans with arrears more than 30 days for collect-
ion and requiring that legal action be initiated for all loans with arrears
of more than 90 days, without possibility of administrative appeals within
the BNF (a common practice when influential clients are involved).



- 36 -
would include specific performance targets for (i) reducing existing
arrears, (ii) improving collection procedures, (iii) close monitoring
and supervision of portfolio to prevent new arrears from occurring, and (iv)
the sending of quarterly reports to the Bank, audited by BNF's external auditors,
on the status of debt recovery and compliance with the new procedures. Prior
to September 30, 1981 BNF would collect not less than an additional 0375,000,000
of the loans mentioned in (a) above, in accordance with the following schedule:
not less than 0125,000 by March 31, 1981; not less than 0250,000,000 by June 30, 1981;
not less than 0375,000,000 by September 30, 1981. BNF would be eligible to
utilize the second portion of US$5 million only after it had put the DRP into
effect and had met the initial targets in line with the recovery schedule to be
established under that program. The DRP would focus on recovery of agricultural
arrears, based on the recommendations of a study sponsored by the Bank, of the
agricultural arrears problem (particularly as related to small-scale farmers).
4.05      Fondo Especial de Desarrollo.  US$10 million would be allocated to
BCP's FED for the financing of medium- and small-scale enterprises, of which
US$2 million would be reserved for subprojects located in the CPS-Encarnacion
Zone (para. 4.10). During negotiations, agreement was reached on the contents
of a policy statement whose adoption by BCP's Board would be a condition of
effectiveness which would define the FED's role as a second-tier intermediary
rediscounting loans and providing a guarantee fund (the latter for loans to
small-scale enterprises 1/) to participating financial intermediaries which
meet the FED's conditions for participation (for a draft, see Annex 21). BCP
is presently undertaking an evaluation of the existing FED programs, which
may lead it to propose organizational and administrative changes in the FED
component, in order to provide the latter with greater autanomy. Such changes
would need to be agreed upon with the Bank prior to these 3eing approved by
BCP's Board.  BCP would contribute US$2 million equivalent (US$1 million from
new resources and US$1 million from existing FED resources) of its own funds
to an account to be set up within the FED. The US$1 million in resources from
BCP would be paid in prior to disbursement of the FED's portion of the loan,
in order to ensure adequate funds for initial disbursements, and the remainder
would be paid in following commitment of half (US$5 million) of the Bank
allocation for the component. The participating intermediaries would provide
an estimated additional US$3 million equivalent to cover short-term working
capital required under this component, and would be required to contribute at
least 10% of the total cost of each subproject from their own funds, such costs to
include the day-to-day working capital needs of the enterprise to be financed.
Although in principle COMDESA and all commercial banks would be eligible for FED
financing, participation in the project would be limited to those institutions
which could meet the requirements established under participation agreements.
These would provide that the participants would: (i) maintain or contract
staff capable of performing satisfactory project appraisals; (ii) supervise
projects to ensure that resources had been used for the purpose intended and
that projects were progressing on schedule; (iii) adhere to terms of lending
and repayment of loans; (iv) ensure that procurement and disbursement provi-
sions were met; (v) maintain adequate records on Bank-financed projects; and
(vi) provide the FED and the Bank with such information as they would reasonably
request. As a condition of disbursement for the FED's portion of the
loan, the Bank would need to receive signed agreements, satisfactory to the
Bank, between BCP and at least five intermediaries. Given the FED experience,
it is expected that most if not all of Paraguay's 17 commercial banks, as well
1/ Enterprises with total assets (excluding land and buildings) of US$100,000
equivalent or less.



- 37 -
as the private DFC will participate. With the exception of the latter (para.
4.09), no single intermediary would be allowed to commit more than US$2
million under this initial allocation. Individual subloans would be limited
to US$500,000 or less, to firms with total assets (excluding land and buildings)
of US$500,000 or less prior to receiving subloans; however, these limits would
not apply for subloans to enterprises located in the CPS-Encarnacion zone to
support the government's decentralization efforts. The adequacy of these
limits will be reviewed not later than March 1, 1982.
4.06      Commercial banks are expected to be active in seeking new lending
opportunities and to account for about two-thirds of total projects financed
under the loan. Because of the small amount of term lending by commercial
banks in the past, commercial banks participating in the project would need
to take steps necessary to train existing, or to hire new professional staff,
as needed, to carry out project evaluation and supervision tasks in conform-
ity with the FED's requirements. COMDESA, or a new DFC (assuming it will be
established), would need to be adequately staffed to be able to participate
actively under the proposed project. Each participating commercial bank would
have to retain at all times at least one staff member who has completed a FED
training course in industrial project appraisal techniques. Consequently,
BCP agreed during negotiations that it would design (with Bank assistance) a
training seminar whose curriculum would need to be satisfactory to the Bank.
Subsequently, the FED would offer such seminars at least annually to train new
analysts and improve existing skills.
4.07      Credit guarantee scheme.  In order to encourage lending to small-
scale enterprises, the FED would offer partial guarantees on loans eligible
for rediscounting under the component described in para 4.05, using the
proceeds of the guarantee fee to establish a guarantee fund, such fund to
be established not later than July 31, 1980. The guarantee would cover up to
75% of the amount loaned by the commercial bank, to a maximum guarantee of
US$40,000 per enterprise, for a one-time charge to the entrepreneur of 5% of
the amount of the sub-loan. As is the case in the existing program,
the FED, using its own funds, would also finance the guarantee fee, thus
spreading its cost to the entrepreneur over the life of the loan. The commer-
cial bank making the loan would initially determine whether a guarantee would
be required 1/ (in most cases when the appraised value of the collateral
offered by the entrepreneur falls below about 150% of loan amount), and the
proposed scheme would permit banks to lower their loan coverage by real
guarantees from the typical 150-200% of loan amount to about 100%, thus
opening bank lending to a wider variety of smaller firms that would not
otherwise have had access to the banking system. If a loan falls in arrears,
the commercial bank would notify the FED within 30 days, and would start
legal proceedings against the client. If the loan continues in arrears for
more than 90 days, the FED would pay off its 75% guarantee as soon as legal
proceedings have been initiated, and any amounts collected through litigation
1/   This component in practice would differ from the existing FED program
in that a loan could be requested without a supporting guarantee.



- 38 -
would pay court costs and then be divided 75:25 between the FED and the
commercial bank, respectively. Any FED losses under the program would be
covered first by the 5% guarantee fee and, in the unlikely case that this
amount should prove insufficient, 1/ by BCP.
4.08      Technical assistance totalling about 60 man-months (at an average
cost of $6,000 per man-month) by consultants satisfactory to the Bank would
be provided to assist BNF in upgrading its capabilities in project promotion,
appraisal and supervision; industrial marketing; industrial engineering
(particularly agroindustry); commercial banking services; accounting
procedures; and organization and methods. This technical assistance would
complement the UNDP-financed TAP under the first loan. Total Bank financing
under this component is expected to amount to US$360,000. In addition,
Paraguay's National Vocational Training Service (SNPP) would be the recipient
of a technical assistance program which would (i) aim at helping small-scale
enterprises to prepare subloan applications under the proposed project; and
(ii) help to organize an extension service for small enterpreneurs. ILO would
be the executing agency for this component which entails 90 man-months of
foreign consultants (at 6,000 per man-month) plus 20 man-months of fellowships
(at US$5,000 per man-month) for a total cost of US$640,000. ILO's involvement
would be a continuation of its assistance to SNPP under the Bank-supported
vocational training project (Loan 1252-PA). An agreement between ILO and
SNPP, satisfactory to the Bank, would be signed prior to disbursement of
technical assistance funds to SNPP.
4.09      Possible participation of a new private DFC.  A feasibility study is
expected to be completed shortly regarding the restructuring of an existing
(COMDESA) or establishing a new DFC. The potential shareholders are expected
to be COMDESA, Banco Union, members of the Union Industrial and possibly IFC.
The study would subsequently be evaluated and form an important input for a
decision to be taken as to whether IFC would pursue the possibility of invest-
ing in the DFC. COMDESA in its present form or the new DFC would be eligible
to participate under the FED component like any other participating interme-
diary. However, as a restructured or new DFC specialized in development credit,
it would have the same limits as BNF (para. 4.03) and thus would not be
subject to the US$2 million limitation on the use of Bank funds, or to the
US$500,000 limit on subloan amounts or asset size of clients, if the Bank was
satisfied at any time during the loan commitment period that a new DFC had met
the following criteria: (i) good management; (ii) capacity to appraise and
supervise projects; (iii) sound financial condition; Civ) capability of hand-
ling procurement and disbursement under a Bank loan; and (v) predominant
orientation towards development banking activities.
4.10      The Regional Development Component would comprise the following:
(i) In line with expected demand in the area, US$5 million would
be preallocated for onlending by BNF and US$2 million through the
FED, for projects located in the CPS-Encarnacion zone;
1/   Through litigation, a major portion of any loan should be recovered.
For example, if as many as 20% of loans default and only 50% of the
amount of these loans is eventually recovered, fees received under
the guarantee scheme would cover the uncollected amount.



- 39 -
(ii)  BNF's branch offices in CPS and Encarnacion would be strength-
ened, and processing of subloans between the head office and
the branches would be streamlined;
(iii)  Bank staff would provide BNF with technical assistance, as
necessary, in preparing subprojects for tourism development;
and
(iv)  A feasibility study for BNF of the proposed industrial estate
in Encarnacion is expected to be undertaken with financing
from KfW. The Bank would furnish staff assistance in the
preparation of terms of reference for the study, and Bank
financing could be made available for industrial estate develop-
ment, if called for during the commitment period of the loan.
4.11      Interest rates.  As mentioned in para. 2.11, interest rates for some
financial intermediaries are regulated and, consequently, a dual structure for
mobilizing and channeling resources exists, in which unregulated financial
institutions have been able to pay higher rates to savers and to capture an
increasingly larger portion of available resources. This has resulted in a
distortion in the financial market which has been accelerated during the last
year due to the high rate of inflation (36%). To deal with this problem, the
government has promulgated new banking legislation covering all financial ins-
titutions, and has prepared a monetary program for establishing a national
system of interest rates to both savers and borrowers, which has enabled the
Bank to establish a tevel of interest rates for relending Bank funds under the
proposed project thaw (i) is consistent with the rest of the financial system,
(ii) supports a rational allocation of resources, and (iii) would be positive
during the average life of a subloan.
4.12      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on an effective on-
lending rate of no less than 18% p.a., which, on the basis of advance payment
of interest, commissions and taxes, would result in a total cost to the sub-
borrower of at least 19% p.a. Such a rate is consistent with projections for
inflation (para. 2.12) and for maintaining a positive real relending rate over
the average lifetime of subloans financed under the project. In addition, there
would be semi-annual reviews of the adequacy of such rates. The system for semi-
annual reviews which was agreed upon at negotiations, would be applied starting
no later than January 1, 1981, would review the adequacy of this rate by comparing
actual with a set of projected rates of inflation. If, according to this formula,
which would compare the average cost of living in any six consecutive months (com-
pared with the same time period of the previous year), the rate of inflation remains
above the projected levels, the government and the Bank shall attempt to reach
agreement on a new interest rate. If within 60 days from the initiation of such
review no agreement on the new onlending rate has been reached, the Bank shall
have the option to discontinue making commitments under the loan until an agreement
has been reached. The government also agreed at negotiations that it would
ensure that, commencing September 1, 1980: (i) the relending terms for subloans
through BNF, financed under the new US$12 million IDB loan, would be substantially
the same as the terms established for Bank-financed subloans, and (ii) that any
similar program for the financing of industrial investment would also be subject
to the same relending terms and conditions.



- 40 -
4.13      Terms and conditions of subloans.  Subloans denominated in guaranies
would initially bear an effective interest rate of 18% p.a., the adequacy of
which would be reviewed periodically (para. 4.12). As BNF would be responsible
for both appraising and supervising its subprojects, it would receive a spread
of 6%, as would the DFC, if it were to participate on the same basis. Commer-
cial banks, which would share part of these functions with the FED, would
receive a spread of 5% and the FED a fee of 2%. The government would
assume the foreign exchange risk and the commitment fee to the Bank for a fee
representing the difference between the Bank's lending rate of 8.25% and the
government's relending rate. The loan would bear the standard commitment fee
of 3/4% p.a. Subloans would be granted for up to 12 years with up to 3 years
of grace. Repayments would be made according to a fixed amortization schedule
of 17 years with 4 years of grace.
4.14      All subloans above US$250,000 (the "free limit" for both BNF and
the FED) would need to be approved by the Bank, and this procedure is expected
to result in a review by the Bank of a representative sample of some 30-40
subloans covering about two-thirds of the loan amount. Based on its performance
under the first project and the intensive technical assistance in subproject
appraisal which BNF is to receive under the proposed project, BNF's free limit
of US$150,000 under the first project would be raised to US$250,000, and as
a result of the FED's good performance under its existing program, the same
limit would be applied to its subloans. The economic rate of return would be
calculated for all subprojects requiring financing of US$250,000 or more.
4.15      Project cost and financing.  Overall, participating intermediaries
would finance up to 80% of total investment cost, incluling foreign exchange costs
estimated at 70% of the total. Although on average sponsors would provide about
21%of the total financing, in the case of an expansion or modernization of
an existing project it is estimated they would usually provide at least 10%
of the cost and at least 25% in the case of new projects. Table 4.1 shows the
expected financing plan for the project.

17.1          40.5       57.6      100.0
4.16      Procurement.  The loan funds would finance the foreign exchange
costs of imported and locally procured equipment, materials and services,
including the foreign exchange component of construction contracts. Con-
sulting services for technical assistance to BNF would be open to interna-
tional recruitment. The estimated man-month cost of such assistance is about
US$6,000. Participating intermediaries would satisfy themselves that pro-
curement items were suitable for the respective investment projects and
reasonably priced, and that the beneficiaries had canvassed the main sources
of supply and were purchasing from the most advantageous source. Whenever
justified, items would be procured on the basis of several quotations, in
accordance with standard practice for IDF-type projects. Since it may be
difficult or relatively costly to obtain quotations from several suppliers in
the case of small orders, the solicitation of offers would be expected mostly
for larger procurement contracts.
4.17      Disbursements.  The final date for the submission of subproject
proposals would be December 31, 1983 and the closing date for disbursement
December 31, 1985 (Annex 26). Bank funds would be disbursed on the following
basis:
(i) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported inputs, machinery
and equipment;
(ii) 70% of local expenditures for imported machinery and equip-
ment purchased locally where the foreign exchange cost cannot
be determined;
(iii) 35% of construction expenditures representing the average
foreign exchange content of investment in industrial build-
ings and related civil works, and 45% of civil works expendi-
tures for hotel projects; and
(iv) 100% of the costs of technical assistance to BNF.
The above percentages are commensurate with the overall estimated foreign exchange
content of about 70% for the project. Since a two-tier system, involving the
FED and the commercial banks, requires more time for processing subprojects
than is usual for IDF-type loans, disbursements would be made for expenditures
incurred up to 180 days prior to receipt of Bank subloan requests, in lieu of



- 42 -
the normal 90 day limit. To eliminate any disparity in lending terms, BNF
would also be able to avail itself of the 180-day limit. All disbursements
requests would be fully documented.
4.18      Accounts and audit reports.  BCP would establish and maintain
separately an account for FED operations under the proposed industrial credit
project, as well as financial statements for FED as a whole, which would be
reviewed and audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank on an annual basis.
This audit report, as well as an annual audit reports from BNF or the private
DFC (should it participate fully), would be submitted to the Bank not later
than four months after the close of each fiscal year.
C. Project Benefits and Risks
4.19      The proposed project is expected to have a significant developmental
impact. Despite the achievements under the first project, institutional
improvements would continue to be particularly important and the proposed
project would therefore (i) devote a great deal of effort to strengthening
further BNF's financial condition, project appraisal and supervision capability,
its promotional efforts and its operational systems; (ii) support and greatly
expand the activities and scope of BCP's FED; and (iii) establish a system
which would substantially improve the capacity of commercial banks to base
their lending activities upon detailed project preparation and evaluation as
well as introducing economic appraisal into the project appraisal cycle.
4.20      The proposed loan would contribute to filling a major gap in term
financing of industrial projects in Paraguay and is expected to help finance,
through BNF and the FED, about 170 subprojects with a total cost of US$57.6
million equivalent. This number of subprojects would be substantially higher
than under the first loan (46 approvals at present) and would represent the
result of a wider distribution of Bank funds through increased intermediation
to a greater number of end-users. Total financing under the industrial
credit project, including the Bank loan, the contributions of BCP, and the
mandatory financing by participating institutions, would provide about 80-90%
of the financing required by subprojects financed under the project during
1980-83, and thus would make an important contribution to the growth of
industry. Also, Bank financing would support mainly small- and medium-scale
enterprises, whose lack of long-term investment credit has hindered their
development.
4.21      The direct employment generation related to the project is expected
to exceed 2,750 jobs with the average investment likely to be close to the
estimated average of US$20,000 per job (in 1979 prices). In addition, a sub-
stantial indirect employment effect is expected from the project due to back-
ward linkages in the agricultural and forestry sectors, since about half of
the proposed loan would finance agroindustrial projects. The impact of sub-
projects on Paraguay's balance of payments should be substantial. About 60%
of the loan proceeds is expected to finance industrial export enterprises, and
the remainder tourism and import-substitution industries.
4.22      The proposed project, as conceived, does not involve any unusual
risks. However, because (i) uncertainty does exist about the degree to which
BNF can rapidly upgrade its performance; and (ii) some of the institutional
arrangements established under the project would be both new and untried, some



- 43 -
initial delays in subloan processing may occur. To minimize delays in project
implementation, Bank supervision of, and assistance to the project would be
more intensive during the first year.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      Prior to July 31, 1980, BNF would adopt revised procedures for col-
lecting loans in arrears over ¢2 million (para. 4.04) and BCP would establish
a FED guarantee fund (para. 4.07).
5.02      During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
A.   With the Government on:
(i)  the onlending interest rate and spreads, a formula for future
interest rate adjustments, and that similar programs financed
by other bilateral or multilateral lending institutions
would be substantially on the same terms and conditions
(para. 4.12); and
(ii)  arrangements for reimbursing BNF for a part of FINAP's
debt (para. 3.18).
B.   W:th BNF o.-:
(i)  implementation of recommendations of a BNF personnel manage-
ment study, as well as a timetable for implementing such
recommendations (para. 3.09), and the hiring of additional
staff for DD's supervision work (para. 3.15);
(ii)  maximum targets for BNF's administrative costs (para. 3.23);
(iii) the inclusion in BNF's annual budget of US$2.0 million equiva-
lent per year to cover local currency costs related to the
project (para. 4.03); and
(iv)  conditions for disbursement under BNF's first US$5 million
portion of the loan and for access to the second US$5
million portion (para. 4.04).
C.   With BCP on:
(i)  operating policies and a credit manual for the FED (paras.
4.05 and 3.31);
(ii)  the amount and timing of the establishment of a short-term
rediscount facility (para. 3.24);



- 44 -
(iii) the hiring on at least one engineer for the FED
(para. 3.29); and
(iv) the content of a seminar in project appraisal to be
carried out by the FED (para. 4.06).
5.03      Prior to loan effectiveness:
(i)  subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank would be
signed between the government and BCP and BNF (para. 4.02);
(ii)  BCP's Board of Directors would adopt a statement of operating
policies and procedures for the FED satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 4.05); and
(iii)  a short-term rediscount facility for up to US$8 million
equivalent would be established by BCP for rediscounting
BNF's agricultural loans (para. 3.24).
5.04      BNF would, as a condition for disbursement of the first US$5 mil-
lion portion, (a) collect loans in arrears over 02 million (excluding FINAP)
totalling 0750 million, and (b) agree with the Bank on the content of a second
DRP which would include specific performance targets 4.04).
5.05      Prior to disbursement of the FED's portion of the loan:
(i)  BCP would pay in US$1 million to an account set up within the
FED to finance the local currency portion of the FED component
(para. 4.05);
(ii)  FED would furnish the Bank signed copies of satisfactory
participation agreements with at least 5 financial interme-
diaries (para. 4.05);
(iii)  FED would hire a competent industrial engineer (para. 3.29); and
(iv)  BCP's Board of Directors would approve a credit manual satis-
factory to the Bank (para. 3.31).
5.06      Prior to disbursements under the technical assistance component
for SNPP, an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would have been signed
between ILO and SNPP (para. 4.08).
5.07      Prior to September 30, 1981, BNF would collect loans in arrears over
02 million (excluding FINAP) totalling 0375 million in accordance with the following
schedule: 0125 million by March 31, 1981; ¢250 million by June 30, 1981; 0375
million by September 30, 1981.
5.08      Prior to March 1, 1982, the adequacy of the loan allocations, as
well as the limits on individual subloans and on the amount of the loan that
individual financial intermediaries could re-lend, would be reviewed by the
Bank and the borrower (paras. 4.02, 4.03 and 4.05).
5.09      The proposed loan would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$31 million to the Republic of Paraguay on the terms and conditions out-
lined in Chapter IV.

functions, the Board of Directors of the National Development Bank hereby
lays down the following guidelines concerning the policies and procedures
to be followed in its operations. This statement of policies and
procedures may be amended by the Board of Directors when need and experience
so warrant.

The National Development Bank is a governmental development bank
whose primary objective is to accelerate economic growth, for which purpose
it shall promote and finance general programs and specific projects to
develop farming, stockraising, forestry, industry and commerce of local
materials and products, the hotel trade and tourism, as well as to promote
the development of the capital market. Consequently, it shall follow a
prudent policy for promoting, financing and assisting by various means
productive enterprises in accordance with the national development plans.
The National Development Bank shall conduct its activities in accordance
with sound criteria and investment practices, pursuant to its charter law,
its regulations and other supplementary legislation and to this statement
of policies and procedures.
II.   FUNCTIONS
The National Development Bank has the following functions and
activities:

investment.
