IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TEACHE TRAINING PROJECT
(Cr. 1773-YEM)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Teacher Training Project in the
Republic of Yemen, for which Credit 1773-YEM in the amount of SDR 8.2 million (US$ 10.4 million
equivalent) was approved on March 31, 1987 and made effective on April 19, 1988.
The Credit was closed on March 31, 1995, one year past the original closing date (March 31,
1994). Final disbursement took place on August 30, 1995 at which time a balance of SDR 1.5 million
was cancelled.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Yogendra Saran, Senior Education Specialist in the Human
Resources Division (MN2HR) of the Middle East and North Africa Region, and was reviewed by
Messrs. Jacques Baudouy, Chief, MN2HR and Gianni Brizzi, Projects Advisor, MN2DR. The
Borrower provided comments that are appended to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during IDA's final supervision/completion mission in
October 1995. The ICR is based on material in the project file, discussions with the Borrower, and
project data provided by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
(Cr. 1773-YEM)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    Teacher training has been at the core of IDA assistance to the education sector in Yemen.
Starting in 1973, four IDA credits supported the expansion and quality improvement of primary and
secondary teacher training especially in rural areas. Upon completion, all four projects had met most
of their stated objectives. In 1986, when this project was appraised, continued support for teacher
training appeared to be justified with increasing focus on quality and efficiency concerns. During the
following years, IDA continued to provide resources for teacher training through projects for
secondary teacher training, for basic education and for education sector investment.
ProJect Obiectives
2.    The project evaluated in this ICR had two major objectives: (a) improve the planning,
management, and delivery of national teacher training programs; and (b) reduce the cost of the teaching
force by replacing expatriate teachers with qualified Yemeni teachers. To achieve these objectives, the
project was designed to: (i) strengthen the administrative and planning capabilities of the Directorate of
Teacher Training in the Ministry of Education (MOE); (ii) improve the qualification of teacher trainers
through specialist services and fellowships; (iii) construct five new Primary Teacher Training Institutes
(PTTIs) and expand a sixth one; and (iv) assist the Faculty of Education (FOE) at the University of
Sana'a to expand and strengthen its program of secondary teacher training. The project also included
three studies: (a) development of a long term strategy on school maintenance; (b) a preinvestmnent study
for the FOE; and (c) a review of teacher training programs.
3.    At the time of Board Presentation (March 31, 1987) the project appeared to be well designed
and its objectives consistent with the country's sector priorities and implementation capacity. The
project addressed critical bottlenecks in teacher training, promoted female participation, and supported
institutional development at the national level.
Im      xetati  Experience and Result
4.    The project's main objectives have been achieved. National teacher training programs were
substantially improved and the output expanded. Present capacities for teacher training are adequate to
meet the demand for qualified teachers into the next decade. Only training programs for female
primary teachers are still short of requirements in rural areas. But ongoing IDA projects focus on those
needs.



- iii -
5.    Technical assistance provided by the project has been fully utilized; it contributed to the
strengthening of pre-service and in-service teacher training conducted by the MOE and FOE. The
study on the review of the PTTI system resulted in a major policy change which emphasizes high
quality training by shifting to the 12+2 mode, i.e. two years of training for high school graduates.
This replaces the earlier 9 + 3, 6 + 5 and 8 + 4 (in the Southern Governorates) systems for graduates of
preparatory and primary schools education.
6.    The other two planned studies were also completed. The findings of the maintenance study
provided the basis for design of the project component on school maintenance under Credit 2570
(Education Sector Investment Project); the preinvestment study for the FOE fed into the preparation of
the Secondary Teacher Training Project (Credit 2222).
7.    The project also provided equipment and furniture to upgrade facilities in the MOE, as well as
for six PTTIs built with MOE funds. Civil works, on the other hand, were completed for only two of
the six institutes included in the project. The unfinished buildings are expected to be completed under
ongoing projects.
8.    In spite of the non-completion of four out of the six training centers, the project could achieve
its objectives and produce an adequate number of teachers because the duration of teacher training was
reduced from five to two years. This reduction took place because of the implementation of a Bank
supported education reform that increased the education level of the trainees at entry level from the
sixth, eighth and ninth grades to the twelfth grade. Conditions for the reform developed only after the
unification of the northern and southern governorates of Yemen and consequently its impact on the
need for training facilities was not anticipated at the time of appraisal. It should also be noted that the
Gulf crisis and the political and economic problems which Yemen faced in recent years resulted in a
slow down of new school construction and a reduced need for teachers. Given these factors, the
overall output of the teacher training system was sufficient to dramatically reduce the share of
expatriate teachers from 86% in 1985 to 14% in 1993.
9.    The goverrnent maintains a strong commitment to both quantitative and qualitative objectives
of teacher training. In this endeavor, it receives support from ongoing IDA projects as well as from
other donors. Recurrent costs for teacher training and the teaching force are being covered through
budget allocations. The benefits generated through this project - strengthening teacher training
programs and replacing expatriate teachers - therefore appear to be sustainable.
10.   The actual project expenditures at the time of final credit disbursement were US$15.16 million
compared with the appraisal estimate of US$20.11 million. The shortfall occurred mainly because
some of the civil works could not be completed. IDA disbursed US$ 9.45 million as against US$10.40
estimated at appraisal. Due to an increase in the disbursement percentage against civil works from 46
to 90% for three years through the Special Gulf initiative, IDA's share in the financing was 62 percent
as against 52 percent estimated at appraisal. UNDP withdrew its commitment to cofinance technical
assistance for the project due to shortage of funds.
11.   The project had a slow start. But gradually the pace of implementation picked up and
disbursement for technical assistance and equipment proceeded at a satisfactory rate. Major problems
occurred with civil works. Their implementadion was plagued by numerous delays at all stages,
reflecting administrative inefficiency further compounded by the absence of a price escalation clause in
an inflationary environment that left contractors without sufficient funds to complete the buildings.



- iv-
Political uncertainties after the unification of Yemen, including the Gulf War and civil strife, and
ensuing administrative weakness contributed to the implementations problems during 1991-94.
Eventually, the Credit's closing date was extended by one year, but that did not solve the procurement
problems for civil works.
12.   IDA staff participated in the design and preparation of the project, and closely supervised its
implementation. Special efforts were made to accelerate the pace of civil works, albeit with little
success. IDA's intervention through policy advice, institution building and training of professional
cadres, on the other hand, played a catalytic role in achieving basic project objectives. Overall, the
performance of IDA is rated satisfactory. The staff in charge of supervision maintained a high level of
involvement with Government in spite of the difficulties resulting from the Gulf crisis and the
unification of the country. The efforts of IDA to solve the issues related to the construction of the
centers were hampered by the project's closing before the procurement problems could be fully
resolved.
13.   Government agencies responsible for the project were motivated and cooperative. But they
faced serious problems with civil works which reflected partly their own administrative inertia but more
importantly the inefficiencies of many other government departments over which MOE had no control.
Summary of Finding? Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
14.   Even though all the physical facilities could not be completed before the project closed, the
primary objectives of the project -- (a) improving the planning, management, and delivery of national
teacher training programs; and (b) reducing the cost of the teaching force by replacing expatriate
teachers with qualified Yemeni teachers, have been achieved in large part. In addition to inputs from
this project, this was made possible as a result of a continuing dialogue on teacher training and other
education issues which were highlighted in IDA's education sector study 1 and IDA's recommendations
to the Government during the preparation of the Secondary Teacher Training Project (Cr.2222-YEM).
With major project objectives having been achieved, the outcome of the project is rated satisfactory.
The Borrower has established a special committee to expedite the completion of unfinished civil works
and to identify appropriate teacher training activities for the schools when they are completed, which
will enhance the existing capacity of teacher training as the system expands. The performance of the
Borrower is rated satisfactory with regard to project preparation, covenant compliance and operation
but deficient with respect to the project's implementation phase.
15.   The two completed PTTIs have started operating at full capacity. IDA staff visited the project
sites and found buildings, equipment and furniture in good condition and well maintained. The
teaching staff is qualified, having benefited from fellowship training provided by this project. Students
are motivated and disciplined.
16.    Two lessons emerge from this project experience:
(a)    Emphasis on policy change and institutional development can have a major impact on
sector performance, especially if pursued consistently in a series of operations.
Teacher training in Yemen provides ample evidence for this lesson; and

(b)    In an inflationary environment, the implementation of civil works will inevitably run
into problems if the contractors are not protected from the impact of excessive price
increases through price escalation clauses. The project's incomplete civil works
provide strong evidence for this lesson.



IEM EMNTATION COMPLETION REPOR
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TEACHER TRANING PROJECT
Part I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. P!roRject Objectives
BackNround
1.    In the mid-1980s, when this project was prepared, Yemen's education sector was suffering
from a severe shortage of teachers. Enrollment in primary schools had risen from 125,000 in 1971 to
781,000 in 1985. This was the result of a strong government drive to expand basic education
especially in rural areas. Further growth in enrollment was anticipated and has indeed materialized
(1.7 million in 1992). Yet, teacher training did not keep pace with these developments so that in 1985,
there were only about 2,300 Yemenis teaching in primary schools. To fill the void, the government
employed close to 13,000 expatriate teachers who in that year claimed 64% of the budget for the
Ministry of Education (MOE). As most of these expenses had to be paid in foreign exchange (about
US$115 million), the reliance on expatriate teachers created a heavy burden on the country's financial
resources. The situation was similar in secondary schools where expatriates accounted for 90% of the
teaching staff.
2.    Teacher training, therefore, had become a high priority for the government's education policy,
and was firmly embedded in the Second five-year Plan (1982-86). In fact, enrollments in primary
teacher training courses had already risen from 1,700 students in 1980 to 10,300 in 1985, producing
some 1,500 graduates a year. But the quality of training programs was still less than adequate as were
the qualifications of the local teaching staff. Moreover, female participation in teacher training was
very low. This situation called for sustained efforts by the Govermment and foreign donors to increase
the capacity and quality of training programs, encourage greater participation of women in such
training, and gradually reduce the expatriate teaching staff.
3.    The expansion and improvement of teacher training had been at the core of IDA assistance to
the education sector which started in 1973 and until 1984, provided seven credits totaling US$84.1
million (see Part 11, Table 2). The First and Second Credits (421 and 611) supported the expansion and
upgrading of primary and secondary teacher training. The Third Credit (915) assisted in developing
agricultural secondary schools and training for public administration. The Fourth Credit (1203)
supported higher technical education and educational research. The Fifth and Sixth Credits (1340 and
1470) again focused on strengthening the utilization of existing Primary Teacher Training Institutes
(PTTIs) and establishing new ones in rural areas. Other objectives supported by IDA were basic
literacy and skill training, local production of training materials, vocational and technical training, and
strengthening the administrative capacity and efficiency of MOE. In 1986, when the project evaluated
in this ICR was appraised, the first two education projects had been completed while the others were at
various stages of implementation. Eventually, all six projects met most of their stated objectives.
Continued support for teacher training appeared to be justified at that point in time with increasing
focus on quality and efficiency concerns. The Technical Training Project (1645) was approved in
December 1985, but did not become effective until April 1987. The project was completed in
December 1993; its overall outcome was rated unsatisfactory (ICR No. 14646).



-2-
.Project Objectives and Design
4.     The Teacher Training Project (Cr. 1773) evaluated in this ICR was prepared by the Borrower
with assistance from IDA staff. An identification mission visited the country in December 1985,
followed by a preparation mission in April 1986 and an appraisal mission in June 1986. Negotiations
were held in February 1987, and a credit of SDR 8.2 million was approved by the IDA Board on
March 31,1987. The Credit Agreement was signed on October 26, 1987, but did not become effective
before April 19, 1988 (Part II, Table 3).
5.     The project's overall objective was to improve the planning, management and delivery of
national teacher training programs, and to reduce the cost of the teaching force by replacing expatriate
teachers with qualified Yemeni teachers. Specifically, this included four components:
(a)    Strengthening the administrative and planning capabilities of the Directorate of Teacher
Training (DTT) in the MOE through specialist services (18 man-months) and
fellowship training of DTT staff (48 man-months);
(b)    Improving the quality and scope of pre-service and in-service training of PTTI staff and
teacher trainers through specialist services (42 man-months) and fellowships (258 man-
months). A special program for training teacher trainers had already been established
at the senior PTTI in Sana'a, and would admit graduates of the Faculty of Education
(FOE) at the University of Sana'a with two years of teaching experience;
(c)    Increasing the supply of qualified Yemeni primary teachers by constructing, furnishing
and equipping three rural PTTIs, one urban PTTI, one new PTTI for females, and the
relocation and expansion of the PTTI in Sana'a. This would create 1,990 new student
places with an estimated annual output of 340 graduates (Part II, Table 6); and
(d)    Assisting the FOE to expand and strengthen its program of secondary teacher training.
This would involve fellowship training of FOE staff (556 man-months); a pre-
investment study to determine future development needs of the FOE (6 man-months of
specialist services); and improvement of FOE facilities through renovation and
provision of equipment and furniture. FOE's enrollment capacity would thus be
expanded by about 300 additional training places in the four-year programs, and post-
graduate diploma courses (suspended for lack of staff) would be restored.
6.     The project also included a study on school maintenance practices. Cofinancing was to be
provided by UNDP (US$0.9 million) to finance technical assistance mainly for local training.
Assessment of Objectives
7.     At the time of Board presentation, the project appeared to be well designed and its objectives
consistent with the country's sector priorities and implementation capacity (see paras 2 and 3 above).
The project addressed critical bottlenecks in teacher training, promoted female participation, and
supported institutional development at the national level. Moreover, project preparation was well
advanced. All sites had been selected and two sites had already been acquired. Almost half the civil
works designs were ready for bidding. Equipment lists had been prepared, and the technical assistance
packages fully defined.



-3 -
Changes in Project Design
8.    During implementation, the project design was somewhat changed. In July 1990, funds for
improving FOE facilities (para. 5 d) were reallocated to finance project designs for new FOE buildings
(which would be financed by the Secondary Teacher Training Project - Credit 2222). Eventually,
however, the funds were not used for either purpose because cofinancing from UNDP did not
materialize. In August 1990, the scope of the review of the existing PTTI system was expanded to
include changes needed after the country's unification (May 1990). Finally, in November 1994, the
Credit Agreement was amended to utilize savings resulting from delays in civil works to (a) procure
30,000 student desks for schools in the Southern Governorates; and (b) provide funds for the ongoing
construction of a Vocational Training Center in Taiz, which had been part of the earlier Technical
Training Project (Credit 1645), but for which civil works could not be completed. While some funds
from Credit 1773 were indeed used for the center in Taiz, the government was unable to arrange the
procurement of student desks before the Credit's closing date.
B. Achievement of Objectives
9.    The project's overall objectives (para. 5) have been achieved:
(a)    National teacher training programs were substantially improved and expanded; and
(b)    The costs of the teaching force were reduced.
10.   Technical assistance (TA) provided by the project was fully utilized (Part II, Table 7), and
contributed significantly to:
(a)   the strengthening of pre-service and in-service training conducted by MOE and FOE;
as a result, the number of Yemeni teachers has grown rapidly and their qualifications
have improved;
(b)   the review of the PTTI system resulted in a major policy change which emphasized
high quality training by shifting to the 12 + 2 system, i.e. two years of training for
high school graduates. This replaces the earlier 9 + 3, 8 + 4 (in the Southern
Governorates) and 6 + 5 systems which use preparatory and primary school graduates.
In addition, project funds have been used to prepare new curriculum, teacher guides,
and textbooks for the 12 + 2 programs. These changes and inputs have led to
significant quality improvements in teacher training; and
(c)   the findings of the maintenance study for school buildings was subsequently used to
design a project component under Credit 2570 (Education Sector Investment Project);
and the pre-investment study for FOE fed into the Secondary Teacher Training Project
(Credit 2222).
11.   The project also provided equipment and furniture to upgrade facilities in MOE, as well as for
six PTTIs. Although civil works for only two of the six institutes included in the project were actually
completed (see para 15 below), the shift to 12+2 system increased the capacity by more than 50% and
compensated for the loss of outputs from the four incomplete PTTIs. Only training programs for female
primary teachers are still short of requirements especially in rural areas. In 1992-93, close to 25,000
students were enrolled in PTTIs, and another 31,000 students were enrolled at university level to
become secondary school teachers. By the same year, the number of Yemeni teachers employed in



-4 -
primary schools had risen to almost 57,000 while expatriate teachers had declined to 9,000 or 14
percent of the total (compared with 86 percent in 1985). Training local teachers significantly reduced
the unit costs of the teaching force.
12.   IDA continues to lend support for teacher training through subsequent education credits,
including those for secondary teacher training, for basic education and for the education sector
investment project (see Part II, Table 2). These projects focus primarily on quality improvement and
gender equity.
C. Makjor Factors Affccfing Project Impentio
13.   The project had a slow start. After Board approval in March 1987, and signing in October
1987 the effectiveness of the project was delayed to April 1988. Subsequently, the technical assistance
(TA) components proceeded satisfactorily and in June 1990, a contract was signed with AMIDEAST
(an international consulting firm) to manage the implementation of a package of TA for the Fifth and
Sixth Education Projects (Credits 1340, 1470) along with the TA for this project. That arrangement
proved to be quite satisfactory and facilitated the successful completion of this important project
element. TA for secondary teacher training was managed by the FOE, and also was successfully
completed. Most of the TA served to enhance the quality of teacher trainers in PTTIs and the FOE. In
December 1992, the Borrower requested AMIDEAST under its ongoing TA contract to prepare 47
textbooks for two year post-secondary teacher trainers, based on revised curricula and teaching
modules. This was approved by IDA and the textbooks were completed in February 1994.
14.   The original project design included two studies: (a) a preinvestment study for FOE; and (b)
school maintenance. Both studies were completed and their findings have been utilized (see para. 10 (c)
above). In addition, the government had made a commitment during negotiations to review the career
path of primary teachers. This review was abandoned after unification (May 1990) as circumstances
had changed and the study was no longer considered to be useful. Instead, the scope of the review of
the PTTI system was expanded and resulted in major changes in the PTTI system (and financed from
IDA funds).
15.   While TA and studies were successfully implemented, the project ran into major problems with
its civil works component. Their implementation was plagued by numerous delays at all stages,
reflecting administrative inefficiency and cumbersome procedures compounded by the absence of a
price escalation clause in an inflationary environment that left contractors without sufficient funds to
complete buildings. Preparation of tenders for four PTTIs was only finalized in mid-1989. Bids were
opened in August 1989, yet approval was delayed by another ten months. Contracts were eventually
signed in June 1990 and construction started in August of that year. Meanwhile, tender documents for
the remaining two PTTIs (Mahweet and Sana'a) were held up in the High Tender Board (HTB) which
was reluctant to give contractors foreign exchange to import materials. By October 1991, the Mahweet
tender had finally been approved and the contract awarded. But the validity of bids for the Sana'a
PTTI had expired and new bids had to be invited. The contract was awarded in February 1992 and
work on both PTTIs started in mid-1992, albeit on a slow pace. By February 1994 the buildings of two
PTTIs (Al Beida and Al Mahra) had been completed, while work on three other sites had come to a
halt because of major cost increases resulting from domestic inflation. New contracts negotiated by the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to complete these buildings were not approved. Construction of the
Sana'a PTTI had been slowing down due to a land compensation dispute. No further progress was
made until the project was closed. Completion of the unfinished PTTIs (except Mahweet which has
been canceled) is now to be financed from other ongoing IDA projects.



-5 -
16.   Procurement of equipment and furniture proceeded without major problems. The goods have
been installed in the two completed PTTIs as well as in other institutes that had been built with
government funds.
Project Costs and Financing.
17.   The actual project expenditures at the time of final credit disbursement were US$15.16 million
compared with the appraisal estimate of US20. 11 million (see Part I, Table 8). The shortfall occurred
mainly with civil works. IDA's share in the financing averaged 62 percent as against 52 percent
estimated at appraisal due to an increase in the disbursement percentage from 46 to 90% after the Gulf
War. UNDP withdrew its commitment to cofinance part of the project due to shortage of funds. (Part
I, Table 9).
D. PrsjctSnsanbiity
18.   The Government maintains a strong commitment to both quantitative and qualitative objectives
of teacher training. In this endeavor it receives support from ongoing IDA projects as well as from
other donors. Recurrent costs for teacher training and the teaching force are being covered through
budget allocations. The unfinished buildings are expected to be completed before long from available
funds under ongoing projects. The benefits generated through this project - strengthening teacher
training programs and replacing expatriate teachers - therefore appear to be sustainable.
E. 
19.   IDA staff participated in the design and preparation of the project, and closely supervised its
implementation (Part II, Tables 12 & 13). Special efforts were made to accelerate the pace of civil
works, albeit with little success. The underlying issues (streamlining the process of tendering and
contract approval, as well mitigating the impact of inflationary pressures) were too complex to be
resolved quickly and by the time a solution was agreed it was too late to apply it to the contracts under
this project. IDA's intervention through policy advice, institution building and training of professional
cadres, on the other hand, played a catalytic role in achieving basic project objectives. Overall, the
performance of IDA is rated satisfactory.
F. Borrower Perforingce
20.   Government agencies responsible for the project - the Ministry of Education (MOE), its PIU
and the Faculty of Education (FOE) at Sana'a University - were motivated and cooperative. However,
they faced serious problems with civil works which reflected partly their own administrative inertia, but
which were mainly the responsibility of other government departments over which MOE and its PIU
had no control. Political uncertainties after the unification of Yemen, including the Gulf War, civil
strife, and ensuing administrative weakness contributed to the implementation problems during the

21.   Credit covenants have been complied with (Part II, Table 11). The PIU maintained accurate
records of project accounts which were audited annually by private audit companies. The audit reports
were submitted to IDA and reports were found to be of acceptable quality. The performance of the
Borrower is mixed. It was satisfactory with regard to project preparation, covenant compliance and
operation but deficient during the project's implementation phase.
G. Assement of Outcome
22.   In spite of the non-completion of four out of the six training centers, the project could achieve
its objectives and produce an adequate number of teachers because the duration of teacher training was
reduced from five to two years. This reduction took place because of the implementation of a Bank
supported education reform that increased the education level of the trainees at entry level from the
sixth, eighth and ninth grades to the twelfth grade. Conditions for the reform developed only after the
unification of the northern and southern governorates of Yemen and consequently its impact on the
need for training facilities was not anticipated at the time of appraisal. It should also be noted that the
Gulf crisis and the political and economic problems which Yemen faced in recent years resulted in a
slow down of new school construction and a reduced need for teachers. Given these factors, the
overall output of the teacher training system was sufficient to dramatically reduce the share of
expatriate teachers from 86% in 1985 to 14% in 1993. This has significantly lowered the unit cost of
the teaching force. The table below provides the enrollment and output data for teacher training.

The PTTIs which could not be completed before the project closed will be needed as the school system
expands with investments from the public and private sector. The Borrower has established a special
committee to expedite the completion of the unfinished civil works at the PTTMs. IDA has informed the

5     Graduate output in 96-97 would reach 10,000 and if additional capacity is created from incomplete PTTI's,
it would be 11,000.

Government of its willingness to release funds from ongoing credits to assist in the financing of the
unfinished buildings.
H. Futur Opration
23.   Two completed PTIs have started operating at full capacity. IDA staff visited the project sites
and found buildings, equipment and furniture in good condition and well maintained. The teaching
staff is qualified, having benefited from fellowship training provided by this project. Students appeared
motivated and disciplined.
I. 
24.   Two lessons emerge from this project experience:
(a)    Emphasis on policy change and institutional development can have a major impact on
sector performance, especially if they are pursued consistently in a series of operations.
Teacher training in Yemen provides ample evidence for this lesson.
(b)    In an inflationary environment the implementation of civil works will inevitably run
into problems if the contractors are not shielded from the impact of excessive price
increases - this is a key lesson from the incomplete civil works in this project. One
way of dealing with this issue would be price escalation clauses, an approach practiced
by a number of borrowers. For contracts to be completed in less than 18 months, the
Yemeni authorities have opted against this solution. Instead, they are now offering
contracts denominated in US$ to local builders.

OCTOBER 1-11, 1995
AMDE-MFMOERE
1.           An IDA implementation completion mission composed of Messrs. Yogendra Saran
(Task Manager), Ms. Patricia Maughan (Operations Officer) and Mr. Otto Maiss (Consultant), visited
Yemen during October 1-11, 1995 to review the implementation and outcome of the Teacher Training
Project (Cr. 1773-YEM). The mission met with representatives of the project implementation unit
(PIU) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) and inspected project sites. The PIU provided important
information and data which will be reflected in the implementation completion report (ICR). The
mission wishes to express its appreciation for the cooperation and support it received from the Yemeni
officials.
2.           Project implementation was slower than anticipated, and the closing date of the IDA
credit was extended by one year to March 31, 1995. Major problems were encountered with civil
works due to high rates of domestic inflation and the absence of a price escalation clause. As a result,
only two of the six primary teacher training institutes (PTTIs) included in the project could be
completed. The Government is now trying to complete the civil works with funds from ongoing IDA
credits. All agreed equipment and furniture were procured; additional school furniture was purchased
from IDA funds under the Emergency Recovery Project (Cr.2258-YEM). Technical assistance
provided under the project has been fully utilized. It made significant contributions to (i) the
strengthening of the Teacher Training Department in the MOE; (ii) the training of teacher trainers; and
(iii) the preparation of several studies.
3.           Total project costs were US$15.2 million compared with the appraisal estimates of
US$20.1 million. Some SDR 6.7 million or 82 percent of the approved IDA credit (SDR 8.2 million)
were disbursed. The undisbursed balance of SDR1,487,465.97 was cancelled with effect on August
30, 1995.
4.           IDA's intervention through policy advice, institution building and training of
professional cadres played a catalytic role in achieving basic project objectives: strengthening the scope
and quality of teacher training and reducing unit costs of the teaching force. The country now has an
adequate capacity for primary and secondary teacher training to meet requirements into the next
decade. The quality of training programs has been significantly improved and will be further
strengthened under ongoing IDA projects. The number of primary teachers employed by the MOE has
increased from about fifteen thousand in 1985 to over fifty-two thousand in 1992, and that of secondary
teachers from about five thousand to six thousand. At the same time, the share of expensive expatriate
teachers in the teaching force has dropped from 85 percent to 13 percent for primary teachers, and
from 90 percent to 50 percent for secondary teachers.
5.           A draft of the ICR will be forwarded to the MOE by November 30, 1995, for review
and comment by the relevant officials.

BORROWER'S CONTRIBUION
We are pleased to provide our comments related to the ICR prepared by the Bank for the
Teacher Training Project Credit 1773-YEM.
Overall, we convey that, in our opinion, the ICR accurately and well presents all the important
issues and factors related to the implemented results.
We also agree with the reports findings. In this regard, our specific observations are as
follows:
(a)    We agree that the project's stated objectives were achieved. Of special note is
that the project's ability to accommodate changes needed because of changing
circumstances and needs was very important.
(b)    Also, initiation of the policy revisions, which proved so important, was
possible due to the Bank's cooperation and understanding of the issues. These
revisions:
(i)    enabled the Government to implement and plan changes to address
difficult factors resulting from the political and economical situations
happening in Yemen during the latter part of the implementation
period; and
(ii)   proved to be very favorable as they allowed the Government to
consolidate project outputs to best serve the education sector and
allowed for an acceleration of capacity development (e.g. the 12+2
system).
(c)    The policy revisions noted above will also serve future programs and the
government will want to ensure that once policy revisions are made, that
subsequent activities planned in advance are reviewed for any needed changes.
(d)   In the area of building maintenance, in addition to the point mentioned in para.
6, the Study brought important issues to a high level of awareness and thus
facilitated policy strategy to address the problems.
(e)    Although the many problems that were faced in the civil works were difficult,
the later agreements reached in mid-1995 between the Bank and the
Government, to address problems will prevent future similar problems and
hence, will enhance implementation and full utilization of allocated funds.
In conclusion, despite some of the problems noted, the overall achievements of this project as
part of the series of projects in the area of Teacher Training, have contributed to the development of
Yemen's teacher training capacity and the country's need to develop national qualified teachers to meet
the demand of the expanding educational system.
