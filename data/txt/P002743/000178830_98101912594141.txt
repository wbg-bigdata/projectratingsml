I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources and Planning
1.01       Tanzania's energy resources are large and diverse but have not
yet been exploited systematically. In addition to forestry resources, the
country has coal deposits in the south-western area estimated at
about 300 million tons of proven reserves.   Despite their remoteness from
the main population centers and harbors, exploitation on a sizeable scale
appears feasible and is being examined under a recently approved I.D.A.
assisted coal engineering project.   Tanzania has si nificant natural gas
deposits on Songo-Songo island (about 800 billion ftf proven) and possible
additional reserves at Kimbiji and Mnazi Bay where exploration is
continuing.   The potential for oil is being   investigated although no
significant  discovery  has  yet  been  made.  1/    Tanzania  also  has  a
significant hydro power potential mostly sited in the basins of various
rivers which drain into the Indian Ocean.   The country's   geothermal and
uranium potential is unexplored. Tanzania has a general energy policy for
the development of various energy forms, giving priority to renewable
energy resources.   However, a systematic approach to the development of
existing resources, supply of fuel and its transportation, maintenance of
equipment and training has yet to be established. A UNDP-Bank joint energy
assessment mission is visiting Tanzania in mid 1983.
Renewable Energy Resources
1.02        Tanzania has so far concentrated its efforts on six types of
renewable energy resources for development, i.e. biomass, hydro power,
animal power, wind, solar and geothermal.   At present, Tanzania depends
mostly on biomass sources in the form of firewood for heating, cooking and
some industrial processes, and on hydro power for electric energy.
1.03        Firewood and charcoal, which provide about 86% of Tanzania's
total  energy  consumption,  are  the  traditional  sources  of  energy
particularly in the rural areas. About 90% of the population lives in the
villages and depends almost exclusively on firewood.   Current consumption
is estimated at about 35 million m3 (about 2.1 m3 per capita per annum);
and the annual average growth of consumption is about 1.7%. The household
use of firewood as well as by industrial processes (such as tobacco curing,
tea drying, fish smoking, heating, brewing, brick-making and pottery) are
causing  sources  to  be  fast  depleted.    The  Government  has  formulated
strategies to avoid deforestation by introducing simple technologies such
as condensing wood residues into readily transportable briquettes and
pellets, improving the design of wood stoves, and by reforesting and
controlling wood harvesting.   Tanzania has also made efforts to develop
biogas and gasification by particle combustion projects in recent years.
The Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO) and the Arusha
1/ The Bank financed an exploration project in 1980 to assess petroleum at
Songo-Songo (IDA Credit 27-TA for US$30 million, June 30, 1980) and
oil-gas exploration project for US$20 million (IDA Credit 1199-TA,
January 13, 1982).



-2-
Appropriate Technology Project (AATP), both government organizations, have
about 16 planned projects (comprising the construction of gas tanks with a
total capacity of about 240 m3, at a cost of about US$30,000).
1.04          So far more  than 70 potential  sites for hydro power and
irrigation have been identified in Tanzania, mostly by the UN Food and
Agricultural  Organization.   The total hydroelectric potential has been
estimated to be about 19,000 GWh per year production capability, with about
3,800 MW capacity, 2/ of which 247 MW 3/ has been developed.  In addition
to the large hydroelectric power potential,  there are also a number of
sites suitable for mini hydro stations mostly in rural areas far from the
main power grid and the major population centers.   About 20 mini hydro
stations  operate  in Tanzania with  a  total capacity of  0.9 MW.   The
Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), Swedish International Development
Authority (SIDA) and the Federal Republic of Germany - Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) are investigating about 30 sites with a total capacity
of about 50 MW in the northern and southern parts of the country.
1.05      There are various geothermal areas mostly located in the north-
east  and  south-west  of  the  country  in  the  Great  Rift  Valley.
Investigations are continuing through SIDA and initial indications are
promising.
1980 Energy Balance
1.06      The Ministry of Water and Energy (MWE) estimates Tanzania's total
gross energy usage in 1980 to be about 5,000 thousand toe.  No energy has
been exported (except for sales to ships of about 50,000 tons of refined
oil products from the Dar es Salaam refinery (TIPER) in 1980).  About 87%
of all energy consumed was provided locally (mainly firewood).   Coal is
predominantly used in industry and transportation. About 13% of all energy
used in 1980 was imported, almost entirely in the form of crude and refined
oil products from the Middle East and North Africa.   Details of energy
consumption in 1980 are shown follow:
2/  Estimated hydro power potential of major rivers is:  Kagera River 280
MW (Rusomo-Kishanda projects); Mara River 89 MW, Wami River 120 MW,
Rufiji River 2,100 MW (Stiegler's Gorge project); Kilombero River 550
MW (Kingenenas/Shuguri Falls projects); Great Ruaha River 280 MW
(Kidatu and Mtera projects); Nkiwe, Rumbila and Rumakali Rivers 160 MW;
Songwe River 50 MW; Ntembwe, Kalumbo Rivers 60 MW; and Malagarasi River
100 MW.
3/ Wami/Pangani Rivers (Hale station 20 MW, Pangani station 17 MW, Nyumba
Ya Mungu station 8 MW); Great Ruaha River (Kidatu station 200 MW);
Little Ruaha River (Iringa 1 MW); and Songwe River (Mbeya 1 MW).

a/ Production from hydro stations. Production from diesel stations is
included in the "Imported".   Kilombero sugar estates and other
captive plants produce some power from bagasse (about 10 GWh per
annum), which is included in electricity.
b/ In 1980 616,904 tons of crude oil and 255,203 tons (872 thousand
toe) of refined products were imported.
c/ toe 1.0 = tce 1.5; toe 1.0 = 4,038 kWh
1.07       The Tanzanian Government has made substantial efforts to reduce
oil usage in the country since the 1973/74 worldwide energy crisis. Total
imports of crude oil and refined products in 1980 were about 872,000 tons.
Some refined products were also exported to neighboring countries directly
by the petroleum companies (i.e. Shell, BP and AGIP). The present level of
net imports is approximately the same as it was in 1974/75, so that
Tanzania has achieved about a zero growth rate in oil consumption (as
against a GNP growth of 0.8% p.a., and a population growth rate of 3.4%
p.a.) over the past six or seven years through conservation measures such
as restriction on weekend travel by car and gas oil rationing. Crude oil
is being refined at the TIPER refinery with a current production rate of
about 500,000 tons per annum.
Energy Prices
1.08          The prices  of oil  products  and other types of energy are
controlled by the Government.

Electricity is used mainly in industry and commerce, but it is also used
for lighting water heating and air conditioning (to a small extent). Other
fuels are used for cooking and water heating.   The effect of   different
pricing policies on energy consumption and the possible need to change the
tariff structure to a more economic basis will be subject of the
electricity  tariff  study  (paras.  5.14  -  5.15).    The  following  table

a/  Firewood is practically "free  in the rural areas.
Oil prices are based on the imported cost of crude oil and refined products
plus transportation and tax. There are also subsidies and cross subsidies
(e.g.  between  kerosene,  industrial  diesel  and  fuel  oil).    Price  and
taxation will be fully reviewed during the proposed energy assessment
sector work (para. 1.01).
Power Sector
1.09       The total electrical energy consumption of the country in 1980
was about 880 GWh, which corresponds to a per capita energy use of about 44
kWh/year, and is among the low levels of electricity use in the Eastern
Africa Region, reflecting the moderate level of industrial activity.
Annual electricity consumption per capita in other East African countries
is approximately as follows:   Kenya 90 kWh, Mauritius 573 kWh, Madagascar
41 kWh, Ethiopia 22 kWh, Botswana 450 kWh.
1.10        The Tanzania Electricity Supply Company Ltd (TANESCO) is the
country's main power producer, but a small amount of electrical energy
(about 2%) is also generated by parastatals and private organizations which
have captive power plants on sugar, tea and coffee estates, the oil
refinery, textile factories and large farms.   These power plants operate
under license from TANESCO, which has so far issued about 95 licenses for
diesel, steam and small hydro plants, corresponding to a total capacity of
about 7.5 MW and producing about 20 GWh per annum.



-5-
1.11           Another  public  organization,  the Rufiji Basin Development
Authority (RUBADA), established under MWE in 1975 to harness the
multi-purpose potential of the Rufiji River, also has authority (by its
Act) to plan, construct and generate power facilities in the Basin and to
sell electric energy. This situation of confused responsibilities creates
considerable difficulties and overlap in the planning of power sector
activities.   RUBADA has been concentrating on the preparation of hydro
power projects at Stiegler's Gorge, Kingenenas and Shuguri Falls, rather
than on projects for agricultural, industrial and social development of the
Rufiji Basin.   The result has been costly duplication in power sector
planning by TANESCO and RUBADA, a situation which Tanzania, with its
constraints in skilled manpower and finance, can ill afford and which has
delayed   identification   and   preparation   of   the  proposed   project.
Furthermore, the Government is planning a new organization, also
accountable to MWE, to be responsible for rural electrification, the
Tanzania Rural Electrification Corporation (TARECO), whose prime objective
would be the provision of relatively inexpensive power to rural communities
throughout the country through renewable resources of energy such as
mini-hydro plants  (para.  1.16).   The Government has already employed a
CIDA-financed energy specialist for the establishment of an energy planning
unit  in the Ministry  of Water  and Energy.    In order to clarify the
responsibilities and duties of each organization in the power sector,
during negotiations the Government has agreed to employ consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms of reference shall be satisfactory to
IDA to prepare a power sector organization study by December 31, 1984, and,
after taking into account comments of IDA, to implement by December 31,
1985 all appropriate actions, based on recommendations of that study.
Similarly, TANESCO has agreed to employ consultants with qualifications,
experience  and terms  of reference  satisfactory  to IDA to prepare,  by
December 31,  1984, a long-range power sector development study for the
timely identification of the least cost development alternatives for the
country.
Existing TANESCO Facilities
1.12       TANESCO has an extensive grid system in the eastern part of the
country which serves the coastal strip including the Dar es Salaam,
Morogoro, Tanga, Arusha, Moshi regions and, through submarine cable,
Zanzibar. TANESCO also has 15 isolated service areas scattered throughout
the country, but mostly located in the northwestern, southwestern and
southeastern zones of Tanzania. The total installed capacity of TANESCO's
power plants is about 380 MW, of which 247 MW is hydro (interconnected
system only) and 133 MW is diesel (mostly isolated systems).  TANESCO has
about 4,840 km of powerlines of various voltages and cables throughout the
country.
1.13       TANESCO is organized into the coastal grid system (para. 1.12)
and into zones:   the Northwest (NW) zone comprises the towns of Dodoma,
Singida, Iringa, Shinyanga, Musoma, Mwanza, Sumbawanga, Tabora, Bukoba and
Kigoma; the Southwest (SW) zone, Iringa, Mbeya, Songea and Tukuyu; the
Southeast (SE) zone, Mtwara, Lindi and Nachingwea.   Detailed information
regarding TANESCO's existing facilities is given in Annex 1 and shown on



-6 -
the map (IBRD 16231).   The total system losses are about 13%, including
distribution system losses and station use, which appears to be reasonable
when the scattered power plant locations and long distances of power
transportation  are  taken  into  account  (Annex  2).    TANESCO  routinely
conducts studies to identify further economic reductions of system loss.
1.14         The following table shows TANESCO's installed and available
capacity of power plants, lengths of powerlines, number of consumers and
peak demands in various zones of the country in 1981:

Access to Service and Electrification of Rural Areas
1.15       The Government has given high priority to industrial and urban
electrification for many years.   Only about 1.2 million (less than 7% of
total population) have access to electricity.   This is in the high range
for East African countries. Comparative percentages of population supplied
with electricity are: Kenya 6%; Lesotho 3.5%; Malawi 2%; Sudan 8.5%.
1.16       The Government's program for the electrification of rural areas
covers the electrification of villages and small towns. TANESCO has so far
electrified a few villages and small towns through government grants and
soft loans through bilateral assistance. Since this operation is generally
expected to be unprofitable, the Government has decided, on the basis of a
MWE study, to establish a rural electrification corporation in order to
accelerate development of village electrification.   Where possible this
will be by renewable resources - for example, small hydro schemes in the
Kigoma, Rukwa and Ruvuma regions.
Role of IDA/Bank
1.17         This would be the Bank Group's   fourth lending operation in
Tanzania's power sector.  The first was Loan 518-TA for US$5.2 million to
cover part of TANESCO's development program for the years 1967 through



1970; the second was Loan 715-TA for US$30 million and a supplementary loan
for US$5 million to cover part of construction of the First Stage of the
Kidatu  Hydroelectric  Scheme  which  was  completed  in  1975  (Project
Performance Audit Report, December 19, 1979); and the third was for the
Second Stage of the Kidatu Hydroelectric Project with Loan 306-T-TA for
US$30 million and a Supplementary Special Action Credit of US$7.0 million,
which was completed in 1981 and for which the project completion report has
already been issued.
1.18      The most important lesson related to previous Bank operations in
Tanzania is related to project cost overrun. In order to prepare realistic
cost estimates and a corresponding financing plan, cost estimates should be
reviewed by an independent cost consultant as early as possible in the
preparation of the project, preferably before the appraisal of the
project.    This  is now a standard recommendation for any project with
substantial civil works.  The Bank's requirement of a panel of experts in
dam construction has been particularly valued by TANESCO.   Retention of
full-time advisors for construction supervision has also been a positive
feature of previous projects.  The Bank's concern for the environment has
resulted in detailed studies on various aspects, and TANESCO has
satisfactorily implemented recommendations directly related to the project,
though implementation of certain recommendations will be long term.   The
Bank has systematically guided and encouraged TANESCO's comprehensive
training program, and the program's successful achievement of objectives
shows the effects of cooperation between the implementation agency and the
Bank.   The Bank has  played  and  continues  to play a constructive  and
catalytic role in the preparation of projects and in coordinating
cofinanciers' efforts.
1.19       The Bank's intentions for future lending for the power sector
will be formulated on the basis of the long-range power development study
(paras. 1.11 and 3.11).  To ensure that proper consideration can be given
in the study to the major options for power development in Tanzania, the
Bank is also financing studies into energy natural resources in Tanzania
that will provide major inputs to the long-range power development study.
These studies cover natural gas exploration and utilization and preliminary
studies for hydroelectric resources (IDA Credit 1060-TA, August 8, 1980).
Development of coal is presently under investigation (para.  1.01).   The
Bank has also recommended study of the feasibility of installing thermal
generation capacity (para. 3.07) that would consider the potential for the
use of domestic natural gas resources for power generation.
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
1.20      The Government continues to give high priority to the development
of the power sector in view of its importance for the overall economic
development   of   the   country,   emphasizing   its   essential   role   in
industrialization.   With bilateral aid the Government hopes to pursue a
rural  electrification  program  (para.  1.16).    Recognizing  the need  to



- 8 -
formulate a comprehensive national energy development plan, the Government
intends to set up an energy planning unit in the Ministry of Water and
Energy (para. 1.11).
II. THE BORROWER, BENEFICIARY AND EXECUTING AGENCY
The Borrower
2.01       The Government of Tanzania would be the borrower.  The proceeds
of the proposed IDA credit would be onlent to TANESCO.
The Beneficiary and Executing Agency
2.02          The beneficiary and executing agency would  be TANESCO,  a
parastatal  limited  liability  company  accountable  to  the  MWE,  and
responsible for public power supplies throughout mainland Tanzania.
TANESCO supplies about 130,000 consumers (connections) or about 4% of the
total population.  It was established in 1931 as a private company and in
1964 the Government bought all the issued shares not already owned, from
the  East  African  Power  and  Lighting  Company,  Limited  (EAPL).    Under
TANESCO's license, 4/ which expires in 2012, TANESCO has the right to
first refusal of any additional areas of public supply of electricity in
Tanzania, and is required to operate in accordance with sound commercial
principles, which it does.   TANESCO's board of directors is appointed by
the Government and the managing director is a presidential appointee. The
present incumbent is  a professional power specialist who was appointed in
1980 from within the ranks of the organization.   TANESCO's organizational
structure  is  shown  in  Annex  3.   Further  improvements  are  needed  in
TANESCO's organization and management practices in order to improve the
quality of services and company efficiency.  Therefore, TANESCO has agreed
(i) to employ consultants with qualifications and terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA to prepare TANESCO's management study by June 30, 1985;
and (ii) after taking into account IDA's comments to implement agreed
recommendations of the study by January 1, 1986.
Accounting and Auditing
2.03      TANESCO's accounting staff are competent and procedures are good,
so that information has been readily available and financial control
reasonably effective. TANESCO has in the past maintained adequate records
and submitted audited accounts regularly. However, since 1980 the computer
which TANESCO uses to maintain its records has been operating only
intermittently.   As a result, TANESCO's audited accounts for 1980 were
submitted to the Bank later than required under the existing project
agreement.    Billing  and other accounting  procedures  are also severely
affected and the accounts for 1981 have only recently been finalized.
TANESCO has purchased a new computer, which is being tested.  When in full
operation, it will enable audited accounts to be presented regularly in the
future, and will also help TANESCO to bill promptly, control overdue
4/ Issued in 1957 under Electricity Ordinance No. 3 of 1957.



-9-
accounts more effectively (para. 4.03), and generally bring accounting
records up to date.
2.04       The government-owned Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC) has been
auditing TANESCO's accounts since  1971.   The audit covenant under Loan
1306-TA requires TANESCO to have its financial statements audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to submit its audited
financial statements to the Bank within five months after the close of the
fiscal year has been substantially met, except in FY80 and FY81 when the
audited statements were received by the Bank as much as one year late.  It
is anticipated that in the future with the new computer operative, TANESCO
will be able to have its accounts ready for audit on a more timely basis.
The performance of the auditors has been satisfactory.  The convenant has
been repeated in the proposed Credit Agreement.
Billing and Collection
2.05        Meters are read monthly and the readings are sent to Dar es
Salaam from the branch offices for processing on the computer, which
prepares the bills.   These are then distributed to the consumers by the
respective branch offices. Computer breakdowns have disrupted this process
so that outstanding accounts are excessive.   The steps proposed to remedy
this situation are described in para. 4.03.
Personnel and Training
2.06         The Bank Group has a long-standing involvement in TANESCO's
training program and manpower development.   Dating from the appraisal of
the first power project in 1967, TANESCO's progress in manpower development
gives cause for satisfaction.   TANESCO established a training school and
training program in the mid-sixties and later with the help of the SIDA and
the Bank, TANESCO has developed a long-term and sound training program with
appropriate objectives for manpower development.   TANESCO has an active
manpower development and training unit and the Technical Institute (TTI) at
Kidatu, where at technician level, electricians, general mechanics and
diesel mechanics are being trained. The TTI workshops and laboratories are
reasonably equipped and include a hydro power plant control board
simulator. Expatriate trainers on 3-year contracts, equipment and teaching
materials were provided by SIDA on a grant basis at the time of the
establishment of the TTI (1974).   At present,  almost  all trainers  are
Tanzanians, who are supported by TANESCO's operational staff for specific
technical courses.   Through comprehensive management  training programs,
which were components of previous Bank power projects, since 1975 TANESCO
has reduced expatriate staff at headquarters and major power plants from 50
to 6. At present, all managerial positions are capably held by Tanzanians
and this is a remarkable achievement. The expatriates are specialists and
advisors employed mainly in the planning, design and construction
departments and for the overhaul of special equipment such as large diesel
engines and hydroelectric units. The ratio of 18 consumers per employee is
reasonable  due  to  the  scattered  power  facilities  covering  the entire
country. TANESCO has a total staff of about 6,300.



- 10 -
2.07       TANESCO's demand for engineers and technicians is growing as its
power facilities expand. Although the TTI and Bank/SIDA training programs
have met the requirements for technicians and administrative personnel,
there is a shortage of engineers and some management staff.   The project
therefore includes a training component, consisting of the training of four
engineers to be employed in the operation of the proposed Mtera power
plant. The project also includes provision for a continuation of the power
management training program included under Loan 1306-T-TA to upgrade middle
and top management staff, particularly for planning, construction and
system control activities.   Combined with the ongoing training programs,
TANESCO will be able to train about 125 individuals between 1982 and 1986,
to meet TANESCO's manpower needs, which is adequate.
2.08      TANESCO is expected to prepare its next training program in 1983
and to implement it in the period 1984-87.   About 75 people of various
categories would be involved in the project's related training program.
Insurance
2.09       Insurance of TANESCO's major assets is considered adequate.   It
is  effected  through  the  National  Insurance  Corporation,   the  sole
government-owned insurance company, which in turn re-insures through the
European insurance market for plant and equipment, including thermal power
sets.
III. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Demand and Market
3.01      TANESCO's electricity sales growth has been rapid during the last
two decades. From 1962 to 1980 annual sales increased from 159 GWh to 738
GWh, with an average annual growth of about 8%.   This growth rate was
reduced to about 5% per annum between 1973 and 1977 due mainly to the
restraint on growth imposed by the high cost of oil, but recovered with an
average annual rate of about 9% between 1977 and 1980.
3.02      A comprehensive load forecast study covering the period 1981-2000
was carried out in 1981 for the interconnected system, for each TANESCO
region and for the various zones of the country by Acres International
Limited of Canada (Acres). It was based mainly on historical growth trends
for domestic and small consumers and on projected individual growth for
industrial and other major consumers.   The proposed expansion of the grid
to the isolated systems in the NW and SW zones and expectations of economic
growth over the next two decades have been taken into consideration.  The
load forecast was revised and updated by TANESCO during the appraisal to
incorporate the revised construction programs of planned future industrial
consumers (Annex 4).
3.03      The revised load forecast estimates an average yearly growth from
1981  to  1990  at  about  6.6%  for  the  interconnected  system,  including
Zanzibar but excluding NW, SW, and SE expansions. Including the expansion,



- I1 -
the growth is expected to be about 9%.  This is lower than the historical
growth  rate  due  to  expectations  of  slower  economic  growth.    Since
Tanzania's independence in 1968, TANESCO has been expanding its grid to
service  areas  as  far as economic  constraints  have  permitted.    It  is
envisaged that TANESCO will connect the SW zone (Iringa, Mufindi and Mbeya)
to the grid in  1983 and the NW zone from  1984-1986  (Dodoma in  1984,
Shinyanga in  1985 in 1985,  Tabora,  Mwanza and Musoma in 1986).   Some
connecting power lines between the grid and the SW and NW zones are under
construction, and are being financed by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and the Italian  Government, including for the
connection of the proposed Mtera power station to the grid via Iringa and
Dodoma.
3.04        Electricity sales and average yearly growth rates by TANESCO
consumer groups summarized below:
Sales         Sales       Average Annual
---- GWh----   in Total (%)  Growth Rate (%)
Consumer Groups       1975   1980    (average         1975 - 1980
1975-1980)
Domestic               86.1  155.9      20.7              12.6
Commercial             56.5   87.5      10.5               9.1
Industrial            339.6  482.4      68.2               7.3
Public lighting         4.9    6.2       0.6               4.7
Total              487.1  732.0    100.0                8.5
Expansion  of  the  interconnected  system  will  enable  reduction  in  the
operation of the diesel stations in the isolated systems, including the
second largest system (Mwanza) and therefore will provide savings from fuel
imports (about 50,000 toe in 1988).
3.05        The industry is by far the largest consumer group, and it is
expected that it will remain so for the foreseeable future. The national
load forecast for 1982-1990 (Annex 4) shows total electricity consumption
increasing at a growth rate of 8.9% per annum.
Development Program
3.06        The proposed project is part of TANESCO's development program
(1983-1988), which will meet the growth in demand in the expanded grid.
This program also includes some small diesel stations to meet demand in
isolated areas and expansion of transmission/distribution system. By 1988
TANESCO's total firm capacity (including the proposed project) will
increase to about 335 MW, which will be sufficient to meet the expected
system maximum demand of about 300 MW in 1990 with adequate system
reserves.  This is the least-cost development program for construction of
generating and transmission additions needed to supply future loads. The
costs of the program are summarized below:

b/ Includes electrification of 20 townships and construction of mini-

3.07       According to simulation studies performed by the consulting firm
that carried out the feasibility study for the project, the Swedish
Consulting Group (SWECO), a protracted dry period of at least 3 years, as
occurred in 1975-1977, would result in the occurrence of power shortages
during the peak demand period (around December) from 1985 onwards.   The
consultants give a probability of 1 in 10 for the occurrence of a 3-year
dry period.   To avoid drastic load shedding under such circumstances,
TANESCO would need to anticipate such an occurrence by conserving stored
water for hydro power generation and by introducing load management
measures.    TANESCO  will explicitly  conduct  an  investigation  into  the
adequacy of such measures, the potential dislocation to users and the means
of  minimizing  economic  costs.    The  investigation  will  consider  the
justification for installing thermal generation capacity in 1985 or later
as back-up capacity to the hydro-based power system.
3.08         SWECO have also carried out studies to evaluate the future
performance of TANESCO's 220, 132-kV and lower voltage transmission systems
and rehabilitation of the Ubungo diesel station, which had been derated due
to problems with the quality of the cooling water, an inefficient cooling
system and excessive vibrations.   Three small hydropower plants and the
power distribution network in the capital area require major overhauls and
rehabilitation after many years of intensive utilization. Maintenance and
operation of power facilities have been satisfactory; but there have been
problems  in supplying spare  parts  and  consumables.    Furthermore  SWECO
recommended that various power system compensation equipment should be
installed, to obtain better voltage conditions and lower system losses.  A
system control center, to be constructed in Dar es Salaam, has also been
recommended because the existing control center is very small (part of the
Ubungo substation), old and is not equipped to control the proposed
extended system.   As recommended by the consultants,  construction of a
suitable control center is included in the project.



- 13 -
3.09      The consultants' recommendations on transmission and distribution
expansion have been included in TANESCO's long-term generation/transmission
distribution construction program.  A transmission line (220-kV) from the
Mtera switchyard to Iringa, not a part of the project, is required to
convey project output to the interconnected power system.  Government and
TANESCO have agreed to complete the construction of Mtera-Iringa line by
January 1, 1987 to provide adequate transmission capacity for the power
generated under the project.
Project Objectives
3.10          The main project objective  is to increase the electricity
generating capacity to meet the growth in power demand through 1990.
The project will develop indigenous renewable energy resources thus saving
on foreign exchange expenditures by substituting less expensive hydropower
energy  and  imported  oil.    Further  benefits  would  be  increased  job
opportunities   and   additional   emploment   possibilities   during   the
construction period. The project will also help lay the basis for improved
power sector institutions and for TANESCO's tariff policy, power system
control and load dispatching practices.   The proposed project will supply
power to the isolated areas through the expanded interconnected system and
will replace power production from diesel sets and thus provide substantial
fuel cost savings (NW, SW and SE zones, Annex 1). Additional objectives of
the project are to maintain and further improve TANESCO's operations
through continuing their training program and assisting TANESCO in planning
system development through a study of long term power development.
Project Description
3.11         The project is an integral part of the Great Ruaha River
generation complex comprising both Kidatu and Mtera, which would be
operated and  regulated as a cascade  system.   The  description  of  the
proposed project is as follows:
(a) construction of a water intake at the existing Mtera reservoir on
the Great Ruaha River; a headrace tunnel and a vertical penstock
system leading to an underground powerhouse with two 40-MW
hydroelectric units; from thence a tailrace tunnel (about 10.5
km long) to the Great Ruaha River; construction of a switchyard
and administration buildings, a storehouse, a workshop and
TANESCO staff houses at Mtera;
(b) construction of a system control center at Dar es Salaam;
(c) rehabilitation of the existing Ubungo diesel station and other
power system facilities (para. 3.08);
(d) training of TANESCO's engineers and managerial staff to improve
TANESCO's operations and its system control and load dispatching
practices; and



- 14 -
(e) consultancy services for construction supervision and for
carrying out studies of: (i) structure of power tariffs; (ii)
long range power development; (iii) organization of the power
sector; (iv) management system of TANESCO; and (v) rehabilitation
of existing power generation and distribution facilities.
3.12         The proposed Mtera hydroelectric power plant will be located
underground near to the existing Mtera dam which was completed in late 1980
as part of the Kidatu Hydroelectric Project Stage II (LN 715-TA).   The
Mtera power plant will comprise an inlet channel and an intake with trash
racks  in  the  existing  Mtera  reservoir,  a short  headrace  tunnel,  two
penstocks with intake gates, an underground powerhouse with control block
and a tailrace tunnel of 10.5 km length with galleries.  An administration
building with  relay  room,  transformer  cells  and  a switchyard will  be
situated in the open above the power station. The proposed powerhouse will
have two units (40 MW each, when using the available maximum gross head of
about 105 meters).
3.13           The Mtera site already has some essential facilities  for
construction activities (such as access roads, air strip, contractors
camps, etc.) which were built during the construction of the Mtera dam and
can be further utilized for the construction of the power plant.  TANESCO
and its consultant have the necessary knowledge and experience of the site
and surrounding area regarding the availability and properties of local
materials, such as rock, sand, etc., which would enable a quick start to
the project.
3.14       Design of the Mtera project was completed in October 1981 and
certain revisions to parts of this design were made during the appraisal in
November/December 1981 on the basis of the recommendations of the advisory
panel of TANESCO and the Bank consultant who had reviewed the design in
November 1981.  The bid documents have already been prepared by SWECO, and
in order to meet the project timetable, bid documents for the main civil,
mechanical and electrical works to be included in the project were issued
in October  1982 and bids were opened in March  1983.   Construction is
expected to begin in late 1983 and to be completed in mid 1988. It is also
expected that the construction of the control center, which would be
financed by the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW), would start in April
1984 and be completed by August 1985. TANESCO would prepare an engineering
report (including consultants' inputs) for the construction of the system
control center by June 30, 1983.   A full description of the Mtera power
plant and the detailed construction schedule are given in Annexes 5 and 7.
Cost Estimates
3.15      The estimated project cost, without interest during construction,
is TSh 2,403.8 million (US$197.1 million) of which about 74%, amounting to
TSh 1,784.8 million (US$146.4 million),  is in foreign exchange.   Total
financing requirement, including interest during construction, is estimated
to be TSh 2,862.1 million (US$234.7 million). The local costs include TSh
309.8 million (US$25.4 million), about 19% of the total base cost, for
duties and taxes. The summarized cost estimates (Annex 6) follow:

3.16        The cost estimates are based on contractors' offers for recent
similar civil, mechanical and electrical works mainly in Europe and also in
other  parts  of  the world.    The base  costs  are expressed  in mid  1983
prices.   During the appraisal mission,  the project costs were revised to
take into account the major revisions to the design of the project and also
recommendations made by TANESCO's cost consultant (A.A. Mathews of USA) who
has prepared a report on project costs in which, among other things, local
conditions  were  also  considered.    Physical  contingencies  for  different
project components, ranging from 10% to 18% on the base cost, have been
added. The price contingencies are based on the constant exchange rate and
price escalation shown in the following table:
1986 and
1983   1984   1985   thereafter
Foreign Costs  %      8.0    7.5    7.0      6.0
Local   Costs  %     14.0   13.0   12.0     12.0
3.17       The project cost has been compared with the prices of the opened
bids for the civil works and adjusted accordingly.

Project Financing
3.18          Project financing arrangements are well advanced.   At the
Government's invitation, representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany
(KfW), Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, NORAD, SIDA, IDA and the
French and Italian Governments held two meetings (in 1982 and 1983) to
review the project preparations and discuss its financing. A Memorandum of
Understanding among the above parties has been prepared for the
consideration and approval of all involved parties.   Co-financiers have
agreed to make their financing available to finance the foreign exchange
cost of the project and to cooperate fully with each other on all matters
relating to the execution of the project and on other matters of common
interest. The amounts of financing for the project indicated by individual
co-financiers are as follows:
In US$ million
(equivalent)
France                            5.0
Germany (Kfw)                    20.0
Italy                            19.0
Kuwait Fund                      20.0
Norway (NORAD)                   30.0
Sweden (SIDA)                    30.0
IDA                              35.0
Total                     159.0
The above amounts reflect early 1983 exchange rates and are subject to
possible  currency  exchange  fluctuations.    The  final  amounts would  be
adjusted to correspond to the actual project financing requirements.   The
Government and TANESCO will finance the balance of the project's local
costs. The projects financing plan would be as follows:

3.19       The proposed IDA credits of US$35 million would be made to the
Government  on  the  standard  terms.    Under  a separate  subsidiary  loan
agreement, the Government would onlend the IDA credit to TANESCO for a term
of 20 years, with 5 years grace period and an interest rate of 11% per
annum.    Cost  overruns  and  foreign  exchange  risks  would  be  borne  by
TANESCO.   Conditions of credit effectiveness shall be:  (M) execution of
the subsidiary loan agreement, (ii) notification by Federal Republic of
Germany  (KfW)  and  SIDA  that  all  conditions    precedent  to  initial
disbursements of their grants have been fulfilled, (iii) signing of the
Norwegian grant, and (iv) evidence satisfactory to IDA showing that the
French and Italian grants have been made available for the project.
Engineering Consultants' Services and Project Implementation (Annex 7)
3.20      TANESCO would be responsible for project implementation, assisted
by engineering consultants (SWECO) who were responsible for preparing the
feasibility study and bid documents (para. 3.07).   TANESCO has signed a
separate contract with these consultants for the construction supervision.
TANESCO employes a part-time advisory panel, which consists of an
engineering geologist and three civil engineers specializing in dam
construction  and  underground  excavation.    The  average  manmonth  cost
(including about 1,600 manmonths of salary, international travel and
subsistence) is estimated at about US$11,000.  The above arrangements for
consultants'  services  are acceptable.   During negotiations  TANESCO  has
agreed to employ engineering consultants and two full-time experts for the
construction supervision of the project, whose qualifications, experience,
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to IDA.
TANESCO has also agreed to employ the part-time advisory panel to assist in
the supervision of construction and advise in the event of unforeseen
problems arising during project construction.
3.21      TANESCO staff have considerable experience in the construction of
transmission and distribution facilities and hydroelectric power plants.
TANESCO   has   already   a   well-established   construction   supervision
department.    Rehabilitation  of  TANESCO's  generating  and  distribution
facilities would require proper attention. Therefore TANESCO has agreed to
employ consultants with qualifications, experience and terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA to prepare the rehabilitation study of TANESCO's
existing power facilities by June 30, 1984.
Procurement
3.22        Works:  Procurement for the main construction works, including
the headrace and tailrace tunnels, the underground power house and the
administration building, would be through international competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the joint financiers (Federal Republic of Germany
(Kfw), Kuwait Fund, NORAD and SIDA) which are in accordance with Bank
guideline.   The remaining and minor civil construction works would be
financed  by  Italy and TANESCO.   Contracts for civil works and' goods,
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and not likely to interest foreign
bidders, would be awarded on the basis of the local competitive bidding
procedures which were found to be satisfactory to IDA, and in which foreign
bidders also have the opportunity to participate.



- 18 -
3.23       Goods:   Equipment, vehicles and furniture, would be grouped in
appropriate contract packages and procured in accordance with the
guidelines of the particular financing agency who would finance the
component.
3.24      Contract Review:  All contract packages for civil works estimated
to cost over US$2.0 million equivalent and all contracts for goods
estimated to cost US$250,000 or more to be financed by IDA would be subject
to  IDA's  prior  review of procurement  documentation.   Furthermore,  all
contracts related to the consultant's services, studies and training would
be subject to IDA's prior review.
Disbursement
3.25         IDA funds would be disbursed against:   (a) 37% of foreign
expenditures and 20% of local expenditures for civil works; and (b) total
foreign costs of studies, training expert's services, and equipment and
materials for rehabilitation of power system facilities.   No withdrawals
shall be made after March 31, 1984 in respect of payments for the main
civil works unless IDA has been notified by the Kuwait Fund and NORAD that
all conditions regarding their disbursements have been fulfilled (para.
3.19).  Furthermore, no withdrawals shall be made in respect of payments
for the rehabilitation of the power system facilities until IDA has
received the rehabilitation study (para. 3.21)
3.26          If any of the IDA funds remain undisbursed after project
completion, they would be cancelled.   The proposed closing date would be
June 30, 1989 to allow for payment of retention money.   A disbursement
schedule (Annex 8) is based on the project implementation schedule and
follows in general the sector and IDA disbursement profile for East and
West Africa.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.27       During negotiations the reports and records necessary to monitor
progress of the project and its evaluation on completion have been agreed.
Proposed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in Annex 9.
Environmental Aspects
3.28       The existing Mtera dam was constructed on the Great Ruaha River
(completed 1981, financed under Loan 1306-T-TA) as part of the Kidatu
Second Stage Hydroelectric Project.   A general ecological review of the
Mtera site and the reservoir had been completed in 1970, financed by SIDA.
A series of detailed studies of all environmental aspects was completed
between 1972 and 1978, including the expected environmental changes below
the Mtera reservoir during the construction of the Kidatu dam (Loan 715-TA,
completed  1971).    These  studies  did  not  indicate  negative  effects
sufficient to jeopardize the feasibility of the construction of the dam.
The studies' recommendations were discussed by the Government, the Bank,
SIDA, and KfW and implemented as agreed between  1978 and  1981.   They
included the successful relocation of about 2,000 persons to the new ujamaa



- 19 -
village established by the Government and TANESCO, the establishment of
health programs and a nature reserve, and a government program for tapping
the potential minimum yield of 3,000 tons per year of fish from the Mtera
reservoir. Implementation of the recommendations has been reviewed in the
completion report on Loan  1306-T-TA.   No adverse effects of the damming
have been observed so far.
3.29         Construction of the proposed project will have no significant
impact  on  the  environment.    There  are no permanent  settlements  on the
stretch of the river between the dam and the tailrace tunnel. Although the
discharged water in the river between the dam and the tunnel outlet will be
considerably reduced during the dry season of the year, the minimum flow of
1.0 m3/sec required by the Government's "Grant of Water Right Certificate
No. 4187", will be fulfilled at all times.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
TANESCO's Past Financial Performance
4.01        Over the five years 1976-81, TANESCO's sales revenues increased
by an annual average of about 21% as a result of average annual increases
of 10% in GWh sales and a 42% tariff increase in December 1979, whereas
operating expenditure increased at an annual rate of only about 19%,
despite fuel cost increases of nearly 23% per annum.   However,  due to a
slow down in economic activity during 1981, sales increased only 7% for the
year.   A summary of TANESCO's income   statements  (Annex  10) for  1976-81
follows:

TANESCO's 1980 Financial Position
4.02        Annex 11 shows TANESCO's actual balance sheets for 1978 through
1981.  TANESCO's fixed assets in operation increased by only 6% from 1978
through 1980 but by 63% in 1981, when Kidatu II came into operation.
Depreciation is charged on a realistic basis and for 1981 averaged some
3.4% of average gross  fixed assets  in operation.   The 1981 debt:equity
ratio of 53:47 was conservative, with 78% of debt relating to loans for
Kidatu I and Kidatu II. Bank Group lending (TSh 615 million) comprised 46%
of TANESCO's debt, followed by Federal Republic of Germany (KfW) 20% and
SIDA 17%. Borrowing terms were generally concessional over about 25 years
(including 5 years grace) at interest rates ranging from 3-1/4 to 9%.   In
1980 and 1981, however, TSh 98 million (about 7% of TANESCO's debt) was
incurred through suppliers credits at 5% to 8.5% with repayment over 6 to
10 years without a grace period.   A schedule of debt as of December 31,
1981 follows:
Grace and               Currency

Total Debt Outstanding December 31, 1981



- 21 -
Debt service for 1980 was covered 2.7 times and 1981 was covered about 3.1
times by net cash generation. TANESCO has complied with the debt service
covenant  of  Loan  1306-T-TA which  will  be maintained  by  the  proposed
credit. This covenant states that TANESCO shall not incur any debt without
IDA approval other than that incurred for the project unless internal
generation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements.
4.03        On December 31, 1981 TANESCO had a bank overdraft of TSh 25
million,  mainly  attributable  to  ineffective  collection  of  customer
accounts; accounts receivables totaled TSh 298 million (an average of 213
days  of  sales).    To  cover  these  overdraft  situations,  TANESCO  has
maintained lines of credit for very short terms from the National Bank of
Commerce. Although TANESCO reduced receivables to a level of 90 days sales
by December 10, 1982, the major problem is that about 60% of accounts
receivables are owed by government and parastatal organizations which have
not been subjected to regular "disconnection for non-payment" practiLes.
Computer  breakdowns  have  limited  TANESCO's  ability  to  apply  the
disconnection practice to the other 40% normally subject to these
practices. During negotiations agreement was obtained from the Government
and TANESCO that by December 31, 1983 TANESCO will maintain its accounts
receivable at a level which will not exceed 60 days of sales and that
TANESCO will submit to the Association a semi-annual summary of outstanding
accounts subdivided between Government (including parastatal) and other and
aged in three categories - under 30 days, 30 to 60 days, and over 60 days.
4.04      A further contributing cause of TANESCO's 1981 liquidity shortage
is the high inventory level, equivalent to 9% of its gross fixed assets in
operation. TANESCO is aware that its inventory includes a relatively high
proportion of obsolete stock and intends not only to reduce such stocks,
but to reduce its overall inventory level to about 4% of its gross fixed
assets by 1986.   With the increased hydro generation,  the reduction of
stocks of fuel oil should help TANESCO towards its objective.
Tariff Levels and Rate of Return
4.05      Under Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement of the Special Action
Credit 55-TA, TANESCO agreed to revalue assets every two years and, under
Section 4.05, to maintain tariffs at a level sufficient to achieve an
annual rate of return of not less than 7% on average net fixed assets in
operation so revalued.   TANESCO's assets were to be revalued for this
purpose using the average of the Dar es Salaam (a) Retail Price Index for
Wage Earners earning between TSh 2,000 and TSh 4,000 per annum; and (b) the
Cost of Living Index for Middle Grade Civil Servants earning between TSh
8,000 and TSh 20,000 per annum, with both indices adjusted to exclude food
items (letter dated August 12, 1976 from TANESCO to the Bank, Loan
1306-T-TA).   The application of this formula has produced revaluations of
55% in 1976, 26% in 1978 and 33% in 1980.   TANESCO believed that these
revaluations are excessive and unrealistic and they have experienced
difficulty justifying them to Government when submitting tariff increase
proposals. TANESCO's tariffs were increased by about 50% in 1976 and again
by 42% in December 1979 to an average of 65 T cents/kWh (6.96 US cents/kWh
at the official rate of exchange).   This was not sufficient to meet the
loan covenant, except in 1980 (6.8%), and it is expected that with the
inclusion of Kidatu II in the asset base, only about 2% will be achieved

f or 1981.   Effective January 1, 1983 TANESCO has increased its average
tariff level by 50% from 65 T cents/kWh to 97.5 T cents/kWh.
4.06       Since Loan 1306-T-TA was made, both TANESCO and IDA have become
aware of the shortcomings of this revaluation formula for the purpose of
increasing tariffs.  Therefore, for use until an index acceptable to the
Government, TANESCO and IDA is available (para. 4.05), during negotiations
the Government's and TANESCO's agreement was obtained to the following
measures: (a) increase of TANESCO's average tariff level by an additional
20% to 117 T/kWh effective January 1, 1984; and (b) thereafter, to
maintain  average  tariff  levels  so  that  TANESCO's  internal  sources
contribute to capital expenditure a level not less than 25% of its capital
expenditure for the years 1985 and 1986 and 40% in each year thereafter.
For this purpose, capital expenditures will be computed on a 3-year moving
average (the preceding year, current year and following year). Government
and TANESCO would determine a realistic and acceptable asset revaluation
formula by December 31, 1984 wh-ch could be utilized in a rate of return
measure of the adequacy of tariff levels as a replacement for the above
cash generation formula with a rate of return requirement which would
produce similar financial results.   TANESCO would, with the agreement of
IDA, have the option of substituting the rate of return method for the
above cash generation procedure.
4.07         Additional increases of TSh 4t in 1987 and 1988 have been
assumed, raising the average tariffs to T 125/KWh.  These increases have
been determined as necessary to meet the requirements of the agreed cash
generation goals (para. 4.06, b).  However these increases will result in
rates of return after 1984, when the rate of return is expected to be 7.7%,
below the 7% rate of return required under Loan 1306-T-TA as follows: 1985
- 5.7%, 1986 - 5.6%, 1987 - 4.4% and 1988 - 3.7% (Annex 10).  These rates
of return reflect current replacement cost of TANESCO's fixed assets based
on the following assumed cost escalation:  1983 - 10%, 1984 - 9%, 1985 and
1986 - 8.5% and thereafter 9%.  As the revenues produced by the proposed
tariffs are adequate to meet a significant portion of the construction
costs while maintaining a relatively strong cash position, it would appear
that Tanzania's concern about the revaluation formula might be valid
(para. 4.05).   Additionally under Section 21 of TANESCO's license dated
March 1, 1957, TANESCO cannot charge more than 120 T/KWh for light or 60
T/KWh for power without obtaining the specific permission of the
"Governor  (now presumably the President).   Therefore, this section would
have to be eventually revised or deleted.  Government gave assurance that
the required license revisions would be obtained without difficulty.
TANESCO's Financing Plan
4.08       Annex 12 shows TANESCO's estimated cash flow for 1981 through
1990.    During  the  project  period  of  1984-1988 TANESCO's  construction
program envisages  expenditure  of  TSh  5,988  million  (US$491 -million),
including interest during construction of TSh 890 million (US$73 million),
of which about 48%, TSh 458 million, is in respect of the proposed
project. In addition to the proposed project borrowing of about TSh 1,818
million (para. 3.18), the financing plan for this period includes major
foreign borrowing of TSh 1,128 million (US$93 million), to finance some 42%
of the ongoing and other future construction, including the completion of



- 23 -
major grid extensions.   The financial forecasts do not include provision
for expenditure on new thermal plant installed as back-up generation
capacity (para. 3.07).   From 1984 through  1988, including the proposed
project, TANESCO intends to borrow TSh 2,946 million for its construction
program (US$242 million), of which the IDA proposed credit of TSh 423
million (US$35 million) is 14%.  The proposed credit is about 23% of the
borrowing for the project and, although there is no requirement for other
lenders to do so, it has been assumed in this report that most would, like
IDA, require their grants and loans to be onlent to TANESCO at 11% over 20
years including 5 years grace with TANESCO bearing the foreign exchange
risk.      The   present   commercial   lending   rate   in   Tanzania   is
government-controlled at about 11% and TANESCO would be eligible for a
lower rate of  10%.   Therefore,  11% appears to be a realistic rate of
interest.    TANESCO's  financing  plan  for  1984  through  1988  includes
increased government equity of TSh 1,073 million (US$88 million), and the
Government agreed to provide such sums as become necessary to enable
TANESCO to complete the Iringa-Mtera line which is vital to the proposed
project (para. 3.09).  As this requirement is estimated to be only 5% of
the funds required during the period, its provision should not be overly
burdensome to Government.
4.09       TANESCO's financing plan for 1984 through 1988 is summarized as

Future Operations and Financial Performance
4.10         Projected income, balance sheet and cash flow statements for
1983/90, together with notes and assumptions used in their development, are
shown in Annexes 10 through 13.  The projections indicate that TANESCO's
financial performance and condition would be satisfactory throughout this
period.   During this period electricity sales are forecast to increase
about 7% per year while revenues, reflecting demand increases and tariff
increases in 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988 and 1990, will increase an average of
about 19% per year. Expenses, including depreciation based on the revalued
asset basis, are expected to increase an average of about 15% per year.
Key financial indicators during the project construction period follow:

4.11        The financial statements both actual and forecast reflect the
liability and payment of income tax at a rate of 50% of net taxable income
which excludes depreciation and includes a capital investment allowance.
TANESCO's entitlement to the application of this capital investment
allowance for the years 1975 through 1980 is currently being reviewed by
Government. If this application is not allowed, TANESCO will be subject to
significantly increased tax liabilities both in the past and in the future
for which no provision has been made.   During negotiations IDA and the
Government discussed this subject and the consequences if this tax relief
were not provided to TANESCO from 1978 through the project construction
period.

V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Need for the Project
5.01        In 1980 TANESCO commissioned Acres International Ltd. to carry
out a power sector study.   The consultants  recommended  that planning,
engineering and financing should proceed immediately for the construction
of a 60-MW thermal power station by 1986. This was to be either coal-fired
at a (then) proposed new mine at Songwe-Kiwira or an oil-fired power
station at Dar-es-Salaam using residual oil from the local refinery.   The
consultants also recommended that the feasibility study for Mtera, which
was being carried out by SWECO (para. 3.08), should be completed and the
engineering and preparation of contract documents should proceed subject to
a review of the load growth of Tanzania.    SWECO's  feasibility  report
concluded that additional generation would be required by 1986 to meet
their "standard" load forecast.   Subsequently during appraisal, TANESCO's
load forecasts were reviewed with SWECO and it was agreed that the TANESCO
forecast, which was lower than the "low case" forecasts of either Acres or
SWECO,  should  be  adopted  for  planning  purposes.    Under  the  TANESCO
forecast, additional generation capacity is required in 1988.
Least Cost Solution
5.02       The only existing technically feasible alternative to the Mtera
project in 1988 is the construction of an oil-fired steam power plant at
Dar-es-Salaam.  If a gas-field is developed in time, a gas turbine plant
would also be an option for the next unit of generation capacity.  There
are a number of options for subsequent development based on hydroelectric,
natural  gas  and  coal  potential.   A detailed  account  of  the economic
evaluation for determining the least-cost solution is given in Annex 14.
5.03        A number of potential sites for hydroelectric generation have
been identified in Tanzania including sites at Stiegler's Gorge, Kingenenas
and Shuguri Falls.   Stiegler's Gorge has been the subject of a planning
report carried out by A/S Hafslund (Norway), whereas the planning of
projects at Kingenenas and Shuguri Falls is only in the conceptual stage.
None of these sites nor any other of the potential hydroelectric sites are
possible alternatives to the Mtera project in 1988 since none could be
developed and constructed in time.
5.04        Proved gas reserves of about 800 BCF5/ have been confirmed at
the Songo-Songo off-shore field  (para.  1.01).   However,  the  Tanzanian
Government has stated its firm policy to use the Songo-Songo gas reserves
for the manufacture of fertilizers.  Exploration activities  are also in
progress at other on-shore and off-shorelocations including Kimbiji and
Mnazi Bay off-shore fields, although reliable estimates of reserves at
these  locations  are  not  yet  available.    The  possibility  of  new  gas
discoveries is a factor in the planning of long-term power development, and
5/ BCF = billions of cubic feet.



- 27 -
therefore natural gas is considered to be an option for power generation
even though at present it is not possible to identify specifically the gas
reserves that would be available.
5.05          An opportunity  cost of gas for power generation equal to
US$3.0/MCF delivered to plant boundary is used in the evaluation basic
case. This delivered value represents in theory the highest economic value
of gas in alternative uses to power generation. The value of US$3.0/MCF is
derived from analysis by the mission of the terms of a proposed agreement
for production of urea from Songo-Songo gas.
5.06         Progress in developing coal mines has not been sufficiently
advanced for a coal-fired thermal station to be operational by 1988.  The
mission considers it realistic to assume that a coal-fired plant could be
brought into operation by 1991 supplied from new local coal mines. 6/
However, the main load center for the power distribution system lies in the
coast and adjacent inland areas, especially in the Dar-es-Salaam and
Morogoro region, which are 800 to 900 km from the coal fields. The capital
costs of a transmission system supplying power from coal-fired stations
located near to the coal fields to the main load center would be high,
probably equivalent to about US$1,000 per kW of installed capacity at the
coal field.   As a result, this option would be a high cost program for
meeting the power demand in the main load center. However, it would be an
attractive option for meeting demand in western Tanzania once the demand in
this region increased to a level that could sustain the economic production
of power from coal-fired units.
Power System Costs
5.07         The costs of the options for a long-term power development
program are composed of capital (generation and associated transmission
works), operating and maintenance and fuel costs.   The capital costs of
existing hydroelectric installations, including Mtera dam, and of committed
investments in extending TANESCO's interconnected system are considered to
be sunk costs and therefore to have zero economic cost. The capital costs
for Mtera and Stiegler's Gorge hydro projects are based on information
contained in the reports by Acres, SWECO and Hafslund, updated to mid-1983
price.terms.7/ Economic costs are expressed in terms of domestic currency
by converting foreign cost components at a shadow exchange rate equivalent
to TSh 20 = US$1.
5.08          A number of  programs  for  long-term development  have  been
evaluated for this report. The criteria used for evaluation is the present
value of the total costs of a program discounted at a rate corresponding to
6/  Songwe-Kiwira  and  Mchuchuma  coal  fields  located  in  Tukuyu  area;
estimated proved reserves 300 million tons; estimated inferred deposits
1.3 billion tons; initial development is likely to be open-cast mining
in Mchuchuma.
7/  Estimated  capital  costs,  including  associated  transmission  costs,
excluding duties, taxes and interest, in constant mid-1982 price terms,
are as follows:   Mtera - US$155 million; Stiegler's Gorge Phase I -
US$760 million; Phase II - US$213 million.



- 28 -
the opportunity cost of capital in Tanzania. In the basic evaluation case,
this rate is taken to be 10 percent.   Energy production in an average
hydrological year is credited to installed hydro capacity, and is taken
from simulation studies carried out by the consultants (paragraph 5.07).
Details of the capacity additions and energy balances used for some of the
programs evaluated are given in Annex 14.
5.09       Since the availability of gas for power generation is presently
unproven (paragraph 5.04), the evaluation of a least-cost solution from
programs that are known to be feasible at this stage excludes programs that
include gas as a source of power.  The options for development therefore
cover hydro  (Mtera and Stiegler's Gorge schemes),  coal and oil.    The
options for the next increment of generation capacity, required by 1988, is
limited to Mtera or oil-fired steam plant in Dar-es-Salaam. The results of
the evaluation of the programs in this category are given in Annex 14. The
least-cost option for the next increment of generation plant is Mtera.
Thereafter, a coal-fired steam generation plant located near to proven coal
reserves  in southwest Tanzania would be an economic proposition.   The
evaluation also shows that the Stieglerts Gorge hydroelectric site would be
an  economic  option  for  development  from  the mid-1990s  onwards.    The
equalizing discount rate between Mtera and an oil-fired plant as the next
unit of capacity is 32 percent.
5.10         The results of the evaluation of development programs that
include gas generation plant, which assumes that natural gas would be
available for power generation, are also given in Annex 14. The evaluation
shows that the Mtera hydroelectric scheme is a significantly lower cost
option than gas turbine plants with gas costed at US$3.0 per thousand cubic
feet. If gas did not have an economic alternative use to power generation,
then a cost of US$3.0 per thousand cubic feet would not be justified. This
would be the case if alternative gas-consuming projects could not be
implemented for a certain increment of proved gas reserves.   In such a
case, the cost of gas used for power generation would be taken to be
gas-field  development  and  operating  costs  only.    Based  on  presently
uncommitted Songo-Songo field develpment costs, the economic costs of
proceeding with either Mtera or a gas plant as the next increment  in
generation capacity are about equal.         However,  if sunk costs for the
Songo-Songo field are also included,  then natural gas would be a higher
cost option than Mtera.
5.11        The sensitivity of the evaluation conclusions have been tested
for increases in capital costs of the hydro schemes and to exchange rates
of 12.18 and 30 Tanzanian shillings to the US dollar. If the capital costs
of Mtera are 20 percent higher than envisaged, Mtera would still be more
economic than an oil-fired plant or a natural gas plant with gas costed at
US$3.0  per  thousand  cubic  feet.    The  Mtera  project  also  remains
economically more attractive than an oil-fired plant within the range of
exchange rates analyzed.   Details of the sensitivity analysis are given in
Annex 14.



- 29 -
5.12      In summary, the proposed Mtera project is the least cost solution
in the absence of availability of natural gas for power production. If gas
reserves become available for power generation but have alternative uses,
Mtera is still the least cost solution.   If the gas reserves have no
alternative uses, there is no significant difference in terms of economic
costs between Mtera and a gas plant as the next increment of generation
capacity.   In addition, there are other factors that are relevant to the
selection of the next power project, and the following factors favor the
selection of Mtera.   The Mtera project would be owned and operated by
TANESCO, who have a proven track record in the operation of hydroelectric
scheme. Furthermore, hydroelectric schemes are relatively simple to operate
with low risk of mechanical breakdown. In contrast, for gas power plants a
new institution would need to be involved in operating the gas field, there
are substantial risks of mechanical breakdown and to date there is no
Tanzanian organization that has experience in the operation of gas-fired
power generation and gas-field delivery systems. As a result, there would
be a substantial risk of delays and cost increases with the gas
alternative.
Economic Rate of Return
5.13       The economic rate of return of the project is the discount rate
at which the present value of the capital and operating costs of the
project equals the present value of the incremental benefits from the
project measured by value of production according to average tariff yield.
Costs are economic values based on the assumptions used to derive the
least-cost power program. Average tariff yield is used as a measure of the
value of benefits from the project although it is recognized that this
method undervalues consumers' willingness to pay and that therefore an
element of consumer surplus is not included in the benefits.   Therefore,
the estimate of economic rate of return is conservative.  Details of the
economic costs and benefits used to derive the rate of return are given in
Annex 15.   Including the 50% tariff increase effective January 1, 1983
(para. 4.05), the economic rate of return from the project is 10.1 percent.
Tariffs
5.14       An indication of the correct average tariff level according to
economic principles is given by the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of
electric power, which is derived from the identified least-cost power
development  program.    The  LRMC  is  taken to be equal  to the average
incremental cost of energy, which is calculated from the ratio of
discounted present value of total costs of the program to discounted
present value of the quantity of electrical energy produced under the
program.  The total costs are economic values for capital and operating
costs used in the derivation of the least-cost solution. The discount rate
used is the opportunity cost of capital which is taken to be 10%.  The
costs and quantity of production from existing power facilities are not
included.   The LRMC of power is estimated to be as follows in 1983 price
terms and with system losses of 20 percent of sales:



- 30 -
-  if gas is not available for power              TSh/kWh produced:  1.83
generation:                                   TSh/kWh sold:        2.20
(from Mtera + Coal + Stiegler's              (US cents 11.0/kWh sold)
Gorge 1995 option)
-  if gas is available for power                  TSh/kWh produced:  1.50
generation at US$3.0/MCF: 8/                 TSh/kWh sold:        1.80
(from Mtera + Nat. Gas Option)                (US cents 9.0/kWh sold)
-  if gas is available for power                  TSh/kWh produced:  1.07
generation with no alternative                TSh/kWh sold:        1.28
economic use:                                  (US cents 6.4/kWh sold)
(from All Nat. Gas Option) 9/
The average yield from tariffs,  including the 50 percent increase,  is
projected to be TSh 0.975/kWh sold in 1983 price terms.   Therefore, the
average tariff is equal to about 44 percent of LRMC if gas is not available
for power generation, and to 54 percent or 76 percent of LRMC under the
alternative gas prices.
5.15       A tariff study based on LRMC was included in the previous loan
(Loan 1306-T-TA) and carried out and partly implemented by TANESCO
satisfactorily so far.  However, the present tariff structure is still far
from an LRMC base and a new tariff study is necessary to take the proposed
long range power development study into consideration, including current
development plans reflecting the prospects for availability of gas.
Therefore, the project includes a provision for a tariff study, to be
funded by IDA, to examine and make recommendations regarding the most
appropriate  structure  for  TANESCO's  tariff.         During  negotiations,
Government and TANESCO agreed to TANESCO's execution of a study with the
assistance of consultants acceptable to IDA to be completed by July 31,
1985 to determine appropriate tariffs based on TANESCO's LRMC, and to the
implementation of the agreed recommendations by January 1, 1986.
Risks
5.16       Although the future load growth accepted in this report is lower
than the past growth and takes the existing economic recession into
consideration and also assumes that it will continue, there is a slight
chance that the actual growth could be lower than the estimates due to
possible further economic deterioration.  In that case, projects following
Mtera power project would be rescheduled. A further point of consideration
is that of the extremely high tariff increases that are required in order
to satisfy the cash generation provisions; however, substantial tariff
increases have been achieved in the past, which suggests there is no undue
risk  in  this  respect.    No  major  physical  risks  are  anticipated  in
implementing the proposed project beyond those that are normally expected
in the construction of a project of this type and size.

5.17       The impact of variable hydrological conditions and particularly
dry periods on the power supply reliability in Tanzania has been studied in
detail by the consultants (Acres, Canada and SWECO, Sweden) (see para.
3.07). This involved a simulation of the behavior of the power system over
a lengthy hydrological period assuming satisfaction of an assessed load
demand. For computer model simulation purposes, operating rules have been
elaborated for water management aimed at meeting the power demand by the
most economic combination of hydro and thermal generation. The results of
the simulation calculations have determined the power generation from each
power source in order to satisfy the load demand over the whole period
under given hydrological conditions. Separate simulation models have been
used to determine the energy characteristics of the project and to carry
out related operational costing and economic analyses.  Detailed calcula-
tions have indicated that it would not be economically justifiable to add
thermal capacity to avoid a possible power shortage with a small risk of
occurrence. The hydrological risks adopted in the consultants' studies are
considered to be appropriate in view of the project's hydrological and
other features as well as characteristics of the Tanzanian power system
generation mix.
VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations the Government agreed:
(a)  to employ  consultants  to prepare a power sector organization
study by December 31, 1984 and after comments from IDA implement
the agreed recommendations by December 31, 1985 (para. 1.11); and
(b)  to make available to TANESCO equity funds necessary to complete
the Iringa-Mtera line (para. 4.08).
6.02      The Government and TANESCO agreed:
to increase TANESCO's tariff level 20% effective January 1, 1984
and maintain TANESCO's tariffs at a level sufficient to generate
adequate cash to meet at least 25% of its average capital
expenditures for 1985 and 1986 and 40% thereafter (para. 4.06).
6.03      TANESCO agreed:
(a)  to employ consultants to prepare a management study by June 30,
1985 and after IDA comments to implement the agreed
recommendations by January 1, 1986 (para. 2.02);
(b)  continue to employ external auditors acceptable to the Bank and
submit audited annual accounts within five months after the close
of the financial year (para. 2.04);
(c)  to complete construction of Iringa-Mtera line by January 1, 1987
(para. 3.09);
(d)  to employ consultants and two full-time experts for construction
supervision of the project (para. 3.20);

(e) to employ consultants to prepare the rehabilitation study of
power facilities by June 30, 1984 (para. 3.21);
(f) not to incur long-term debt without IDA's approval (para. 4.02);
(g) to maintain customer accounts at a level which will not exceed 60
days of sales by December 31, 1983 and forward IDA semi-annual
summaries of these accounts (para. 4.03);
(h) to determine a revaluation formula acceptable to IDA by December
31, 1984 with the option of reestablishing a rate of return
measure (para. 4.06) and
(i) to execute a tariff study by July 31, 1985 and after comments
from IDA implement the agreed recommendations by January 1, 1986
(para. 5.15).
6.04      The following conditions of effectiveness were agreed:
(a) execution of the subsidiary loan agreement (para. 3.19); and
(b) evidence has been received that funds from Federal Republic of
Gemany (KfW), SIDA, NORAD, France and Italy are available (para.
3.19).
6.05      Conditions of disbursement of Credit proceeds were established as
follows:
(a) no withdrawals shall be made after March 31, 1984 on main civil
works unless IDA has been notified by Kuwait Fund and NORAD that
conditions of disbursement of their loans have been fulfilled
(para. 3.25); and
(b) no withdrawals shall be made for rehabilitation until IDA has
received the rehabilitation study (para. 3.25).
6.06       With the above agreements, the project would be suitable for an
IDA credit of US$35 million equivalent. The Credit would be made available
to the Government for a term of 50 years, including a grace period of 10
years, to be relent to TANESCO though a subsidiary credit agreement
acceptable to the Association (para. 3.19).

TANZANIA
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
TANESCO - Existing Power Facilities
Existing Power Network
1.        The existing TANESCO power supply facilities are scattered all
over the country as shown on the map (IBRD 16231). The power system can
conveniently be grouped into four, covering the grid and the NW, the SW,
and the SE zones. The grid, an interconnected power system which operates
at 220 kV, 132 kV and 66 kV, covers the coastal strip including Zanzibar,
Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Tanga, Moshi and Arusha regions. Important power
plants and transmission lines on the grid are shown on pages 3, 4 and 5 of
this annex. Total energy consumption and maximum demand of the grid in
1980 were 627 GWh and 118 MW. The other three zones include isolated load
centers which are mainly the local Government's administrative central
cities. For these cities, the installed and available capacities, maximum
demand and consumptions are shown on pages 3 and 4.
2.        The operating voltages and the length of the main power
transmission lines and distribution systems located in various zones are
given on page 5.
3.        TANESCO has an effective communication system throughout the
country. It has used land mobile radio-telephone equipment satisfactorily
for more than ten years. Maintenance crews working on transmission lines
and almost all important power plants and substations are linked by
radio-telephone. A powerline carrier (PLC) communication network has been
used throughout the grid satisfactorily. The primary means of
communication between the regional administrative centers and the
headquarters in Dar es Salaam is the public telephone system as operated by
the Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation.
4.        TANESCO has an obsolete grid control center (load dispatching
center) at Dar es Salaam, which is too small to cope with the all-switching
operations, load dispatching, frequency control, reactive power supply and
voltage control operations for the extended grid. A new control center
would be built under the proposed project to handle and improve these
operations.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Future Sales and Maximum Demand
1.        TANESCO, in accordance with sound engineering practice, regularly
revises the load forecast for the preparation of the next month's budget
and the yearly forecast for the next year's budget. In 1981 ACRES
International Limited of Canada also prepared a comprehensive load forecast
- high, low and standard - on the basis of IDA and TANESCO terms of
reference.
2.        ACRES' load forecasts through 2015 were developed for each zone,
and for the entire country to enable isolated and interconnected systems to
be developed to meet forecast demand. The load forecast, mainly based on
historical growth trends for domestic and small customers and projected
individual growth for the industrial and other major consumers, is very
sensitive to the variation of future industrial consumption because of its
68% of the total sales. During the appraisal the mission reviewed the
forecast of individual industrial customers (existing and future) and
revised the ACRES' forecast as summarized below:

Revised Forecast            225   1,164   299   1,699   400   2,272
3.        The revised load forecast was based on interviews with the
implementing agencies of the existing and future industrial projects and
the ministries involved. Progress of construction, financing situation and
the availability of raw materials, etc. of each project (about 90 existing
and future industrial setup and projects) were factors taken into account.
The expansion of the grid to the new isolated systems, i.e. NW and SW
zones, and the likelihood of the current economic recession continuing for
about two more decades (throughout the study period, 1981-2000) and lower
capacity operation of the existing industrial factories have also been
taken into consideration. The revised load forecast is shown on the
following pages:

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Description of Mtera Power Plant
Project Area
1.        The project area is shown on the map (IBRD 16231) and a
summarized project description is given in Chapter III. A fuller
description of major components is given below, with a summary of the
project's early history and a brief description of its important features
of geology, topography, hydrology, drilling programs and method of
construction.
Background
2.        The Bank's involvement in the development of the Great Ruaha
River (one of the major tributaries of the Rufiji River) goes back to 1969
when the Bank initially appraised a project which mainly consisted of
construction of a dam and an underground powerhouse at Kidatu site with two
50-MW hydroelectric units. This first stage of development was financed
under the second power loan (Loan 715-TA, December, 1970 for US$30
million). The second stage consisted of the construction of the Mtera dam
(175 km upstream of Kidatu dam) and additional two 50-MW hydroelectric
units at the existing Kidatu powerhouse (Third Window Loan - 1306-T-TA,
July, 1976 for US$30 million). The project completion report for this
loan, dated November 30, 1982, is under review. The proposed project is
the third and ultimate development of the Great Ruaha River, consisting of
the construction of an underground powerhouse with a capacity of two 40-MW
hydroelectric units, bringing total ultimate installed capacity of the
Great Ruaha River to 280 MW when the project is completed in 1987.
Topography and Hydrology of Great Ruaha River
3.        The Great Ruaha River rises in the mountainous South-Western
region of Tanzania, close to the northern tip of Lake Malawi, where the
rainfall is one of the heaviest in the country (about 910 mm last 45 years
average). From there it flows in a northeasterly direction until it
reaches Mtera, where other major tributaries join it and the flow turns in
a southeasterly direction. The river falls about 175 m over a distance of
34 km before it reaches the Mikumi-Ifakara road bridge at Kidatu and then
it enters a long flat plain flowing at a gentle gradient towards the east
until it joins the Rufiji River.
4.        At Mtera where the power station would be located, the average
flow is about 125 m3/sec which corresponds to a calculated annual flow of
about 3,900 million m3 (based on direct discharge measurements obtained

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 5
over a period of 25 years from 1955 to 1979 and supplemented by earlier
rainfall measurements) 1/. Annual and seasonal flow variations are great
and may show a ratio of as high as 100 to 1.
Mtera Dam
5.        The Mtera dam was inaugurated in early 1981 and is located about
6 km downstream of the earlier Mtera road bridge on the Dodoma-Iringa
highway. The dam is a concrete buttress dam with spillway and spillway
chute on the south bank of the river and a bottom outlet on the river
bank. The main data of the dam is as follows:
Calculated maximum river discharge:
1% probability, m3/sec                        2,500
0.1%            m3/sec                        4,000
0.01%           m3/sec                        6,000

Maximum spillway discharge capacity  m         6,000
Bottom outlet discharge capacity, m3/sec         600
a/ Could supply sufficient water for average year production for
three subsequent dry years.
Mtera Power Plant
6.        Geological investigations in the proposed project area comprise
study of landsat images, aerial photographs, seismic tests, field mapping
and 8 diamond drilling of about 1,360 lineal meters (both in the tunnel and
powerhouse cavern). Two holes are in the powerhouse/penstock area and 6
are along the alignment of the 10.5 km tailrace tunnel. The advisory panel
of TANESCO and the independent Bank consultant consider the extent of this
work is consistent with the usual requirements of a feasibility study for
the preparation of bid documents. The quality of rock (mainly granite) is
1/ Calculated figures from the model are:
1% probability - 16,400 million m3
50% probability - 3,000
99% probability -    540

shown to be unusually good and the panel and the Bank consultant are
agreeable with this conclusion. The Mtera power plant comprises an inlet
channel, intake with trash racks, a short headrace tunnel (about 100 m),
two vertical penstocks (about 100 m each) with intake gates, an underground
powerhouse with control black, and tailrace tunnel of 10.5 km length with
merge galleries. An administration building with reading room, transformer
calls and a switchyard are situated in the open above the powerhouse. The
proposed powerhouse contains two Francis type units, each with a capacity
of 40 m when using the available maximum gross head of about 105 m.
7.        Main data for the proposed power plant is as follows:
Full supply level in the reservoir,
elevation m                                  698.5
Minimum supply level in the reservoir,
elevation m                                   690.0
Water levels at tunnel outlet, elevation m

Tailrace tunnel cross section, m2                 55.0
8.        The inlet channel is situated in the reservoir area just upstream
of the right alignment of the Mtera dam. Part of the excavation for the
channel will have to be carried out under water. A cofferdam will be
provided to enable the major part of the excavation to be carried out in
dry. The works will be carried out during periods of low water levels in
the reservoir.
9.        The entrance of the headrace tunnel for the power plant will be
to concrete situation located just upstream of the Mtera dam on the right
river bank. The intake will be placed sufficiently deep to avoid any
deleterious effects from vorteces created by the 8.5 m drawdown allowed for
in the reservoir. The intake will be equipped with trash racks with
appurtenant cleaning equipment. From the intake the water will flow in the
unlined headrace tunnel.
10.       Each penstock intake will be provided with a cylinder gate
upstream of which a wheel gate will be arranged in a separate shaft, common
to both the penstock intakes. The penstocks will be steel lined and
surrounded by concrete over the entire length.

11.       The powerhouse will be of the underground type located about 125
m below the ground surface. The machinery hall will be for two
hydroelectric units with auxiliary equipment. The turbines will be of the
vertical Francis type, directly coupled to the generators. Access to the
powerhouse will be obtained via an access tunnel about 600 m in length.
12.       Water will be discharged to the tailrace tunnel through steel and
concrete lined draft tubes. At the end of draft tube, a gate will be
installed. From the draft tubes, the water will be passed back to the
river through the unlined tailrace tunnel. It is anticipated that some
parts of this tunnel will be strengthened by means of concrete cubes,
shotcrete lining and holting. The tunnel would be excavated from eight
faces.
13.       The power cables from the generators will be passed through a
cable shaft from the machinery hall to the transformers, located in the
switchyard at above ground level. The power plant will be connected to the
system at Iringa and Dodoma by 220-kV power transmission lines which will
be financed by CIDA.
14.       The average production of the project will be about 350 GWh per
year, the firm production about 220 GWh per year. 2/ The plant load factor
will be about 50% average and 31% firm. The hydro production of-the
TANESCO system is shown below: 2/

Operations
15.       The existing Kidatu power station (200 MW) and the proposed Mtera
power station (80 MW), together with existing dams at Kidatu (live
reservoir capacity: 125 million m3) and Mtera (live reservoir capacity:
3,200 million m3) comprise a cascade system on the same river (Great
Ruaha). Regulation of the river is very important to produce maximum
possible energy from the river water depending on the load pattern and the
system demand for capacity and energy. Therefore, upon an earlier Bank
request (in 1979) consultants of TANESCO (SWECO) have recently prepared a
study reported titled "Great Ruaha Power Projects Water Management, 1981."
In this report necessary information is given in the form of several
diagrams to explain how to operate the reservoirs at Mtera and Kidatu under
various conditions in a year, e.g. various load demands, various water
levels in the reservoirs, etc. The diagrams also show when production of
thermal power shall be started up in the system in order to avoid power
shortages during dry periods.

TANZANIA
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.           In preparing the financial projections TANESCO's FY80 actual
financial statements have been used as a base.
Income Statements
Revenues
2.         Existing tariffs assumed to be increased by 50% in January 1983
to 97.5 (T) cents/kWh, by a further 20% to (T) cents 117.0 in 1984 and by
an additional (T) cents 4 in 1987 and 1988 to (T) cents 125.0 in 1987.
Sales as per TANESCO forecasts agreed during negotiations.
Operating Costs
Generation
3.            Fuel/lubricating oil expenditures are based on engineering
estimates of plant utilization and an assumed price escalation of 15% per
annum (1980 cost:  TSh 0.58/kWh).  No energy purchases are assumed beyond
1981. Price increases of 10% per annum but no volume increases have been
assumed for salaries and wages, repairs and maintenance, and other
generation expenses.   The staffing at Mtera is effectively static since
staff are already in place for maintenance and control of the existing
Mtera dam.   Salaries assume annual scale increases of 3-4% plus general
wage increases equal to approximately 30% of inflation.   The absence of
volume increases for repairs and maintenance for thermal stations reflects
recent purchases of sets from Mirrlees Blackstone and Wartsila.
Transmission and Distribution
4.             Salaries and wages are assumed to increase  10% annually;
provision has also been made for additional staffing as follows: 1982-46,
1983-44, 1984-50, 1985-34, 1986-66, to maintain the additional grid
system.   Repairs and maintenance are assumed to increase 10% annually in
price and 5% in volume.   Other transmission and distribution expenses are
taken to rise 10% per annum in price and 10% in volume.
Administration
5.        Volume increases have been taken at 5% per annum through 1986 and
2% thereafter. Annual salaries escalation is assumed at 10%.

Long-term Debt for Future Projects
14.        Each future project has been identified with actual or potential
lenders, if known.   Debt service has been based on TANESCO's historical
pattern for such loans to (or onlent by) the Government (9% interest) with
durations varying with TANESCO's experience of each lender's normal
repayment  terms.    Terms  for  unidentified  future  lenders  (e.g.  for  a
coal-fired generating station) has been assumed at 9% over 27 years,
including 7 years grace period with 100% foreign cost being borrowed.
Local cost is assumed to be financed by TANESCO.

TANZANIA
Economic Analysis - Least Cost Solution
1.            The evaluation of the most economic option for new power
facilities in 1988 has to be set in the context of long-term power
development.   There are two related issues involved in determining the
least cost long-term power program. The first issue concerns the selection
of the next unit of power generation capacity which is required by 1988.
The only existing technically feasible alternative to the Mtera project in
1988 is the construction of an oil-fired steam power plant at Dar-es-
Salaam, although this would result in an increase in oil imports and
therefore, greater expenditure of scarce foreign exchange. If a gas-field
is developed in time, a gas turbine plant would also be an option for the
next unit of generation capacity.  The second issue concerns the type of
power plant selected for additional generation capacity subsequent to
1988.   According to TANESCO's  load forecast,  the first  stage of such
additional capacity would be required in 1990 or 1991 depending upon the
amount of capacity commissioned in 1988. There are a number of options for
subsequent development based on hydroelectric, natural gas and coal
potential.
Hydroelectric Options
2.        A number of potential sites for hydroelectic generation have been
identified in Tanzania including sites at Stiegler's Gorge, Kingenenas and
Shuguri Falls.  Stiegler's Gorge has been the subject of a planning report
carried out by A/S Hafslund (Norway), whereas the planning of projects at
Kingenenas and Shuguri Falls is only in the conceptual stage.   None of
these sites nor any other of the potential hydroelectric sites are possible
alternatives to the Mtera project in 1988 since none could be developed and
constructed in time.
3.         The first phase of the Stiegler's Gorge hydroelectric projectl/
could be completed by 1992 if the project was started before end 1984.
Subsequent phases would be completed as required to meet increased load.
The firm energy potential of existing hydro stations (Kidatu), Mtera and
Stiegler's Gorge hydro projects would be sufficient to meet TANESCO's load
forecast to about the year 2012, and therefore these hydro projects form an
option for a long-term power development program.   Howevever, the power
potential of the Stiegler's Gorge project is large relative to the
1/  Stiegler's Gorge installed capacity and firm energy:   Phase I 300
MW/2,150 GWh; Phase II 600 MW/1,570 GWh; Phase III 300 MW/1,150 GWh;
Phase IV 900 MW/1,050 GWh.



- 64 -
ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 21
total load of TANESCO's system and, even with the proposed phasing, much of
the potential output would not be usable during the initial years of
operation. The amount of unused potential would be reduced as the date for
installing the first phase is put back due to growth in TANESCO's system
load. Therefore, there are further options in which implementation of the
first phase of the Stiegler's Gorge project is delayed to 1995 or beyond,
and thermal power plants are installed before the first phase of the
Stiegler's  Gorge  project.    The  other  identified  potential  sites  for
hydroelectric generation (paragraph 2) are not considered as firm options
for new power generation facilities in 1991 since insufficient preparatory
investigations have been carried out to provide reliable technical and cost
data.
Natural Gas Option
4.          Proved gas reserves of about 800 BCF2/ have been confirmed at
the  Songo-Songo off-shore field.        Exploration activities are also in
progress at other on-shore and offshore locations including Kimbiji and
Mnazi Bay off-shore fields, although reliable estimates of reserves at
these  locations  are  not  yet  available.    The  possibility  of  new  gas
discoveries is a factor in the planning of long-term power development.
5.          The Tanzania Government has stated its firm policy to use the
Song-Songo gas reserves for the manufacture of fertilizers. According to a
draft gas suply agreement between the Tanzanian Petroleum Development
Corporation (TPDC) and Kilwa Ammonia Co. (KILAMCO), TPDC has undertaken to
dedicate 602 BCF of gas reserves at Songo-Songo for KILAMCO's use for the
manufacture of fertilizers.   This agreement is conditional on success in
raising financing for the fertilizer project and on proving the existence
of adequate reserves.  Therefore, if the agreement becomes binding, there
would be about 200 BCF of gas reserves at Songo-Songo available for power
generation.
6.            In the present state of knowledge about Tanzania's energy
resources, there are two strategies worth consideration for the use of gas
for generating power.   The first strategy involves using gas  turbines
primarily as reserve and peak generation capacity by taking advantage of
the lower capital costs of gas turbines relative to other plants.  Under
this strategy, gas generation capacity would be installed as the next
station following the Mtera project and would be required by 1991.
2/ BCF = billions of cubic feet.



- 65 -
ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 21
Additional units could be installed subsequently depending on the economic
attractiveness  of other available power plants.    The quantity  of  gas
reserves that would need to be dedicated to power generation under this
strategy would not be more than 100 BCF.  Therefore, such use of gas for
power development would be planned as a supplementary use of gas to a major
gas user, such as a fertilizer project.
7.           The second strategy takes into account the possibility that
substantial gas reserves will be discovered in addition to the Songo-Songo
field. Under this strategy, gas generation plant would be used to meet
base load and would be the main type of plant commissioned.    The period
over which such a program could be enacted would depend on the quantity of
gas reserves that would be available for dedication to power generation. A
power program based entirely on gas turbine installations to meet TANESCO's
load forecast projected at a growth rate of 5 percent per year for a 30
year period up to 2016, would require the dedication of about 2.5 trillion
cubic feet of gas reserves. This quantity greatly exceeds presently proved
reserves in Tanzania and therefore, this strategy remains hypothetical un-
less sufficient new reserves are discovered.  Nevertheless, this strategy
is worth consideration as a possibility for power development in theory
whilst exploration is in progress for new gas reserves.
8.             An opportunity cost of gas for power generation equal to
US$3.0/MCF delivered to plant boundary is used in the evaluation basic
case, whether the gas is supplied from the Songo-Songo field or a new as
yet unproved field.  The net economic value of gas is the delivered value
less  gas  field  and gas delivery  system  costs.   This  delivered value
represents in theory the highest economic cost of gas required for power in
alternative uses to power generation.   The value of US$3.0/MCF is derived
from analysis by the mission of the terms of a proposed agreement for
production  of  urea  from  Songo-Songo  gas.   In practice,  the value  of
US$3.0/MCF could be lower than the value for the opportunity cost of gas
for generating power, since a use for gas other than for manufacturing
fertilizer would not be considered as giving the opportunity cost for power
unless the economic value of gas in this use is higher than US$3.0/MCF.
For instance, if gas reserves of the order of 3 trillion cubic feet are
proved in a new gasfield, as would be required for the long-term base-load
use described in paragraph 7, one alternative use for the reserves would be
exports of LNG which at present offers a return to gas that is at least as
high as from the manufacture of fertilizers.
Coal Option
9.             Coal is another option for new power generation capacity
installed after  1988.   Progress  in developing coal mines has not been
sufficiently advanced for a coal-fired thermal station to be operational by
1988. The mission considers it realistic to assume that a coal-fired plant
could be brought into operation by 1991 supplied from new local coal



- 66 -
ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 21
mines. A 100 MW coal-fired plant could be constructed in the vicinity of
one of the coal-fields in Tanzania,3/ and would require about 350,000 tons
per year of coal at full production. Due to high costs of transportation
from coal-field to the coast, the economic value of coal mined in Tanzania
for export would be very low.   Therefore, development of Tanzanian coal
reserves will have  to be based on domestic utilization.    The  proved
reserves are sufficient to meet the requirements of the series of
coal-fired power plants that would be needed to meet TANESCO's load
forecast to beyond the year 2016 projected at a growth rate of 5 percent
per year.
10.        The main load center for the power distribution system lies in
the coast and adjacent inland areas, especially in the Dar-es-Salaam and
Morogoro region which are 800 to 900 km from the coalfields.  The existing
grid zone, which covers this region, presently accounts for about 85
percent of the total energy sold by TANESCO (Annex 1).  The capital costs
of a transmision system supplying power from coal-fired stations located
near to the coal fields to the main load center would be high, probably
equivalent to about US$1,000 per kW of installed capacity at the
coal-field.   As a result, the cost of power delivered to the main load
center from this source would be more than US cents 10 per kWh even if coal
was to be supplied at a low cost to the power station, such as US$ 25 per
ton from open-cast mines.  Although this coal option would be a high cost
program for meeting the power demand in the main load center. it would be
an attractive option for meeting demand in western Tanzania once the demand
in this region increased to a level that could sustain the economic
production of power from coal-fired units.   Power could be delivered to
this region at an economic cost of the order of US cents 5 per kWh from a
coal-fired station located near to an open-cast mine.   According to the
present power demand forecast (Annex 4), demand in the Mbeya and Mwanza
regions could be sufficient from the mid 1990s for economic development of
a coal-fired power station in western Tanzania.
Power System Costs
11.          The costs of the options for a long-term power development
program are composed of capital (generation and associated transmission
works), operating and maintenance and fuel costs.   The capital costs of
existing hydroelectric installations, including Mtera dam, and of committed
investments in extending TANESCO's interconnected system are considered to
be sunk costs and therefore to have zero economic cost. The capital costs
for Mtera and Stiegler's Gorge hydro projects are based on information
contained in the reports by Acres, SWECO and Hafslund, updated to mid-1983
3/  Songwe-Kiwira  and  Mchuchuma  coal-fields  located  in  Tukyu  area;
estimated proved reserves 300 million tons; estimated inferred deposits
1.3 billion tons; initial development is likely to be open-cast mining
in Mchuchuma.

price terms.4/ The capital costs of oil-fired steam plants are based on a
unit rate of US$1,200/kW installed, for gas turbine plants of US$600/kW
installed,  and  for  coal-fired  plants  of  US$1,600/kW  installed.    The
economic cost of gas used for power generation is taken to be US$3.0 per
thousand cubic feet (paragraph 8).5/  The economic cost of coal supplied
to power stations is based on an assumed cost of supply from local
open-cast mines of US$25/ton. The economic value of petroleum products is
based on import parity prices and is assumed to increase at 2.0 percent per
year in constant price terms in line with World Bank projections.   All
costs are expressed in constant 1983 prices. Economic costs are expressed
in terms of domestic currency by converting foreign cost components at a
shadow exchange rate equivalent to TSh 20 = US$1.
12.           A number of programs  for long-term development have been
evaluated for this report. The criteria used for evaluation is the present
value of the total costs of a program discounted at a rate corresponding to
the opportunity cost of capital in Tanzania. In the basic evaluation case,
this rate is taken to be 10 percent.   Energy production in an average
hydrological year is credited to installed hydro capacity, and is taken
from simulation studies carried out by the consultants (paragraph 11).
Details of the capacity additions and energy balances used for some of the
programs evaluated are given at the end of this Annex.
13.        Since the availability of gas for base-load power generation as
an alternative to the Mtera project is presently unproven (paragraph 7 of
this Annex), the evaluation of a least-cost solution from programs that are
known to be feasible at this stage excludes programs that include gas as a
source of power. The options for development therefore cover hydro (Mtera
and Stieglers Gorge schemes - paragraph 2), coal (to supply western areas
of Tanzania and separately, the main load centers in eastern Tanzania -
paragraph 9) and oil station (located in the Dar-es-Salaam area - paragraph
1). As noted in previous paragraphs in this Annex, the options for the
next increment of generation capacity, required by 1988, is limited to
Mtera or oil-fired steam plant in Dar-es-Salaam.   The results  of  the
evaluation of the programs in this category are summarized below for the
evaluation  basic  case  (for  which  the  assumptions  are  described  in
paragraphs 8, 11 and 12 of this Annex).  Details of the costs for some of
the programs are given at the end of this Annex.
4/ Estimated capital costs, including associated transmission costs,
excluding duties, taxes and interest, in constant mid-1983 price terms,
are as follows:   Mtera - US$100 million; Stiegler's Gorge Phase I -
US$760 million; Phase II - US$213 million.

14.       The evaluation of options that exclude gas generation plant shows
that Mtera is the least-cost option for the next increment of generation
capacity. Thereafter, a coal-fired steam generation plant located near to
proven coal reserves in the southwest of Tanzania would be an economic
proposition.   This plant  (Option E) would supply  the  load  centers  in
western Tanzania connected to the grid system (see Annexes 1 and 2) and it
may also be possible to transmit some power to eastern Tanzania along the
220 kV line from Mbeya to Dar-es-Salaam that will have already been
constructed.     The  evaluation  also  shows  that  the  Stiegler's  Gorge
hydroelectric site would be an economic option for development from the mid
1990s onwards. The equalising discount rates for some of these options are

The evaluation shows that in the basic case the Mtera hydroelectric scheme
is a lower cost option than gas turbine plants with gas costed at US$3.0
per thousand cubic feet. An oil-fired generation plant is not an economic
option to Mtera or gas turbine plant.   The economic attractiveness of the
Stiegler's Gorge project increases as its implementation date is delayed,
and by the year 2000 Stiegler's Gorge becomes attractive relative to
natural gas priced at US$3.0 per thousand cubic feet at 10 percent discount
rate.   The equalizing discount  rates for some of these options are as
follows:

1/ defined in table above.
The   evaluation   shows   that   options   that   include  natural  gas  are
significantly more attractive in economic terms than options that are based
on the absence of natural gas supplies for power generation (paragraphs 13
and 15).
16.        A key assumption in the above evaluation is that there would be
an alternative use for gas to power generation that has an economic value
equivalent to US$3.0 per thousand cubic feet of gas.   The sensitivity of
the evaluation to this assumption is shown below, in which gas-field future
capital and operating costs are charged to power, and gas consumed for
power generation is given zero opportunity cost. In the case that gas does
not have an economic alternative use to power generation, the economic
costs of proceeding with either Mtera or a natural gas plant as the next
increment of generating capacity are about equal.   Therefore,  this case
defines the break-even value of gas for power in comparison to the Mtera
project, which is equivalent to an average cost of gas for power of

US$1.32/MCF at 10% discount rate.   The inclusion of the sunk costs of the
Songo-Songo gas-field would add about US$110 million in present value terms
to the discounted cost of the natural gas option at 10 percent, which is
equivalent to about TSh 2200 million at the shadow exchange rate of TSh
20/US$1.0, and in this case the Mtera project would be clearly the
least-cost option.

1/  Gas-field capital and operatings costs are based on estimates made by consulting
engiLeers (Williams Bros.) for the &Sogo-Songo field (excluding sunk costs), with an
additional amual aLlcaance of US$7 mi11ion for expatriate mmsagement.
17.          The sensitivity of the above conclusions has been tested for
changes in assumptions from those used in the basic case concerning capital
costs of hydroelectric schemes, estimates of which are subject to greater
uncertainty than other cost estimates. The cases examined are capital cost
estimates for Mtera increased by 20 percent and for Stiegler's Gorge by 30
percent,  which  results  in  the  following  incremental  increases  in  the
present values of total costs discounted at 10 percent for those options
which include these schemes:
M4tera: +20% to capital costs--installed by 1988: +TSh  285 millions
--installed by 1990: +TSh  236 millions
--installed by 1993: +TSh  177 millions
Stiegler's Gorge: +30% to capital costs
--installed by 1995: +TSh 1812 millions
--installed by 2000: +TSh 1028 millions
With a capital cost increase of 20 percent,  Mtera would still be more
economic than an oil-fired power station or a natural gas station with gas
costed at US$3.0/MCF as the next increment in capacity in 1988 (paragraph
15).6/   A 20% increase in Mtera capital costs would raise the break-even
cost of gas for power relative to Mtera from 1.32 to 1.50 US$/MCF.   An
increase of the order of 30% in the capital cost of the Stiegler's Gorge
project  would  strengthen  the  economic  justification  for  delaying  its
implementation (paragraph 13).
6/   The present values of total costs for programs based on Mtera and
natural gas costed at US$3.0/MCF, with Mtera capital costs increased
by 20 percent, are as follows (TSh millions):
Option F:  Mtera (1988)/Natural Gas:            9084
Option G:  Nat. Gas/Mtera (1990)/Nat. Gas:  9251
Option H:  Nat. Gas/Mtera (1993)/Nat. Gas:  9506

18.        The sensitivity of the above conclusions has also been tested to
the value adopted for the shadow exchange  rate.   The results  of the
sensitivity analysis are given on page 10 of this Annex for shadow exchange
rates of 12.18, 20, and 30 Tanzanian shillings to one US dollar.   The
analysis shows that (a) the Mtera project remains more economic than an
oil-fired steam plant or a natural gas plant with gas valued at US$3.0/MCF
within this range; (b) the economic attractiveness of Mtera increases with
higher shadow exchange rates; (c) Mtera is more economic than a natural gas
plant with gas charged at gas-field capital and operating costs with
exchange rates above TSh 20/US$, and is less economic at lower exchange
rates.
