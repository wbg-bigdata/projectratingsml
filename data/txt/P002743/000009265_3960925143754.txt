HNMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Tanzania
Fourth Power Proiect (Credit 1405-TA)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Tanzania - Fourth Power
Project  (Credit  1405-TA)" prepared by  the Africa Regional Office.    No
contribution was received from the Borrower nor were comments requested from the
co-financiers.
The project achieved the primary objectives of increasing the
electricity generation capacity to meet the growth in electricity demand through
1990, and improving tdchnical operations and reliability of power generation and
distributitn facilities. Cost recovery, the enhancement of sector coordination
and tariff objectives were achieved to a lesser extent.
Cofinanciers contributed 702 of actual project cost, Tanzania
Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), the Government 8% and IDA 22%. Co-
lenders were RfW, NORAD, and SIDA, Kuwait Fund, Italy, IDA and the Borrower.
About 18% in project cost saving was achieved from the civil works procurement.
Procurement disputes among co-lenders and contractual difficulties
caused significant delays. A turbine supplier did not comply with the technical
specifications. Flaws in the design of the Mtera hydroelectric station required
the intervention of a Panel of Experts and remedial works by the contractor. The
design shortcomings will significantly reduce technical efficiency even after all
feasible remedies have been applied.
Overall, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory. Institutional
development is rated as partial since the skill base seems to have improved but
the project did not succeed in providing TANESCO with autonomy and independence
from the Government. Because of this and a mediocre financial performance so
far, the sustainability of project benefits is uncertain.
The PCR quality is satisfactory; it contains a frank account of the
unsatisfactory performance of imported consultant services and weak coordination
among co-lenders. An audit of the project is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOURT POWER PROJECT
(fDlT 1405-TA)
pREFAC:E
This is the Ptoject Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Power Project in Tanzania for which
IDA Credit 1405 - TA in the amount of SDR 32.5 million was approved on July 26, 1983. r:t Credit
was closed on December 31, 1991, 3 years and 6 months later than originally expected. Except ior SDR
0.58 million which was cancelled, the proceeds of the Credit were disbursed by May 17, 1991.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country Departnent
II and the Industry and Energy Operations Division of the Southern Africa Department VI of the Africa
Region (Prefice, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and  O). On Feb. 11, 1993, the Association sent Parts
I and Im to the Beneficiary with a request to prepare Part 11 by May 12, 1993, and their reply is awaited.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Association's final supervision mission of the
project in April 1992 and is based, inter alia. on information contained in the Issues/Decision Papers,
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), supervision reports, quarterly
progress reports, correspondence between the Association and the Borrower/Beneficiary, internal
memoranda and information gathered in Tanzania.

EV-ALUATION SUMMARY
1.    The primary objecive of the prtoect was to increase the electricity generation capacity in
Tanzama to meet the growth in power demand through 1990. Te project would also help to lay the
basis for improving the power sector instituions (para. 3.01).
Imgp2mempn ELxpernence
2.    Overall implement.ition of the project took eight years against the SAR estimate of 6 years and
two months, with a 18% cost underrun (due to high appraisal estimate and low bid price due to the
recession during this period, para. 6.05). The delay was due in part to the cumbersome coordination
effort between the beneficiary and the other co-financing agencies (France, Germany - KFW, Italy,
Norway -NORAD, Sweden - SIDA and Kuwait Fund) and slow award of the civil works contract. An
item of note was a design error by the design consultants in the calculation of the turbine elevation
causing cavitation damage to the turbine runners (para. 5.04). Correction of the problem will necessitate
construction of a sill downsream of the turbines discharge to the tailwater level at a cost of about
US$ 50,000 Cmn 1990 prices). With this measure, the loss of power plant productivity would be about
3 percent. It would also require shutting down of the power plant for the period of construction of the
sill, which is not possible at the present time because of extreme shortage of power due to draught
conditions in the country.
3.    The project succeeded in (a) augmenting the power generation capacity by constructing the least
cost solution within budget, (b) better equipping TANESCO to carry out more efficiently its role as the
national electric power supply utility, and (c) rehabilitation of hydro-electric and generating units (para.
6.01).
Sustanabiliqt
4.   'Me major benefit from the project is the availability of additional electric power to an extensive
area of Tanzania covered by an interconnected grid. The added power supply is helping to enhance
industrial production and the standard of living mainly in urban areas. This benefit of the project will
endure for the investment's useful life of about 40 years provided the operations and maintenance
expenditures are kept at proper levels. This in turn depends to a large extent on the level of tariffs
applied during the life of the project and the ability of TANESCO to collect the revenues for services
rendered.



iii
To fiirer improve the benefits TANESCO and the Governm   need to focus on continued
instdonal development of TANESCO and its taiff policy and better financial performance through
impwved bflling and coUection (paras. 7.01 to 7.03).
F _nuan La=LM
5.    The project experience provides the following main lessons:
(a)   befoe appraisal of hydro-electic projects of the nature of Mtera, the Association in
addition to saisfying itself that the desig4 has been done by competet consultants,
should have their work reviewed by a panel of idepene  experts. It would be
desirable to have this panel of  pets involved in the project as soon as the feasibility
sudy is completed (para. 8.03);
(b)   for projects involving complex funding arrangements with the participation of several
donors, the Association should insist on an appropriate mechanism to settle disagreements
between donors and between the Borrower and donors and for timely disbursement (para.
8.02);
(c)   the need for thorough review of bid documents by Bank Staff and/ or independent experts
knowledgeable not only on hydro-electric project contracting but also on Bank's
procurement guidelines and Sample Bidding Documents. Particular attention should be
given to crteria for responsiveness and bid evaluation in the bid documents. Additional
attention should be given to payment clauses in contracts for civil works to ensure that
stpulated payments can be realistically met, particularly if a numnber of donors are
funding a single contract (para. 8.03); and
(d)   targets for financial improvement should be realistic by basing them on a thorough review
of the likelihood of the beneficiary acwally being able to achieve the proposed goals, and
this should be discussed in the lssuesJDecision Papers and the SAR (paras. 5.12, 5.13
and 8.04).

Sector:            Infrastruchtre
Subsector:         Power
2.    Project Background
2.1   The Association has supported the development of the power sector in Tanzania since 1969 with
5 loans and 4 credits of over US$ 160 million. This represents about 25% of the power sector's total
investment in its facilities. The total financing requirement for the Fourth Power project which is the
subject of this Project Completion Report was estimated at US$ 234.7 million including US$ 37.6 million
interest during construction. The Associadon contributed US$ 35 million and six other donors US$ 124
million.
2.2    During the project's implementation, regulation of the electric power sector has been the
responsibility of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals (MWEM), which is in charge of
formulating national policy for the sector. Within MWEM, power sector matters are dealt with by the
Energy Department, which oversees TANESCO, the sole electric power utility in Tanzania.The
beneficiary, TANESCO, was established in 1931 as one of several private power companies opeati
in what is presently Tanzania. It was bought by the Government in 1964 and established as a state-owned
autonomous national power utility the same year. Since then, TANESCO has been the sole utility
responsible or power generation, transmission and distribution to the public. Currenty it supplies about
95% of the electric power consumed in the Country with the balance self-generated by parastaa and
private organizations. Decisions concerning implementation of major investments by TANESCO, as well
as semi-annual tariff increases above 15%, rest with MWEM prior to submission to the CabineL
Although TANESCO is intended to operate as an autonomous corporadon, its autonomy is limited.
2.3 In broad terms, the role of the Association in supporting Tanzania's power sector has been to
guide the development of the power sector along least-cost criteria. This objective has been achieved
through a succession of loan and credits (in close cooperation with other lenders and donors) and throug
studies and technical assistance to TANESCO in order to enhance its planning capability. Concurrently,
the Association has been instrumena in the institutional strengthening of TANESCO through substantial
training support to develop the skills needed by Tanzanian perso  to properly manage the utility and
operate its facilities.

2.4   TANESCO's market enwompasses the whole of Tania, although only part of the country is
supplied from an Interconnected system. Areas too distant to be supplied from this gid are provided with
electric service by 20 separate diesel-electic stations. The effective generating capacity connected to the
grid is presendy about 300 MW. At the time the Fourth Project was under consideration the available
generating capacity in the grid was around 195 MW, and peak demand around 180 MW. Including
Zanzibar and expansion of the grid to NW and SW zones it was forecast at appraisd that load demand
would grow at an average of 10% per year, from 860 Gwh in 1983 to 1,700 Gwh in 1990. In fact load
demand growth has been slightly slower (9% per year) reaching 1,565 Gwb in 1990. In the same period,
peak demand has increased from 181 MW in 1983 to 264 MW in 1990, while in th SAR, peak demand
was forecast to reach 300 MW that same year.
3.           QWe&t Jbnves ad Compnt
3.01  T'ohObjAdw: Ine main proJect objectives were:
(a)   to increase the availability of electic power to meet the ibrecast growth in demand by
1990 by making good use of the available hydraulic head downstream of an existing large
reservoir;
(b)   to help improve power sector coordination, tariff policy, power system control and load
dispatching practices;
(c)   to maintain and improve TANESCO's operations through traiing and management
programs;
(d)   to assist TANESCO in system development through a study of long term power
development and rehabilitation of existing generating plants and distribution systems; and
(e)   to improve the reliability and efficiency of the existing generating plants and distribution
systems.
3.02  EPje  Comnen: The Mtera project was to be an integral part of a cascade system on the
Great Ruaha River comprising both the existing 200 MW Kidatu power plant and Mtera. IThe
powerhouse was to be located underground near the existing Mtera dam, which had been completed in
late 1980 as part of the Kidatu Hydroelectric Project Stage n to enable TANESCO to utilize the power
from Mtera. The project included:
(a)   construction of a water intake at the existing Mtera reservoir; a headrace tunnel and a
vertical penstock shaft leading to an underground powerhouse with two 40 MW
turbinegenerator units; a tailrace tunnel (about 10.5 km long); an outdoor switchyard;
and administration building and TANESCO staff houses at Mtera;
(b)   rehabilitation of the existing Ubungo diesel station and other power facilities;
(c)   construction of a system control center at Dar es Salaam;
(d)   training of TANESCO's engineers and managerial staff; and
(e)   consultancy services for construction supervision and for studies on tariffs, long-rage
power developments, power sector organization and management system of TANESCO.



4.    *a=Desiggn and gQr andn Q
4.01   At the time the SAR was prepared the detailed desigs and bid documents for the Mtera
component of the project were under preparation and well advanced. The prain of these documents
had been entrusted to the same consultants who had prepared the feasibity sudy. TANESCO (under
SIDA financing) had signed a separate contract with the same consultants for the consuction supervision.
In addition TANESCO (under IDA financwig) employed a part-time Panel of Experts (POE) to monitor
the work on Mtera and to advise in the event of unforeseen problems arising during project construction.
TANESCO (also under IDA financing) employed two full-time experts to assist in the construction
sprvision of the project, one of whom - the Project Advisor - stayed unt the end of 1991, wll after
plant coissioning, to assist TANESCO in civil works claims. TANESCO also employed consultants
to carry out studies on organization structure, tariffs, long range development and for the rehabilitation
of its generion and distributi3n facilities.
4.02 Due to the complex finding arrangements for the project (six co-financiers), procurement for adl
items of the project, except the civil works, was through procurement in accordance with the origin of
the fimding source for each particular item. Civil works for Mtera were to be procured though
international competitive bidding.
4.03  Eursmcat. Tne procurement for the various items of the project was organized as follows:
(a)   procurement for the civil works of the Mtera hydro-power plant, including the headrace
and tirace tuns, the itake, the underground powerhouse and the admintrati on
building was to be done through international competitive bidding procedures acceptable
to the joint financiers, which were in accordance with the Associatio guidelines;
(b)   all goods were to be grouped in appropriate contract packages and procured in
accordance with the guidelines of the particular financing agency who would finance the
item - in effect reserved procuement;
(c)-  rehabilitation works would be  entialy proprietary prcrement; and
(d)   consultants for all studies (to be financed by IDA) were to be selected in accordance with
the Association guidelines on the use of consultants by Assochtion borrowers.
4.04  Ten bids were received for the civil works contrat and the Consultants recomended the award
to a contractor from Sweden. TANESCO recommended the award to a contactor from Italy and the
Association was in agreement with TANESCO'S recoendation. The Kuwaiti Fund and Gerny also
concurred with this view. However, SIDA and NORAD disagreed with TANESCO's recommendation
and wanted the award to be in favor of a Swedish contractor or resort to rebidding as an alternate
measure. Ihere were protracted negoiations between the borrower and the co-finacierr 'nd ulmately
after eight months it was decided that TANESCO would negotiate with the Italian contractor regarding
the award of contrac. Part of this delay was to be made good by compressing the construction period
by 4 monfts, for which the contractor agreed to receive Tsh 16.5 million as fdll compensation to be paid
in addition to its bid amoun. This compression of the work schedule was to be used later on by the
contaor as one of its rationales to support claims against TANESCO (para. 5.01). Consequent to
TANESCO's award of contract to the Italian concor, SIDA and NORAD cancelled their financial
support to the civil works conract. The Italian Government ageed to cover this finacing gap.



-4-
5.    hoect lLmentation
5.01   The project was originally scheduled to be completed in June 1988 after about a 6 year
implementation perioo. At the outset the project effectiveness was delayed by seven montbs due- to
additional dmt   required to resolve a procurement problem amongst co-financiers and revision of the
financing plan. Agreements between the borrower and the vaious co-financiers were cross-effectiveness
conditions. Ile delays in making the IDA and the other co-financiers' credits effectve, were detrimental
to the project implementation, inter alia, because of additional payment of interest penalties to the Civil
Works Contractor consequent to delay in payment of advance provided for in the contract, Coordinating
disbursements from the co-financiers of the civil works contract (KfW, Kuwait Fund, SIDA, NORAD
and IDA) - and for that matter disbursement from co-financiers fcor all other items of the project -
proved to be a difficult endeavor. A proposed "Memorandum of Understanding" between the co-
financiers designed to provide a handle on this matter, was never subscribed to and TANESCO was left
on Its own to try to coax disbursements from the various agencies involved in financing the project. It
also strained the relations between TANESCO and the Contractor and claims for large amounts have still
not been settled (para. 4.04).
5.02   IhelMera Hydropower Station Comoonen. The construction work of the power plant went
ahead without major difficulties except near the outlet of the tailrace tunnel, where the rock along the
original aligmnent proved too unstable, forcing a realignment of this portion of the tunnel. The basic
cause for this difficulty was insufficient field investigations coupled with erroneous geological
interpretation. Notwithstanding this problem, which was solved with the assistance of the Panel of
Experts, the construction was done in a workmanlike way and the quality of workmanship was excellent
troughout. However, the contractor made numerous clains, a few of which were amicably setded. The
outstanding amount of the claims, which were rejected by TANESCO, totalled US$ 54 million plus
interest and consequenti damages (in total possibly well over the original contract amount). This claim
was referred to arbitration by the contractor but was subsequendy withdrawn.
5.03 Actual completion of construction on December 1, 1988 was on schedule according to contract
program. Trial runs for the first unit on May 1, 1988 and for the second unit on August 1, 1988 were
also on schedule. Commissioning of the first urnt was completed on June 1, 1988 about six months later
than anticipated in the SAR. The commissioning of the second unit could only be completed in October
31, 1988 (five mnonths lat) because of damage suffered by the genemtor at start up.
5.04 After only 2000 hours of operation the turbine runner in unit No. 1 presented extensive cavitation
damage. According to the manuacturers, the problem was caused by the tailwater level being too low,
i.e., below the specified elevation of 595 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) so that the minimum
submergence of the turbine runner would be not less than 4 meter since the center line of the unner
would be set at elevation 591 m.a.s.l. Apparendy, the lower than anticipated tailwater level was due to
a misjudgment by the Consultant on the value of the coefficient of friction for the flow in the tunnd. The
Consultant had used a Manning's 'n* value of 0.035 while the actal value was better than assumed. In
fact during the field visit to Mtera in connection with the preparation of this PCR, and using actual flow
data, an 'n' value of 0.0298 was computed. This better coefficient of frction might be due to the
excellent smooth-blasting technique used by the contractor in driving the tailrace tunnel. However,
calculation done during the above field visit indicated that the bare minimum submergence needed to
avoid cavitation is 8 meters and not 5 meters as designed by the Consutant. This fact was also
recognized by a distinguished specialist in hydraulics who was consulted by TANESCO. His
recommendation (based on the consultant's original suggestion subsequendy withdrawn) was to build a
sill just afte the outlet of the draft tube- with cret level at elevation 592.78 m.a.s.l (height about 2.80
meters), to increase submergence. The independent consultant also concluded that e cener line of
runner should have been set at elevation 587 m.a.s.l. some 4 meters lower than the actual setting of 591



m.a.s.l. to minimize cavitation effects. This would have given a safe 9 meters submergence for the
turbine rnmer. In other words, based on the available documentation, the Consultant made a basic error
In designing the power house arrangement.
5.05 Construction of the s8il has not yet started because TANESCO cannot afford additional load
shedding resulting from stoppage of Mtera for construction of the sill. While the reason for the very
heavy deterioration of the turbine runners was being sought, the turbine supplier experimented with
reshaping the runner's buckets in model testing and there was some improvement in the cavitation
phenomenon due to this. The concrete sill at the tallwater tumnel entrance (estimated to cost USS 500,000
in 1990 prices, and requiring a construction period of about 2 - 3 months) Is still needed. While it would
stop the cavitation, it would result in a permanent loss of hydraulic head. The reduction in average
output is estimated at about 3 percent.
5.06 When examining the problem with the turbines it was found the turbine supplier had not complied
with the technical specification in its supply contract concerning the performance of model tests for
cavitation; model tests for which it was paid. According to this contractual stipulation the model tests
were to be carried out in an independent laboratory and on a model turbine runner having a throat
diameter of not less than 330 mm. Neither of these stipulations was complied with, i.e. the diameter of
the model runner was 300 mm (against 330 mm) and the model tests were done in the turbine supplier's
own laboratory. Nevertheless, the Consultant had certified payment to the turbine supplier for the model
test as if they had been done in accordance to specifications. Faced with the seriousness of the problem
TANESCO agreed to pay for an additional modified turbine runner, in order to permit modification of
the runner in unit No. 1, which would later replace the runner in unit No 2. In addition TANESCO
agreed to furiher payments to the Consultant for their professional services in connection with the
provision of the new runner and reshaping of the existing runners. These actions by which the owner
ended up paying for errors committed by the Engineer and for work improperly done by the Supplier
raise serious questions about proper conduct of affairs. It should be noted that the payments by
TANESCO were financed by grants from NORAD and SIDA and the Association was only informed
about these arrangements after the agreements between TANESCO, NORAD and SIDA had been
concluded. The Association could therefore not intercede in this questionable project financing, although
it expressed its concern when the facts became known.
5.07  The Power System Control Center Comonent. The supply and erection of the power system
control center at Ubungo as well as the remote terminal units (RTUs) at substations in the Grid was
completed in June 1989, about three months later than contracted. The control center is well adapted to
TANESCO's needs although some problems developed initially, which were corrected later.
5.08 The Rehabilitation Component. Two major rehabilitation works were included in the project
scope: (i) refitting of the turbines of units No.I and 2 at the Kidatu Hydropower Plant; and (ii)
refurbishment of the diesel-electric units at the Ubungo Thermal Power Station in Dar-es-Salaam. The
refitting of the two turbines was successfully completed in early 1989. Rehabilitation of the Ubungo
Mirless Blackstone diesel-electric sets (3 x 4.4 MW) was completed in early 1991, including the
installation of a new cooling tower. Concerning the five Pielstick diesel-electric units at Ubungo, two
7.5 MW units and one of the 3 x 6.1 MW units are being refurbished under a French Technical
co-operation program at a cost of US$ 12.5 million. The rehabilitation task should be completed in the
second half of 1992. The other two 6.1 MW units are considered scrap. The major problem encountered
in this work was a foundation crack on one of the units which required reconditioning of the top part of
the base frame structure.
5.09  .Tndnig      A      mXThe Training Component was successfully completed by TANESCO in
late 1989. The program involved the placement of 53 staff in foreign isitutons for courses lasting up



-6-
to three years for technicians and from 2 to 12 months for higher-level staff. TANESCO has greatly
benefited from the much better performmce of these personnel.

The rehabilitation study prepared by EPD (UK) has been the basis for the Power Rehabilitation Project
(IDA Credit I687-TA) now nearing completion, while the Long Range Development Study carried out
by ACRES (Canada) established that the Kihansi Hydroelectric Scheme should be the next step in the
least-cost expansion program to meet the forecast demand for electricity beyond 1997. The Association
approved an IDA Credit (2330-TA) for US$ 10 million to finance the neceary design studies on this
scheme. The Management Study formed the basis for the reorganization of TANESCO, as prsently
structured.
S.1 1  Enviromnental Issues. The enviromental impact of the Mtera project was dealt with in the SAR
by stating that no adverse effects had been observed by the damming of the Great Ruaha River at Mtera
and that the Mtera hydro-power project would be entirely undeground. There were no permanent
settlements on the stretch of river between the dam and the outdet of the tailrace tunnel, and a minimum
flow of 1.0 cumec required by the Government's 'Grant of Water Right Certificate' was maintained at
all times. Furither, the SAR indicated that implementation of the recomnendations contained in detaied
studies of all environmental aspects done between 1972 and 1978 on the Mtera dam had been reviewed
in the PCR for Loan 1306-TA for the Second Stage of the Kidatu Project. ITese recommendations
included: (a) the establishment of health programs and of a nature reserve, and (b) Government program
for tapping the potential minimum yield of 3,000 tons per year of fish from the Mtera reservoir. It was
found that these recommendations had been ssfactorily implemented.
5.12   &Iw     _ PerformanceIThe original financial covenants in the Project Agreement included, in
addition to financial statements and audits requirements:
- the aggregat amount due TANESCO at the end of each month to be less than the sum of the
amounts charged or to be charged by TANESCO for electricity supplied to its customers during
the sixty days immediately precedig the date (Section 3.07 (a));

requirements (Section 4.03);
- TANESCO to increase its tariff by 20% no later than January 1, 1984 and to take measures so
that funds from internal sources shall be produced equivalent to n less than 25% of the annal
average capital expenditures in CY1985 and CY1986. and no less than 40% in each fiscal year

TANESCO's financial performance was adversely affected by the difficut economic conditons during
the above period. Ihe devauation of the Tsh from 12.2 to the US$ in June 1984 to about Tsh 200 to
the US$ at the time the project was completed in early 1991 had a serious impact on the company's
finances and ability to service its debt. About 90% of TANESCO's capital investments were financed
by foreign loans mostly on lent by the Government but also by some direct loans to the company. Also
high accounts receivable have been a chronic problem and cotntbuted to the tight cash position that has
affected TANESCO. Consequendy, TANESCO was not able to generate internally sufficient funds to
pay debt service when due and to finance a reasonable portion of its capital investments after operating
expenses had been met, in spite of regular tariff increases. In 1988, TANESCO and the Governmnent
embarked on a financial restucturing of the company which comprised mainly of: Oi rescheduling of
loans on-ent by the Government; (ii) rescheduling and converting into equity some of the overdue debt
service to the Governmet; (ii) implementing a 45% tariff increase in mid-1988 with semiannual tariff
increases of 15% thrafter; and (iv) converting into equity some of the grants originally received by the
Government from foreign donors but on-lent to TANESCO. The implementation of the financial
restructuring package has led to improvements over the past couple of years. However, billing and
collection remain a particdularly troublesome area in TANESCO in spite of various attempts to corract the
problem. New   ounti  procedues to be fully computerized and a new computerized billirg system
are in the process of being implemented with the assistance of a team of experts financed. under the
recently approved Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Cr. 2330-TA. The new accounting and
billing sym   are expected to eliminate many of the present manual processed which are at the base of
the delay and inaccuracies plaguing the system.

6. ErQiec Reults
6.01   The project achieved its main objective, which was to develop the hydraulic head downstream
of the Mtera dam for electric power production, although the turbine cavitation problem has still to be
dealt with. Both the training component and the studies component also achieved their objectives, which
were essentially to better equip TANESCO to cary out efficiently its role as the national electric power
supply utility, and to establish the least-cost pattern of expanding elec&ticity supply in Tanzania. The
rehabilitation objective has been partially met by the refurbishing of the turbines at Kidatu Stage I and
of the MirJess Blackstone diesel-electric sets at Ubungo. Yet another objective achieved was the setting
up of a modern power control center at Ubungo, which with proper additions should enable TANESCO
to have adequate control of the grd operation. All in all, the results of the project can be considered
satisfactory and having fWlfilled the SAR expectations except concerning TANESCO's finances.
6.02 Although TANESCO has a number of capable and dedicated managers and staff, it suffers from
a shortage of middle level staff and still has a very large work force of 6,400 which gives a ratio of only
28 connections per employee, a very poor ratio. One of the reason is the high number of small power
stations (mainly diesel), which require numerous employees.
6.03 'he recomputed internal economic rate of return is 12.4% compared with 10.1% computed at
appraisal (See Part Hol.
6.04 Timetable and Costs. Overall implementation of the Fourth Power Project took 8 years from
September 1983 to April 1991 (over two years more than anticipated). This excludes the rehabilitation
of the Pielstick diesel-electric sets at Ubungo and the construction of the tailwater sill at Mtera. The basic
reasons for the considerable time overrun were: (a) the cumbersome financing arrangements; and (b) the
protracted award of the civil works contract. Notwithstanding the problems that arose during
implementation of the project, the time schedule of 6 years estimated at appraisal seems to have been
somewhat optimistic. In fact, the Bank's typical implementation profile for similar projects runs between
7 and 9 years.
6.05   The final cost of the project at December 31, 1991, including the construction of the tailwater
sill at Mtera and the rehabilitation of the Pielstick diesel sets at Ubungo which are still to be completed,
is equivalent to US$ 160.7 million compared to US$ 197.1 million estimated in the SAR. Ihe basic
reason for the large reduction in project cost was due to lower than expected price obtained for the civil
works contract for the Mtera hydro-plant. It could be argued that the cost of the Mtera component was
considerably overestimated, even after the SAR had reduced the Consultant's cost estimate. A summary
comparison of the original project cost estimate with the actual project expenditures per major item of
the project is given in Part m.
7. Er-ect Sustainabilitv
7.01   The major benefit realized from the project is the badly needed additional supply of electric power
to an exension of Tanzania covered by the interconnected system. The added supply is helping to
enhance the industrial production and the standard of living of a large proportion of the urban population
in the area served by the inter connected grid. This benefit will endure for all the useful life of the Mtera
project, which would be about 40 years.
7.02   The second benefit is the revenue income from the sale of electricity produced at Mtera. Of
course, this benefit depends on the level of power tariffs applied during the life of the project and the
ability of TANESCO to collect the revenues for services rendered.



-9-
7.03 To ensure the projecta's sustainability TANESCO and the Govenmment need to focus on continued
institutional development of TANESCO and its tariffs policy, proper maintenance of the power plant, and
better financial performance through improved billing and collecion (paras. 5.12 and 5.13).
S. Association Performance
8.01   The main project objective of supporting TANESCO's effort to expand the availability of
electricity in the grid, was an integral part of the Association's strategy of using the Association resources
to meet Tanzaniaes most pressing development needs. The Association played throughout the project
implementation a discreet but vital role in trying to ensure that the project management was efficient
though it was not always successfl (para.5.06).
8.02 The Association planned less than adequately for managing the complex financing arrangements
devised for the project. The financing gap created as a result of donor's withdrawal in financing the civil
works was a big factor in delayed payments to the civil works contractor resulting in major claims by the
contaor. In hindsight, the Association could have entered into some form of agreement with
cofinanciers to ensure the smooth implementation of the project including agreeing on a procedure to
settle disagreements between cofinanciers and between the Borrower and the cofinanciers. The failure
to address properly the consequences of the project financing set up, was undoubtedly at the root of the
problems that later developed between the civil works' contractor and TANESCO.
8.03  The Association fUiled to ensure that the design work prepared by the consultant was properly
reviewed, particularly the bid documents. 'his was ;he main cause of the problems encountered at award
time, as well as of difficulties with the Contractor during construction of Mtera. There is no doubt that
a more careful review of the consultant's work would have spotted the insufficiency of the site
investigations in the downstream portion of the tailrace tunnel that forced the change in its alignment
(para. 5.02).
8.04 In hindsight, the objectives set in the Project Agreement concerning financial performance may
have been too optimistic to be attained (paras.5.12 and 5.13). The Association's supervision mission
reports reflect concern about TANESCO's financial situation throughout, and show that the Association
proposed naw schemes to bring TANESCO to finacial health. But there was no progress in the direction
of a greater degree of autonomy or the conversion of TANESCO into a private corporation; TANESCO
remained too tightly tied to Government, and was as such subject to Government's bureaucratic
inefficiency and interference.
9. Borrower ' s Perfrmance
9.01 At project appraisal, TANESCO had made remarkable progress towards developing a rational
power system in the eastern and north-western parts of Tanzania. In addition to providing additional
power it had interconnected these regions and replaced power generation mainly from thermal power
plants with energy generated by a more economic hydro-electric facility at Kidatu. TANESCO
management staff were dedicated and performed capably in spite of the constraints discussed in this
report. TANESCO's performance can be considered truly exemplary when aking into account the
institutional and economic environment under which it operated and also considering the fact that it
received little help from the Government when serious problems arose.
9.02  In several areas, TANESCO did not comply with the Credit covets (para 5.13). It should
be stressed however, that TANESCO received little help from Government wbich was itself faced with
the deteriorating economic situation of the country. These faflings therefor, should not be ascribed to
TANESCO but to the general inefficient system in which it had tOD operate. Statements of good intentions



- 10-
were rarely followed by effective govemment actions. A paticularly vexing problem is the aras of
payments to TANESCO by government and partal entities, which still represent a sizeable porion
of overdue payments for lc.taricity bled.
IO. Proeet Rglatiobsip
10.01 The Association received very close cooperation from TANESCO during project preparation and
appraisal. A cooperative attitude which was established since 1969 continued all dtough the project
cycle. It helped to resolve many complications dtat onnally occur during projects of this nature. The
Association's relations with the other financiers were good with the possible exception of SIDA and
NORAD in the earier years. TMe Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) stopped
disouement during project implemention. The Association disbursed the amounts due to KFAED on
the undetanding that the latter will refund this amount to the Association upon settlement of ounding
issues with Tanznia. The refund of US$ 2.9 million materialized in June 1992 after nealy two years
of delay.
II. Consulti  Sendce Perbnance
11.01 The performance of the consultant for the Mtera hydro-power component of the project was
unsatisfactory. The bid documents prepared by the consultants lacked clarity, resulting in different
nterpretations during the bid evaluation stage. The difficulties encountered during excavation of the
downstem portion of the tailrace tunnel were due to the fact that the consultant had not done a ihorough
job in carrying out the sie investigations nor In their intepreion. 'his was not only eviden in the
need to abandon a portion of the lined tunmel and align the lower stretch of the tailrace tunnel, but also
in the consultant's failure to foresee the larW inflow of water which ensues from the dolerite dikes
crossing the tunnel path. Not only had large extra payments to be made to the contractor for the
abandoned portion of the tunnel and for additional pumping of this water flow into the tunnel, but this
-isasseasment of the hydro-geology was the basis for one of the claims lodged against TANESCO by the
contractor.
11.02 When the caiation problem in the turbines appeared, the consultant claimed that the lower
tailwater level was due to overbreak in the tunnel excavation. A review of the technical specifications
in the civil works contact reveals that there was no provision for a limit in overbreak as is :iormally
stipulated in such type of works, nor was there a provision for the contactor to refill with concrete any
excess in overbreak. According to information obtained during the preparation of this report, the
contractor did an excellent job in driving the tunnel using smoohblasting technique with minimal or no
overbreak at all. It appears that the consultant misjudged the value of the coefficient of friction in the
tailwater tnel (para.5.04). But the basic reason for the cavitadon problem has been identified as a
design error in the setting of the turbine runner elevation for which the consultant was responsible.
Although the turbine supplier had not complied with the technical specification for model tests for
cavitaion, the consultant certfied payment for the tests (pra. 5.06). The construction of the sill would
correct the caviaion problem but it entails a sacrifice in power generation becaue of the pemnn loss
of hydrdic head.
11.03 The Panel of Experts performed satisfactorily in helping to resolve some of the constuction
problems that arose during implementation of Mtera, particularly regarding the re-routing of the tailrace
tel through the meta-sedimentary rocks. The Project Advisor assigned to TANESCO performed
sadsfactorily, and was instrumenta in guiding TANESCO staff in the direction of proper management
and effecdve project implementation.

5.1   The SAR evaluated the inta economic rat of return (ERR) as the discount rate at which the
present value of capital outlays and operating costs of the Mtera Projec equals the present value of th
incren_tal benefits from the project measured by value of production according to average tariff yield.
In the SAR the TERR was estimated at 10.1 percem.
5.2  In tbsPCR a similar approach to tat used in de SAR has been used in the re-estimation of the
MIRR, using the following parameters:
(a)    The cost stream indludes:
() the capital cost in US$ of the project deflated to mid-1983 and
(O) the operating  apenses for Mtera.
(b)    The beneft stream comprises the revenues from electricity sales at the early 1992 tariff
deflated to mid-1983. In order to compute these benefits the average anmnal generation at
Mtera esmated origiAly at 350 Gwh per year has been reduced by 3 percent to take into
account the loss in hydraulic head caused by the sUIl in the tailwater tunel. From the
resulting figure system losses of 12 percent have been deducted (Current system losses in
TANESCO's interconnected system are aound 20 percent, but this includes non-technical
losses (mainly theft) which are not an economic loss but a finacial loss).
On the basis set forth above the D3RI is re-omputed to be 12.4 percent.
