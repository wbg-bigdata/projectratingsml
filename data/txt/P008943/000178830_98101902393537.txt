THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrower           :     Republic of Turkey
Loan Amount              US$304.5 million equivalent in various currencies
(including the capitalized front-end fee).
Terms              :     17 years including 4 years grace, with interest at
11.6 percent.
Description        :     The loan would be in further support of Turkey's
stabilization and structural adjustment program
initiated in January 1980, and designed to restore
sustainable growth. This program provided the basis
for the $200 million Structural Adjustment Loan I
(No. 1818-TU), its $75 million Supplement
(No. 1915-TU), and the $300 million Structural
Adjustment Loan II (No. 1987-TU). The measures which
provide the basis for this new loan are in the areas
of:
(a) macroeconomic policies--domestic resource
mobilization, export promotion, import
liberalization, medium-term framework;
(b) rationalization of public investment;
(c) reform of the State Economic Enterprises; and
(d) policies in the agriculture and energy
sectors.
The loan would finance all imports, except for
items financed by other sources and luxury,
military or paramilitary items and nuclear
reactors.
The main risks relate to external uncertainties
A                                         facing the growth of trade, and internal
developments which might impede the Government's
determination to carry out the policy reforms
designed to restore domestic and external
financial equilibrium, rationalize investment and
carry out SEE reform.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Third
Structural Adjustment Loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of
US$304.5 million to support the Government's program of structural reforms
designed to restore financial equilibrium and achieve sustainable growth. The
loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at 11.6 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The last economic report entitled "Turkey:  Policies and Prospects
for Growth" (No. 2657a-TU) and the Postscript thereto, were distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1979 and March 1980 respectively. Updating of
economic prospects as well as in depth economic analysis and dialogue has
since been undertaken through the continuing work on structural adjustment
loans (SALs) to Turkey, and two special economic missions. The report of the
special economic mission in November/December 1980 to evaluate the investment
program and entitled "Turkey: Public Sector Investment Review" (No. 3472-TU)
was distributed to the Executive Directors in December 1981. The report of
another special economic mission in May/June 1981 to review Turkey's
industrialization and trade strategy, entitled "Turkey: Industrialization and
Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU), was distributed to the Executive Directors in
March 1982. This report contains several Annexes, which are listed in the
Table of Contents.
3.       Turkey is about as big as France and Germany combined, with an
estimated GNP per capita of $1,460 in 1980. With a population of around
45 million, the density is low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land),
although the rate of urbanization is high (about 45 percent). Population
growth is below the median for middle-income countries (2.2 percent per
annum). But the employment situation has deteriorated steadily, with an
unemployment rate currently about 16 percent, despite rapid economic growth in
the mid-70s and substantial emigration of workers to Western Europe and, more
recently, to the Middle East.  There is little or no absolute poverty, but
income distribution is still relatively skewed. Data for more recent periods
is incomplete, but indicates a worsening, especially of the position of wage
and salary earners over the last few years, with a sharp real decline in the
minimum wage. There are also considerable regional differences, and large
rural-urban disparities. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but
the rate of adult literacy remains relatively low (60 percent in 1975).
4.       Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy. It
contributes 23 percent of GDP (1980), employs about 55 percent of the labor
force, and provides about half of merchandise exports. Turkey is one of the
very few developing countries which is self-sufficient in food.



-2-
Turkish agriculture is dualistic: a modern irrigated sector produces cash
crops and most exports; a traditional rainfed agricultural sector emphasizes
grains and livestock mainly on the Anatolian plateau where only a small part
of the irrigation potential has been developed, despite considerable
investment. Turkey has a large potential for expanding agricultural
production and exports, but it faces major constraints like small and
fragmented farm holdings, inadequate research and extension services,
insufficient credit, and poor utilization of irrigated areas.
5.       The major emphasis of the past development strategy has been on rapid
industrialization. Thus, in the 1970s industry absorbed up to 30 percent of
total investment and today accounts for 19 percent of GDP and 48 percent of
exports (mainly textiles, processed foods and leather products), but only
14 percent of employment. The private sector is dominant in exports and
accounts for some 60 percent of industrial value-added. Industrial policy has
sought to achieve self-sufficiency through import substitution, while exports
have generally been given a secondary role. The principal policy instruments
have been large public investments in State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), and
high levels of protection for private investment.  These policies yielded high
growth rates and domestic production of some key basic and intermediate
goods. But they also resulted in the establishment of uncompetitive
industries, wasteful of capital and other inputs and with limited export
possibilities. Many manufacturing SEEs are characterized by inefficiency and
high dependence on imported inputs.
6.       Turkey has large underdeveloped energy resources (hydropower and
lignite), but little petroleum. Energy consumption has grown in line with
GDP, but remains below the per capita average for middle-income developing
countries. Oil imports account for over 85 percent of oil consumption and
cost $3.6 billion in 1980, equivalent to 122 percent of exports. Hence, the
energy situation has become a major preoccupation of the Government. Prices
for most products--especially petroleum products--have been brought into line
with international prices since 1980. Investments in energy have the largest
share in the public investment program. The principal sector issues include
institutional constraints, insufficient resources for exploration, poor
project implementation capacity and the lack of comprehensive demand
management.
7.       The economic policies pursued during the seventies led to rapid
economic growth, especially in industry, until the mid-1970s.  By then the
incipient problems were greatly aggravated by the rise in the cost of oil and
other imports which led to a sharp deterioration in Turkey's terms of trade.
The response was inappropriate--continued expansionary policies and
capital-intensive import-substituting investment, based mainly on external
borrowing, much of it short-term. By 1977 the budget deficit, as a percentage
of GDP, had increased to over 6 percent, external indebtedness to
$11.0 billion, of which 56 percent was short-term, and inflation to
25 percent. During the crisis which followed, economic management'remained
weak. It was not until January 1980 that the Government launched a policy of
structural adjustment towards a greater reliance on market forces and an
outward orientation.

8.       Following a period of sustained unrest, terrorism and deterioration
of the parliamentary process, the military assumed power in September 1980.
The new government, like previous military regimes in 1960-61 and 1971-73, has
emphasized its commitment to restore civilian rule, set for 1984, following
the adoption of a new constitution. A Consultative Assembly has been set up
to draft the constitution. It is also empowered to debate issues and
legislation submitted to it at the discretion of the government. The
Assembly's powers are limited but it is playing an increasingly important role
in economic affairs, especially with respect to the reform of SEEs (see
para. 71 below) and the budgetary process.
PART II - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
Introduction
9.       The Government's program for restructuring the Turkish economy,
initiated in January 1980, is now entering its third year. The original
objectives set out in January 1980 included a reduction in the rate of
inflation, an increase in foreign exchange inflows, improved domestic resource
mobilization through greater public sector efficiency and increased private
savings, a more rational public investment program, and better external debt
management. The program, and SAL I which supported it, aimed at stabilizing a
crisis situation through a series of urgent measures designed to correct
serious external and domestic imbalances. By 1981, the Government had evolved
a more comprehensive set of adjustment policies with more clearly defined
actions with basically the same objectives. These were set out in the
Government's Statement of Development Policies dated February 20, 1981, and
were described in the President's Report for SAL II (No. P-3034-TU dated
April 20, 1981).
10.      The adjustment program is designed to restore balance to the economy
and achieve sustainable growth over the medium-term. The program includes:
(a) the adoption of a realistic and flexible exchange rate;
(b) incentives to encourage producers to export;
(c) tight monetary conditions to restrain domestic demand;
(d) deregulation of interest rates to reflect market conditions and
encourage private savings;
(e) the strengthening of public finances through tax reform;
(f)  improved external debt management policies and information
systems;
(g) steps to improve institutional efficiency in key sectors;
(h) a rationalization of the public investment program; and
(i) the initiation of reforms of the SEEs designed to reduce their
burden on the budget and improve their efficiency.
11.      The adjustment program as a whole involves far reaching changes
affecting all facets of the Turkish economy. It entails substantial changes
in attitudes, institutions, and legal and policy frameworks, all of which will
take time and face considerable resistance. Overall, progress to date is
satisfactory and in some areas such as trade, domestic resource mobilization
and inflation control, extremely encouraging. Progress with respect to the
major economic indicators and specific progress against the SAL II objectives
is described more fully below.

Progress under SAL II
12.      The Second Structural Adjustment Loan focussed on the following
policy areas;
(a)   macroeconomic policies--domestic resource mobilization, export
promotion, and import liberalization;
(b)   investment and sectoral policies--public and private
investments, energy and agriculture; and
(c)   reform of the SEEs.
Progress against monitorable actions 1/ in these three areas was reviewed in
November 1981 as a condition of tranche release, and reported on to the
Executive Directors in the Memorandum entitled "Turkey: Review of the Second
Structural Adjustment Loan" (SecM 81-1033) dated December 30, 1981. Progress
continues to be satisfactory. The new policies are beginning to show results
and, in many cases, actual performance in 1981 met or exceeded the
Government's own targets.
Macroeconomic Policies:
13.      In response to a policy of monetary, credit and fiscal restraints
(which the IMF is monitoring), and of strict wage control, domestic demand has
been restrained and the average annual rate of inflation has been brought down
from 107 percent in 1980, to around 35 percent in 1981. After two years of
economic stagnation, and helped by internal security and labor peace, GDP has
shown a positive real growth of around 4.4 percent in 1981. While there has
been a growth in all sectors, that in the industrial sector amounted to
7.6 percent. A flexible exchange rate policy and export incentives helped to
substantially improve the balance of payments.
Domestic Resource Mobilization
14.      A major tax reform package and policies to stimulate private savings
were introduced in early 1981. These measures led to a substantial
improvement in tax revenues which, together with better expenditure control,
reduced the budget deficit to less than 1 percent of CNP in 1981 as against 5
percent in 1980. Overall, tax revenues increased by 71 percent in 1981 and,
as a share of GDP, rose from 17.3 percent to 19.8 percent, good progress
towards the Government's target of a 21 percent share by 1982.  Tax buoyancy,
which had averaged 0.99 percent over the previous five years, increased to
1.6 percent in 1981. Through a restructuring of the income tax there was also
some improvement in the distribution of the tax burden, another of the
program's objectives.
15.      Commercial bank interest rates, deregulated in July 1980, have
substantially increased and are now, for non-preferential credits,
substantially positive. As a result, total bank deposits increased by
68 percent in 1981 over the 1980 level, with a striking shift in composition
towards time deposits which grew by 150 percent and now comprise 33 percent of

the total.  In addition, certificates of deposit (CDs), which were introduced
into the Turkish banking system in 1980, increased seven-fold_in_1981, and no
comprise 11 percent of total bank deposits.
16.      Since July 1981, private companies have been free to set their own
bond rates in competition with the banks, and can use flexible rates if they
so choose. As a result of steps to improve SEE financial performance--by
freeing most SEE prices and gradually exposing SEEs to market forces--SEE
losses are projected to be only TL 7 billion in 1981, compared with
TL 23 billion in 1980 and TL 72 billion in 1979, all in current prices.
Balance of Payments
17.      Developments on the external account have been particularly
impressive. Export growth in 1981 of 62 percent in dollar value was
substantially higher than projected and was characterized by a shift in
destination towards the Middle East, and a concentration in manufactured
goods. 1/ A new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange comes from
construction contracts in the Middle East (around $9 billion outstanding by
end 1981). These activities are also expected to add to worker remittances,
which remained strong throughout 1981. While imports grew in value by
13 percent in 1981, in volume terms they remain below the 1974-77 average.
Given these developments, the current account deficit in 1981 is expected to
be about $2.4 billion (3 percent of GNP) compared with $3.2 billion in 1980
(5.5 percent of GNP).
Investment and Sector Policies
18.      There has been substantial progress in the rationalization of the
1982 Public Investment Program, which is discussed fully in paras. 54-56 below.
19.      Within the key sectors of agriculture and energy there is measurable
progress to report. The reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture
consolidated field services under new provincial directors in 60 of the 67
provinces. Input subsidies have been eliminated on plant protection materials
and fertilizer prices increased tenfold since 1980, thereby sharply reducing
the margin between retail and cif equivalent prices to about 40 percent. The
number of commodities receiving price supports was reduced from 23 to 16 and
their application made more flexible. The Government decided to phase in the
levying of the full operation and maintenance costs of major irrigation
schemes on beneficiaries over a three-year period, 1982 to 1984. Similar
measures are being prepared for the recovery of O&M costs for on-farm and
small scale systems.
20.      A review with the Bank of the energy sector was carried out during
September 1981 and the report of this mission is now under discussion. The
Government continued to raise petroleum prices to keep pace with international
costs and has generally increased other energy prices as well, for example,
lignite prices and high voltage electricity tariffs have more than doubled
1/   Export developments are analyzed in more detail in paras. 34-40.



- 6 -
while hard coal prices increased by 57 to 96 percent. The draft legislation
reorganizing TPAO 1/ and allowing private mining of lignite is still under
consideration. The legislation allowing TEK 2/ to take over responsibility
for municipal distribution of power was passed in January 1982. About 16
licenses have been issued to foreign oil companies for exploration and two
companies have started work. A temporary conservation unit within the
Ministry of Energy has been established and a law setting out energy policies
drafted.
SEE Reform
21.      The interim reform measures taken during the course of 1981 have
begun to have some impact on SEE performance. SEE losses are now expected to
be TL 7 billion in 1981 rather than the projected TL 38 billion, and budgetary
transfers for investment to be TL 232 billion rather than the projected
TL 249 billion 3/    On the other hand, fixed investments by SEEs in 1981 are
estimated to be TL 407 billion compared with the programmed TL 316 billion.
About TL 60 billion of this increase reflected exchange rate revaluation
factors and the availability of counterpart funds not previously budgeted.
-iAoreover, the major share of the increase went to high priority energy
projects. Employment in all SEEs declined slightly. A decree permitting
multi-year contracts for SEE managers has been passed, but major improvements
in this area await the general reform package (see para. 71 below).
Monitoring of SEE performance by the High Control Board has been superseded by
a quarterly monitoring mechanism at the Prime Ministerial level focussing on
profitability and productivity. In sum, while some of the specific measures
envisaged in the SAL II package have not been implemented, overall progress
has been better than expected.
The Role of the Bank in Turkey's Structural Adjustment
22.      The Bank's role hitherto in the structural adjustment program has not
been limited to the support under SALs I and II. The Bank has undertaken a
number of activities including three major economic studies--the Public Sector
Investment Review, the Industralization and Trade Strategy Report and the
Energy Assessment Survey, which will be completed shortly. The analyses and
recommendations of the first two of these reports have helped strengthen
policy formulation in the Government and have had an important influence on
clarifying Bank objectives. Similar expectations exist with respect to the
energy report and the studies of the agricultural and financial sectors
scheduled to take place before the end of 1982. Moreover, a substantial
amount of the ongoing economic work and the lending program is geared to the
realization of the objectives of the structural adjustment program, most
notably in the field of industrial policy and the reform of the SEEs. Project
lending, technical assistance, economic work, and SALs are complementary and
mutually reinforcing instruments to achieve these goals. The Bank will
continue with this comprehensive approach to structural adjustment in the
coming years.

Bank/IMF Cooperation
23.      The Bank's structural adjustment program in Turkey has involved a
close relationship with the IMF (see also Table 1, pages 9-16). Since
June 1980, the IMF has had a three-year Standby Arrangement with the
Government of Turkey for a total of SDR 1.25 billion (about $1.6 billion).
Under the arrangement Turkey has thus far made seven purchases, totalling
SDR 760 million.  The main conditions of the Standby are the maintenance of
external competitiveness through a flexible exchange rate policy, ceilings on
Central Bank credit to control aggregate demand, and limitations on budget
transfers to SEEs amounting in 1982 to TL243 billion, a reduction in real
terms of more than 20 percent from 1981. The Standby provides for quarterly
reviews of performance and tranche release and twice yearly agreement on
Central Bank credit limits and budget transfers. The credit limits for the
first half of 1982 provide for proportionally more rapid expansion of credit
to the private sector.
24.      The IMF has recently completed a review for release of the SDR 100
million March 1982 tranche, and found performance in implementing the program
to be satisfactory. The Fund concluded:
"The standby arrangement for Turkey has now reached its half-way
mark. The progress made thus far has clearly matched, if not
exceeded, expectations at the outset. Forceful adjustment of the
exchange rate and of interest rates has helped to bring about an
impressive growth in exports and workers' remittances, as well as a
marked turnaround in short-term capital flows. An essential adjunct
has been a more resolute program of domestic demand restraint via
financial and incomes policies ..... The lessening in both external
and internal imbalances that has resulted can be viewed with
considerable satisfaction by the authorities."
25.      The Fund's attention to the country's overall financial and budgetary
situation, aggregate demand, and the financial consequences of SEE
performance, has complemented the Bank's efforts to support increased domestic
resource mobilization, more efficient use of resources, growth of exports, and
constraint on the growth of imports. The Bank endorses the tight monetary
policies essential to the stabilization objectives, which are a prerequisite
for restoring sustainable growth. Nevertheless, with progress towards growth
in the medium-term, the Bank will give increasing prominence to supporting
longer term development objectives including those social objectives which, of
necessity, have been deferred during the initial period of adjustment.
Continued close collaboration between the institutions will remain essential
to identify the trade-offs between stabilization and growth.
Conclusion - Progress to Date
26.      The conclusion may be drawn at this stage that the Government has
made very substantial progress in its structural adjustment program.  The
major achievements are undoubtedly in the area of exchange rate management,
monetary policy, inflation control, resource mobilization, and direct efforts
to stimulate exports. These successes should not be allowed to conceal the
magnitude of the tasks ahead, and the need to establish an updated and more
explicit medium-term framework within which the program should unfold. The
Government's approach to this and the other outstanding issues is discussed at
the beginning of the next section.

PART III - THE SAL III PROGRAM
27.      The policy measures to be supported by SAL III are set out in an
updating Statement of Development Policies-1982, attached to a letter fro-- te'h
Deputy Prime Minister to the Bank dated April 24, 1982 (AnnexIV-A), and are
summarized below:
A.   Macroeconomic Policies (paras. 29-53).  The preparation of a
comprehensive medium-term framework including sectoral master
plans while continuing to refine the current macroeconomic
policies, in particular domestic resource mobilization and trade
liberalization policies;
B.   Public Investment (paras. 54-68).  The rationalization of the
public investment program so that its size and composition
reflect the priorities of the stabilization and restructuring
program, supported by a strengthening of project evaluation
capacity;
C.   SEE Reform (paras. 69-78).  The finalization of a major reform
package for the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), designed to
improve their economic and financial performance through
increasing their autonomy and market orientation, and the
continuation of interim reforms designed to increase their
efficiency and reduce their drain on the budget;
D.   Agriculture (paras. 79-91).  The promotion of growth in the
agricultural sector, including exports; and
E.   Energy (paras. 92-98).  Constraining the growth of energy
imports.
28.      Each of these areas is discussed more fully below.  As with previous
Turkish SALs, the SAL III package embraces a number of decisions already
taken, as well as others remaining to be implemented in 1982 and early 1983.
For convenience, the main actions are summarized in Annex IV-B, and an
overview of the structural adjustment program and SAL III is given in Table 1.
A. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES I/
Medium-Term Framework
29.      In 1982, Turkey is at a stage of transition between stabilization and
the beginning of sustainable growth. The Government has put in place many of
the policies designed to bring about a fundamental change in the Turkish
economy towards greater reliance upon market mechanisms, and a shift from
inward directed growth to a more outward oriented economy. This strategy
hinges on appropriate actions in three main policy areas: trade, investment,
and resource mobilization. However, actions in these areas have to be weighed
against other considerations, such as the impact on inflation and employment.

30.      Growth in exports is needed to finance essential imports and support
economic recovery. If it is to be obtained, policies favoring exports and
discouraging inefficient import substitution must be continued. By far the
most important is the maintenance of a realistic exchange rate. In the
short-run, special incentives are also required to induce domestic producers
to look outward and establish new markets. In the medium-term, import
restrictions, which tend to encourage inefficient domestic production, have to
be reformed by shifting to a system based on tariffs.
31.      Since Turkey's exports depend heavily on products produced by the
private sector, export growth will ultimately require additional investment by
the private sector in agriculture, industry, and transport. Thus, to
complement the trade policies, policies to encourage such investments are
required. Bottlenecks to production and exports, especially in energy,
agriculture and transportation, require complementary investments by the
public sector. To achieve quicker results, public investment must be focussed
on a more limited number of high priority projects. The limitations on
external resources require policies to increase domestic savings. In the
public sector, these should cover tax and other fiscal matters and greater
efficiency in the SEEs. To increase private savings, steps to reduce the
costs of financial intermediation, and the development of capital markets,
would complement the efforts already made, such as the deregulation of
interest rates.
32.      The inter-relationship of these various policy instruments should be
more explicitly examined by the development of a medium-term policy
framework. Because of the rapidly changing situation and the lack of
stability in relationships undergoing structural change, the Government has
found it difficult to prepare a meaningful medium-term framework until
recently. It now plans to use the 1981 results as a basis and expects to have
such a framework completed by early 1983. This framework would examine the
tradeoffs between various options and help in assessing the impact of various
policies on sectoral, employment and social objectives, debt service and
borrowing capacity. It would also provide clearer benchmarks for monitoring
performance towards the medium-term objectives. 1/
Trade
33.      The promotion of export growth and efficient import substitution
continues to play a prominent role in Turkey's development strategy. The
remarkable performance in 1981--exports up by 62 percent to $4.7 billion while
imports grew only 13 percent to $8.9 billion--is the result of the fundamental
shift in policy towards outward orientation as well as certain special
factors. Two key issues are the sustainability of this export growth and the
reduction of excessive protection. These are discussed in paras. 37-40,
and 43 below.
1/ In paras. 102-105 below, the report discusses a preliminary medium-term
projection made by the Bank.

Exports
34.      The growth in exports has two distinct characteristics:  it has been
industry-led and there has been a marked shift in destination away from the
EEC and towards the Middle East. Industrial exports grew by 119 percent in
1981 (Table 2) and, for the first time ever, now comprise a larger share of
exports than agriculture. 1/

35.      Agricultural exports grew by 33 percent despite declines in the
prices of hazelnuts, figs and raisins, and due largely to increases in
livestock, fruits and vegetables, and industrial crops, especially tobacco.
There has also been a marked diversification in manufactured export goods.
Among such exports, those with a higher value-added have performed
particularly well: agro-industrial exports, for example, doubled during this
period; textiles grew by 85 percent, especially ready-to-wear garments
(167 percent) and rugs and carpets (85 percent), and transport vehicles and
non-electrical machinery have also done well.
36.      In 1981, exports to the Middle East more than doubled, reaching
40 percent of the total, and accounted for 70 percent of the increase in that
year. The EEC received 32 percent, down from 43 percent. This trend has
helped offset the oil imports from Middle East countries. Turkey also holds
construction contracts in the area worth around $9 billion. Libya, Iraq, Iran
and Saudi Arabia received 26 percent of Turkey's exports in 1981, three times
their share in 1980, and Iraq is now rivaling Germany as Turkey's chief export
market. Turkey's exports to the Middle East include traditional exports such
as livestock and grain as well as a new and more diversified range of
products--processed agricultural goods, carpets, ready-made clothes, glass and
ceramics, leather and hide products, metal goods, electrical appliances and
machinery, buses and trucks, and cement (Table 3).

shift in share between major groups in Annex VII, Chart II.

Reasons for Performance
37.      Much has been done to improve export incentives since January 1980,
By far the most significant change has been the introduction and maintenance
of a realistic exchange rate, adjusted daily since May 1981 against a
trade-weighted basket of currencies. Low cost export credits, indirect tax
rebates, and privileged access to foreign exchange and imports have further
increased the attractiveness of exports. 1/  Altogether, the average subsidy
rate on industrial exports was 11 percent in mid-1981, helping to offset the
bias in the protection system towards domestic production as well as the costs
for inexperienced Turkish firms of learning to penetrate export markets.
While it is difficult to assess precisely the impact of the incentives on
exports, around 70 percent of realized exports in 1981 were pledged against
incentives (assuming that incentives granted in 1981 were utilized the same
year). Most important were low-interest credits, which amounted to around
30 percent of total export value and tax rebates, which amounted to around
5 percent of total export value.
38.      Some special circumstances have also influenced export growth.
First, industrialists have been encouraged by domestic factors to look abroad
for markets. Following the banning of strikes and better supply of imported
inputs, production of almost all key industrial commodities was up from 1980
levels. However, after more than a year of monetary restraint, domestic
demand was stagnant. Because of Government concern about rising unemployment,
non-voluntary redundancies were not allowed and high severance payments
further discouraged layoffs. High interest rates make it extremely costly to
hold stocks. In short, growing output and slack domestic demand combined with
the high costs of maintaining stocks, have encouraged exports.  Second, the
Iran-Iraq war has contributed to the growth of exports of goods and earnings
from freight and transportation. With these two countries' Gulf ports closed,
the volume of transit trade through Turkey has grown rapidly, and there is
heavy demand from these countries for goods ranging from foodstuffs to
building materials, particularly cement.
39.      The prospects for Turkish exports over the next few years are good.
Although export growth is likely to be considerably lower than in 1981, given
the low 1980 base and gradual restoration of domestic demand, an average
annual increase of around 15 percent during 1982-85 seems attainable. 2/ This
projection is conditional upon a continuation of the current export-oriented
policies and, in the medium-term, on new investment in export activities. It
is supported by the following favorable factors. First, exports to Middle
Eastern markets are unlikely to be significantly affected by an end to the war
since they consist mostly of necessities (foodstuffs, clothing, transport
vehicles, machinery). Second, considerable experience has now been gained by
exporters in a new activity involving a fundamental change in attitude,
1/ A fuller description of these incentives and their importance is given in
the SAL II President's Report and the ITS Report, Chapter 2.
2/ The Government projects a 23 percent increase in 1982. Exports in
January-February 1982 were 36 percent above the same period in 1981.

product design and quality control. Third, the diversification of exports,
and the number of new products (twice the number of items as compared to
1977/78) reduces the susceptibility to market changes. Fourth, Turkish
construction companies now hold contracts worth about $9 billion and
increasingly rely on Turkish inputs. 1/ Fifth, the growth of trading
companies, which accounted for about 10 percent of the increase in exports in
1981, and which have sufficient expertise and resources to develop new
markets, will help underpin future growth. Sixth, excess capacity still
exists in some industries, although supply constraints are being felt in the
production of carpets, leather goods, and buses.
40.      The Government's continuing efforts to maintain external
competitiveness through a flexible exchange rate policy, further improvements
in export incentives and various measures to encourage freer trade are part of
the SAL III package (see para. 8 of the Draft Statement). The Government
plans to continue its daily exchange rate adjustments to ensure that external
competitiveness is maintained. Export incentives are being rationalized
through the following measures:
(a) tax rebates for exports from January 1983 will be based on net
foreign exchange earnings from exports rather than full export
value and export credit incentives will take value added into
account;
(b) tax rebates applicable to trading companies are being simplified
and their coverage extended to fresh fruits and vegetables;
(c) administrative procedures have been considerably simplified in
the 1982 Export Regime and the requirement that potential
exporters obtain a license to export removed; and
(d) the unrestricted duty-free import of inputs by exporters will
continue and has been extended to equipment and investment goods
for export production. Further, exporters are now entitled to
hold foreign exchange at the Central Bank to facilitate payments
and business travel.
A study to set up a joint public/private export promotion center should be
completed by the end of this year; a small privately-operated center is
already functioning. The Government is also in the process of introducing
legislation to allow bonded warehouses. The range of export incentives is,
thus, reasonably comprehensive, and there has been continuous improvement in
the administrative arrangements affecting exports.
1/ About 150,000 Turkish workers are employed in the Middle East (about
20 percent of the number in Europe). Their remittances comprise a larger
share of income than their European counterparts, and are of growing
importance.



- 23 -
Imports
41.      The Government has been taking legal and administrative steps to
liberalize the import regime over the last year including abolition of the
quota list and the shifting of about 200 items from Liberalized List II to the
more liberalized List I. 1/ Liberalized List I includes items which are
noncompetitive with domestic production and freely admitted. List II items
require a license, issued normally if the goods cannot be supplied locally in
comparable quantity and quality. During 1981, the Government increasingly
administered List II to provide some additional de facto liberalization, i.e.
by allowing imports of items domestically produced which were indirectly
needed for exports or to keep domestic prices down through competitive
pressure (e.g. steel and PVC). Moreover, the duty-free importation of inputs
going into exports, which bypass the normal regime, increased from
$172 million in 1980 to $356 million in 1981. The 1982 Import Regime
continues the policy by shifting another 35 items, with import value of about
$110 million in 1981, to List I. More significant, it introduces a new list,
a levy list, initially of about 15 goods which can be imported without
restriction, subject only to a flexible levy, which will be adjusted from time
to time. The levy list provides a more flexible instrument for further
liberalization of protected items primarily those produced domestically which
are indirectly important for exports; e.g., animal feed. It will also be used
to keep pressure on domestic prices and help control inflation. The licensing
and administrative procedures for imports have also been further simplified.
42.      In 1981, imports amounted to $8.9 billion, of which 25 percent were
capital goods, and 40 percent, oil and oil products. Import duties as a share
of total imports have declined substantially in recent years, from
37.8 percent in 1979 to an estimated 13.7 percent in 1980, due mainly to the
increase in the value of fuel imports. The 1982 Import Program projects
imports of $10 billion, of which 22 percent are expected to be capital goods
and 42 percent oil.
43.      The Government has made clear its intention to open the Turkish
economy to competition from abroad. Its long-term policy is that import
restrictions will not be used to protect domestic producers. 2/ It is keenly
aware that efforts to reduce the effective level of protection and the bias
towards domestic production are essential to the efforts to restructure the
Turkish economy and stimulate competitive exports to support growth.
Nevertheless, because of foreign exchange constraints, entrenched domestic
forces dependent on protection and international trade restrictions, it
recognizes the process will, of necessity, be gradual. The Government's
intention is thus to gradually shift from a licensing system of import
1/ The relaxation of certain restrictions in 1980 and 1981 was described in
the SAL II President's Report (paras. 57-64). The importance of import
liberalization to-the overall strategy was also highlighted in the
Industrialization and Trade Strategy (ITS) Report, which describes the
procedures in greater detail.
2/ See also paras. 6 and 8 of the Statement of Development Policies - 1982,
Annex IV-A.

control to one relying on tariffs and to reduce these tariffs over the next
five years. In doing this, it will draw on the results of the protection
study started under SAL I, which is expected to be completed by the end of
1982. One of the difficulties in assessing the remaining quantitative
restrictions is that some items which are domestically produced are not
included on the liberalized lists, and thus are effectively prohibited. The
Government has indicated that it will prepare a list of such items in the next
few months and that during the course of 1982 and in preparing the 1983 Import
Program, it expects to continue the process of gradual liberalization towards
its medium-term objectives. Because of the importance of continued progress
to the structural adjustment objectives, satisfactory progress in import
liberalization would be a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 4).
Domestic Resource Mobilization
44.      After several years of deteriorating domestic savings performance,
the Government has taken a number of steps to raise domestic savings,
including a major tax reform, steps to improve the financial performance of
the SEEs, the liberalization of interest rates, and institutional improvements
in the capital markets. 1/ These measures, supported by SAL II, have had a
considerable measure of success. In early 1982, the Government introduced
further modifications to the tax system to improve both revenues and equity.
To lessen the tax burden on lower income groups, there will be a gradual
reduction in the minimum tax bracket, from 40 percent in 1981 to 25 percent by
1985. To help alleviate the financial difficulties of the private corporate
sector and to encourage private investment, the corporation tax has been
reduced from 50 to 40 percent.
45.      To more fully realize the potential yield from the 1981 tax reform,
the Government is embarking on a major effort to improve the efficiency of tax
collection.  The budget allocation for tax administration 1982 has been
increased in real terms over the 1981 level. Additional tax offices will be
established in key tax generating areas. By end-April, 1982, the number of
district tax controllers had been increased from the January 1982 level of 350
to the 1982 year-end target of about 750, and the Government now expects to
reach 1,000 by year-end. The enactment of the chartered accountancy law
permitting chartered accountants to notarize tax declarations will further
reduce the burden on the Government. Computerization of tax returns is making
progress with German technical assistance.  Real estate taxation, which has
generated less than 3 percent of tax revenue but absorbed 45 percent of the
collection budget, has been simplified by a minimum payment scheme. As a
result of these efforts, the Government expects tax revenues to reach
TL 1,440 billion for the ten-month 1982 fiscal year, an increase of 10 percent
in real terms over 1981. The budget deficit in 1982 is expected to be held at
less than 1 percent of GNP.
1/ These are described in paras. 14-16 above and in the SAL II President's
Report, paras. 32-40.



- 25 -
Cost of Credit
46.      The liberalization of various interest rates, has been extremely
effective in mobilizing resources but has also raised the cost of funds
(para. 15). Moreover, for a variety of reasons (a bank cartel agreement, the
inefficiency of the banks, taxes and charges on loans, and high reserve
requirements), the costs of financial intermediation are high--more than
30 percentage points.  As a result, non-preferential interest rates are
positive in real terms by as much as 20 to 25 percent. Because of the
extensive system of preferential interest rates, notably for investment and
exporters' working capital, the main impact of these high rates falls on
non-export working capital loans. While this discourages stock accumulation,
which is desirable, it also substantially reduces the profitability of
production, and could be a major factor detering the recovery of investment.
On the other hand, selective high rates may be a necessary instrument to
pressure the private sector to reorient outward. Because of the importance of
the right kind of private investment to the medium-term strategy, a study of
the financial sector is tentatively scheduled for late 1982, to provide, inter
alia, a better understanding of this issue.
47.      In the meantime, the Government has adopted a variety of measures to
reduce financial intermediation costs and encourage investments in high
priority activities. Government bond rates and rediscount rates are being
used to influence market rates. By a combination of persuasion, increased
capital requirements, and competition from foreign banks, the Government is
bringing pressure on banks to improve their efficiency. Preferential interest
rates are given to priority activities, such as production credits for
exporters and for investment. In addition, the Government reduced the
transaction tax on loans in mid-1981 from 25 percent of interest to 15 percent
and waived it on loans by development banks and, recently, for loans to
exporters. Complete elimination of this tax is not likely before 1983 because
of budgetary considerations. The interest equalization charge has been
reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. Finally, the development of
alternative instruments, such as the new "profit sharing certificates" or
nonvoting stock is being encouraged. The new Capital Market Regulatory
Commission came into being only in February 1982, so it is too early to assess
the impact of the new regulatory framework.
Private Investment
48.      Private investment in subsectors supporting export growth and
employment is a key element of the Government's long-term restructuring
strategy. Overall, private investment, which comprises of 43 percent of total
investment, is not expected to increase significantly in 1982. Preliminary
estimates for 1981 show a modest 2 percent real increase in private investment
in manufacturing to TL 137 billion (30 percent below 1977), and a 17 percent
increase in private transport investment to TL 77 billion, reflecting the
growing importance of trade. However, housing, the major component at
TL 243 billion, continued to decline.
49.      The restoration of growth of private investment faces several
difficulties. Capacity utilization is estimated by a major industry



- 26 -
association to have been about 60 percent in 1981, only a moderate increase
from 1980. The 119 percent increase in manufactured exports in 1981 has
allowed individual firms to operate at capacity; however, exports comprise
only 6 percent of industrial production. Bottlenecks in energy, industrial
infrastructure, and lack of inputs also deter recovery. The financial
structure of most firms is heavily dependent on debt, now costly in real
terms. Equity markets, weak to begin with, have been decimated by the failure
of dividends to keep pace with inflation.  Equity has been further eroded by
taxes based on nominal profits, although the law to permit revaluation is
under consideration. Debts of firms which borrowed foreign exchange have
soared due to a more rapid depreciation of the lira than the rise in domestic
prices. Though commercial banks have substantially increased their medium and
long-term lending to the private sector, much of this has been for working
capital. Under these circumstances, many firms, especially if they are not
associated with a bank/holding group, have found it difficult to obtain local
financing, and banks are insisting on more stringent financial standards for
their project lending.
50.      Despite these problems, the private sector investment activity that
is taking place is encouraging. The Government is making major efforts to
promote a change of ingrained attitudes toward outward orientation among
private investors. Besides incentives, efforts include frequent high level
government/business trade missions. The overall investment figures obscure
the shift that is taking place in response to these efforts. A significantly
higher percentage of projects in development bank pipelines is for
modernization, efficiency improvement, extensions to make better use of
existing capacity or in sectors where Turkey has a long-run comparative
advantage, such as food processing and engineering. Moreover, many of these
projects are being planned and financed by new outward-oriented investment
groups. Conversely, project cancellations, which have grown during the past
year, have mostly been for large new projects where the returns are no longer
sufficient. The export obligations of projects receiving investment
certificates have more than tripled in the past year. While levels of private
manufacturing investment must increase in the medium-term to sustain growth,
past investment levels, based on capital-intensive import substitution, are
not a guide to the future. Feasible growth scenarios suggest investment
growth rates of 8 to 10 percent would suffice. A significant increase in
private sector investment seems likely in 1983 as confidence grows, but
further expansion to desirable levels will probably require several years more.
Foreign Investment
51.      If the export drive is to be sustained, Turkey will need technology,
access to markets and substantial investments which are beyond the capacity of
the domestic private sector and the State. There is thus a need to attract
substantial foreign investment. Foreign investors have been slow to respond
to the variety of new incentives which the Government offers. In 1981, 109
foreign companies received licenses to invest $334 million, up from
$92 million in 1980, but $290 million of this was financed by purchases of
Turkish lira abroad from holders of non-guaranteed trade arrear obligations.
Foreign investors have been discouraged by earlier experiences in Turkey, and
by the investment approval process, which still remains cumbersome, despite
well intentioned efforts to streamline it.



- 27 -
52.      To further stimulate foreign investment, the Central Bank has hired
an investment banking consortium (Lazard Freres, Kuhn Loeb Lehman Brothers,
and S.G. Warburg & Co.) to promote foreign investment in petroleum, tourism,
mining and agroindustries, as well as to review the relevant laws and
regulations. To date, the most promising area seems to be petroleum
exploration. In addition, to facilitate foreign investment, the Government is
planning to revise the laws pertaining to investments in mining and petroleum
and has recently revised the law regarding tourism. However, results are
likely to be long-term given the current depressed world economy and the
competition for investable funds.
External Debt
53.      External debt management in Turkey has been hindered by manual
tabulation of data. Under SAL I the Bank supported a program to computerize
it. Progress to date has been slow, due mainly to staff shortages. The
Government plans to strengthen this program by providing additional full-time
staff and by hiring specialized consultants in the Ministry of Finance by
mid-1982. In addition, in order to obtain summary debt information more
promptly, the Government agreed to provide debt information to the Bank in a
simplified format every six months, beginning with December 1981. The
December 1981 data has been received and is being analyzed.
B. PUBLIC INVESTMENT 1/
54.      The management of the public investment program presents one of the
most difficult challenges for the Government's structural adjustment program.
Decisions on the appropriate size of the program, its composition, and focus
are not easy and often involve conflicting considerations. The size of the
annual allocation must balance the need for demand management, the need to
remove bottlenecks to growth and the need to provide for the restoration of
private investment over the medium-term. The composition must reflect an
appropriate balance among sectors and within sectors, while at the same time
laying the basis for the adjustment of the economic structure. Moreover,
these decisions must be taken in circumstances where the room for maneuver, in
the short-term, is limited by past decisions, contractual commitments, and the
sheer size of the program.
55.      Within these constraints, the Government is using the public
investment program as a major instrument for restructuring the economy. The
major objectives are to:
(i) reduce the relative size of public sector investment in total
investment over the 1982-85 period;
(ii) constrain the volume of public investment to a level that can
be financed domestically without adding to inflationary
pressures and, externally, without adding imprudently to the
debt burden;
1/ The Government's program is described in paras. 14-17 of the Statement of
Development Policies - 1982, Annex IV-A.



- 28 -
(iii)  focus on high priority projects in infrastructure,
agriculture, and energy, with manufacturing increasingly left
to the private sector; and
(iv)  concentrate the public investment program on a smaller number
of projects to shorten completion times.
56.      SAL III supports these objectives.  It must be recognized, however,
that they can only be attained over a number of years. The sheer size of the
program, some 7,400 ongoing projects costing about $65 billion, means it can
only be modified to a limited extent in any single year. This problem is
aggravated by the overhang of a large number of projects, many of uncertain
merit which cannot be fully funded given current resources. Despite a major
effort to trim the program for 1981, and especially for 1982, considerable
work remains to be done. The Government estimates it will take another three
to four years to fully rationalize the program and achieve the objective of a
better balance between public and private investment.
1982 Public Investment Program
57.      The level of public fixed investment programmed for calendar 1982 is
TL 978 billion (about $7 billion), and represents a 6 percent real increase
over the estimated actual level for 1981, but only 9 percent above the level
of investment in 1979 (See Table 4). 1/ As a share of total fixed investment,
the 1982 program remains about the same as in the two previous years, but
somewhat higher than in 1979 and should be expected to decline in future years
towards the 1979 level in line with the Government's policy. As a share of
GDP, the 1982 program is not significantly different from that of recent years.

/1  A factor complicating comparisons is the shift in 1982 from a March -
February fiscal year to the calendar year.  As a result, public investment
in fiscal 1982 is programmed at TL 922 billion for the 10-month period,
March-December. It has been adjusted to 12-months by including January
and February 1982.

Sectoral Composition
58.      The changing sectoral composition of public investment is shown in
Table 5. Most noteworthy is the steady increase in the allocation for energy
over the period. That for transport and communications is maintained, while
manufacturing drops significantly from 19.3 percent in 1980 to 16.3 percent in
1982. Table 5 also shows how the sectoral pattern of the public investment
program for 1982 compares with a pattern for 1982-85 suggested in the Bank's
Public Investment Review (PIR) Report, which entailed increases in energy and
agriculture and a decline in manufacturing. The share of energy for 1982
already exceeds the suggested share. In agriculture, the smaller allocation
reflects absorptive capacity problems in the sector. The share for
manufacturing is reduced, reflecting the Government's effort to reduce the
role of manufacturing SEEs.

59.      The significance of the changes in sectoral distribution of public
investment can be better gauged from the following table which shows how the
absolute change in fixed investment over 1980-82, was distributed among major
sectors. The increased emphasis on energy, the decline in manufacturing, and
the limited allocation to social infrastructure are clearly evident.

Project Composition
60.      In November 1981, the Council of Ministers reviewed the draft 1982
Public Investment Program. Priority was assigned to projects according to the
following criteria:
(a) those having high rates of return and capable of being
completed within two years;
(b) those which will help develop indigenous energy resources;
(c) those which rehabilitate or extend the infrastructure in
energy, transport and agriculture, and exports generally; and
(d) those which help overcome output bottlenecks.
61.      The 1982 Investment Program reflects the application of these
criteria. About one-quarter of the 139 major projects 1/ in the 1981 program
has been dropped, deferred for restudy or substantially reduced in scope in
the 1982 Investment Program (Annex VIII, Table 4). These changes reduced the
total cost of projects in the program by about $15 billion, or about
23 percent. In addition, many lower priority projects still in the program in
1982 have been given nominal allocations for the year to allow fuller funding
of the higher priority projects. The 1982 program still contains several
major projects which would not be started in current circumstances, but which
were retained in the program after intensive review because of their advanced
stage of execution and contractual commitments. Execution of most of these is
being stretched out and they have been allocated less than 5 percent of the
funds.
1/  Major projects are those costing more than TL 5 billion each.  In the 1981
program, this was equivalent to about $60 million, in 1982 to about
$47 million.



- 31 -
62.      The degree of project rationalization is well illustrated by the
manufacturing sector, a key sector in the Government's restructuring
strategy. About a dozen major projects, with a total cost of TL 230 billion
(about $2 billion), have been eliminated. In addition, nominal amounts have
been allocated to a number of other low priority very large projects,
including Sivas Steel and Iskenderun Steel Expansion, while many projects
(e.g. tractors, diesel engines, steam boilers, etc.) have been scaled down.The
elimination or reduction in scope of various projects has reduced the
portfolio of projects in manufacturing by 25 percent in value and has helped
the Government concentrate its limited resources on hastening completion of
priority projects. Of the 795 manufacturing projects in the 1982 program, 331
or 42 percent are scheduled to be completed in 1982 compared to 35 percent in
the 1981 program. Furthermore, the 1982 allocation represents 12.4 percent of
the remaining cost of all manufacturing projects in the portfolio, compared to
the 1981 allocation which represented only 8.4 percent.
63.      The Government recognizes that the project list is still not fully
satisfactory and expects to further rationalize it over the next several
years. About 35 of the major projects in the 1982 program, 22 percent of the
total, are expected to be re-examined to confirm their priority before they
are fully funded. In selecting projects for funding in future investment
programs, the Government intends to ensure they meet satisfactory economic
criteria and has indicated it would continue to use a satisfactory rate of
return criteria for this purpose. The Iron and Steel Master Plan, scheduled
for completion in January 1983, will re-evaluate the Sivas Steel and
Iskenderun Steel Phase II Expansion, which together account for almost
30 percent of the remaining manufacturing portfolio.
64.      The 1982 program also reflects a determined effort to speed up the
project completion rate by focussing funds on a more limited number of
projects. For the four major sectors (agriculture, energy, transport and
manufacturing), about 35 percent of the projects, accounting for almost
30 percent of the programmed investment, are to be completed in 1982. Of the
157 major projects (costing over TL 5 billion each), about 60, or 38 percent,
are expected to be completed by 1984, although such projections have been
inaccurate in the past. Eighty-Six of the 157 major projects are considered
the highest priority and are programmed to receive 84 percent of the funds
going to the major projects. As a condition for tranche release, we would
seek evidence of the Government continuing to focus funds on higher priority
projects pursuant to the policy of rationalizing the Public Investment Program
(Loan Agreement, Schedule 4). An appropriate benchmark would be that the
mid-year investment review should confirm that more than 80 percent of the
funds expected to be spent on these major projects would go to the 86 highest
priority projects as programmed.
Size
65.      Despite the concerted effort to constrain the real growth of public
investment, the size of the 1982 program is 6 percent higher in real terms
than the estimated 1981 levels (Table 4). The Government has argued that this
is justified for four reasons:
(a)    there is a need to rehabilitate and expand infrastructure in
support of exports stemming from a rundown of the capital
stock, and a pressing demand for facilities. Between 1977 and



- 32 -
1980, fixed investment in transport declined by 18 percent per
year and in agriculture by 22 percent, leading to a serious
deterioration in the capital stock of these sectors. Existing
transport facilities--ports, highways and storage--have comne
under additional pressure because of the expansion in Turkey's
trade and transit trade destined for the Middle East;
(b)   there is a need to remove bottlenecks in energy production.  A
recent survey of some 230 Turkish businessmen throughout the
country indicated limited energy supply was among the most
important impediments to expanding production and undertaking
investment. In these circumstances, a major effort to increase
investment in energy is understandable;
(c)   the major improvement in domestic resource mobilization in 1981
and expected in 1982, enables financing a larger investment
program without adding to inflationary pressures, pre-empting
resources destined for financing private sector investment, or
encouraging imprudent borrowing abroad. Preliminary estimates
(Table 7) show a steady increase in public savings from
5.3 percent of GDP in 1980 to 7.0 percent in 1981 and 9 percent
in 1982.

This improved savings performance reflects an improvement in
the tax effort, better expenditure control and improved SEE
performance. Public saving is thus financing an increasing
share of public investment; from 47 percent in 1980 to
61 percent in 1981 and an expected 73 percent in 1982.
Domestic and foreign borrowing to finance the investment
program has been correspondingly reduced; in particular,
borrowing from the Central Bank in 1982 is expected to be less
than half in nominal terms than in 1980. The declining
requirement for foreign borrowing is a contributing factor to
the strengthening of Turkey's creditworthiness;
(d)   there is a need to maintain the overall level of investment in
the economy in view of the sluggishness in aggregate private
investment (para. 48). Indeed, the increases in public
investment and exports are the major driving force underlying
the 4.4 percent growth rate in output between 1980 and 1982 and
in helping to prevent a further deterioration in the employment
situation. Although there is a potential risk that the public
sector could crowd out private investment by pre-empting
investment opportunities and resources, public and private
investment are also complementary. The restoration of private
investment depends on the availability of essential inputs,
such as power, infrastructure and basic materials, that can
only be provided by the public sector. The public sector is
also a major market for private producers such as the
electrical supply and engineering industries, which have done
reasonably well because of the expanded public energy program.
These forward and backward linkages mean that to some extent
private investment will grow in parallel with public investment.
66.      While these reasons justify the increase of public fixed investment
programmed for 1982, a continued growth of public investment is clearly
inconsistent with the Government's stated objectives to stimulate private
investment and to constrain investment to levels justified by available
resources, as well as the expectation that the share of public in total
investment would decline over the 1982 to 1985 period. Moreover, the
improvement in resource availability in 1982 was in part due to a once and for
all transfer from the private sector through more realistic SEE prices.
Taking these factors into account, restraint of the growth of public
investment in future would be essential. A possible benchmark for judging
progress in achieving these objectives would be to program public investment
in 1983 at the same level in real terms as that in 1982.  With this benchmark
as background, satisfactory progress towards the Government's objectives of
constraining the level of public investment to conform with available
resources, and to allow for stimulating the growth of private investment,
would be a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4).
Project Evaluation Capacity.
67.      The Government's capacity for project preparation, evaluation, and
selection was weakened in the 1970's and is one of the reasons for the
questionable quality of some projects in the investment program. Given the



- 34 -
practical difficulties of reassessing ongoing projects, the Government has
taken a reasonable approach over the last two years of qualitative
reassessment based on such factors as the stage of completion, the need to
make better use of existing capacity and the need for infrastructure to
support export growth. There remains, however, a need to rebuild the
Government's capacity to more systematically re-examine the large number of
projects at very early stages of execution, especially those which have been
deferred, as well as to provide for the proper selection of new projects, to
ensure adequate rates of return on public investment.
68.      Given the complexity of the Turkish economy and the size of the
investment program, the Government does not believe a centralized "project
office" is appropriate. Rather, it plans to:
(a) build up a core evaluation capacity in the SPO which will
provide guidelines for project evaluation and selection and
ensure overall consistency;
(b) strengthen the project preparation and selection capacity of the
key ministries and agencies;
(c) upgrade the State Investment Bank's (DYB) ability to appraise
and supervise state projects;
(d) require all new SEE projects to be prepared or vetted by
qualified consultants and to meet the same standards for
investment incentives as private projects; and
(e) rely on market forces for manufacturing SEEs to determine their
investments within their financial capabilities.
The head of the evaluation department and his deputy have recently been
appointed. Training courses, possibly with EDI assistance, are to be
organized for SPO and the other ministries. In the meantime, DYB has prepared
a draft law, in connection with the State Industrial Finance Project, to
improve its operations, which is expected to be considered by the Government
following the passage of the SEE reform law. Adequate progress in developing
the Government's procedures and mechanisms for project preparation,
evaluation, and selection would be a condition for tranche release
(Loan Agreement, Schedule 4). In particular, the Bank would examine the steps
being taken to enable the key agencies to better carry out rate of return
calculations for new and restudied projects.
C. STATE ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES I/
Background
69.      The State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) are significant factors in
manufacturing as well as in traditional public utilities, transport, and
agriculture marketing and supply. They account for a substantial share of
1/ The Government's program is described in paras. 18 and 19 of the Statement
of Development Policies - 1982, Annex IV-A.



- 35 -
investment, value-added and employment. Since the late 1970s, their operating
losses and growing investment demands have put intolerable burdens on the
budget and added to inflationary pressures. While some SEEs were well run and
profitable, in aggregate they showed increasing losses. The sources of these
difficulties were well known. 1/ They include price controls, uneconomic and
excessive investments, overstaffing, lack of autonomy, frequent changes of
management, inadequate salaries for managerial and technical staff,
over-centralization of decision making, and a confusion between economic,
social, and political goals.
70.      The reduction of the financial burden of the SEEs and improvements in
their efficiency are major goals of the structural adjustment program. In
view of the importance of the SEEs in the Turkish system, the Government has
taken a gradual, but steady, approach to reform. Its strategy is to
fundamentally change attitudes in Turkey to reach a consensus that the SEEs'
prime objectives should be profitability and productivity, that their
operations should be under professional, not political, management, and that
their investments should be primarily in infrastructure, agriculture and
energy, with manufacturing increasingly left to the private sector. The
Government is implementing a number of interim measures to improve short-term
financial performance, redirect their investment programs and finance them
increasingly from non-budget sources, and undertaking legal reforms to
institutionalize these changes. The first step, in early 1980, was to
liberalize prices with a view to generating additional financial resources.
This was followed, in 1981, by several additional measures designed to begin
to improve efficiency, reduce costs and constrain investment. 2/
The SAL III Package for SEEs
71.      The centerpiece of the Government's program for SEEs in SAL III
(described in para. 19 of the attached Statement) is a significant reform
package. While the Government recognizes the challenge is to change
attitudes, not laws, the draft law has considerable symbolic importance.
Moreover, it specifically addresses many of the key problems underlying SEE
inefficiency. The law is complemented by the strengthening of interim
measures to improve performance (para. 18 of the Statement).    While results
should not be expected quickly, the legal reform lays the groundwork for
substantially improving SEE performance over time. The Government has
presented a general enabling law to the Consultative Assembly in April 1982.
Following its enactment, expected shortly, the Government intends to enact the
SEE reform by decree law. Satisfactory progress on SEE reform would be a
condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4). The essential
features of the reform law and the probable effects are as follows:
(a) the SEEs, initially in energy and manufacturing, are to be
re-established under the commercial code, free from the
restrictions of the SEE Law (440) and the State Personnel
1/ SAL II President's Report and Chapter 6 of the ITS Report.
2/ These are described in detail in the SAL II President's Report paras.
135-155. Progress on these interim measures has been generally
satisfactory, and is summarized in para. 21 and Annex VII.



- 36 -
Law (657). This will permit them considerably greater freedom
on salaries and incentives, particularly for management and
technical personnel. It will give management far greater
responsibility for minor investment and operational decisions;
(b) these SEEs will be removed from direct ministerial control, and
their main interaction with Government will be through an annual
shareholders meeting. The provision for hiring managers and
boards for fixed terms will encourage management continuity;
(c) manufacturing SEEs will be increasingly responsible for
financing their investments, which should result in more viable
investments; and
(d) they will be permitted to sell shares to the public and required
to publish financial statements. The broader scrutiny of their
operations, currently veiled from the public view until long
after the fact, will increase the pressure to perform, as will
the presence of private shareholders interested in financial
results.
72.      In addition, an interim package was implemented by decree on
November 27, 1981 (described in para. 18 of the Statement), which continued
the progress started under SAL II. Its most significant features were:
(a) the priority given to operational results and improvements in
productivity, with investment targets being given a secondary
role;
(b) the stress on profitability and productivity being the primary
function of SEE managers and the institution of a Prime
Ministerial level quarterly review of performance;
(c) the continuation of the policy restricting the replacement of
employees in eight key SEEs to 50 percent of the positions
becoming vacant through attrition;
(d) the limiting of budgetary transfers to the SEEs in 1982 to
TL 243 billion, 1/ a significant reduction in real terms from
1981, with the proportion going to the manufacturing SEEs
reduced in both real and nominal terms; and
(e) the frequent adjustment of prices to reflect market conditions
and, for monopoly or semi-monopoly firms, to take explicit
account of international price levels.
1/ Being monitored by the DMF.



- 37 -
73.      The above set of interim measures and legal reforms constitutes an
appropriate set of actions pursuant to the long-term objectives of economy c2
efficiency. It addresses key problems such as delinking operations from
day-to-day government control, and greater autonomy on personnel, product an,
investment decisions, which have long been identified as critical to improved
performance. The reform package does not envisage breaking up the large
manufacturing SEE holding companies, although their monopoly power is being
curtailed by allowing selective imports, underscoring the importance of impo-r-
liberalization to future efficiency. While the SEEs are expected to have
greater responsibility for investment decisions, especially in manufacturing,
the Government's efforts to improve project selection are important to ensure
government funds go to soundly conceived projects. Encouraging the SEEs to
tap other sources for their needs will encourage financial discipline, but
poses the question of the availability of these resources and the possible
impact on private activities. The reform law is a broad enabling instrument
and many of the practical details will have to be worked out in future in the
course of implementation. These include more detailed guidance on the
issuance of shares, improvements in the mechanics for monitoring performance,
especially for the SEEs not covered by the law, and the development of
specific criteria for Government equity participation.
Financial Results and Prospects
74.      The financial position of the operational SEEs both individually and
as a group, together with the Government's projections for 1982, is provided
in Annex VII. The positive trends in most key indicators, noted in para. 21,
which have emerged in 1981, are expected to continue. These are summarized in
Table 8 below:

The improvement in profitability is largely due to price increases, higher
capacity utilization and wage constraints, which reduced the share of wages
and salaries as a percentage of sales from 33 percent in 1979 to 18 percent in
1981. The decline in employment (1.3 percent since 1979) also helped. Wage
bill increases were held to an overall 35 percent in 1981. The Government's
projections for 1982 assume wage increases averaging 30 percent, price
increases of 25 percent, and a 20 percent increase in production.

75.      The breakdown of performance by sectors and firms is needed to
understand the underlying movement (Annex VII, Table 2). Price liberalization
led to profits in manufacturing in 1980, but declining domestic demand and
increasing competition reduced these in 1981. The energy sector experienced
substantial profit increases in 1981 as price increases in petroleum and power
took effect. Losses have been concentrated in the trading and transport SEEs,
where prices continue to be subsidized. The main losers in 1981 were the
fertilizer trading companies (TL 61 billion), the railways and maritime
companies (TL 11 billion), the coal company (TL 9 billion), and the steel
company (TL 6 billion), while substantial profits were shown by the power
company (TL 21 billion), the petroleum company (TL 50 billion), the post and
telegraphs (TL 10 billion), and the mining company (TL 6 billion). The losses
of the fertilizer trading company were offset by about TL 75 billion
transferred from a fertilizer fund financed by an indirect export levy on
agriculture products.
76.      The cutting edge of the Government's policy for improving SEE
performance is the investment program. After years of growth, the size of the
program, as a percent of GNP, is being reduced, projects dropped or
re-evaluated, self-financing increased and funds are being directed away from
manufacturing towards infrastructure. This is shown in Annex VII and
summarized in Table 9 below:

Despite these improvements, there are still problems.  The financing plan for
SEE investment, although improved, still depends on "short term borrowing and
net arrears", for about 23 percent of the funds, although down from 27 percent
in 1981. 1/ Financing by arrears seems to have abated: Accounts payable to
non-SEE sources, including arrears, are estimated to have declined from
9.4 percent of sales in 1980 to 5.7 percent in 1981. The financial burden of
carrying stocks--they increased by TL 126 billion in 1981, is of concern to
the Government and it is trying to reduce the increase in 1982 to
TL68 billion, primarily by reducing the stock of fertilizers (see para. 87).
1/ This is a residual category, which also includes substantial off-budget
transfers from special funds, such as the fertilizer fund. See also
Annex VII, Tables I and 3.



- 39 -
77.      To bring SEE financing under tighter control, the 1982 SEE investment
decree set out a new policy: that fulfillment of investment targets is no
longer a justification for additional government funds. If operating results
fall short of projections, investment expenditures are expected to be cut.
Budget transfers have been severely limited, with those to manufacturing
reduced from TL62 billion in 1981 to a programmed TL47 billion in 1982, a
realdecline of 32 percent. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has made it
clear that "short-term borrowings and net arrears" should be reduced by price
increases, cost savings, or further reductions in investment. Failure to pay
debts to the Treasury, tax offices and foreign creditors will lead to
deductions from programmed transfers. The IMF is monitoring the overall
budget transfers to the SEEs. Since the manufacturing SEEs are where the
savings are significant, the Government's performance in containing the level
of transfers to manufacturing SEEs to the budgeted level for 1982, would be a
condition for tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4).
78.      In the medium-term, improved profitability is not the sole objective
of SEE reform, since their monopoly or semi-monopoly position often enables
them to conceal inefficiencies. Increased efficiency must also be a paramount
objective. If efficiency could be increased by 10 percent, enough resources
would be generated (TL 255 billion in 1982) to offset the need for budget
transfers. In the short-run, profitability may also be adversely affected by
the reforms. Salaries for high level staff may have to be tripled or
quadrupled to reach competitive levels. Liberalization of imports will put
pressure on prices, and wage costs may accelerate once union activity is
restored. On balance, the reform package nevertheless offers good prospects
for reaching the objectives of increased efficiency and enhanced profitability.
D. AGRICULTURE 1/
Background
79.      Besides meeting domestic food needs, agriculture directly accounts
for about half of all exports ($2.2 billion in 1981) and indirectly supports a
substantial part of industrial exports as well. Possessing a strong
comparative advantage in a vast array of crops, especially fruit and
vegetables and some cereals, Turkey's long-term potential for expansion of
production and exports is excellent. The Bank's ITS Report estimated
potential exports in 1985 could reach $4 billion if appropriate medium term
policies are followed. The Government's objectives in agriculture include
promoting rapid and sustained export growth, ensuring domestic food supplies
and domestic materials for industry. These objectives often conflict and
involve difficult trade-offs. Its policies in agriculture aim at reducing the
market distortions and interventions of past policies and include export
incentives, investment and production incentives for agroindustries, the
reduction or elimination of input subsidies and pricing subsidies, higher real
interest rates, and higher water charges. These policies are complemented by
a more flexible administration of floor prices and by a reorganization of the
major agencies to emphasize farmer support services.
1/ See also para. 20 of the Statement of Development Policies - 1982,
Annex IV-A.



- 40 -
80.      Developments in 1981 related to the SAL II program have been
described in para. 19 above. The real growth rates of agriculture production,
both gross value and value added, continued to decline in 1981 to about
1.3 percent and 0.5 percent p.a. respectively. This was principally due co
lower production of olives and tobacco and higher input prices. Farmgate
prices are projected to catch up in 1982 and restore growth of value added to
the historical level of 3 percent p.a. Export performance in 1981 was
nevertheless excellent, a 33 percent increase. Of particular significance was
the diversification of export crops and the opening of new markets, largely by
a group of new exporters (see also Annex VII, Chart II). This growth was
achieved in spite of a 16 percent decline in hazelnuts which formerly
accounted for about one fourth of agriculture export value. Exports of
lentils and other pulses were dramatically increased, the large but partially
recorded earnings from livestock exports were legalized, 1/ and the export of
barley expanded. Favorable prices for cotton and tobacco also helped.
Preliminary government estimates of increases in private on-farm investment
are not supported by lending data and private investment seems to have
remained stagnant and declined as a share of total investment.
81.      During 1981, the Government eliminated urban food subsidies and
required the agriculture marketing SEEs to cover their operating costs and
contribute to their capital expenditures. About 300,000 tons of wheat were
imported and sold at cost to stabilize wheat markets and draw out stocks being
speculatively held by private traders. The financing of agriculture support
prices designed to encourage production and stabilize farmer income was
rationalized in 1981 by eliminating direct budgetary transfers. Prices are
now set as floor prices without a subsidy element. Total financial outlays
were TL 180 billion, primarily to finance purchases of stocks. This was about
the same in real terms as in 1980, and most was for three major exports:
cotton, hazelnuts, and tobacco, and to sugarbeets, a key import substitute.
Export and Production Support Measures
82.      The Government recognizes that the potential for future growth of
exports requires capacity expansion. Thus, incentives to encourage
production, particularly for export, are being expanded. The Agriculture
Bank's (TCZB's) authorized lending volume for medium and long-term credits in
1982 was increased by 136.4 percent, which will help alleviate the current
severe shortages in the supply of investable funds. Specific investment
incentives were announced for integrated livestock fattening, slaughterhouses
and export marketing facilities. New programs are being instituted to augment
the supply of critical inputs, particularly high quality planting materials
and animal feeds. Seed and feed imports are now being permitted.
Public Investment
83.      The public investment program for agriculture in 1982, about
11 percent of the total program, is better balanced between subsectors and
focussed on a more limited number of projects. It has been established under
1/ Livestock exports increased from $108 million in 1980, to $258 million in
1981, or about 27 percent of the increase in agriculture exports.



- 41 -
more realistic assumptions regarding the absorptive capacities of the
implementing agencies than in 1981, when they were expected to double their
expenditures. Irrigation development will absorb 66 percent of sectoral
allocation, forest industries and grain storage 19 percent and agriculture
support and other services, 15 percent. Of particular significance is the
increased share given to extension and livestock services, from 1 percent in
1981 to 10 percent in 1982. The existing irrigation program has been
significantly rationalized; no new project starts are programmed and 2 of the
18 large relatively new projects have been dropped, and 15 either assigned
token allocations, scaled back significantly, or substantially accelerated.
As a result, 17 of the 69 major irrigation projects in the 1982 program are
expected to be completed by 1983.
Institutional Developments
84.      Progress in 1981 in the reform of the Ministry of Agriculture (MAF),
designed to consolidate fragmented services and thus provide better service to
the sector, has been described in para. 19. Provincial agricultural services
will be further consolidated in 1982 by decentralizing budgeting and
programming activities to them. In February 1982, a Government reorganization
decree enabled the general directorates in the MAF to be reduced from 35 to 13
and regrouped along functional, rather than commodity, lines, which should
considerably improve the delivery of services. Most important, the extension
services are being expanded and reorganized to provide integrated support to
farmers, adapted to the different regional conditions in Turkey. The planning
phase was completed in 1981 and the shifting of personnel and equipment from
surplus to deficit regions has been initiated. This effort, which is
supported by the Bank, involves about 15,000 of the Ministry's staff. While
well prepared at the national level, implementation problems may arise in the
field unless a more selective approach is evolved which focusses initial
efforts on high priority areas.
85.      The Agriculture Bank (TCZB), has been severely hampered by resource
constraints, a weak internal organization, cumbersome procedures, and
substandard accounting and financial controls. In 1981, the Government
installed new top management in TCZB and tripled its paid-in capital. TCZB's
1982 lending program gives increased emphasis to agriculture lending. In
January 1982, the new management regrouped its head office departments
according to functions, thereby eliminating overlapping responsibilities.  It
intends to simplify its chain of command with branches and decentralize
authority to its seven regional offices. To further improve coordination with
the Ministry of Agriculture, a modification of TCZB's foundation law was
submitted to the Council of Ministers in early 1982 which would reserve a seat
on TCZB's Board of Directors for a representative of the Minister of
Agriculture.
86.      While agriculture SEEs are not currently part of the SEE reform
package, it is anticipated that the reforms would be extended to them in the
future. They need to be allowed to function primarily as commercial entities,
dispose of inefficient or poorly located plant and equipment, and be
relatively free to rationalize their price and cost structures. In the



- 42 -
meantime, the consumer support role of the wheat purchasing agency is being
reduced, and emphasis given to food security and price stabilization. These
institutional matters will be further reviewed in an agricultural sector
mission scheduled for May/June 1982.
Fertilizer Stocks
87.      Stocks of fertilizers increased substantially in 1981 creating a
financial burden. Year-end stocks were roughly 2.3 million product tons, with
a value of about $300 million, about one-half the anticipated yearly
consumption, with the main excess in phosphatic fertilizers. This resulted
from faster than anticipated growth of production, lower consumption due to
the substantial price increases in 1980 and 1981, a decline in the use of
phosphatic fertilizers, an overestimation of the needs for wheat production,
and an undue, if understandable, caution in cutting back fertilizer imports
too quickly. The Government has instituted a program to reduce the level of
stocks to 1.5 million product tons by year-end through relaxed eligibility
requirements for fertilizer credits, a delay in further retail price
increases, a reduction of the import program, and encouragement to producers
to export about 300,000 tons of phosphatic fertilizers. The Government
recognizes that it has to strike a careful balance between maintaining
agricultural production by adequate fertilizer supplies and reducing the
substantial costs of carrying stocks. The Government program is based on 1982
sales of 4.3 million product tons, 20 percent higher than 1981, and 6 percent
higher than the previous peak in 1979, which may be optimistic. In the event
spring purchases remain low, additional measures will have to be taken.
Prospects
88.      In the short run, the reduction of input and price subsidies is
likely to have a negative effect on production and value-added. In the
medium-term, the removal of market distortions, more realistic pricing
policies, and the better provision of services should lead to the production
of a higher value mix of crops. The Government expects the growth of
production to recover to 3 percent in 1982 and exports to grow 14 percent. To
continue growth at these rates, a number of weaknesses in the program will
have to be addressed. The sector's good export performance in 1980 and 1981
was realized largely through diversion of current production to foreign
markets, a pattern which can not provide a basis for sustained export growth.
In the medium-term, the Government expects agriculture to play an important
role in meeting a number of conflicting policy objectives, including exports,
food security, employment, raw materials for manufacturing, and imbalances in
regional incomes. While the implicit trade-offs amongst these objectives are
complex and need to be more rigorously examined, some preliminary judgements
can be made.
89.      Broadbased productivity increases will be needed to meet production
and export targets. Thus, private investment must increase, and additional
measures to stimulate investor confidence will have to be considered if
recovery does not begin in 1982. In order to sustain export growth of
10-12 percent and resume past sectoral GDP growth of 3-3.5 percent p.a., the



- 43 -
composition of production will have increasingly to emphasize industrial and
cash crops at the expense of food crop production. Turkey needs to re-examine
its food policies which presently emphasize secure supplies of wheat, sugar
and vegetable oils from domestic sources, since substantial food imports may
be required to offset shifts in land use to cash and non-food crops. Plans
for further expansion of inefficient import substitutes such as sugarbeet and
some oil crops may have to be dropped. Further clarification is also required
of the sector's role as a source of low cost raw materials for industry, i.e.
the trade off between production of inputs for industry and for direct
exports. Implicitly, the provision of raw materials for industry has been
given high priority. The current pattern of export incentives does not reward
primary commodities, including agricultural produce, which may not be optimum.
90.      In the immediate future, the policy-making procedure for farm price
supports should be further refined to ensure that resource costs are kept
under control and production is encouraged where needed. In particular, farm
income support could be further de-emphasized as an objective, the number of
supported commodities could be further reduced, and a better statistical basis
for pricing decisions created. The new policy analysis unit in the Ministry
of Agriculture may provide the future basis for better quantitative analysis
and a more vigorous determination of support prices.
91.      In summary, the SAL program will underpin requirements for the
restructuring of the sector, and are important departures from the past.
These particularly include the plan to reorganize TCZB and improve its
financial capability, the reorientation of public investment priorities, the
reorganization of technical support services, and insistence that agricultural
marketing SEEs operate as financially viable entities. Nevertheless, more
needs to be done, and further actions to clarify the presently conflicting set
of sectoral objectives, and the related policies and incentives needed to
reach the Government's objectives will be reviewed in the planned sector
mission. The actions being undertaken in 1982 provide an essential foundation
for sustained export expansion and the recovery of sectoral GDP growth over
the medium-term.
E. ENERGY 1/
Background
92.      Turkey's dependence on imported energy, primarily petroleum, is one
of the main contributing factors to the structural imbalance in the external
accounts. Petroleum imports amounted to about $3.6 billion in 1980, and are
estimated at about the same level in 1981, about 40 percent of all imports.
1/ The program was set out in the Statement of Development Policy for SAL II
and described in the President's Report for that loan. The updating
Statement of Development Policies - 1982, para. 20 in Annex IV-A, provides
additional details on the evolution of these policies.



- 44 -
On the other hand, Turkey is relatively well endowed with hydropower and low
quality lignite, both relatively unexploited. The Government's policy is to
constrain the growth of energy imports by more quickly developing these
domestic resources while restraining the growth of consumption through demanid
management. This policy is supported both by the SALs and an intensive
program of project lending. The elements of the program include:
investmentsin high priority projects, conservation measures including frequent
price adjustments, encouragement of oil exploration, and institutional changes
devised to increase domestic capacity and efficiency.
93.      Energy consumption in Turkey in 1981, was estimated at about
33.2 million tons of oil equivalent, a modest increase over 1980, of which
about 42 percent, was imported. The per capita level of consumption,
0.7 mtoe, is somewhat below the average for middle income countries. Domestic
production of lignite, hard coal and hydropower is estimated to have increased
over the 1980 levels by 10 to 15 percent, and total domestic production of
energy is estimated to be up 8 percent. Imports of oil and petroleum products
in 1981, dropped in volume by 12 percent and in value by 3.7 percent. In
1980, system losses in the generation and distribution of electricity amounted
to about 15 percent of total power consumption. This has been reduced to an
estimated 13.5 percent in 1981 and further reductions are expected. The Bank
is currently working on an assessment of energy supply and demand and the
implications for energy policy, for discussion with the Government in the
first half of 1982. The preliminary findings indicate that to contain the
energy gap at sustainable levels along with reasonable economic growth, a
vigorous program to increase domestic supplies and pursue appropriate demand
management policies will have to be carried out.
Public Investment
94.      The 1982 public investment program reflects the priority accorded
energy, with the allocation for energy investments increased to 34 percent of
the total compared with 32 percent in 1981. The ratio of yearly allocation to
total project costs increased from about 7 percent in 1981, to about
10 percent in 1982. Several major projects of lower priority have either been
dropped or given a nominal allocation, notably the Elbistan B project. The
program also provides increased resources for reducing losses by improvements
to transmission and urban distribution systems, and to make better use of
existing plant capacity by providing more funds for spare parts. Several
energy projects of lower priority, such as the refinery projects, are still
included in the program, however, because of their advanced stage of
construction and contractual commitments. Overall, these changes mark
progress in the direction of weeding out marginal projects, giving emphasis to
priority projects, and making better use of existing facilities.
Prices
95.      During 1982, the Government plans to continue its policy of adjusting
energy prices to reflect changes in the cost of energy to the national
economy. Frequent adjustments are being made to petroleum prices to keep pace
with international prices and the changes in the exchange rate, i.e. by an



- 45 -
average 8 percent in December 1981 and another 5 perce-nt in February 1982.
Price levels for petroleum products, while not as high as some European
countries, are above international costs, e.g. over $2.0/gallon for gasoline.
Other energy prices are also being increased to cover costs: coal prices were
increased in March 1982 by an average 20 percent. Despite past substantial
increases, electricity tariffs and lignite prices do not contribute
sufficiently to future expansion needs due, in part, to the relative
inefficiency of coal and lignite operations.  Moreover, to encourage
substitution of domestic resources for imported energy, a possible alternative
would be to introduce a tax element into the price levels of imported fuels.
Conservation
96.      The maintenance of petroleum prices above international costs has
already had a modest impact on the consumption of petroleum products in 1981,
now estimated to be slightly below the 1980 level. To improve public
awareness of the need for conservation, a publicity campaign is now underway.
A financial incentive scheme was introduced in January 1981 to encourage
private energy savings. The current institutional and incentive arrangements
for encouraging energy efficiency, while well intended and heading in the
right direction, will require considerable augmentation if energy wastage is
to be substantially reduced. A vigorous, well staffed, energy efficiency
program is needed to carry out energy surveys, set efficiency targets, and
enforce regulations. A new conservation law is expected to be enacted in
1982, which will define the objectives and guidelines for energy conservation
in all sectors and will contain information, incentives, monitoring and
enforcement procedures. Once the scope for energy saving is better
identified, a program of retrofitting investments designed to achieve these
savings should be carried out.
Institutions
97.      The essential increase in domestic production depends heavily on
improvement in the capabilities of the energy SEEs and the greater
mobilization of private resources, especially in oil and geothermal
development. Besides the SEE reform package, which will cover energy SEEs,
several additional measures are being taken to strengthen energy institutions,
but improvement is likely to be slow. The amendment to the mining law
permitting private exploitation of lignite is in an advanced stage of
consideration and expected to be enacted in the course of 1982. In the
meantime, to overcome its capacity limitations, TKI 1/ has begun to make
greater use of private contractors in removing the overburden for lignite mine
development and for some mining as well. Improvements to the petroleum law to
encourage more foreign oil exploration are under consideration. Steps have
recently been taken in connection with the Elbistan project to improve the
implementation through the greater use of contracted management. The
institutional capability in the energy sector, nevertheless, still remains
weak, and will have to be further strengthened if it is to cope with the
10 percent per year expansion required to meet expected needs.

- 46 -
Prospects
98.      Overall, the Government's balance of incentives, institutional
measures and investment policies in the energy sector has shown a significant
improvement over the last year, but much more remains to be done. The most
serious limitation on the Government's energy program continues to be
institutional, with a number of deep-seated problems. The improvement in the
performance of the public energy agencies is fundamental to the success of the
energy development program and the containment of the increasing energy
deficit that Turkey faces. There is, however, a limit to what the coal and
power companies can be expected to accomplish, even if all the proposed
reforms are carried out quickly and effectively. In order to reduce
dependence on imported energy sources, a higher priority will have to be
placed on energy conservation, interfuel substitution, and the'development of
other energy resources. The potential exists for increasing the recovery of
oil from proven reservoirs, exploiting identified geothermal fields, and the
more extensive use of forestry resources and wood plantations for fuelwood.
Such developments would require a substantial expansion of the financial and
technical resources currently committed to these fields. The Bank's energy
assessment report and planned lending for energy and structural adjustment
will support additional measures to expand domestic energy production and
strengthen the major institutions as well as further improvements in
conservation and pricing policies.
F. OVERVIEW, PROSPECTS AND FUTURE ISSUES
Overview
99.      The Government's structural adjustment program as further refined in
the revised Statement of Development Policy for SAL III, represents a
comprehensive package addressing many of the key issues impeding Turkish
recovery and development. The development of a medium-term framework is
essential to guide and assess future policy development, particularly the
difficult trade-offs between objectives and the fine-tuning of existing
policies. Because external resource constraints are a major impediment to
raising the future growth rate and improving creditworthiness, the trade
policies are central to the program. The package of incentives and
institutional actions, together with constraints on domestic demand, is a
powerful stimulus for reorienting Turkish producers towards the external
markets. Trade liberalization is a necessary complement to ensure that the
bias towards domestic markets and uncompetitive production does not re-emerge
once domestic demand revives.
100.     The domestic resource measures are designed to generate the savings
needed for investment to support future growth. The tax reform package and
follow-up administrative measures, SEE reforms, interest liberalization, and
capital markets regulations are generating additional savings, although the
weakness of private financial markets remains an issue for future attention.
The efforts to reform the Public Investment Program will ease its drag on the
Turkish economy and speed the removal of bottlenecks to future output growth
and export development.    The measures to constrain aggregate demand have led



- 47 -
to idle capacity and limited private investment recovery. Nevertheless, the
investment which is taking place is largely outward oriented, reflecting the
current incentives for private investment. The efforts to attract foreign
private investment are appropriate to complement domestic savings. The
interim and long-term measures for SEE reform are also essential to improve
public sector efficiency.
101.      The policies and actions in agriculture represent an appropriate mix
designed to improve the institutions serving the sector and support the growth
of production, the major resource base for Turkish exports. Turkey may have
to become an importer of food, if it is to obtain the maximum potential from
agriculture exports. The policies and actions in the energy sector should
increase energy savings and improve production, thus reducing the growth of
energy imports, although the main institutions in the sector remain weak,
despite steps to improve them.
Medium Term Prospects
102.      A more systematic assessment of these policies, taking account of the
progress to date, has been prepared using a simple economic model. The
results of these projections are summarized in Table 10 below.

These projections are more optimistic than those presented with SAL II and in
recent reports, largely because of the favorable results in 1981; exports
reached $4.7 billion, $500 million more than earlier projections, oil imports
were $200 million lower than earlier projections and GDP grew at 4.4 perccnt
instead of 3.5 percent. In addition, the new projections take specific
account of the dramatic increase in overseas contracting in 1981 by
forecasting additional profit remittances in 1982-85 of about $300 million per
year and by increasing workers' remittances by 3 percent per year in real
terms. On the other hand, these projections continue to be conservative about
the prospects for containing oil imports, which are projected at $6.4 billion
in 1985.
103.     The projections indicate that, if appropriate policies continue to be
followed, the economy could regain a growth rate of about 5 percent by 1985
without unduly straining the balance of payments or domestic financial
stability. The current account deficit in 1985 is projected at $1.6 billion,
the gross capital inflows about $5 billion, and the debt service ratio at
about 27 percent. These results would be even more favorable if oil prices
decline; a $1/barrel drop in the price of oil would reduce the import bill by
*100 million. The high debt service ratios in the mid to late 1980s, are
partly the result of repayment of rescheduled debt which would amount to about
$1.0 billion in 1985 alone. The Government's targets for 1982 are consistent
with these projections (see para. 7 of the Statement of Development Policies -
1982). They expect exports to increase 25 percent to $5.9 billion and imports
to increase 12 percent to $10 billion. With workers' remittances projected to
increase to $2.8 billion, the current account deficit is expected to be around
$2 billion in 1982. GDP is projected to grow at 4.4 percent and inflation to
average 25 percent.
104.     The scenario for 1985 assumes no unfavorable developments in the
external environment and a stable domestic political climate. The crucial
assumption is an average annual export growth rate of about 15 percent in real
terms during 1982-85, highlighting the importance of the trade and investment
policies discussed earlier. Given the emerging trends, notably the factors
set out in para. 39, export growth of this magnitude is feasible. In the
later years, the recovery of private investment in both manufacturing and
agriculture is needed to support this growth. A second key assumption is the
modest growth of imports, about 6 percent in real terms, which depends on the
success of the Government's program to constrain energy imports.  If export
growth is significantly lower, or import growth significantly higher, the
balance of payments problems will continue into the mid 1980s. The
projections also highlight the importance of financing growth increasingly
with domestic savings. The scenario assumes that improved creditworthiness in
1982 would lead to access to medium and long-term credits from commercial
sources starting in 1983, which would gradually replace the current dependence
on concessional and official support. The eased foreign exchange situation
could permit a significant dismantling of the protection system, beginning in
1983-84.
105.     The cumulative impact of the tax reform and follow-up administrative
measures should keep the Government's budget deficit within manageable levels,
and the overall tax effort at above 20 percent of GNP. The massive



- 49 -
investments in infrastructure, particularly in energy, should begin bearing
fruit by 1985, and ease some of the constraints on production emanating from
bottlenecks and shortages. Continued but gradual improvement in the financia
performance of the SEEs may be expected, with profitability perhaps reaching
5 percent of sales and the contribution to investment from revenues staying
above 20 percent.
Creditworthiness
106.     At the end of 1978, Turkey faced an overwhelming debt burden of
$7.5 billion in short-term debt and $6.8 billion in M&LT debt.  Turkey was
faced with service payment obligations (mostly on short-term debt) of
$5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly three times the value of
merchandise exports in 1977. Over the last three years a series of large
scale reschedulings have been worked out including: $3.0 billion of
commercial and convertible Turkish lira debt finalized in March 1982
(repayments from 1985 to 1990); three consecutive reschedulings by OECD
creditors of $1.0, $1.1 and $2.5 billion respectively in 1978, 1979 and 1980;
and the consolidation of about $1 billion of unguaranteed trade credits
(8 to 10 year terms). Without these reschedulings, the debt service ratio
would have been around 29 percent instead of 12 percent at the end of 1980, or
short-term debt of $2.8 billion and M&LT debt of $14.3 billion. Nevertheless
debt service obligations are likely to remain high in the mid to late 1980's,
partly the result of repayments of rescheduled debt, which will amount to
about $1.0 billion in 1985 alone, and partly due to the need for additional
borrowing to enable the economy to achieve a modest level of growth. The debt
service ratio is projected at 27 percent in 1985 on the assumptions made in
paras. 102-104. However, the debt burden should remain manageable, provided
current policies are successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained,
and Turkey continues to receive further international support from private and
official donors. Turkey is beginning to explore with commercial banks the
timing of re-entry to the medium term commercial markets, possibly in early
1983.  In February 1982, Turkey raised its first medium term credit from
commercial sources since 1979 in the form of a $76.5 million loan with US
EX-IM Bank. The non-guaranteed portion was raised from a syndicate of
international banks at 1.5 percent over LIBOR for five years. To better
coordinate external borrowing by public and private agencies, a committee has
recently been formed under the Central Bank to review applications for
external borrowing.
Risks
107.     The Turkish economy is at a transitional point in its structural
adjustment process. Prospects are favorable but the risks are nevertheless
substantial and a reversal still possible. The risks include external factors
such as oil prices and the trade environment, the fragility of private
investment, the overhang of public investment and institutional weaknesses in
the Turkish economy particularly in key sectors like energy. There are also
costs to the adjustment process in the form, for example, of increased
unemployment and a decline in real wages which, if not addressed, may imperil
social stability.



- 50 -
108.     The factors underlying the remarkable growth of exports over the last
year have been analyzed in previous paragraphs. Factors which threaten the
sustainability of future export growth include the possible impact of a
revival of domestic demand, the instability of some of the new markets, the
sluggishness of private investment and the difficulties of increased
penetration in traditional markets at a time of a world-wide recession. These
risks are not inconsequential since the recovery of the Turkish economy and
its ability to service a reasonable level of debt, depends heavily on a
successful expansion of exports. Failure of the export drive, given the
dependence on imports, could mean that Turkey would have to resort to a
strategy of reduced growth as the mechanism of adjustment.
109.     Another major risk concerns the adequate response of private
investment to the adjustment process. Future export growth is dependent on
the revival and redirection of private investment in the medium-term. Perhaps
an inevitable consequence of the current stabilization process is the current
low level of private investment, although there are some signs of recovery.
The weakness of domestic demand, the inadequacy of the Turkish financial and
capital markets, high interest rates, and the lack of equity funds are the
major medium-term issues facing this recovery. For the immediate future, the
existence of substantially underutilized capacity in many industries offers
the prospect for expansion of production without further investment. But in
the medium-term, the current low level of investment will have to be reversed.
110.     The most important uncertainty is whether the Government's
determination to carry out some of the structural reforms will weaken, leading
perhaps to a resurgence of the old import-substitution and excessively
controlled style of economic management. The awareness of this risk perhaps
explains the emphasis being placed on institutional reform, especially within
the SEEs. This report has already noted that, whatever else, such reform
requires a fundamental change of attitudes, never an easy objective to attain.
Ill.     On balance, while these risks are serious, they are not
insurmountable. The demonstrated capacity of the Turkish government to carry
forward its program, devise flexible responses to new circumstances, and hold
steadfast to essential policies, gives confidence that the Turkish adjustment
program will continue to show commendable progress. The authorities are well
aware that 1982 and 1983 are key years for the success of the program. The
prospects of declining concessional funds and the increased need to resort to
the commercial markets, make it all the more important that the program be
kept on track.
The Costs of Restructuring
112.     The adjustment measures underway have entailed considerable
transitional costs, primarily in terms of depressed economic growth, increased
unemployment and distortion in income distribution. Despite some recovery
from the severely-depressed levels of 1980, economic activity in 1981 has been
constrained by stagnant domestic demand, and only marginal improvement can be
expected in 1982. Over the medium-term, if there is to be substantial
economic growth, private investment will clearly have to recover, particularly
as it has the greatest potential for export growth.



- 51 -
113.     While data on employment remain poor, they indicate a disturbing
deterioration in the employment situation, with unemployment increasing from
13.9 percent in 1979, to 15 percent in 1980 to the current 16.6 percent.
Around 600,000 new workers look for jobs each year, in addition to the large
number of currently underemployed. The economic slowdown has aggravated the
situation, although the rural-urban migration has apparently slowed due to the
high cost of living in the cities. The Government's concern with the problem
is clear from their mandate banning dismissal of workers in the private sector
(although it is continuing to reduce employment in SEEs).  It is taking more
positive steps through a new Social Housing Law, requiring an allocation of
not less than 5 percent of consolidated budget expenditure to a Social Housing
Fund each fiscal year, beginning in FY82. Over the medium-term, the
Government believes that the real solution to the problem is through a
resumption of economic growth.
114.     The available data on income distribution, indicate that there have
been marked changes associated with the acceleration of inflation in recent
years, in particular, a steady deterioration in the position of Government
employees and, to a lesser extent, industrial workers. Civil servants'
salaries have declined 53 percent in real terms since 1977 and are currently
less than half the 1970 level in real terms. Organized industrial workers'
salaries have declined by 48 percent since 1977 and are 60 percent below the
1970 level. Although the data are weak, it is probable the position of
agricultural workers has also deteriorated. The groups who have benefitted
from the rapid inflation are those in the service sector, particularly the
recipients of speculative profits. The substantial deceleration in inflation
in 1981 and the further decline expected in 1982, together with the recent tax
changes, have helped somewhat to reduce the skewness in income distribution,
but it will clearly take time before any major improvement is evident.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED LOAN
115.     The proposed loan is the third in a series of loans supporting the
Government's structural adjustment efforts, begun in January of 1980. The
main developments of the program have been described elsewhere in this
report. A letter from the Deputy Prime Minister dated April 24, 1982, sets
out the major refinements in the program and the new policy actions envisaged
for 1982 and early 1983. The letter and its updating Statement of Development
Policies - 1982, are attached as Annex IV-A. Preliminary discussions on the
possible content of the SAL III package were held with the Government in
November 1981, and the proposed loan was appraised in January 1982.
Negotiations were held in Washington in April 26 to May 3, 1982.  The
Government delegation was headed by Mr. Altinok, Chief Financial and Economic
Counselor of the Turkish Embassy.
116.     The proposed loan of $304.5 million (including the capitalized
front-end fee) would finance about 3 percent of Turkey's total merchandise
imports, and about 7 percent of the gross capital inflows over the
disbursement period (mid-1982 to mid-1983). The loan, a decrease in real
terms when compared with SAL II, is designed to continue Bank support through
the critical structural transition period of 1982 and early 1983 and has been
determined partly in light of the overall size of the Bank's lending program
for Turkey.



- 52 -
117.     Unlike previous loans to Turkey, the proposed loan would finance all
goods to be imported into Turkey except for goods financed by other sources
and a specific list of excluded items such as military or paramilitary items
and luxury goods such as tobacco, precious stones and jewelry, gold, and
nuclear reactors and parts. Counterpart funds would be deposited in a special
account with the Central Bank; the Government would use these to help finance
expenditures included in its development programs, as under previous loans.
While the Bank has not sought to influence the Government in its allocation of
funds, the Government has indicated that it would expect to continue to
allocate the funds to the most important energy projects including the
Bank-financed Elbistan and Karakaya projects.
Procurement, Disbursements, and Administration
118.     The satisfactory administrative arrangements made for SALs I and II
would be continued, with the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank bearing
the main responsibility for administering the proposed loan. Procurement and
disbursement performance has been entirely satisfactory. To speed
disbursements, the Government intends to continue its relations with two
foreign commercial banks who are providing bridge financing to cover the
period between payments and reimbursements from the proposed loan and
providing certain administrative services to facilitate the preparation of
withdrawal applications. To further simplify disbursement, the minimum amount
of invoices and withdrawal applications established under the previous loans,
$5,000 and $25,000 respectively, are being retained (Loan Agreement
Schedule 1, Para. l(e), Section 2.10(b)). The loan would be disbursed against
only foreign expenditures, with retroactive financing permitted up to $40
million of expenditures made after March 1, 1982 (Loan Agreement Schedule 1,
Para. l(c)). The retroactive financing is to ensure a smooth flow of
commitments and payments during the transition period between the second and
third loans.
119.     Imports would be made directly by actual users with imports costing
$10 million or more procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Certain
commonly-traded commodities may be purchased through price quotations from
organized international commodity markets. All contracts of lesser value
would be awarded through normal trade channels on the basis of normal
procurement procedures of the public and private sector firms concerned. The
procurement procedures of public sector firms provide for substantial
international bidding or shopping and are satisfactory. Firms in Turkey have
adequate choice of international suppliers to ensure reasonable availability
and price.
Monitoring
120.     Monitoring of performance under the SALs involves essentially two
complementary and inter-related activities: a more general monitoring of the
progress on implementing the program and the monitoring of specific progress
as a condition of tranche release. 1/ Time and data considerations place
1/ The Government's objectives are summarized in paras. 10 and 27.



- 53 -
limits on the actions that can be meaningfully monitored before tranche
release. Proposed conditions for release of the second tranche of
$100 million include:
(a)   satisfactory progress in the SEE reform including progress on
SEE legal reforms and progress in maintaining the level of
budget transfers to manufacturing SEEs below the budgeted level
of TL 47 billion for 1982 (paras. 71 and 77); and
(b)   satisfactory progress towards rationalizing public investments,
and constraining the level of public investment to conform to
available resources and stimulate the growth of private
investment, in accordance with the Government's objectives
(paras. 64 and 66);
(c)   satisfactory progress in developing the Government's procedures
and capabilities for preparation, evaluation, and selection of
investment projects (para. 68); and
(d)   satisfactory progress in import liberalization (para. 43).
121.     Despite the considerable progress to date, and the comprehensive
nature of the structural adjustment program, a number of issues and emerging
concerns are likely to be addressed more explicitly in future SALs. These
include further steps to reduce the impact of energy on the balance of
payments, to improve production and exports in agriculture, to address the
problems of financial intermediation and private capital formulation, and to
increase employment.
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
122.     The Bank/IDA has to date lent about $3,476 million, through 68
projects. Agriculture accounts for 20 percent of funds lent, industry and
DFCs (including structural adjustment) for 41 percent, power for 12 percent,
and urban development, transportation, education and tourism for the rest.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of March 31, 1982, with notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
123.     The implementation of private sector projects has been satisfactory.
Political instability, limited coordination amongst ministries, staffing
problems and the serious external and domestic financial crisis since 1977
have seriously affected project implementation in the public sector. A system
of joint project reviews between Turkey and the Bank was instituted in
June 1975. This has resulted in distinct, but modest, improvements. The
broad reform of the public sector launched in January 1980, and pursued with
new measures since then, allows cautious optimism that performance can be
gradually improved further, provided it is not eroded by new factors,
including shortages of resources. As of December 31, 1981, overall
disbursements amounted to 68 percent of appraisal estimates, which compares
favorably with other countries in the Region. This figure includes structural
adjustment lending which tends to disburse more rapidly than other project



- 54 -
funds, and also reflects good disbursement performance in the power,
industry/DFC and water supply sectors. Disbursements have been fair in the
agricultural sector and rather poor in the urban, energy and railways sectors,
due mostly to project-specific problems that are being addressed through
ongoing supervision efforts.
124.     Bank lending is aimed at supporting the economic policies initiated
in January 1980, especially: the pursuit of an export-oriented development
strategy; and domestic economic policies aimed at establishing a
macro-economic balance, increasing domestic savings, restraining public
investment and reorienting it to reflect the new Government priorities
(completion of ongoing projects, emphasis on quick-yielding new investments,
and balance of payments impact). The Bank has discussed with the Government
how its overall lending can best contribute to the latter's medium-term
objectives, and help remove past policy and institutional constraints. A
series of structural adjustment loans (SALs) is being implemented, at the
Government's request, to support the program of structural adjustments.
Agriculture, industry and energy will be the key sectors for project lending.
In agriculture, projects emphasize livestock, exports, and rural development;
in industry (including DFCs), the emphasis is on promotion of exports and
employment, and the gradual strengthening of the SEEs. Energy projects
underway are in power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite
resources; future projects will emphasize the oil/gas sub-sector and
coal/lignite. Projects for urban development and public utilities may
supplement these efforts. The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue
established with the Government in recent years is expected to be pursued on
key issues. The economic and sector work undertaken over the last 15 months
includes special studies of the public investment program, of
industrialization and foreign trade strategy, and of the energy sector, and
completion of sector memoranda on agriculture and industry. In addition, the
progress made in fostering structural adjustment will be monitored in the
context of each future structural adjustment loan.
125.     Besides the proposed loan, the remaining loans expected to be ready
for consideration by the Executive Directors in this fiscal year are for
sewage disposal and highway rehabilitation. Other projects being processed
include agricultural credit, irrigation completion, development of gas
reserves, rehabilitation of the paper and cement industries, and a supplement
to the Elbistan loan.
126.     The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was
6 percent in 1980, and is expected to grow to about 13 percent by 1985. Its
share of service payments is projected to increase from about 10 percent in
1980 to about 12 percent in 1985.
127.     IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, motor bicycle engines, piston rings and cylinder
liners, and tourism. It has also invested in the Turkish Industrial
Development Bank (TSKB). As of March 31, 1982, gross IFC commitments totalled
about $226 million, of which $87 million were still held by IFC. New
investment opportunities are being pursued.

PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
128.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of special interest are described in paras 43, 64, 66,
68, 71, 77, and 120 and listed in Section III of Annex III of this Report.
129.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
130.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 1982 I/
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44 million
loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Effective Date: March 20,
1974. Closing Date: December 31,1983.
Initial delays occurred due to difficult rock conditions and
inappropriate tunnelling methods. Political problems in 1980 further delayed
the project. In December 1981 the project was extended for a two-year
period. The main dam construction is progressing satisfactorily, with 95
percent of the earth works completed and the spillway ready for evacuating the
floods in the 1981/82 season. The installation of the power plant has been
started. The construction of the irrigation systems is progressing
satisfactorily. It will be completed and be operational for half of the total
area in the 1982 season. On-farm works are progressing steadily, with about
two-thirds completed. Tile drainage is expected to be completed in 1983.
Staffing of the extension service is satisfactory. Its backing up by
consultants is soon to materialize in a satisfactory manner. The project is
expected to be completed by end-1983.
Ln. No. 957 Antalya/Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project: US$40 million loan of
January 28, 1974. Effective Date: May 26, 1976. Closing Date: June 30,
1982.
Construction is substantially completed. The saw mill is ready for
operation and the pulp and paper plant is expected to start operation in
May/June 1982.
Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project: US$148 million loan of
June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
Project implementation had been delayed by critical problems,
including insufficient staff, inefficient management, inadequate coordination
among various agencies and unsatisfactory performance of civil contractors.
Following continuous Bank and co-lender reviews of the situation with the
Turkish authorities from early 1977, the remedial measures initiated by the
Government resulted in some improvement of project execution, until mid-1979.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

However, continuing and serious shortage of local funds then affected project
progress, which has been aggravated by staff and management deficiencies. The
Government's timely provision of adequate local funds for this high priority
project from the Structural Adjustment Loan counterpart funds has helped
resume momentum. The colenders and the Government agreed in November 1980 on
a detailed program of action to overcome remaining implementation problems;
this program is now being implemented. Further measures to strengthen project
implementation by strengthening site management with expatriate assistance,
increasing suppliers' involvement in equipment erection, and changing
contracting arrangements for the major civil works, and to meet remaining
foreign exchange needs are being considered by the colenders and the
Government.
Ln. No. 1130 Corum-Cankiri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of June 23,
1975. Effective Date: January 22, 1976. Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The project is in general progressing satisfactorily although because
of disruptions of construction in 1980, the irrigation works will be completed
only by end-1983. In November 1981 the closing date was extended 2-1/2
years. The Corum dam has been completed including the works to divert run-off
from 5 nearby watersheds. The Kumbaba pumping station is operational, and
irrigation has started in 1981. The Alaca dam, delayed because of extra
excavation required due to bad rock, is expected to be completed by end-1982.
Damage to the Alaca diversion tunnel, because of rock slides, has been
repaired and the tunnel lining is completed. Construction on the scheme's
irrigation system has been started. Contracts for completion of the dam and
for the irrigation system of the Guldercek scheme have been awarded and work
is in progress. The project extension service is operating successfully and
its impact on agriculture is promising. Village roads, small irrigation
facilities and most of the water supply and electricity works will be
completed by end-1982. The project is expected to be substantially completed
by end-1983.
Ln. No. 1194 Second TEK Power Transmission Project: US$56 million loan of
June 14, 1976. Effective Date: April, 21, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
Procurement action is complete, somewhat behind schedule, but
deliveries of some equipment are delayed. As of December 31, 1981, an amount
of $5 million was held in the loan accounts pending settlement of final
payments. Of this, about $4.3 million have since been disbursed. The loan is
expected to be closed shortly.
Ln. No. 1248 Agricultural Credit and Agroindustries: US$54.3 million loan of
May 5, 1976. Effective Date: May 11, 1977. Closing Date: June 20, 1984.
The ferryship component has been implemented, and the two roll-on and
roll-off ships purchased under this project and the First Fruit and Vegetable
Export project are now operating a regularly scheduled service between ports
in Turkey and two ports in Italy. The implementation of the agro-industries
component is delayed, mainly due to investors' reluctance to assume the
foreign.exchange risk. The Government is reviewing possible measures to
overcome this problem. The Agricultural Bank (TCZB) has introduced improved
lending procedures for its ongoing supervised credit program, and this

component is being implemented satisfactorily. After considerable delay, tht
consultants have completed the study of TCZB's structure and procedures. TC'i
has begun implementation of some of the consultants' recommendations. At the
Borrower's request, a cattle-fattening component of the Project, and $7.7
million of the original loan amount of $63 million allocated for this purpose,
were cancelled on May 5, 1977. Also, as provided for in the Loan Agreement,
$1.04 million for training was cancelled on December 22, 1977, following
approval of UNDP funds for this purpose.
Ln. No. 1258 Balikesir Newsprint: US$70 million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, 1976. Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The project is nearing physical completion. The newsprint plant has
begun operations and appears to be operating well. The sawmill is physically
complete but is not operating due to marketing problems because of a depressed
construction industry. Energy savings through using bark as fuel are not
being achieved since the Forestry Department continues to deliver logs with
bark removed. Remaining loan funds are being used for technical assistance
and spare parts.
Ln. No. 1265 Livestock III: US$21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976. Effective
Date: February 25, 1977. Closing Date: July 31, 1982.
After a slower than anticipated start-up, project implementation has
improved. About 760 dairy farms are being developed, more than anticipated at
appraisal, and a higher than expected proportion of sub-loans has been made to
small farmers. The Government is taking action to recruit 3 technical
specialists to help train the project staff and beneficiaries in forage
production and in strengthening extension services. If this action is
completed by end July 1982, the Bank plans to consider the Government's
request for a further extension of the closing date to permit utilization of
the remaining $8.5 million undisbursed loan funds.
Ln. No. 1310 South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure: US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date: March 1, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1982.
Though delayed, project implementation is now progressing
satisfactorily. Highway connecting the project area to Antalya and water and
electricity supply systems are completed, the construction of Kemer marina is
in an advanced stage, and all other major construction works are contracted.
The Government's request for a two-year extension of the closing date, and
some modifications in the project scope, is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1379 DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date: July 21, 1977. Closing Date: December 31,
1982.
The loan has been fully committed. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by December 31, 1982, which is the extended closing date. A
comprehensive study of DYB's institutional aspects and objectives is to be
carried out by the Government under Loan No.1998.

Ln. No. 1585 Northern Forestry: US$86.0 million loan of June 5, 1978.
Effective Date: October 30, 1978. Closing Date: March 31, 1986.
Depressed timber sales have reduced complementary funding for the
project but action has been taken to remedy the situation through stimulation
of sawn timber exports and expansion of housing construction. Revision of
forest management plans has been completed and proposals have been approved to
prepare new plans for all productive forest areas. Action for recruitment of
project consultants and fellowship training is underway.  Procurement is
making steady progress.
Ln. No. 1586 Livestock IV: US$24.0 million loan of June 5, 1978. Effective
Date: October 31, 1978. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The supervised credit program is behind schedule as demand for
sub-loans was affected by increased feed costs and low milk prices. Following
the Government's actions to correct the situation, the project is picking up
momentum. Recruitment of technical specialists is under way. Government is
reviewing measures to attract qualified staff and train them to provide
effective extension and animal health services to farmers.
Ln. No. 1606 Erdemir Stage II Steel: US$95.0 million loan of June 30, 1978.
Effective Date: July 30, 1979. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Procurement for the phenol treatment plant, the raw material handling
system and the hot rolled shear line has been completed. The depressed
domestic market for steel is affecting sales and internal cash generation. As
a result of lack of cash, raw materials and operating supplies have been
inadequate from time to time, and shortfalls of local funds for the project
are projected. The Government has agreed to reschedule some loans and
increase its equity. The company is considering approaching its private
sector shareholders for increased equity, selective price increases, and
seeking export markets.
Ln. No. 1741 Ports Rehabilitation: US$75 million of July 2, 1979. Effective
Date: January 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. Procurement of
equipment is well advanced, but a delay in project completion of about one
year is anticipated due to delays in finalizing designs of some equipment.
Technical assistance, training, costing and port sector studies, as well as
procurement of civil works are in progress.
Ln. No. 1742 Grain Storage: US$85 million of July 2, 1979. Effective Date:
January 21, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Project implementation has begun. Consultants have been appointed
for engineering design and supervision of construction. Preliminary
engineering designs for silos have been completed. A prototype of hopper
wagons has been designed and is under evaluation.

Ln. No. 1748 TSKB XIII (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$60 million
of July 12, 1979. Effective Date: October 25, 1979. Closing Date:
December 31, 1982.
After initial delays, the progress is now satisfactory with over 85
percent of the loan committed. Targets for SMI and least developed regions
are not likely to be met, because of current policies' impact on small
enterprises, the need to focus on rehabilitation of existing firms, and export
promotion projects. However, approvals of export-oriented projects have
almost reached targets despite depressed investment demand. The planned
program for training and export development has been implemented.
Lns. Nos. 1754 TSKB (US$65 million) and 1755 SYKB (US$15 million) Private
Sector Textiles loans of September 17, 1979. Effective Date: February 29,
1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The consultancy and extension service are now supplying useful
assistance to private firms. Only about 40 percent of the loan has been
committed, due to depressed conditions in the textile industry.
Ln. No. S-15 Ankara Air Pollution Engineering; US$6 million loan of December
12, 1979. Effective Date: April 4, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
Equipment for modification of the Seyitomer plant has been installed,
and is expected to be commissioned in April 1982. Pollution monitoring
equipment is being procured. Consultants are being selected for project
studies.
Ln. No. 1844 Karakaya Hydropower: US$120 million loan of May 21, 1980.
Effective Date: August 15, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1988.
Project implementation is making satisfactory progress.
Ln. No. 1847 Sumerbank Textiles Modernization and Rationalization: US$83
million loan of May 28, 1980. Effective Date: February 27, 1981. Closing
Date: June 30, 1984.
Project implementation is about one year behind schedule due to
de4ays in loan effectiveness and staffing problems in the project
implementation unit. Physical implementation is now progressing
satisfactorily. The plan for reorganization of the Cotton Textile Division
was approved by Sumerbank's Board in March 1982 and a contract for financial
technical assistance was finalized in February 19R2. The main problem facing
the project at present is difficulty in recruiting competent personnel for the
project unit due to salary limitations on State Economic Enterprises.

Ln. No. 1862 Livestock V: US$51 million loan of June 6, 1980. Effective
Date; October 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Project implementation, though behind schedule, is picking up
momentum, with the recruitment of consultants and progress in procurement of
goods.
Ln. No. 1916 Petroleum Exploration Project: US$25 million loan of November
24, 1980.  Effective Date:  June 30, 1981.  Closing Date:  December 31, 1984.
Geophysical and geological studies are making progress and seismic
surveys have begun. Recruitment of consultants for carrying out energy audits
is underway.
Ln. No. 1917 Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project:
US$62 million loan of November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. Detailed
engineering designs for the Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery sub-project have
been completed, and all major equipment ordered. The stimulation of the
Thrace gas field has been completed. Progress in separation of TPAO's
import-related operations is behind schedule, pending Government's decision on
overall SEE reform.
Ln. No. 1952 Labor Intensive Industry Project: US$40 million loan of
March 13, 1981. Effective Date: June 12, 1981. Closing Date:
June 30, 1986.
Sub-loan approvals (about $3 million) have been slower than expected
because of the depressed investment climate.
Ln. No. 1967 Second Fruit and Vegetable Project: US$40 million loan of
April 6, 1981. Effective Date: August 4, 1981. Closing Date: June 30, 1986
Projection implementation has begun satisfactorily. Recruitment of
consultants for horticultural production marketing and studies is underway.
The articles of agreement for the Regional and the Central Marketing
Corportions have been finalized, and the Government has initiated efforts to

A mission in November 1981 reviewed progress in carrying out the SAL
economic program, especially in the areas of trade policy, tax reform, SEE
reform and energy prices and found progress satisfactory. The second tranche
of $100 million was, therefore, released on December 29, 1981.

April 24, 1982
Mr. A. W. Clausen
President
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Clausen:
Further to my letter of February 20, 1981, I am writing to request a
Third Structural Adjustment Loan in the amount of $300 million in the Bank's
fiscal year 1982 in support of the Government's ongoing structural adjustment
program, which is being continued and vigorously advanced. The Statement of
Development Policies attached to the letter of February 7, 1980 and further
elaborated in the Statement of Development Policies attached to the letter of
February 20, 1981, set out the main features of the Government's policy
directions and actions for structural adjustment, and will continue to guide
our actions in future.
A number of significant developments have taken place since February
1981, which we would like to highlight for your attention. These include a
major improvement in tax revenues as a result of the tax reforms, introduced
last year, which are expected to reduce the budget deficit in 1981 and 1982
below 1 percent of GDP; a continuing liberalization of the import regime
designed to support export efforts, which together with the maintenance of a
flexible exchange rate and other incentive policies have resulted in export
growth of more than 60 percent in 1981; a drop in the current account deficit
from $3.1 billion in 1980 to about $2.0 billion in 1981; a continuation of
the stabilization policies which have reduced inflation to below 35 percent in
1981; the development of a major package of reform measures for the State
Economic Enterprises and interim improvements to their performance; and the
restoration of GDP growth to about 4.2 percent.
These policies and the additional measures which we intend to take over
the next several months have been described in detail to your staff. The key
features are summarized in the attached Statment of Development Policies
1982; they supplement those provided in 1981. Turkey is in good standing
with the IMF, with which we have a three-year Standby Agreement extending to
June 1983. Turkey has purchased the equivalent of SDR 100 million in November
1981 and again in March 1982.

STATEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT POLICIES - 1982
Introduction
1.     Faced with serious external and internal imbalances, the Government of
Turkey formulated in January 1980, a major medium-term program of Structural
Adjustments and took the first policy measures to begin its implementation.
The main features of both the program and the initial measures were described
in detail in the two government publications attached to our letter of
February 7, 1980 and further elaborated in our Statement of Development
Policies attached to our letter of February 20, 1981. Several additional
measures to implement this medium-term program have since been taken. The
structural adjustment program, which is an evolutionary process, is based on
the major principles of making our economy outward-looking and responsive to
market forces. The policy actions through which this process has been
vigorously advanced and will be continued, include the adoption of a flexible
exchange rate policy, those geared to promoting exports, liberalizing imports,
reforming the SEE sector, mobilizing savings through tax reforms and
liberalizing interest rates, rationalizing public investments, reducing the
rate of inflation, and generally creating new conditions conducive to
strengthening our external position and achieving a sustainable rate of growth.
2.     The purpose of this Statement is to articulate specific measures in the
macroeconomic areas, balance of payments, domestic resource mobilization,
public investments, energy, agriculture and SEEs that we are implementing in
the coming year within the framework of our medium-term restructuring program,
which we believe should be supported by the third Structural Adjustment Loan.
Macroeconomic Developments and 1982 Policies
3.     The major macroeconomic accomplishments resulting from our program and
actions taken so far include: a major improvement in tax revenues as a result
of the tax reforms, introduced last year, which are expected to reduce the
budget deficit in 1981 to around 1 percent of GDP; a continuing liberalization
of the import regime, designed in part to support export efforts, which
together with the maintenance of a flexible exchange rate and other incentive
policies have resulted in export growth of more than 60 percent in 1981; a
drop in the current account deficit from $3.1 billion in 1980 to about $1.8
billion in 1981; a reduction of inflation to below 40 percent in 1981; and GDP
growth of about 4.2 percent.
4.     In 1982, we expect the continuation of the positive developments
recorded in 1981. An increase of 4.4 percent in the national income has been
set as a target for 1982. Following the downward trend in recent years in the
rate of increase of the national income, which fell behind the rate of



- 73 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 3 of 10
population increase, and the stagnation in the economy, the realization of
this rate of growth is important, from the point of view of decreasing
unemployment, pulling the economy out of stagnation, and raising the level of
welfare. We are aiming at a further slowing down of the increase in prices
and bringing inflation down to 25 percent in 1982. Money-credit policies will
be diligently implemented during 1982; savings will be protected against
inflation and encouraged.
5.     The Consolidated Budget for 1982, an estimated TL 1,815 billion, has
been prepared with the aim of meeting these inflation and income targets.  As
a result of increases in tax revenues, we expect the deficit to be maintained
around I percent of GDP. The most important characteristic of the budget, in
view of investments, is to pursue policies which emphasize the traditional
functions of the State. Thus, we attach great importance to allieviate the
requirements of infrastructure, the lack of which was hurting the economy.
Moreover, the rationalization of the investment program in line with basic
economic policies and aims constituted one of the most important problems.
Therefore, during 1981 and 1982, the increase of efficiency in the public
investment program was taken as the main objective, and for this reason all
projects have been reviewed. In addition, regarding the SEEs, our fundamental
goal is to reform them while enhancing their financial and economic
effectiveness, and keeping costs at a minimum.
6.     We are considering the reduction and abolition of the out-dated
protectionist measures which have been implemented for years, and which not
only created undeserved earnings, but also inefficiencies. We consider
competition created by a correct imports policy, as a vital element to
increase dynamism and productivity in our economy. Consequently and to
prevent any arbitrary administrative distribution of our scarce foreign
exchange reserves, we aim at a gradual liberalization of our imports policy
over the next few years. A first step was already taken in 1981 to abolish
the "quota system"; a more liberal import policy will be implemented in 1982,
and any necessary protection will be granted through foreign exchange and
customs policies.
7.     We feel it is very important to pursue policies to increase our foreign
exchange earnings. Our target for exports in 1982, which is conservative, is
$5.85 billion and we could surpass this limit if we are not hindered in
foreign markets and if we can pursue our present policies more carefully. We
also expect workers' remittances will pass $2.8 billion. With imports
projected at $10 billion, we expect the current account deficit to be further
reduced to well below $1.8 billion.
Details of 1982 Policy Actions
8.     Trade Policies:  Actions to further stimulate exports and liberalize
imports include:
-    Since May 1981, exchange rates have been adjusted daily against
the major trading partner currencies, based on a mix which
realistically reflects our trade patterns; these adjustments will
continue in 1982;
-    Trading companies are becoming important for industrial export
promotion; tax rebates encouraging their industrial activities are
being simplified, and the coverage extended to fresh fruits and
vegetables;



- 74 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 4 of 10
Exporters will continue to be allowed unrestricted duty free
import of needed inputs and this benefit has been extended to
equipment and investment goods for export production or foreign
currency earning activities;
Tax rebates for exports, will be based on net foreign exchange
earnings from exports rather than full export value and export
credit incentives will take value-added into account; to ensure a
smoother flow of export production credits, the rate of subsidy
has been reduced, commercial banks encouraged to provide a greater
proportion of 'own funds' and the system of credits as well as tax
rebates streamlined and simplified;
According to the 1982 export regime, exporters will no longer be
required to obtain a licence permitting them to export;
The study on ways to establish a more effective export promotion
centre, with public and private participation, will be completed
in 1982;
- To ens..   a smoother availability of foreign exchange to exporters
without administrative restrictions, exporting companies are now
entitled to hold foreign exchange at the Central Bank to
facilitate small payments and business travel;
The 1982 import regime contains a number of features designed to
further liberalize imports, including simplified licensing
procedures, shifting of some items to the more liberalized list.
Furthermore, the more liberalized list now includes items free of
tariff, but subject to a flexible levy. This list would be
expanded in future years. Selective imports of basic products is
thus being permitted to exert competitive pressure on companies to
produce on a cost-efficient basis;
An amendment to the customs laws to permit bonded warehousing has
been submitted for enactment;
Drawing upon the results of the protection study now underway, we
intend to: (a) rationalize the existing tariff system; and (b)
gradually shift from a licensing system of import control to one
relying on tariffs. It should be recognized that the levying of
duties on items previously restricted or being moved from the
licensed list to the more liberalized list, may initially result
in tariff measures on those items. However, to the extent the
international trade environment permits, the main trend over the
next five years will be to continue to reduce tariffs to lower
levels.
9.     Tax System.  To improve its equity and efficiency, we have introduced
further adjustments since January 1982, including the gradual reduction of the
minimum tax bracket from 40 percent to 39 percent in 1982 and thereafter to 25
percent by 1985, and the immediate reduction of the corporate tax rate from 50
percent to 40 percent. The law allowing revaluation of assets to take account
of inflation is expected to be passed by mid-1982. Measures are also being
taken to generate additional revenue from the 1981 tax reforms, through a
major effort to strengthen tax administration along the following lines:



- 75 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 5 of 10
The budget allocation for tax administration in 1982, has
increased in real terms over the 1981 level; computerization of
tax returns is progressing and will substantially improve
collection efficiency;
-    Additional tax offices are being created in key tax generating
areas, and the number of district tax controllers will be
progressively increased over the next 12 months from the present
level of 350 to about 700;
w - Following the enactment of the law establishing the chartered
accountancy system, currently before the Consultative Assembly,
chartered accountants will be authorized to notarize and authorize
tax declarations.
10.    Domestic Resource Mobilization.  We intend to encourage the process
initiated by the liberalization of interest rates in 1980. In July 1981 the
ceilings on private bond rates were removed. We intend to continue using
Government bonds as an instrument to regularize interest rates in the market,
taking account of the rate of inflation. Given the current high positive
interest costs on non-preferencial credit, we are taking steps to encourage
the reduction of intermediation costs by the banks. The interest equalization
tax has been reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. To further reduce the
cost of working capital for industry, it is being rebated. The definition of
time deposits has been expanded to deposits exceeding one month. The
financial transaction tax was reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent in 1981
and eliminated for development banks and exporters. The same law allows
further reduction by decree. Increased equity requirements for commercial
banks and for new branches have been introduced and are expected to improve
the liquidity of the banking system, further reduce intermediation costs and
increase efficiency. Companies are now allowed to issue "profit-sharing
certificates" (non-voting stock) as a means of providing an additional source
of financing for those companies which have exhausted their bond issue
capacities. A major capital market law was enacted and the regulatory
authority brought into operation in February 1982. We intend to continue
vigorously encouraging the development of the capital market.
11.    Debt Management.  In order to improve our debt management, we plan to
strengthen the program for computerizing debt data by the provision of
additional full-time staff and by hiring specialized consultants in the
Ministry of Finance by mid-1982. Because of the importance of accurate debt
data in managing our external situation, we intend to prepare debt
information, including short-term debt, in an agreed simplified format every
six months beginning with December 1981.
12.    Foreign Investments.  We will continue our efforts to promote such
investments, and the Central Bank has hired consultants to promote them in
petroleum, tourism, mining and agroindustries, as well as review the relevant
laws and regulations in 1982. A revision of the mining, tourism and petroleum
laws in 1982 to facilitate foreign investment, is also under consideration.
13.    Medium-term Framework.  The preparation of the next five-year plan will
begin shortly. For this purpose, a medium-term economic framework will be
developed by early 1983, which will enable us to systematically evaluate the
internally consistent policies needed to achieve the intended structural
reorientation of the economy. We are also preparing: (a) a Transport Master



- 76 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 6 of 10
Plan for completion by April 1982; (b) an Iron and Steel Master Plan for
completion by January 1983; and (c) a crop pattern survey to provide more
reliable data. To enable a more timely adjustment of policies, the
statistical basis for policy decisions will be improved, including measures to
improve price indices.
Other Major Areas of Structural Adjustment
14.    Public Investment.  Major efforts have been made during the last two
years to bring the level of public investment in line with available resources
and to focus them on a more limited number of projects. This included
detailed discussions in September 1981 with the Bank's Public Investment
Review mission and a further intensive screening of the list of ongoing
projects. A major step in the rationalization and focussing of the investment
program has been made for 1982. The Government has reduced the list from
8,000 to 7,400, of which over 40 percent are expected to be completed in
1982. Full rationalization of such a massive program can only be an
evolutionary process that should take another two years to complete, given
various practical constraints including contractual commitments and the
advanced stage of many of the larger lower priority-projects. It is our
intention to continue our efforts to constrain the program to levels justified
by available and anticipated future resources.
15.    As a result of these efforts, we believe that the 1982 program can be
financed without adding any inflationary pressures, and without pre-empting
resources from private sector investment, which we remain committed to
fostering. The program is further justified by the need to complete
infrastructure investments in the shortest time to support the development of
the private sector. In line with our policy orientation towards stimulating
private investment, we expect the restoration of economic activity and the
recovery of private investment will lead to a decline in the share of public
investment in total investment over the 1982-85 period. Priority in the 1982
program continues to be given to the agricultural, energy, and infrastructure
projects in support of the policy that manufacturing should be increasingly
left to the private sector.
16.    In selecting projects for future programs, we will continue tot
(i)     Ensure that new projects meet economic criteria.
(ii)    Allocate available funds as a first priority to ongoing
projects which can be completed within 24 months, or which can
be brought quickly to an economic basis through rehabilitation
or rationalization.
(iii)   Give special weight to the foreign exchange impact and
employment implications.
17.    To improve our project selection and evaluation capacity for the
ongoing and future investment programs, it is our intention to restore our
evaluation capability primarily in the State Planning Office, supplemented by
that in key agencies and DYB. To achieve this, the Director for the unit in
SPO has just been appointed and a training program will be prepared in the
course of 1982 for the intended staff and agencies. These efforts will be
complemented by requiring SEEs to use qualified consultants to prepare,

ANNEX IV-A

or review, all new SEE projects. We intend to provide support for the
development of the local consulting expertise for this purpose. We would
appreciate Bank Group assistance in building up our evaluation capacity.
18.    SEE Reform.  The Government is taking steps to reform the SEE system,
with the overall objective of having a viable SEE sector responsive to market
forces.  We recognize that a basic change in the SEE system will require not
only time and significant legal reforms, but also consistent efforts to bring
about a fundamental change in attitude. Interim steps have been taken to
achieve improvements in performance, while carefully developing, and then
implementing, the fundamental reforms in the SEE system. Overall SEE losses
have been drastically reduced in 1981, and it is expected that SEEs would show
an overall profit in 1982 of about TL 47 billion. Such interim measures
include:
-   A radically new SEE financing and investment program for 1982,
under which programmed investment figures will constitute nominal
targets or ceilings. It is the responsibility of SEE managers to
realize investments to the extent that available resources permit.
Investment expenditures will not be accepted as an excuse for not
meeting operating expenses and debt payments.
-   SEE managers are primarily responsible for utilizing the present
capacity of their organizations in the most effective and efficient
manner. To achieve this, management has been given complete
authority to take steps to raise productivity and has been
instructed especially to adopt a financial and economic perspective
to complement their technical expertise.
-   The SEEs continue to be free to determine their own prices.  Prices
should reflect immediately, and exactly, increases in the cost of
petroleum and other major imports, and increases should be made
without delay, step by step, and in small amounts when necessary.
Decreases will also be expected to meet market conditions.
Recognizing some SEEs are monopolies or near monopolies, their
prices should take into account international prices.
-   Direct and indirect (through DYB) budgetary transfers to the SEEs
in 1982 will be limited to TL 243 billion, a significant reduction
in real terms from 1981. Of this, only TL 50 billion will go
directly to manufacturing SEEs. All SEEs are to pay their taxes
and debts in due time; otherwise these budgetary transfers will be
withheld.
-   A ministerial committee is now carrying out quarterly reviews of
performance of SEEs focussing on productivity and profitability.
-   Restrictions on new.hirings and reduction in the number of
authorized positions by 35,000 in 1981 and further reductions in
1982 by allowing filling of only 50 percent of posts becoming
vacant in eight major SEEs.
19.    A ministerial committee under the Prime Minister has developed a
comprehensive package for fundamentally reforming the SEE system. Based on
its work, the Government expects to submit draft legislation to the
Consultative Assembly by May 1982. Implementation would begin immediately
after approval.  The main features of the proposed reform package include:



- 78 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 8 of 10
-   All energy and manufacturing SEEs will be re-established as
companies under the commercial code, and be freed from the
restrictions of the SEE Law (Law 440) and the State Personnel Law
(Law 657). Profitability will be their primary objective.
-   To ensure broad consistency between SEEs, an enlarged High Planning
Council of the Government will provide general guidelines for
operations, investment and personnel policies of SEEs and direct
control by the ministers over individual SEEs will be eliminated.
All major decisions relating to individual SEEs will instead be
taken at annual general shareholders meetings.
-   Boards will be appointed at such meetings and the general managers
by the Boards; both for fixed terms of at least 3 to 5 years.
Performance incentive systems will be encouraged.
-   Responsibility for investment decisions will also be delegated to
manufacturing SEEs, and will not be imposed by Government. These
SEEs will have to find their own financing for those investments
they wish to pursue, as any private sector company would.
Government financing would be limited to equity participation.
-   Selling of SEE shares to the public will be encouraged through
improved financial performance, revaluation of assets and the
publication of financial statements audited annually by independent
auditors.
Major Sectors
20.    The major actions in progress, or anticipated, in the key sectors are
set out below.
In Energy. Recognizing the enormity of the task of increasing domestic
production of energy by several times by 1990 in order to contain imports at a
manageable level, the Government continues to give the development of this
sector the highest priority. Our policy is to increase domestic
investment/production through a focussed investment program, which balances
new investments with better use of existing facilities, and through efforts to
strengthen the major public institutions and encourage private investment.
Specific steps are being taken in the Elbistan Project to speed up execution.
The major elements of sector policies are:
-   The share of energy investment (including petroleum) in the 1982
investment program has been increased from about 32 percent to
about 34 percent and the funds focussed on a more limited number of
projects.
-   Greater priority has been given in allocating investment resourcs
to transmission and urban distribution systems through Illerbank to
minimize losses, and to the provision of spare parts to maintain
existing plants in service.
-   Expenditures are being increased for reforestation to support
fuelwood production.



- 79 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 9 of 10
-   Energy prices have been frequently adjusted upward in 1981, faster
than inflation and are now in line with international prices. We
intend to continue our policy of increasing domestic prices of
energy to keep pace with increases in the international prices,
while encouraging conservation, and stimulating the use of domestic
fuels. Our policy in coal/lignite prices is to cover production
costs under reasonable levels of operating efficiency.
-   A major Bank review of the sector was carried out in September
1981. We look forward to reviewing and discussing the report and
its recommendations in early 1982. We then intend to develop an
energy sector Master Plan for the new five-year plan.
-   A law consolidating the municipal distribution of electricity under
TEK has recently been passed, while the draft mining law permitting
the private production of lignite is awaiting passage.
-   A conservation law has been presented to the Consultative Assembly
for passage in 1982.
In Agriculture, our objective is to promote rapid export growth, while
ensuring domestic food supplies. To achieve a greater impact we are devoting
increased attention to integrating our activities in irrigtion, credit and
extension. The major elements of the sector policies are:
-   Agriculture's share of investment has been kept high, as in last
year, and the resources focussed on projects in an advanced stage
of development. For 1982, some projects have been redesigned to
speed up completion and there is greater emphasis on the completion
of on-farm irrigation works and small irrigation schemes in rainfed
areas where potential productivity is high. The program also
provides for increased farmer support services.
-   TCZ8's lending program gives increased emphasis to agriculture,
which will receive 80 percent of all new loan approvals in 1982.
To facilitate achieving this goal, TCZB's paid-in capital has been
increased and its authorized capital more than tripled. Proposals
for internal reorganization of TCZB to improve the efficiency and
resource mobilization, are at an advanced stage of preparation and
reorganization is expected to start by end 1982.
-   The reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture, to improve the
delivery of services to producers, will continue to be put in place
in the course of 1982. Provincial directors of'agriculture have
been appointed for 60 of the 67 provinces and are being given
authority to coordinate, program and budget for all agricultural
services in the provinces; this will be extended to all provinces
by the end of 1982.
-   A number of export incentives have been extended to agriculture and
measures taken to provide support for export production. To
encourage exports for the livestock subsector, we are taking steps
to improve the supply of feed including allowing imports,
developing the local feed industry, and liberalizing export

procedures. A study of the best means of improving seed production
will be completed in 1982 and imports of seeds are being
permitted; new credit facilities will be made available in 1982 to
stimulate the supply of high quality seeds by State Farms, as well
as by private producers. Further, we intend to improve
agricultural land use and production statistics in 1982.
TMO's role in the wheat markets has been modified and emphasis has
been given to its price stabilization functions. The agricultural
price support system has been further rationalized to reduce
financial outlays while continuing to stabilize the farm gate
prices of major crops.
All subsidies on pesticides, herbicides, and other plant protection
chemicals have been phased out and the subsidy element in retail
fertilizer prices reduced in September 1981 to about 40 percent.
To reduce the financial requirement in 1982, resulting from a build
up of fertilizer stocks in 1981, we have arranged to rationalize
fertilizer imports, exports and consumption.
