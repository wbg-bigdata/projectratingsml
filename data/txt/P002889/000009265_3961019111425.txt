MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR AN EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Togo for SDR 23.3 million (US$36.6 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. This credit would help finance an
Education Rehabilitation Project to reverse the decline in education sector enrollment and quality.
It would rebuild the sector in a way that is consistent with sectoral policy and medium- and long-
term development objectives. The Government and beneficiary communities would contribute
US$10.0 million equivalent.
2.    Country Economic Background. Togo is a low-income country with an estimated per
capita GNP of US$ 315 in 1994 and a population of 3.9 million that is growing at an annual rate
of 3.1 percent. The economy has traditionally depended on primary production, service activities
and exports of phosphates and cotton. Agricultural production is concentrated in food crops,
cotton, coffee and cocoa. About 75 percent of the active population is employed in agriculture
which accounts for about 38 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The service sector
consists mainly of commerce and transit activities.
3.    After two decades of uninterrupted growth above 5 percent per year, the Togolese
economy encountered growing difficulties in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of over-
rapid and financially unsustainable expansion of the public sector. Initial stabilization efforts were
tried, but recognizing the deeper-seated nature of the situation, Government moved to the first in
a series of structural adjustment programs in 1983. These programs have all been supported by
the LMF and by the Bank, most recently through SAL IV which was approved by the Board in
December 1990. The thrust of these programs has been to reduce external and internal financial
imbalances, cut back Government's role in the economy while improving its efficiency in use of
resources, and improve the incentives framework for private sector activities. Until early 1991,
substantial progress was achieved in implementing structural reforms, while significantly reducing
internal and external financial imbalances. During the adjustment period, Togo was one of the best
economic performers in Western Africa, with real GDP growth of 3.4 percent p.a. on average
during 1984-89.
4.    A deep political crisis was precipitated in 1991, when the regime came under increasing
pressure to establish a multi-party system. This interrupted Togo's successful economic recovery
of the 1980s. The period was marred by violent street riots and mass civil disobedience. A
national conference, convened in July 1991, led to the formation of a one-year transition
Government. Parliamentary and presidential elections were scheduled for July 1992 but political
violence disturbed the electoral calendar, paralyzing economic activity from November 1992
through July 1993 and leading to a collapse of Government revenue. The political situation



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  4
improved during the second half of 1993. In August 1993, President Eyadema was reelected for a
five-year term and legislative elections were completed in March 1994.
5.    The combination of socio-political turmoil and compression of Government expenditures
as revenues fell, exacerbated by the drying up of foreign aid, led to a severe contraction of the
economy. During 1991-93, real GDP fell by 17 percent, revenues dropped by 47 percent, and by
end-1993, the overall fiscal deficit widened to 14.5 percent of GDP. During 1992-93, the
Government increase of domestic payment arrears amounted to about CFAF 37 billion (10% of
GDP). The substantial drop in net foreign financing led to a marked deterioration in the overall
balance of payments. By end-1993, external payment arrears amounted to the equivalent of US$
111 million.
6.    The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994, the formation of a new Government in
June 1994 and the preparation of a three-year Policy Framework Paper (PFP) set the stage for
greater political stability and the country's economic recovery. The 1994/95-1996/97 PFP
provides the macroeconomic framework required for the resumption of structural reforms
interrupted by the political turmoil of the last three years. During 1994, the economy showed clear
signs of recovery and real growth reached about 11 percent spurred by increased production of
traditional export crops (cotton and coffee) and a strong recovery of mining and manufacturing.
The external current account deficit was lmited to 8 percent of GDP. The current primary budget
deficit was contained to about 5 percent of GDP. However, despite improved performance in
1994, Government revenues amounted to only about half Government expenditures. Togo's
budgetary situation is expected to remain tight in 1995, 1996, and 1997.
7.    Sector Background. Since 1984, recruitment of civil servants in Togo has been frozen.
In the education sector, this has given rise to a number of alternative and sometimes makeshift
arrangements, in order to replace retired or deceased teachers or to meet growing demand. These
arrangements have been extremely unstable, and have resulted in school closings and frequent
disruption of school programs and occasional strikes. The present fiscal crisis has exacerbated
these problems, with the most severe problems created in rural areas, because urban schools
frequently draw civil service teachers from rural areas to replace retiring teachers.
8.    The economic crisis caused a serious deterioration in the quality and access to basic
education, which was, even before 1990, characterized by inadequate budgetary allocations,
inefficiency, and lack of relevance to the needs of a developing economy. At a functional level,
many classrooms were severely overcrowded and teacher training was non-existent. The work of
inspectors, directors and other personnel was organized in ways that provided almost no
instructional support. Primary school enrollment ratios had been deteriorating, as had most
indicators of instructional quality. At 36 percent and 46 percent respectively, student repetition
and drop-out rates were among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and a disproportionately low
number of girls were in school. There were systemic biases in favor of urban schooling, and in
favor of higher levels of education. Secondary school teachers were often inefficiently distributed
and underutilized. In general, policy making and financial management have been highly
centralized.
9.    The general strike in 1992-93 brought the educational system to a complete halt for six
months, and further weakened a sector that had already been in steady decline for more than a



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                       5
decade. Following the strike, although classes have resumed, educational material is lacking,
many auxiliary teachers recruited by the communities are still not being paid and instructional
standards continue to fall as a result of a significant cut in inspectors' budgets and increased
reliance on untrained teachers. While the situation is serious across the country, it is particularly
acute in the Savannah and Central regions.
10.   There are a wide range of quality issues as regards teaching and learning outcomes
requiring immediate attention. The repetition rate is the most striking indicator demonstrating the
extent of the problem: approximately 35 percent of all students in the system, at all levels from
primary to tertiary, fail each year. Few textbooks are available, pre-service training has not been
offered in ten years, and there is little in-service training. Adequate information regarding the
quality of teaching and learning is unavailable. Statistical yearbooks are being produced almost
three years late; evaluation capacity remains weak. At present, there is no capacity for
systematically sampling the level of student learning outcomes, although evaluations of the system
prepared in the mid- and late-1980s already referred to declining levels of performance. Many
classrooms are overcrowded, with students numbering as high as 200 in urban Grade 1
classrooms.
11.   A number of features within the current Togolese education system mitigate against equal
schooling opportunities for rural children. The freeze on hiring teachers through the civil service
has meant that as teachers retire in urban areas, there is a tendency that they are replaced by
teachers from rural schools. This leaves the rural schools with a perennial teacher shortage, with
no other recourse than to finance teachers with whatever sources of funding are available locally
(parents' committees, inspectors' travel and operational budgets, NGOs, etc.). In the rural
Savannah region, for instance, 41 percent of all teachers are financed locally, whereas only 17
percent of teachers are financed locally in the capital city of Lome. The result is uneven teaching
quality for children in rural areas, and significantly fewer opportunities to attend school and to
advance through the grades. The net schooling rate in the country is estimated by MENRS at 61
percent (1993-94), although statistical data are not reliable and enrollment rates vary from
approximately 85 percent in the capital region to only 30 percent in the rural Savannah region.
The lack of school mapping capacity has been a handicap to efforts to establish a sector expansion
program sensitive to gender equity concerns. It also hinders the development of schooling in rural
areas.
12.   The nation's female literacy rate is substantially lower than that among men (31 percent
versus 52 percent). In rural areas the situation is worse as less than 15 percent of women are
literate. The percentage of female students in the educational system remained low, and relatively
unchanged, over the period 1980-90. The most striking feature concerning girls' schooling is that
initial enrollment of girls is relatively positive (42 percent of the total), but that girls drop out of
the system at astonishingly high rates: by the first year of secondary schooling, they represent
only 29 percent of the total; by the last year of secondary schooling this figure has dropped to 12
percent. It is clear that the impact of Togo's high repetition rates is borne disproportionately by
the female students, for whom repetition commonly leads to dropout. In several respects, the
economic crisis has increased gender disparities. Female students have been less likely to return to
school after the end of the strike. The findings of recent Bank sector work on girls' schooling in



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                   6
Togo will provide an important input for the Quality Schools Initiative of the project, as well as
future interventions in this area.
13.   The institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education for budget planning is weak.
Resource allocation within the sector does not match the stated priorities of the Government.
The education sector's share of the national budget has dropped from 28 percent to 19 percent,
slightly below the francophone average for Sub-Saharan Africa of 22 percent; higher education
receives about 25 percent of this total (1995) even though it serves only 1 percent of the students.
Secondary education receives 34 percent of the total, while primary education receives a relatively
low 41 percent of the overall sector budget.
14.   The breakdown of the budget by expenditure category reveals a number of imbalances.
Prior to the current economic crisis, salary expenditures in the primary education budget, for
instance, consumed approximately 98 percent of total non-administrative expenditures, leaving
very little for the purchase of textbooks, chalk and other pedagogical inputs. The situation has
further deteriorated since then, with non-salary operating expenditures now accounting for less
than one percent of primary expenditures (excluding central administration).
15.   Project Objectives. The Project seeks to halt the degradation in educational services in
Togo and to strengthen institutional capacity conducive to developing longer-term reform. It
does this by focusing interventions in two areas: (a) improving the quality of schools through
school construction and rehabilitation, textbook provision, and the introduction of school-based
experiments in teaching and learning processes through the Quality Schools Initiative; and (b)
developing better education system management through decentralized recruitment and financing
of teachers and development of system management tools. This would include establishing five
regional school boards and a decentralized Education Support Fund. Beyond its role as a conduit
for the funding of auxiliary teachers' salaries, the Fund is seen as a tool for enabling more
decentralized management of schools by regional school boards. The project would thus lay the
foundation for much greater school-level involvement in developing more effective teaching and
learning processes, ensure the availability of teachers at the primary school level by helping
stabilize the current auxiliary teacher situation, and consolidate gains from an earlier Ministerial
restructuring by focusing Ministry functions around the instructional process.
16.   Project Description. The project's support to the implementation of education sector
policy and strategy would be provided through two components corresponding to the two
objectives of the operation. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan is shown in
Schedule A.
(a)   Improving the Quality of Schools:  To bring school facilities back to acceptable
minimum standards and to establish conditions within schools that are more supportive of
improved teaching and learning, this component would support: (i) the rehabilitation of 440
classrooms and the construction of 360 primary classrooms; (ii) the reprinting, purchase and
distribution of approximately 2,300,000 primary school textbooks and 41,000 teachers' guides and
the purchase and distribution of an initial stock of approximately 510,000 textbooks for lower-
secondary schools and 20,000 teachers' guides; (c) in-service teacher training programs, including
training for teachers in the use of textbooks; (d) training for school directors and parents'
associations in management of textbook stocks; and (e) the implementation of an experimental



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                     7
Quality Schools Initiative, including a series of school-based "action research" projects at
selected primary schools. A total of 50 action-research programs, and 300 small grants in schools
and school clusters are planned.
(b)   Developing Better Education System Management: This component would support
the gradual decentralization of sector management, administration and financing. This would
involve the establishment of regional school boards and the development of criteria for
decentralized personnel management and financing, including the establishment of a decentralized
Education Support Fund for the payment of auxiliary teachers. Under the project, additional
financing for teachers' salaries would be mobilized. Initially, resources would pass through
budgetary accounts, but when the Education Support Fund has been established under the project,
resources would pass through it. The following resources would be mobilized: (i) Government
budgetary allocations, constituting counterpart funding to the project, would be increased in line
with savings from attrition in the civil service (teacher) wage bill; (ii) community and parent
contributions resulting from school fees and other community sources to be identified. As these
resources are insufficient to meet the full cost of auxiliary teachers' salaries in the early years of
the project, IDA would finance part of the incremental cost for primary auxiliary teachers on a
declining basis (declining from 80 percent to 40 percent over the life of the project). This
component would also support the development of key management capacities at all levels of the
system. A functional audit of MENRS personnel would be a first step in secondary school teacher
redeployment. In addition, this component would support seminars and field surveys aimed at:
preparing budgetary programming models and establishing standard operating procedures and
reorganizing inter-departmental and inter-ministerial communications. Based on the above process
of ministerial restructuring, as well as the initial findings of the Quality Schools Initiatives, the
project would provide for periodic yearly training seminars for all school directors, pedagogic
counselors, inspectors, and teacher trainers.
17.   Project Implementation. Project coordination and monitoring would be ensured by a
Steering Committee which was created during project preparation. It is comprised of key
departmental directors and chaired by the Minister. The Steering Committee would also be
responsible for organizing and participating in annual reviews and a mid-term review of project
progress. Specific implementation matters, such as procurement, disbursements and project
accounting, would be handled by the Division for Financial Affairs (DAF) of the General
Directorate for Education Planning. Other line agencies with responsibility for project
implementation are the Directorates for Primary and Secondary Education and the Directorate for
Continuing Training & Pedagogical Action Research. In addition, an interministerial committee
has been established to address links between education and economic development, given the
importance of intersectoral re-allocation of resources in favor of the social sectors.
18.   Project Sustainability. The initiatives to improve the overall quality of the education
system have been developed through a participatory approach designed to promote ownership by
all stakeholders and through continued Bank commitment to support the emergence within
MENRS of a results-oriented culture. In line with the education sector strategy that evolved from
this process, the Government seeks to build a more stable environment for teaching and learning
over the next five years through this project. The project would build on the few positive features
of the current auxiliary teacher situation (decentralized control, community participation), in order



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  8
to develop a stable, region-based approach for hiring and supervising auxiliary teachers. This is
an important step towards broader education sector reforms which would support
macroeconomic and civil service reforms. It is also an essential step for ensuring the presence of
teachers in classrooms, improving teachers' productivity and morale, and for reversing declining
enrollment trends. By strengthening education system management and assuring greater
availability of resources for the sector, the project would thus enhance sustainability. The
sustainability of the data collection, dissemination and monitoring operations supported by this
project would be enhanced through ongoing training of MENRS personnel.
19.   Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. The Bank's previous involvement in the
education sector in Togo underscores the need to pay attention to how the broad policy
environment affects issues of implementation, sustainability and quality. Both the Educational
Improvement Project and the ongoing Vocational Education and Training Project provide
compelling examples of these concerns. The lack of a coherent strategy to deal with insufficient
funding of recurrent costs, especially for teacher financing, has been a key issue. This created an
unstable and unproductive teacher situation at all levels of the system and led to widespread
teacher shortages. The provision of science laboratory facilities to secondary schools, which was
a key part of the Education Improvement Project, ultimately did not contribute to improved
learning outcomes because school directors lacked the capacity to reorganize classroom
instruction patterns. The attempt to develop national pre-service teacher training institutions did
not succeed because of the Government's inability to provide the recurrent costs associated with
this investment project. Most primary pupils, especially in the rural areas, did not have access to
textbooks provided under the Education Improvement Project because of inability to pay. These
problems have further demonstrated that meeting specific resource needs may be insufficient to
produce sustainable improvement in teaching and learning in the absence of complementary
measures designed to strengthen educational planning and management both at the central and
school levels, as well as beneficiary involvement.
20.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is closely linked with the objectives of the
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (being presented together with this Project to the
Executive Directors) which assigns a high priority to the education sector and stresses the central
role of human resource development in the economic renaissance of the country. As a result of the
education sector dialogue over the past three years between Government, IDA and other donors,
a two phase strategy for the rehabilitation and longer term development of the education system
has been prepared. This is summarized in the Government's Letter of Education Sector Policy.
The proposed operation would support the first phase. It is designed to halt the degradation of
education services following the general strike of 1992-93 by ensuring the availability of teachers,
pedagogical materials and classrooms and providing support for decentralizing management and
financing of the educational system. IDA has been one of the principal donors to Togo's education
system for over a decade and has contributed to developing an investment-based, program-
oriented approach to sector management. As part of the sector dialogue for the last three years,
IDA has taken the lead in helping reorient the decision making process--outside and inside the
MENRS--toward a coherent program-based approach to sector management. IDA financing of
the proposed project would ensure the continuity of our dialogue and would enable MENRS to
reach the sectoral goals that it has established for the next five years and prepare for the second
phase, which the Bank also expects to support. The Country Assistance Strategy stresses that the



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  9
development of the education sector must be pursued within a difficult macroeconomic
framework. Sectoral policy would be monitored closely in this regard over the life of the project.
21.   Donor Coordination. Among donors, IDA has taken the lead in the policy dialogue with
Government. Discussions have been held with all of the principal actors who have historically
been active in the sector, although many donors have suspended activities in the country. The
African Development Bank (AfDB) has supported the Vocational Education and Training
subsector to rehabilitate three lower secondary vocational training centers. The AfDB has also
begun to replace 360 classrooms in the central region of the country. The European Union is also
considering providing support to the primary education sector. The Japanese Government has
already financed the purchase of library books and is considering the construction of a number of
primary classrooms in urban areas.
22.   Actions Agreed. The Government has submitted to IDA a signed Letter of Education
Sector Policy. During negotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) deposit into the Project
Account, promptly before each calendar quarter starting after the Effective Date, sufficient funds
to pay the Borrower's contribution to the financing of the project required for such calendar
quarter, as estimated by the Borrower in agreement with IDA; (b) prepare, on the basis of
guidelines acceptable to IDA, and furnish to IDA not later than six months after the Closing Date,
a plan for the future operation of the project; (c) redeploy teaching personnel at the secondary
school level in accordance with the objectives and timetable set forth in the Government's
strategy laid out in the Letter of Education Sector Policy; (d) issue an Arrete (decree) acceptable
to IDA not later than March 31, 1996, for the establishment and operation of a textbook loan and
decentralized rental mechanism for primary and secondary school students respectively, to
include, inter alia, provisions relating to management responsibilities, reporting and audit
requirements; (e) undertake with IDA not later than November 30, 1996 and, thereafter, not later
than November 30 of each subsequent year, a joint annual review of the Project, to exchange
views generally on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the project and on the
performance by the Borrower; (f) prepare and submit to IDA, not later than four weeks before the
scheduled date of the annual reviews, a report of project activities of such scope and in such detail
as IDA may request; (g) as part of the mid-term review, adopt an action plan, satisfactory to IDA,
and promptly thereafter, implement such plan; and (h) adopt an action plan with a timetable,
satisfactory to IDA, not later than March 31, 1996, describing a program of actions and measures
necessary to the creating of a decentralized Education Support Fund and implement promptly the
action plan. As conditions for credit effectiveness, the Government would have: (a) adopted a
Project Implementation Manual; (b) employed independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (c)
prepared and furnished to IDA bidding documents, satisfactory to IDA, for the goods scheduled
to be procured during the first twelve months after the Effective Date; (d) employed the
consultants whose services are required during the first twelve months after the Effective Date;
and (e) opened the Project Account and deposited therein the initial deposit in an amount in CFA
francs equivalent to US$ 250,000.
23.   Poverty Category. The project is part of the Program of Targeted Interventions. The
findings and recommendations of project preparation studies, carried out in a participatory way,
have been fully integrated into Government's education sector strategy and project design. The
Quality Schools Initiative and the decentralized recruitment and financing of teachers represent



Education Rehabilitation Project                                                    10
important aspects of the Government's strategy to reduce poverty and improve the access of the
poor and vulnerable groups to basic education services.
24.   Environmental Aspects. The project is rated C for its negligible environmental impact.
The implementation of this project would lead to the improvement of sanitary conditions in
schools and the promotion of hygiene among school children.
25.   Program  Objective Categories.  Reflecting the emphasis on improving access and
quality at the primary and secondary school levels, this operation is classified in the Poverty
Reduction and Human Resource Development objective category.
26.   Participatory Approach. Project preparation has been a broadly participatory process,
involving a series of workshops, some of which took place at the local level and involved
community members, as well as regional school personnel. The supervision of the project would
include annual review meetings and a mid-term review with representation of all stake holders
involved in the sector as weD as beneficiary assessments.
27.   Project Benefits.  The main benefits of the proposed project would be improved
education quality and access as a result of a more adequate supply of primary school teachers,
rebuilding of infrastructure badly damaged by recent vandalism and neglect, and greater
availability of pedagogic materials at the primary and secondary school levels. The institutional
capacity building carried out under the project would be an essential step for ensuring the
presence of teachers in classrooms and for reversing declining enrollment trends. The
establishment of consultative regional school boards and a region-based Education Fund in
parallel with regional non-civil service teaching bodies, would present the potential for a
significant reduction in unit salary costs as well as a corresponding opportunity for increasing the
number of teachers in place and for reallocating the sectoral budget in favor of needed non-salary
operating expenditures.
28.   Risks. The main risks of the project are the politically unstable environment which could
significantly increase the likelihood of implementation delays and difficulties in assuring adequate
budgetary resources to finance Government's counterpart contribution including payment of
auxiliary teachers. Other risks to achievement of project objectives are Government's capacity to
address broad institutional, finance and political issues critical to the success of the reform
program and low sectoral capacity to oversee the Quality Schools Initiative on an ongoing basis.
The risks presented by the politicaDly unstable environment are addressed to some extent in
project design, with an emphasis on working teams supported by coordinated short-term
interventions of external expertise. Budgetary issues are addressed through up-front agreement
on budget targets that are included in Government's Letter of Education Sector Policy and that
will be monitored through a planned Public Expenditure Review, and annual budget reviews. The
Government's commitment to address institutional capacity issues has been expressed through its
Letter of Education Sector Policy which includes specific institutional reform targets; these would
be closely monitored throughout project implementation. The issue of low sectoral capacity to
oversee the Quality Schools Initiative would be addressed through the use of short-term
consultancies to provide training and research experience to Ministry and University of Benin
personnel, who would in turn provide training to inspectors and pedagogic counselors on an
ongoing basis.

years of crisis since 1990 and the percentage of problem projects in the portfolio soared to 75 percent. Following
the return of normalcy in the country, Government and IDA gave a high priority to restoring satisfactory
execution performance ratings of the portfolio and restructure it to meet immediate priorities. In addition, two
problem projects were closed in early FY1995 and Government is expected to take the measures needed to
redress the execution of the one problem project remaining in the portfolio. Given the unavailability of
counterpart funds and the slow resumption of external assistance, IDA agreed to waive counterpart funds
requirements until June 1995. Disbursement indicators are improving and most overdue audits have been
produced. A Country Portfolio Performance Review, attended by all key ministers and senior staff finalized
restructuring arrangements. To maintain satisfactory performance, it recommended: i) to produce annual
operational audits to assess project management performance and address systemic deficiencies in project
execution; and ii) to include beneficiary assessments as components of annual audit reports for key projects.
Annual CPPRs will be held thereafter. Finally, the Resident Mission is expected to increase its role in project
preparation and supervision and in providing implementation assistance to the government and, to that end, its
local staff are trained in procurement, disbursement and audit procedures.
