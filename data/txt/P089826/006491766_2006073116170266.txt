Principal Payment Date (
“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan 
have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the 
principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the 
Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first

(a) 
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn 
as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with 
paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 
 
(b) 
Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall 
be repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of 
such withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by 
multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in 
the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal 
Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) and the denominator 
of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares 
for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such 
amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
Page  12
11 
 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a 
Currency Conversion applies. 
 
3. 
(a) 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior 
to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of 
calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal 
and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this 
paragraph, if at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system 
under which invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal 
Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no 
longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, 
upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan 
Balance to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the 
Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal Payment Date 
occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank 
by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately 
prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the 
Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 
 
5. 
If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan 
Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the 
amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.
