APPRAISAL OF TUE INiAIROBI ALITER SUPPLY PROJECT
SUJI'IARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.         This report covers the appraisal of a project for additional
water supply facilities for the city of Nairobi for which a Bank loan
of US$8.3 million equivalent is proposed. Nairobi, Kenya's capital,
currently has a satisfactory water system but it must be expanded to
meet future needs. Unless the public water supply system keeps pace
uiith Nairobi's population growth, commerce, industry and individuals
will be forced to supplement or install separate water systems at a
greater overall cost to the eccnomy; in addition, public health may
suffer and the tourist industry, Kenya's most important source of foreign
exchange, may be adversely affected.
ii.        The existing water supply facilities in Nairobi are almost
fully utilized. Ilinor expansions and improvements are underway to increase
the supply and meet demand until 1973-7h. Development of a reliable new
source to meet future demand must be started now if future water shortages
are to be avoided. The project would form the first phase of a long-
range development of the Chania River and meet anticipated water demand
through about 1980.
iii.       The project consists of construction of an intake on the
Chania River (about 25 miles north of Nairobi), a pumping station, a
modern water treatment plant, a transmission main to Nairobi, a terxinal
reservoir and distribution system improvements and extensions including
provision of water meters.
iv.        The financial requirements of the project total US$13.4 million,
consisting of US$12.1 million estimated project costs and US$1.3 million
estimated interest and commitment charges on the Bank loan. The Bank
loan would finance the total foreign exchange costs amounting to about
62% of the total requirements. The balance would be financed from
internally generated funds from the city's water operations. The supply
and construction contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
campetitive bidding.
v.         The Borrower would be the City Council of Nairobi (NOC) and the
loan would be guaranteed by the Government of Kenya. The city has been
well managed financially and is creditworthy. In past years, its opera-
tions have resulted in surpluses. The water and sewierage functions
formerly carried out by the City Engineering Department have been reor-
ganized into a New Water and Sewerage Department which will be responsible
for the project.



- ii -
vi.        NCC increased the water rates in April 1970.  Based on these
increased rates and a further 20% increase in 1972, the internal
financial rate of return on the project is estimated between 10% and 15%.
vii.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$8.3 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE RI\ROBI WIATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The City Council of Nairobi (NCC) has applied for a loan to
help finance a project to improve and expand its water supply facilities.
The project is estimated to cost about US$12.1 million equivalent including
foreign exchange costs of US$7.0 million equivalent. A loan of US$8.3
million is proposed to cover the foreign exchange costs and interest
during construction on the Bank loan estimated at US$1.3 million equivalent.
The local currency costs of the project would be financed by funds
generated from NCC's water operations.
1.02       In response to NCC's application to the Bank for financial
assistance for the project, a mission visited Nairobi in May 1967. At
that time, the proposal was to obtain additional water from a new reservoir
to be formed by damming the Cnania River and field investigations were
in progress.  Project cost was estinated at about US$25 million and the
expected additional supply was about 12 DMgd. The Bank requested addi-
tional information in order to determine the justification of the project.
1 .03      At the request of the Minister for Agriculture, in September
1968, a Bank mission reviewed the status of preparation and scope of the
project with the Government, NCC and its consultants. The mission
recommended consideration of alternative sources and methods of supply,
which were again examined by the consultants. The project, which increases
capacity at much less cost than the original proposal, was finally agreed
upon during appraisal.
1.04       The project includes construction of a weir on the Chania
River, a raw water pumping station, a water treatment plant, a 24-mile
long transmission main to Nairobi, a terminal reservoir and the strengthen-
ing and expansion of the distribution system. The new works will have
a capacity of 10 IMgd.
1.05       The appraisal of this project was carried out by a mission
composed of Messrs. Lamson-Scribner, Rajagopalan and Ljungh which visited
Nairobi in October-November 1969.
II. WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR IN KFPYA
A. RELATION TO KENYAN ECONOMY
2.01       Predominantly an agricultural ccuntry, Kenya occupies an area
of some 225,OOO sq. miles and has a population estimated to be 10.9 million.
The population increase in recent years has been about 3.3% per year.
Economic activity has been growing at an average rate of 6.8% (1964-1968),



- 2 -
and per capita income is about US$115 equivalent (1968). The population
density averages 47 per sq mile, varying fromi about 6 persons per sq mile
in northeastern Kenya to 1 740 per sq mile in the capital city of Nairobi.
Some 85% of the people and nearly all economic activity are centered in
the southern two-fifths of the country, the northern three-fifths being
arid.  It is estimated that over 9 million people live in rural areas.
The urban population is concentrated mainly in Nairobi (475,000) and in
Mombasa (245,000), the main port and second largest city.  Provincial
headquarters towns and small townships constitute the other urban centers.
2.02      Wqater supply expenditures since Kenya attained independence
in 1963 have been mainly in the urban areas, and virtually all of the urban
centers have piped water systems. Some of these systems are inadequate
and studies for expansion are underway. In urban areas outside Nairobi,
only minor construction is expected in the near future. The Nairobi
project would be the largest for water supply in Kenya, and is required
in order to keep pace with the city's rapid growth and the expansion of
tourism. With an area of 266 sq miles, Nairobi is not only the hub of
ccmmercial and industrial activities in East Africa, but also the focal
point for tourism. Situated in south-central Kenya, the city is a starting
point for most of the safaris for which this country and region are
famous. Expanding very rapidly in recent years, tourism in Kenya has
become the most important earner of foreign exchange for the country; the
outlook for its continued growth is bright.
2.03       Compared with the urban residents, only a small percentage of
the rural population is served by adequate water supplies. Recognizing
this situation, the Government of Kenya has started a rural water develop-
ment program under its 1969-74 Development Plan with assistance from the
Swedish Government. Two hundred and twenty small schemes will be under-
taken over a 3-year period at a total cost of about KS 1.7 million. In
addition, the development of the livestock industry in the country's arid
and semi-arid areas depends on improvement of water supplies for both
people and stock. This is being achieved by projects assisted by IDA
(Livestock Development Credit 129-K) and bilateral agencies.
2.04       All concentrated population centers in Kenya have sanitary
sewerage systems and, for the most part, these systems are adequate at
present. A continued expansion of these systems is necessary as population
within each city increases, and studies are being carried out by the
cities individually as needed.
B. AD4INISTRATIVE STRUCTURE
2.05       The VWater Development Department (WDD), under the Ministry of
Agriculture, is responsible for all water resources and their development
in Kenya. The Water Ordinance of 1951 provided for the establishment
of a Wiater Resources Authority, a Water Apportionment Board and Regional
Water Boards.  The WDD functions as the technical agency for these
statutory bodies and advises on priorities for water development and on



- 3 -
water apportionment.  The main functions of the WDD are to plan, construct
and maintain water supply and sewerage schemes and to collect bydrological
data.  WDD operates same 90 municipal and township water supply systems
including that of Mombasa. fWDD is also responsible for the rural water
development program mentioned in paragraph 2.03.
2.06       A number of cities such as Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret,
Thika and Kitale independently operate their own water and sewerage faci-
lities. In these cases, a measure of coordination at the national level
is provided by the Ministry of Economic Planning, which assessess overall
development priorities including public spending on water and sewerage
projects, and by the Ministry of Local Government, which approves all
municipal and county budgets. WDD is also involved when a new source is
to be developed and the permission of the Water Apportionment Board is
required for such development. WDD has provided much of the basic data
needed for planning the Nairobi water supply project.
2.07       In a minor way, the Health Ministry and Community Development
Department have also been involved in rural water supply activities. With
assistance from IOH and UNICEF, the Health Ministry has carried out a
number of demonstration projects for small rural water supplies and this
program is continuing. The Community Development Department has sponsored
a few self-help rural water supply projects. Coordination of these
programs with WDD's activities has been limited, but no duplication of
effort is apparent.
2.08       The existing municipal and township water supplies in Kenya
are shown on Map 1.
III. THE BORROWER
A. GENERAL
3.01       The Borrower would be the City Council of Nairobi (NCC), which
has already borrowed both in Kenya and the U.K. in the past, and has
followed conservative financial policies.  NCC has the administrative
capacity to carry out the proposed water supply project.
B. ORGANIZATION AND AIMINISTRATION
3.02       The City of Nairobi was incorporated in 1950.  Provisions of
local Government Regulations, 1963 as amended, apply to the city. Under
these regulations, the Minister for Local Government exercises the right
of approval over NCC on a number of matters. Principal among these are
the control over NCC's borrowing, annual budget, appointment and dismissal
of officers, and certain procurement matters (for example, prequalification
of bidders and awards of contracts to other than the lowest bidder require
the Minister's approval). The 1963 Regulations permit NCC to raise loans
relating to its functions.



3.03       The City Council of Nairobi consists of 43 members, of whom
40 are elected.  Two members are nominated by the Minister for Local
Government and one is appointed by Kiambu County Council, which formerly
had jurisdiction over part of the Nairobi area. The Council elects a
Mayor and a Deputy Mayor and appoints coraiittees of Council members to
administer the various services provided by the city. The annual capital
and operating budgets are reviewed by these committees before adoption
by the Council. The Town Clerk is the chief executive and administrative
officer of NCC. Senior officers are selected by the various committees
and appointments are made by the Council with Mlnistry approval. Junior
officers are selected by department heads and appointed by the Council.
NCC's senior staff is dedicated and competent. An organization chart
is shown on Annex 1.
3.04       Water and sewerage operations were previously carried out by
separate divisions under the City Engineering Department. The financial
aspects, including billing and collection, were carried out by the City
Treasurer's Department.  There were coordination problems between the two
Departments, for example in cutting off water service (Engineering
responsibility) for non-pa-yment of bills (Treasurer's responsibility) or
in assessing financial implications of technical decisions.  To alleviate
these problems and to improve efficiency, a new Wdater and Sewerage
Department (WSD) has been created which will be responsible for the
project. It has been agreed that NCC will not materially change the
organizational and administrative structure of WSD without prior approval
of the Bank. The organization of WSD is described in Annex 2.
3.05       WSD is under the direction of a General Manager whose qualifi-
cations and experience are acceptable to the Bank. NCC has agreed that
it will continue to employ a competent Manager for WSD with experience
and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank and qualified technical staff
in adequate numbers. The staff which had been responsible for water and
sewerage activities previously under different departments of NCC have
been transferred to WSD and the additional staff needed is being recruited.
3.06       NCC utilizes the services of consultants for engineering design
and supervision of construction of major water supply and sewerage works.
Howard Humphreys & Sons, a British finm, has been associated with NCC
for over 30 years and has carried out most of such work. Construction of
past projects has been adequately- carried out by NCC with its own labor
force in sane cases and through contractors in others.
C. TRAINING
3.07       There is a need for training of junior and middle technical
and financial personnel and it is considered that such training can best
be provided on the job through use of competent advisers. The services
of experts in water supply and sewerage, are expected to be provided
under a UNI  project requested by the Government of Kenya.



D. SERVICES PROVIDED BY TEE BORROI-aER
i.  General
3.08       NCC provides a broad range of municipal services including water
supply, sewerage and drainage, housing, education, medical and health
services. The city organization and services provided are indicated in
Annex 1.
ii.  Existing Water Supply
3.09       The existing water supply in Nairobi is reliable, continuous
and safe. Water pressure in most of the city varies from 30 psi to over
100 psi. The system covers the old city and is being extended to the
outer areas. Water is obtained from three sources - the Sasumua and Ruiru
reservoirs, located about 40 and 18 miles respectively, to the northwest
of Nairobi, and from Kikuyu Springs, about 2 miles outside the city limits
on the western side. Water from the reservoirs is treated in conventional
rapid sand filters and chlorinated before distribution. The Kikuya Spring
supply is partly distributed after chlorination only and the balance
receives full treatment in rapid sand filters. The supply is entirely
by gravity, with a total reliable yield of about 20 IMgd. Details of
existing facilities are given in Annex 3 and indicated on Map 2.
3.10       In the old city, there are also a few private wells used by
industries and institutions. Outer areas of the city are presently
served mostly by private water undertakings using wells. The Water
Apportionment Board issues permits limiting the quantity of water which
can be pumped from wells in order to preserve ground water resources.
It is estimated that the total quantity of water produced from the
private wells is about 2 Ilgd and that some 40,000 people depend on these
supplies.
3.11       NCC supplies about 85% of Nairobi's population, through some
400 miles of water mains and about 32,500 service connections.  A smll
amount of water is sold to consumers not connected to the distribution
system from nine water kiosks. It is estimated that about 60% of the
consumption is by domestic users, 18% by commercial and industrial users
and the balance by Government agencies and others. Per capita consumption
for the population served has averaged about 35 gcd recently and is not
expected to increase significantly.
3.12       A program for systematic reduction of leakages is underway and
unaccounted-for water is only about 15% of production. The quality of
water is regularly tested by NCC's Health Department and is satisfactory.
The plants and equipment are well maintained.
iii. Existing Sewerage and Sewage Disposal
3.13       Nairobi has adequate sewerage and sewage disposal facilities
covering all densely populated areas. The system serves approximately
184,C00 people.  The sewage is treated in two main treatment plants before



-6-
disposal. NCC also operates two small primary sewage treatment units for
two outlying communities of about 6,000 people. In less densely populated
areas of the city, septic tanks are used where soil conditions permit;
conservancy tanks and latrines are used elsewrhere. NOC's Cleansing
Department provides a septic tank emptying service for which it collects
a fee. In addition, individual sewerage and sewage disposal systems serving
some 10,000 people are maintained by a few housing colonies, government
institutions and industries.
iv. Borrower's Development Program for Water Supply and Sewerage
3.14       NCC's water supply program for the years 1970-75 consists
mainly of the proposed project with minor capital outlays for small
distribution system extensions and improvements to the Kikuyu Spring
supply and Ruiru transmission mains. After completion of the proposed
project, distribution system extensions would be continued annually
depending on need but no new major source is likely to be required before
1980.
3.15       During the next five years, NCC proposes to gradually extend
the sewerage system to cover presently unserved areas and expand the
existing treatment plants. During this period, the existing collection
and disposal system would be reviewed and a plan for future development
prepared. NCC has requested UNDM assistance in this regard.
3.16       During negotiations assurances were obtained that NCC will
review with the Bank periodically its program of investments for water
and sewerage facilities and the proposed means of financing such program.
E. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
3.17       The city's accounts are computerized and, in general, the
accounting system provides the information necessary for financial control.
The accounts for each activity are identified for budget control purposes.
Accounts relating to administration, public health services, education,
public works, city properties, housing, and social, trading and recrea-
tional services are consolidated in "General Fund Accounts".  In the past,
water supply accounts were kept separately, but sewerage accounts were
included under public works. Both wrater and sewerage accounts will be
kept separately under the new WSD. In addition to the general fund, water
supply and insignificant miscellaneous accounts, there is a consolidated
loans fund which receives the proceeds from all loans raised by NCC and
which relends them to the various operating departments for capital
outlays.
3.18       Loans obtained by a department from the consolidated loans fund
are normally amortized over the estimated life of the assets. This amor-
tization is deducted from revenues and is credited to a "Capital Discharged"
account on the balance sheet and is comparable to and denoted as deprecia-
tion in this report. For the few assets, financed from other than loan



funds, no depreciation is charged. Overall, the amount noted for
depreciation is reasonable at about 3% for water assets and 2-1/2% for
sewerage assets.
3.19       Assets are maintained at historical costs.  For water rate
covenant purposes (see paragraph 6.o0), water assets in service on
December 31, 1969 are valued at KE 15 million (see Annex 10, page 2).
In future, the value of assets would be adjusted annually by an economic
index based on a combination of the following 3 indices for the city of
Nairobi:
(a)  wage earners index of consumer prices as published
in the Kenya Statistical Digest;
(b) middle income index of consumer prices as published
in the Kenya Statistical Digest3 and
(c) cost of living index (excluding rent) as published
in the Kenya Gazette.
3.20       Cash generated in various city departments is deposited in one
bank account; surplus cash is invested at interest. A surplus generated
in one department (such as WSD) is credited to the department's assets
either as cash or outside investment or can also be deposited, at interest,
in the city's own consolidated loans fund account.
3.21       Accounting is the responsibility of the City Treasurer.  Audit
is presently carried out by Chartered Accountants and NOC has agreed that
its accounts will be audited annually by independent accountants acceptable
to the Bank. A recent law subjects the accounts to Government audit.
However, the Government has not yet made such separate audit and it is
expected that the reports by the independent auditors of NCC will be relied
on by Government also in the future.
F. FINANCIAL POSITION - PAST AND PRESENT
i. City in General
3.22       Nairobi has been financially well managed in past years.  The
city derives its revenues from income and property taxes and from
charges for services rendered such as rents for housing, hospital fees
and water rates. With the exception of water, the general fund account
covers most city operations and the following table summarizes transactions
in this account for the period 1964-69.

3.23       General Fund operations have had operating surpluses in recent
years after related debt redemption (equivalent to depreciation). Detailed
tables by department are provided in Annex 4. The substantial reduction in
net income in 1968 was due to a reduction in the amount of personal income
tax allocated to NCC by the Government. NCG has increased property taxes
to compensate for the loss.
3.24       Balance sheets for both General Fund operations and for the
entire city are provided in Annex 5. The city has good liquidity with
investments and cash of almost KE 3 million at the end of 1968. Based
on assets carried at historical costs, the city's debt:equity ratio is
about 59:41; if assets were revalued to present worth, debt would be
substantially less than equity. The city carries insurance for buildings
and other structures of approximately 50> more than historic book value
since book value understates its replacement cost.
1/ Expenditures in 1969 include loans repaid.



- 9 -
3.25       City departments borrow from the consolidated loans fund at an
interest rate which covers the fund's interest paid on its borrowings
and its administrative expenses. For internal book-keeping purposes,
they then repay in even annual amounts of interest and principal over the
estimated life of the assets for which loans are used.
3.26       NCC borrows on the local capital market, from Governmental
agencies and a number of other sources. A summary of debt transactions
over the period 1964-69 and details of amounts outstanding at 31 December
1969 are shown in Annex 6. Future debt service for 1970-75 averages
about KE 1.5 million annuially, about 25% of the city's present gross
receipts. Surpluses generated will not be sufficient to cover all debt
maturities and some new borrowings will be required for this purpose.
All loans are secured by all city revenues and rank equally. The proposed
Bank loan would be passed through the consolidated loans fund to WSD.
3.27       The city is creditworthy and capable of assuming the new debt
proposed under the Bank loan. Wlth continued good management, there is
no reason to doubt the city's financial viability. The WSD represents
an important segment of the city's activities and it is therefore proposed
to apply specific financial performance tests to the operations of this
department.  1rith regard to the other activities, such as housing,
education, public health, etc., it is inappropriate and impractical
for the Bank to inject itself into overall city management as long as
the creditworthiness of the city remains satisfactory. NCC has agreed to
submit to the Bank audited financial statements for its entire operations.
ii-  Water Supply and Sewerage
3.28       Income statements for water and sewerage for the past five years
are summarized in Annex 7. In the past years, operating surpluses have
been generated from wzater operations, although for 1968, due to increases
in operating cost and debt service, the surplus was substantially reduced.
For water, the return on net plant in service based on assets at historical
cost has been in the 6-8% range. For sewerage, for the years 1964-67,
there were deficits but after a rate increase, there was a substantial
surplus in 1968 when the return on net plant was over 10%, based on
historical cost.
3.29       Balance sheets for wrater operations for the past five years
and for sewerage operations for the last year are summarized in Annex 8.
The sewerage balance sheet has been estimated, since sewerage accounts
were included with other public works accounts. Water and sewerage
operations are quite liquid with substantial funds currently invested,
primarily in the consolidated loans fund and can be either withdrawn or
applied against debt service due. Wiith assets at historical value, the
debt:equity ratio is 7h:26. A revaluation of assets would correct the
debt:equity ratio to approximately 60:40.



- 10 -
G. WATER AND SEWERAGE RATES
3.30       All water service connections are metered, including public taps
where concessionaires purchase water fron NCC and sell water to consumers.
Past water rates met operating costs and debt service but provided only a
small and inadequate surplus to finance expansion. NCC increased the water
rates in April 1970 (see Annex 9) to yield larger surpluses to cover a
reasonable share of the costs of expansion (about 40% of the project).
In addition to the basic water rate of 5 sh/1000 gal (US$0.70/1000 gal),
a meter rent is charged. These rates are comparable to existing water
rates in most other areas of Kenya and to median water rates for a
number of cities in Africa.
3.31       In addition to the water rates and meter rentals, a potential
customer pays the cost of connecting to the water system, which averages
about KE 10. Water customers are also required to post a deposit of KL 5
which is retained by NCC and credited with interest during the period
of service. The deposit is refunded with interest when service ceases.
The fact that a substantial deposit is required and held by NCC, accounts
for the good collection record; bad debts are negligible.
3.32       Sewerage rates are based on estimated volumes. Sewerage
revenues are presently sufficient to cover operating costs and debt
service as well as provide substantial funds for future expansion for
1970-76. NCC has agreed to maintain sewerage rates and charges at a
sufficient level to cover operating costs and debt service.
3.33       For sewerage, customers pay the cost of connection to the
system and also ccntribute a portion of the cost of providing sewer
mains. New housing developments normally provide a sewer system built
to NCC's specifications which is then taken over by NCC.
H. BILLINGS AND COLLECTIONS
3.34       Billing and collection procedures are good. In past years,
accounts receivable have been 2-1/2% to 10% of annual billings with the
exception of 1968 when the institution of ccmputer billing took place and
there was some confusion which has since been remedied. Service meters
are read monthly. Bills are sent out by mail to most customers or are
delivered where mail service is not available. Payments may be made by
mail or in person at NCC's offices.
3.35       Bills are usually dispatched within two weeks of the meter
reading and payments normally take place during the month following.
If a bill is not paid within 10 days of the following bill, the connection
is cut off. For reconnection, a customer must pay KE 1 (US$2.80). In
recent years, disconnections have been in the range of 4-6000 annually but
most services are reconnected within a short period.



- 11 -
I. STORES AND INVENTORIES
3.36       The present stores system is not adequate.  Stores and inven-
tories are kept in a number of locations, with most being carried by an
NCC central stores operation. There are problems of coordination between
central stores and water operations and problems of inventory control
generally. NCC has agreed to establish before the end of 1972 a separate
stores operation for materials used primarily for water and sewerage.
All water and sewerage inventories will be consolidated on one set of
records and kept at one location as soon as a satisfactory location can
be designated.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. DESCRIPTION
4.01       The project includes river intake works, a raw water pumping
station, pumps, a raw water pumping main, treatment works, a treated
water transmission main, a terminal reservoir, distribution system exten-
sions and improvements, and provision of water meters. The project
facilities would increase the capacity of the water supply system fram
20 IMgd to 30 IMgd which should be sufficient to meet anticipated water
demand in Nairobi until about 1980.
4.02       Water fran the Chania River would be pumped to a treatment
plant located at Ngethu, about a mile from the river. At the treatment
works, facilities would be provided for chemical coagulation, settling,
rapid sand filtration and chlorination of water. After treatment the
water would flow by gravity through a 24 mile transmission main to a ter-
minal reservoir of about 1.5 I lg capacity which would facilitate the
distribution of water to meet the increasing demand in eastern and central
sections of Nairobi and the industrial areas. Additional distribution
mains would strengthen the existing system and extend the areas of
supply. A detailed project description is given in Annex 11 and the
locations of the proposed works are shown on Map 2.
B. PROJECT COSTS
4.03       The project cost is summarized in the table below and is
given in detail in Annex 12 on a year-by-year basis for the construction
and disbursement period, 1970-75.

4.04       Construction costs are derived from estimates made by the
consultants and are based on preliminary designs and current quotations
for equipment and materials. Similar works have not been constructed
recently in Kenya. Provision has been made for technical contingencies
of about 20% on local costs and 10% on foreign costs, and for price
increases of 5% per annum on both local and foreign costs. The cost
of consulting services includes detailed engineering, preparation of
contract documents and supervision of construction. Project construction
is expected to be completed by mid-1974. The construction schedule is
shown in Annex 13.
C. LOAN AM4OUNT
4.05       The project's financial requirements total US$13.4 million,
US$12.1 million for project cost and US$1.3 million for interest, payable
during construction. A loan of US$8.3 million equivalent is proposed to
cover the foreign exchange component of the project (US$7.0 million) and
interest during construction on the Bank loan (US$1.3 million).



- 13 -
D. DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION
4.06       Howard Humphreys & Sons made the feasibility studies for this
project and has been retained by NCC to prepare detailed designs and
tender documents, evaluate tenders and supervise construction. This
arrangement is satisfactory.
4.07       The project initially prepared by the consultants was subs-
tantially changed during appraisal as a result of technical and economic
evaluations (see Annex 11). To avoid delay, NCC instructed the consultant
to begin detailed engineering at the time of project appraisal. It is
proposed that the Bank reimburse the foreign exchange cost of consulting
services incurred after December 31, 1969.
4.08       WSD would be responsible for the project implementation.
Construction is expected to be done by contractors, except for staff
quarters and some distribution mains, which may be done by NCC with its
labor force.
E. PROC UREMEN AND DISBURSEMENT
h.09       The procurement of goods from abroad is regulated by Government.
Import licenses are required in respect of items manufactured in Kenya
and in certain cases, imports are banned. However, the Guarantor has
agreed to follow the Bank's procurement procedures and the goods to be
financed by the Bank loan would be procured through international compe-
titive bidding. Local m.anufacturers are expected to compete, probably
successfully, for the supply of a few items such as poly-vinyl chloride
pipes for the distribution system. A margin of preference to local
manufacturers of 15% or customs duty, whichever is lower, had been
requested and was agreed during negotiations.
4.10       Construction contracts also would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding. The larger contracts may attract
bids from foreign contractors but local contractors with foreign
affiliations are expected to compete successfully.
4.11       Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against the actual
foreign exchange costs of imported goods and the estimated foreign
exchange component of locally procured goods and construction contracts.
An estimated disbursement schedule is at Annex 20.
4.12       In the event of there being savings in foreign exchange costs,
the unused balance of the loan would be cancelled.
F. WATER RIGHTS
4.13       NCC has been authorized to take up to 10 1I4gd from the Chania
River which is adequate for the project. An analysis of the presently
available hydrological information indicates that the river could be
relied upon to yield 10 IMgd without a storage dam upstream.  Assurances



- 14 -
were obtained during negotiations that the Government would prohibit
the discharge into Chania River or into its tributaries above the project
intake of any sewage, industrial wastes, or other pollutants.
G. ECOLOGICAL INPLICATIONS OF THE PROJECT
4.14       The canstruction of the intake on the Chania River is not
expected to have any effect on the regimen of the river; storage of water
is not involved. When project facilities are fully utilized and 10 IMgd
is drawn from the river, there will be a substantial reduction in flow
immediately downstream of the intake during the dry season but some flow
will be maintained; dissolved oxygen in the water will not be depleted
since the river has a good gradient and the biological food chain should
not be adversely affected. Sufficient water will pass over the intake
weir to meet the needs of both the animal and human population down-
stream. Further downstream, small streams and springs discharge into
the river and increase the flow.
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01       The project is intended to meet the growing water needs of
Nairobi, which is both tlhe capital of Kenya and the main center of popu-
lation, comnerce, tourism and industry. The Government accords high
priority to the project.
5.o2       With the city's recent expansion from 33 sq miles to 266 sq
miles, large and virtually uninhabited areas exist within the city
limits which provide scope for development. About 40% of Kenya's industry
is located in Niairobi and growth of output in this sector has been about
6% per annum with consequent increases in employment. Tourism has been
expanding rapidly and Nairobi, with its international airport, is the
main focal point and tour base. The growth of tourism directly affects
Nairobi because of the need for accommodations and services. In addition,
since Nairobi is the commercial center, tourism activities elsewhere
in Kenya and East Africa contribute to its commercial activities
and employment. NCC is also making an effort to promote low income
housing and many housing projects are underway. These factors should
contribute to continued rapid growth which, in turn, requires the provisior
of adequate water supply as an essential infrastructure.
5.03       The existing water supply facilities are almost fully utilized
and, with the minor expansion programs now underway, demand can be met
only until 1973-74. To meet Suture needs thereafter a new source of
supply has to be developed, and the necessary pipelines, treatment plant,
etc., have to be provided. The project, which is expected to be completed
by mid-1974, is therefore an urgent and essential measure to be pursued
now. Upon its completion, the present reliable supply to Nairobi of
about 20 IMgd would be increased by an additional 10 IMgd.



- 15 -
5.04       Past consumption and forecasts of demand are shown in Annex 14.
From 1962 to 1969, the population in Nairobi increased at an average
yearly rate of about 8%. This growth has been due to intensive migration
from other parts of Kenya as well as the natural increase in population.
NCC estimates that the future population growth will be 5-6%. The
present per capita water consumption for the population served is about
35 ged. The per capita consumption is not expected to vary significantly
in the future but population served as a percent of total population is
expected to increase from the present 85% to over 90% by 1980. The
supply will be extended to cover the outer areas of the city and to
meet projected dermands of housing developments and industries. On this
basis, consumption is expected to grow at an average annual rate of
about 6-1/2% and the project should be fully utilized by about 1980.
If consumption grows only at the present rate of 5% per annum, project
facilities would be sufficient until 1983.
5.05       The project has been selected on the basis of technical)
economic and financial evaluations of the alternative available. It
is estimated that additional water sources with a capacity of about
40 IMgd will be needed during the next 30 years. Various alternatives
for increasing source capacity in stages to meet this demand have been
compared using present worth analyses. The construction of impound-
ment dams across the Chania River and its tributaries, taking water
from these rivers without dams, and abstraction from other rivers
with or without dams were all ccnsidered, as well as pumping and gravity
alternatives. The proposed IMiddle Chania scheme has the minimum present
worth of capital and operating costs at discount rates of 9% or higher.
It also allows maximum flexibility for further source development and
use of project components in the future. The design of individual
project components is optimal for discount rates between 9% and 30%.
5.06       If demand grows as forecast, the internal financial rate
of return for the project (plus the necessary future expenditures to
fully utilize it) is estimated at about 13% (see Annex 15, page 1).
The sensitivity of the return to changes in various assumptions is
illustrated in Annex 15, page 2, and summarized as follows:

Except for the last one, these returns are calculated on a financial basis.
The economic return is believed to be considerably higher for the follow-
ing reasons. First, the value of water to consumers as a whole exceeds
the water rate charged (water rates could be increased substantially
before consuners would reduce consumption or find alternative sources
of water competitive).  Second, project costs are taken at their accounting
values, whereas the incremental costs to the economy are probably less
than that for labor, power and certain chemicals.  Third, there are also
favorable effects on tourism, public health and fire protection.

6.02       Total applications of funds for water and sewerage for the
1970-75 period are estimated at KE 9.1 million (US$25.5 million equi-
valent). The proposed Bank loan of about KE 3 million would cover about
32% of this amount, self-generated funds of KE 5 million about 56%,
capital contributions of KE 789,000 about 9% and other loans of KE 275,000
about 3%. Cash generation from water operations together with the Bank
loan would be sufficient to take care of project expenditures for water;
other loans would effectively finance part of the sewerage facilities and
would be expected to come from the NCC consolidated loans fund. The other
loans are necessary to meet resource requirements in 1973; more funds
than needed will be generated in 1974 and will be available for investment
(see Annex 18). In these circumstances, NCC may choose to finance 1973 needs
with short-term loans and pay these off in 1974.



- 18 -
6.03       For the purposes of this report interest on the Bank loan
has been assumed at 7-1/A%. A term of 20 years including a grace period
of about 5 years is proposed. NCC and Government agreed during negotiations
that they will make available all funds needed to complete the project
on terms satisfactory to the Bank.
B. RATE COVENANT
6.04       The water rate covenant is based on cash flow return - operating
revenues less operating costs (before depreciation and interest charges)
divided by gross water supply assets in service (reasonably valued before
depreciation). This formula has advantages over the conventional rate
covenant when investments are relatively large and made at infrequent
intervals. A conventional covenant requires a fixed rate of return on a
declining rate base between major investments and may lose its controlling
function and lead to insufficient cash generation to cover operating
costs, debt service and a portion of future major expenditure. This
problem will not arise under the covenant which requires a flow of cash
as a percentage of the gross assets in service. In addition, the formula
is ccmpatible with NCC's existing accounting system and is simple in
its application. The only adjustment required would be the fixed asset
valuation. For purposes of the rate covenant the initial value of the
water supply assets has been agreed upon, based on historical value
adjusted to present-day worth (see Annex l1o, page 2). In the future, the
value of assets would be adjusted annually for rate covenant purposes,
in accordance with an economic index (see paragraph 3.19).
6.05       The above formula will allow closer control of water tariff
levels. The present water rates, together with a further 20% increase
in 1972, are sufficient to take care of operating costs, debt service
and a portion of future expenditures for expansion (paragraph 3.30)
provide a steady cash flow return in the 7-9% range over the 1972-76
period. The conventional rate of return would vary over a much wider
range, 7-14% when assets are adjusted to reasonable value (see Annex 10)
and might result in pressures to reduce tariff just when funds are
needed for expansion. NCC has agreed to take all measures including
adjustment of water rates to yield for the year 1972 onwards a cash
flow return of at least 7-1/2% on reasonably valued gross water supply
assets in service.
6.06       For sewerage and waste disposal operations, NCC has agreed
to maintain rates and other charges which will provide sufficient revenue
to cover operating costs and debt service.
C. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
6.07       Estimated Income Statements for NCC's water and sewerage
operations for the period 1969-76 are shown in Annex 17, Estimated
Sources and Applications of Funds in Annex 18 and Estimated Balance
Sheets in Annex 19. Assumptions for all financial forecasts are shomn
in Annex 16. For WSD, debt service coverage is satisfactory, exceeding
1.7 after the 1970 water rate increase. Current ratios increase



- 19 -
gradually from 1.3 in 1972 to more than 2 for 1975 and thereafter.  The
debt:equity ratio based on historically valued assets is initially
marginal at 71:29 reflecting heavy debt financing in the past. This ratio
improves quickly to 58:42 in 1972 and to better than 50:50 by 1975.
Were assets valued at present worth, the debt:equity ratio would be more
favorable than 60:40 at the present time.
6.08       This project is expected to take care of the water demand up
to about the year 1980. To meet demand after that time, a new program
would have to be undertaken. For 1975 forward, under these financial
projections, WSD will generate surpluses for this program.
VII. REC0MMENDATIONS
7.01       During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
(a)  Any material change in the organizational and
administrative structure of WSD would be subject
to Bank approval (paragraph 3.04);
(b)  NCC will establish not later than December 31, 1972
a separate stores operation for materials used
primarily for water and sewerage (paragraph 3.36);
(c)  NCC will take all measures including adjustment
of water rates to provide for the year 1972 onwards,
revenues representing a cash flow return of not
less than 7-1/2% of reasonably valued gross fixed
assets in operation in its water supply system
(paragraph 6.05);
(d)  Rates and other charges levied for sewerage and
waste disposal services will be sufficient to cover
the costs of operating the sewerage system and of
its debt service (paragraph 6.o6).
7.02       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$8.3 million, for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.

NAIROBI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Organization of the new
Water and Sewerage Department
Before the establislment of the new Water and Sewerage Department
in April 1970, the responsibility for Nairobi water and sewerage services
was divided among several parts of the city organization. The new depart-
ment is headed by a General Manager responsible for all water supply and
sewerage activities of the city.  He is assisted by 2 Deputy Managers - one
for engineering operations and the other for financial and caomercial
operaticns. A separate small unit under the General Manager is in charge
of the administration of the department.
The staff under the Deputy Manager (Engineering) is organized
into groups on a functional basis. One group deals with the operations
and maintenance of the water system while a smaller group is responsible
for sewerage. A third group, concerned with planning, design and cons-
truction, ill work on water and sewerage projects, employing the services
of specialized groups for estimating and drawing. This will make it
possible to smooth out variations in workload and provide the staff with
experience in both water and sewerage as part of the staff training
program.
The Deputy Manager (Commercial) is responsible for finance, billing,
collection and accounting for water and sewerage under the general super-
vision and audit of the City Treasurer.  Separate accounts will be kept
for water and sewerage and these accounts will be combined for the depart-
ment before consolidation with all other city accounts (see also paragraphs
3.17-3.21 in the text of this report). The commercial section under the
Deputy Manager has the responsibility for meter reading, billing, records
of delinquent accounts, connections and disconnections. The water and
sewerage bills will be processed using the NCC computer and mailed or hand
delivered.
The materials and equipment used in water and sewerage operations
are at present kept in the City Central Stores, at a separate water sub-
store equipped with a small supply of frequently needed items and at the
treatment plants. The sub-store is located where there are also facilities
for repairing and installing water meters. NCC has agreed to establish
not later than December 31, 1972 a separate stores operation for the
materials, spare parts and equipment required for its water supply and
sewerage services.



ANNEX 3

KENA
NAIROBI IWATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Existing Water Supply Facilities
General
Water supply to Nairobi is derived from the Kikuyu Springs and
impounding reservoirs on the Ruiru and Sasumua Rivers. Certain industries,
institutions and estates in the outer areas of the city have their own
individual wells. The Nairobi City Council (NCC) does not use wells at
present as ground water in the area has a high fluoride content and is
limited.
ikuy. Springs
The use of the Xikuyu Springs for public water supply started
around the turn of the century when a pipeline was laid to the western
part of the city by East African Railways.  The water was of good quality,
requiring no treatment, and the supply was by gravity. In 1916, certain
improvements at the source were carried out and a third spring utilized.
The works were taken over by NCC in 1921. Presently, water from two of
the springs is passed through a microstrainer, chlorinated and conveyed
to a conventional rapid sand filter treatment plant at Kabete. Water
from the third spring is chlorinated and conveyed to Kabete. Water from
these mains is also supplied to consumers en route. The transmission
mains are of steel - a 9 in. main about 7 miles long laid in 1910 and
a 7 in. main about 6 miles long laid in 1920. These mains now have a total
carrying capacity of 1 IMgd. The water is corrosive. NCC proposes to
improve the quality of water by chemical treatment at the source and
arrest further deterioration of the pipelines. Funds needed are included
in NCC's regular annual capital improvements program and are not part
of the project. This source serves the high-level areas in western
Nairobi by gravity and alternative methods of supply would be more expensive.
Ruiru Supply
A 9 in. diameter 18 mile steel pipeline was installed in 1938 to
transmit water from the Ruiru River to the Kabete treatment works and in
1946, a second transmission main of 12 in. diameter was installed.  NCC
completed construction of a masonry dam on the Rhiru River, early in
1950, and a third transmission main, 16 in. in diameter, was installed in
1951. Water from the Ruiru reservoir is treated with sodium carbonate
for corrosion control and is pre-chlorinated before flowing by gravity
to the Kabete treatment works. The three transmission mains have a total
capacity of about 4.4 IMgd.  Since the construction of the dam, supply
from this source has been maintained writout interruption. The water is
reportedly tested at least once a day at Kabete and the dosing of sodium
carbonate adjusted as required. The daily supply from this source is
about 4 IMgd.



AUNa 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
Bank pre-appraisal missions to Nairobi in 1967 and 1968 recom-
mended that the safe yield of this reservoir be verified. A study made
by NCC engineers indicates that a safe yield of 5 IMgd can be drawn from
this source. NCC proposes to examine the hydraulic design of the trans-
mission mains to find the minimum cost solution for transmitting 5 IMgd
to the treatment works. Wlorks needed in this respect would be carried
out under NCC's annual budget and would not form part of the project.
Kabete Treatment Works
The original works were constructed in 1936 to treat water from
Kikuyu Springs and consisted of four rapid gravity filters and ancillary
facilities. Two more filters were added in 1945-47. Three horizontal
flow sedimentation tanks and two rapid gravity filters were constructed
in 1949/50 when the fuiru supply was commissioned.  In 1959, an existing
reaction tank was converted into a filter, and in 1964, chemical feeding
arrangements were improved.
Water from Kikuyu Springs and Ruiru Dam is mixed in the inlet
channel to the sedimentation tanks, pH value is adjusted if necessary,
and alum is added. The settled water is filtered and chlorinated before
distribution.  The treatment works has a total capacity of about 4.75
IMgd.  Filtration rates are low at 80 gal/sq ft/hour.  The works are well
maintained and the quality of water supplied is uniformly good as shown
by analysis reports.
Sasuma Supply
The construction of a dam on the Sasumua River, a tributary of
the Chania, at the southern end of the Aberdare Mountains, was recommended
by NCC's consultants (Howard Humphreys & Sons) in 1946.  The dam, 109
feet high, and the adjacent 4 BIgd treatment plant were completed in 1956.
A 38 mile, 12 in. steel pipeline conveys the water from the plant to service
reservoirs at Kabete. With the rapid growth in demand, these works were
found inadequate and the treatment plant capacity at Sasumua was increased
to 10 IMgd and a second 38 mile transmission main of 18 in. diameter was
completed in 1961. In order to provide a maintainable yield of 10 IMgd
from the Sasumua reservoir, diversion dams were constructed in 1963/64 on
the two main branches of the Kiburu River and the flows from them led
through an aqueduct to discharge into the Sasumua reservoir. More recently,
the height of the Sasumua Dam was raised by 26 feet, thus increasing the
storage reservoir capacity from 2 billion to 3.5 billion gal and the
capacity of the treatment works was also increased from 10 to 14 IMgd.
The treatment works include 3 horizontal and 14 vertical flow
settling tanks, and 22 conventional rapid gravity filters. Chemical treat-
ment of the water includes coagulation, pH correction and chlorination.
The overall physical condition of the treatment works is very good, but
the operation of settling tanks and filters leaves much to be desired.

Page 3 of 3 pages
Operational problems also exist with the transmission pipelines, where
formation of air pockets reduce their capacity; NCC engineers are currently
making field investigations to solve this problem.
In the development of the Sasumua works, NCC has utilized
financial assistance fraa the Federal Republic of Germany, the United
Kingdam and U.S.A.
Service Reservoirs
Three ground-level reinforced concrete reservoirs with a total
capacity of 13 IMg (2 of 6 and 1 of 1 1Mg) are located at the Kabete
treatment works at sufficient elevation to serve most parts of the city
by gravity. Filtered water from Kabete and Sasumua treatment works flows
into these reservoirs by gravity and then through various trunk mains to
different parts of the city.
One 18 in. trunk main from the Kabete service reservoirs feeds
a 4 Img post,-tensioned concrete above ground circular service reservoir
called "Hill Tank" which serves a part of the central and southeastern
areas of Nairobi.
In addition to the above there are five 10,000 to 60,000 gal
steel overhead reservoirs. Three of the five reservoirs serve basically
to equalize flows. The other two serve higher elevation developments
and are fed by pumping from the gravity mains.
Distribution-system
There are about 400 miles of water mains of which about 300
miles are 3 in. diameter and larger. Pressures are adequate in general
except during the dry season, when some industrial and high level areas
experience difficulties, The supply is normally continuous. All service
connections are metered and system losses are reasenable at about 15%.

Water Rates in Nairobi
Proposed
Present            Jan. 1. 1972
Basic rate                              5.00 sh/1000 gal  6.00 sh/1000 gal
East African Railways
(for consumption over 500,000 gal   4.06 sh/1000 gal  4.88 sh/1000 gal
per month)
Minimum monthly charge                  8.00 sh            8.00 sh
The special rat% for the East African Railways were provided for in an
agreement under which the Railway sold its water facilities to the city.
A deposit of 100 sh is collected for each account. For consumers using
more than 2,500 gal/month a meter rental fee is charged as follows:
Meter Size             sh/month
1/2"                     2.00

Water Rates in Other Parts of Kenya
For rural water supply the pricing policy has been to charge little
or nothing for water to promote its domestic use and thereby raise sanitary
and health standards. In some areas where water has a productive use as
in agriculture, attempts have been made to assess the value of water to the
user and use this as a guideline for pricing.
For some 90 water undertakings including that of Mombasa, the
second largest city in Kenya which are administered by the Water Develop-
ment Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, the rate is generally
6 sh/l1000 gal with some reduction for very large quantities. There is a
minimum monthly charge of 12 sh for a metered connection and meter rent
is charged according to the size of the meter.
For independent township and urban supplies, some 16 in number, the
domestic water rate varies between 3.80 sh and 6.00 sh/1000 gal with
reductions for large quantities.  The minimum monthly charge is generally
about 10 sh.

NAIROBI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Detailed Description of the Project
Alternatives Considered
The project has been selected on the basis of detailed analyses
of available alternatives by NCC's engineering consultants. A study of
the geological conditions indicated that large scale ground water develop-
Ment was not feasible. There was also the problem of high fluoride con-
tent in ground water in many areas. Attention was therefore focused on
available surface water sources. Lake Naivasha and the Thana, Thika and
Athi river basins, which are within practicable distance of Nairobi,
were considered.
Preliminary evaluations indicated that supply from Lake Naivasha
and the Thana drainage basin would not be favorable and thus the choice
'was narrowed down to alternative schemes in the Thika and Athi river basins.
The alternatives studied included both run-of-the-river schemes and
impounding schemes on the Kimakia, Chania, Athi, Nairobi, Ndarugu and Rairu
Rivers. On the basis of cost-benefit analyses and calculation of internal
financial rates of return, the consultants concluded that the development
of the Chania River in stages would be the most suitable project. The
consultants accordingly proposed the Middle Chania scheme consisting of a
river intake, a 6 mile gravity raw water pipeline along the river to the
treatment works at Ngethu and a treated water main from there to Nairobi.
The Middle Chania scheme was examined further during appraisal.
As hydrological data were insufficient to establish realiably the yield
of the river at the proposed intake, the alternative of pumping from the
river from a point near the proposed treatment works site was considered;
it was found to be both technically and financially more attractive than
the earlier proposal. The pumping alternative permits the intake to be
sited downstream of the Kimakia confluence and assures a minimum yield
of 10 IMgd from the river. It also provides greater flexibility in plan-
ning for future water source development when more accurate hydrological
data are available.
River Intake Wforks
The intake works will be situated in the reach of the Chania
River closest to the water treatment works at Ngethu and will comprise
a weir structure across the river and a pumping station.  Provision will
be made to flush accumdlated silt. Water will be pumped, after removal
of heavy silt and floating matter, to a treatment works at Ngethu about
450 feet above the river. The raw water pumping main will be about
5000 feet long and of 28 in. diameter. The pumping station will be sized to



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3 pages
accommodate pumps up to at least 10 IMgd capacity and the pumps will be
added in stages as demand increases.
Treatment Works
The treatment of the water from the Chania River is not expected
to differ greatly from that required at the existing Sasumua treatment
works; normal chemical coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration
and disinfection has been proposed. The treatment works will be as simple
as possible and designed for a normal output of 8 INgd but the hydraulic
design would permit overloading up to about 13 IMgd.
A clear water storage reservoir sufficient for about one hour's
supply, a plant control laboratory, offices, workshop and stores will also
be provided.
Transmission Main
The transmission main from the treatment works to the terminal
reservoir will be about 24 miles long and of 28 in. diameter. The pipe-
line route traverses a number of ridges and valleys and the laying
conditions and access are difficult in most reaches. The pipeline itself
would be subject to static pressures d up to 650 ft where it crosses
valleys. The route is being surveyed in detail. For estimating purposes,
it has been assumed that steel pipes will be used and unit costs are
based on previous experience with the Sasumua pipelines and other work,
with sufficient allowances for price escalation. Alternative pipe sizes
were considered and pipe diameter of 28 in. was chosen as the most econo-
mical size. The main will allow gravity flow of 10 IMgd from the treat-
ment works to the terminal reservoir. If abstraction of more than 10 IMgd
from the run of the river were peraitted in the future, it would be econo-
mical to use the 28 in. transmission main with booster pumps to convey up
to about 14 Mlgd; the construction of a second transmission main involving
heavy capital expenditures could be correspondingly postponed.
Terminal Storage
A 1.5 1lg capacity ground level reservoir (designated as
Reservoir 'A') will be constructed in Nairobi.
Distribution System
Some 30 miles of pipes ranging in diameter from 3 in. to 27 in.
are included in the project on the basis of preliminary analysis of the
existing distribution system and proposed extensions. The pipes to be
actually used would be based on a more detailed analysis now underway.
Water Meters
A lump sum provision of KE 60,000 has been included in the
estimate for the purchase of bulk water meters and water meters for service



tCAUTEX i 1
Page 3 of 3 pages
connections that may be required during the project construction period.
Sizes and numbers of meters to be purchased would be decided upon
completion of the distribution system study.
Project Capacity and Utilization
The project components are designed to utilize the present allo-
cation of 10 IMgd from the Chania River to maximum advantage and to
provide flexibility to increase the supply from this source without further
major investments should hydrological data collected in the future
indicate that more water can be taken without impairing downstream interests.
On the basis of present forecasts of demand, the full capacity of the
project should be utilized by about 1980.

Assumptions for Internal Financial Rate of Return
Basic Calculation - (page 1 of th s_Amex)
(1)       Incremental water sales are based on volume projections used
for financial forecasts which assume an increase in sales of
approximately 6-1/2% annually. The water rate for such incre-
mental sales is 6 sh/1000 gallons as proposed by NCC.
(2)       Incremental operating costs are at January 1970 price levels.
(3)       Project investment costs are at January 1970 price levels and
exclude the provision for escalation and duties included in
the project cost estimate.
(4)       A provision for year-to-year investment for distribution extensions
is included. Such expenditures will be necessary to reach sales
projections. This effectively provides that the return calculated
is for an integrated project, including not only source and
treatment plant but distribution as well.
(5)       The operating capacity for the project of 10 IYgd will be fully
utilized in 1981.
Sensitivity Analyses - (page 2 of this Annex)
(6)       Figure 1 relates present value of this investment to various
interest rates.
(7)       Figure 2 relates return on investment to project investment
costs between 80% and 140% of the cost estimates.
(8)       Figure 3 relates return on investment for annual growth in
water demand between 5% and 8%.
(9)       Figure 4 relates return on investment to water rates between
4 and 7 sh/1000 gals.
(10)      Figure 5 relates return on investment to operating cost
between 100% and 120% of those assumed.
(11)      Figure 6 relates return on investment to the real cost of
unskilled labor as a % of money wages (shadow price).

Nairobi City Council
Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
1.        All forecasts are generally based on projections developed by NCC
which were considered reasonable when reviewed at the time of the appraisal
mission.
Income Statements
2.        Unaccounted-for water is defined as the difference between water
produced and water sold and is assumed to be 15%, comparable to actual past
experience.
3.        Water production and sales are assumed to increase at a rate of
approximately 6-1/2% annually. Water rates are assumed to increase from
present levels to approximately 6sh/1000 gal in January 1972.
4.        Sewage charges will be continued at the existing rate of 3.5sh/1000
gal handled. Sewage volume is estimated at 70% of water sales.
5.        Numbers of connections are estimated considering building and
system expansion plans, with an average increase over the years of approxi-
mately 6-1/2% annually.
6.        Miscellaneous billings increase from 1969 to 1970 and again to
1971 due tO the new meter service charge. After 1971, such billings are
estimated to increase at 5% annually.
7.        Fees for connections and work done for customers is estimated
to increase at about 6% annually.
8.        Power costs are assumed to increase 5% in 1973 and a further 5%
in 1976 and in accordance with volume.
9.        Chemical costs are assumed to increase at 2-1/2% annually over
1969 price levels and in accordance with volume.
10.       Maintenance and operation costs are assumed to increase at 5%
annually in addition to added costs for expanded operations.
11,       Salaries and Administration costs are assumed to increase at a
rate of 5% annually after an initial increase in 1970, on establishment of
the new organization.



kiEX 16
Page 2 of 4 pages
12.       Costs for connections and work done for customers are estimated
to increase at about 6% annually.
13.       Depreciation is defined as charges against income for "Capital
Discharged" which is the amount of debt amortized in a year. WSD will
borrow from the Consolidated Loans Fund and amortization of such loans
will be in accordance with the terms of an identified loan to the NCC (as
is the case of the proposed IBRD loan) or over the estimated life of the
assets. This writing down of assets is assumed to be comparable to
depreciation and is at a rate of roughly 3% of gross assets annually for
water and 2.4% for sewerage, depending on amortization schedules. These
amounts are reasonable.
14.       Write-off of deferred charges is assumed to be over a 10 year
period commencing in 1975. Most of these deferred charges are preliminary
expenses for the project.
15.       Interest on other borrowings has been projected based on interest
paid by NCC to its creditors which varies with its obligations outstanding
but is roughly 7%.
16.       Non-operating income is primarily interest received by WSD on its
investments and has been assumed most conservatively at 4%. For 1969 and
1970 it is also assumed that some funds from sewerage operations will be
transferred to NCC General Fund Accounts, of which sewerage is now a part,
to ease transition problems.
Sources and Applications of Funds Statement
17.       Capital contributions are amounts paid by property owners in areas
where sewer systems are installed and is comparable to an assessment. The
amounts noted consider the areas expected to be provided with sewers over
the coming years.
18.       IBRD loan drawdowns are generally comparable to project foreign
exchange expenditures, including interest during construction. To the extent
NCC uses its own funds as working capital for the project and only requests
reimbursements from the IBRD afterwards, these drawdowns may be delayed.
This, in turn, would reduce interest during construction charges.
19.       Loan drawdowns from other sources in 1973 are assumed to be for
sewerage construction and to be amortized over 40 years at 7% interest.
Since such funds may be needed only in the short-term (the WSD will generate
substantial surpluses in 1974 and forward), NCC may choose to provide these
funds with short-term financing. This would reduce the current ratio in
1974 forward but should not place the WSD in an adverse financial position.
20.       Current liabilities are assumed to increase at about 5% annually,
roughly in accordance with expanding operations.



ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 4 pages
21.       Deposits are required of water customers and are assumed to
increase at 6-7% annually in line with increased operations.
22.       Accounts receivable increased substantially in 1968 with the
introduction of computer billing and consequent confusion. NCO is
aggressively correcting this situation and should reduce accounts receivable
to reasonable levels over 1969-70. For 1971 forward, accounts receivable
are assumed to gradually drop from 11% of billings to 9-1/2% or slightly
over one month's sales. In past years, receivables have been 2-1/2 - 10%
of billings.
23.       Investments are assumed to increase or decrease depending on
availability of funds, keeping cash on hand in the range of KS 50-100,000.
24.       Project expenditures are in accordance with the project cost
estimate. Expenditures for other water and sewerage projects are estimated
considering NCC's plans.
25.       Amortization for the IBRD loan assumes the loan is made about
November 1970,a closing date of March 31, 1975, interest during construction
for the period to January 31, 1975, and amortization commencing August 1975
and ending August 1990 (20-year loan). Interest is assumed at 7-1/4% and
cammitment fee at 3/4%.
26.       Loan amortization for existing loans is derived from the terms of
such loans. Interest is noted in paragraph 15. New loan conditions are
noted in paragraph 19.
27.       Reduction in Employee Benefit Reserves reflects the gradual pay-off
of past employees.
28.       The inventory increase in 1971 reflects correction of low levels
on certain items, principally water meters.  Future increases are estimated
at 5% annually, comparable to increases in operation.
29.       Long-term receivables are obligations of property owners who are
allowed to pay capital contributions for sewers over a period of time
(paragraph 17). Variations consider new obligations incurred as well as
past ones discharged.
Balance Sheets
30.       The initial balance sheet is based on existing accounts for water
operations and constructed accounts for sewerage which, in the past, was
included within the Public Works and Services accounts of the NCC General
Fund. To the extent that sewerage assots and liabilities transferred from
the General Fund to the new department are different, all financial
projections would be affected.



ANNEX 16
Page   o f 4 pages
31.       Nost balance sheet entries are derived from variations vhich have
been assumed and noted in paragraphs 2-29.
32.       Fixed assets are shown at historical costs.
33.       Reserve for bad debts has not been increased since losses in the
past have been negligible.
34.       Interest during construction, 1970-74., on the Bank loan has been
capitalized.
