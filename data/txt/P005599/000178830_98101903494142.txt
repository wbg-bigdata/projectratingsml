REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
SECOND TUNISIAN PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Bank has been asked by the Government of Tunisia to help
finance improvements to the ports under the control of the Office des Ports
Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT).
ii.       The project consists of a number of elements designed to ensure
more efficient operation in OPNT's ports including: dredging at the ports
of La Goulette, Bizerte-Menzel Bourguiba and Sfax; provision of a new
dredger and tug; provision of tractors, forklift trucks, and mobile cranes
at La Goulette and Sfax and the rehabilitation of the existing portal cranes
at La Goulette; reconstruction of the island breakwater at Bizerte; con-
struction of a new bulk-grain berth and storage facility at La Goulette;
assistance in training OPNT staff in accounting and financial management;
and necessary consulting services. The total cost is estimated to be US$10.73
million (D 5.63 million) of which the proposed credit of US$865 million
(D 4.46 million) would finance the estimated foreign exchange cost.
iii.      An earlier Loan (No. 380-TUN of US$7.0 million) was made to the
Government of Tunisia in June 1964, for extension of the port of La Goulette.
The construction works have been satisfactorily completed and the loan was
fully disbursed by the Closing Date of March 31, 1968. The law creating
OPNT was passed as one of the conditions of the loan, and the new organization
is functioning satisfactorily except for the Accounts Department which needs
strengthening. One requirement under the loan has not been complied with:
the construction of bulk-grain handling facilities. This is due to lack of
finance, and the Bank is now including it in the new project.
iv.       OPNT controls all shipping entering its ports, but cargo-handling
is carried out by concessionaires, the most important of which is the Societe
Tunisienne d'Acconage et de Kanutention (STIUi).  OPMT provides portal cranes
on the quays, floating cranes, and some equipment for use by consignees or
their agents on taking delivery of cargo. STAM generally provides the tractors,
forklift trucks and mobile cranes for cargo-handling on the quays.
v.        Total traffic through OPNT ports has grown irregularly from 5.6
million tons in 1963 to 8.2 million tons in 1966 and was 7.5 million tons in
1967 due to the situation in the Middle East. Most of the increase has been
in bulk traffic. Future traffic is expected to grow at a modest rate of
about four per cent per annum, taking into account the expected increase in
economic activity and changes in demand. Future exports of phosphates from
southern Tunisian mines cannot be clearly determined at this time. They will
depend upon further investment in the mines and Tunisia's share of the world
market.
vi.       The present project covers the immediate development requirements
of O?NT.  Certain capital expenditure will be incurred by OPTT in the normal



- ii -
course of operations and a further extension of Tunis/La Goulette is
expected to be required about 1972. The Government intends to develop
a newJ port at Gabes. Before this port is completed it will be neces-
sary to consider incorporation of the new port in OPNT, to review the
distribution of traffic between Sfax and Gabes, and to consider the
effects on OPNT's finances.
vii.      All the proposed items in the project are operationally and
technically justified. The economic rates of return on the different
items range between 10% and 25' and these are considered satisfactory.
viii.     The cash position of OPNT is satisfactory and is expected to
continue to be so. Consultants are reviewJing OPNT's tariff structure
and rates and their recommendations, due in 1968, are expected to include
changes that will result in increased revenues. The specific changes and
expected results are not known but the Bank will require that tariffs be
applied to produce revenues sufficient to assure a rate of at least six
per cent in 1971 on the average value of net fixed assets and seven per
cent in 1973, and increasing thereafter.
ix.       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank Loan to OPNT
of US$8.5 million, for a period of 30 years, including 10 years' grace
at  D6,   per annum   interest.    The Government of Tunisia would be
the Guarantor.



FEPUBMIC OF TUHISIA
SECOND TUIESIAN FORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia in August 1966 requested the Bank to
assist in financing improvements to the ports operated by the Office des
Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT). The proposed loan of US$8.5 million
covers the estimated foreign exchange costs out of a total estimated cost
of US$10.7 million equivalent, and will be made to OPNT at 6-Va interest
rate for a 30-year repayment period including 10 years' grace with the
Government as Guarantor. The project consists of dredging at the ports
of La Goulette (Tunis), Bizerte-Menzel Bourguiba and Sfax; provision of
a dredger and attendant tug for maintenance dredging; replacement of
cargo-handling equipment, provision of additional equipment, and re-
habilitation of quay cranes; reconstruction of the island breakwater at
Bizerte; construction of a bulk-grain berth and storage facility at La
Goulette; training of accounting staff; and the provision of accounting
and engineering consultants. Details are given in Chapter 5.
1.02      Tunisia has previously received a Bank loan of US$7.0 million
for port improvements at Tunis-La Goulette. Construction of the project
was satisfactorily completed in November 1967. Further details are
given in paras. 2.09 - 2.12.
1.03      The following appraisal report is based on the findings of a
preliminary Bank mission to Tunisia in May/June 1967, an appraisal mis-
sion in November 1967, and a follow-up mission in March 1968, to settle
the details of the project and to update the information. The missions
have included at various times, Messrs. Clark, Dobie, Higginbottom, Muth
and Pusar., Tlis report has been prepared by Messrs. Awar, Clark and
Higginbottom.
2. BACKGROUND
A. General (see Map 1)
2.01      Tunisia, with an area of 164,000 sq km or about one-quarter of
the area of France, has a population of about 4.5 million, estimated to be
increasing at an annual rate of 2.3%. It is bordered by the Mediter-
ranean to the north and east, Algeria to the mest, and Libya to the south
and southeast. The coastline is some 1200 km, and there are four major
ports: Bizerte-Menzel Bourguiba, Sfax, Sousse and Tunis-La Goulette
all under OPNT control. Tunis is the capital and, mith La Goulette, is
the country's largest port. The Government is building a new port at
Gabes for the development of southern Tunisia.



- 2 -
2.02      The gross national product (GNP) in 1967 amounted to US$963
million, or US$215 per capita. ,eal output grew by about four per cent
annually between 1960 and 1967.2J
2.03      Agriculture contributed some 18% to GNP, and provided
about one-half of all employment in 1966. The principal agrLcultural
products are cereals, olives, vegetables and citrus fruit, and wine. The
share of agriculture has been declining as mining, manufacturing and
tourism have grown more rapidly. Tunisia's first oil refinery (1963) and
steel works (1964) have started production and further increases are ex-
pected. The growing volume of tourist traffic has stimulated construction
and related activities.
B. Transport System
2.04      Tunisia is served by a relatively well-developed transport system.
In 1966, there were about 16,000 km of roads, almost two-thirds of which
were surfaced. The road network is best developed in the north where in-
dustrial activities are concentrated.
2.05      The railway network consists of 1,110 route-km of standard-gauge
and 911 route-km of narrow-gauge track. The two systems link up at Tunis.
Until the end of 1966 the standard-gauge system and part of the narrow-
gauge system were operated by the government-owned Railroad company, and
the rest by a privately-owned company on a concession basis. All systems
are now government-operated. Part of the narrow-gauge network serves
largely the transport of phosphates from Gafsa to Sfax and is linked to
the port of Gabes. The possibility of a direct connection between Gafsa
and Gabes is under consideration by the Government and has been referred
to the Bank for possible inclusion in the proposed Railway Loan at present
under appraisal.
2.06      The Government has a large degree of control over rail and road
operations through the fixing of tariffs, licensing of routes for road
transport, dispatching of commodities, control of investments, etc. Prior
to independence, Government policy aimed to regulate transport by adminis-
trative means with little reliance on competition and consumer choice, and
favored the railways. The shortcomings of this system are being increasing-
ly recognized by the Government. An important development was the establish-
ment in 1966 of the Directorate of Transport within the M1inistry of Public
Works with responsibility to formulate and recommend transport policies. In
addition, a UNDP study of the transport sector, with the Bank as Executing
Agency, has been undertaken. One of the objectives of the study was to
establish a transport policy offering a better balance between all modes of
transport.

March 19, 1968.



2.07        The only major airport of the country is at Tunis, which is
connected by scheduled air services with cities in Europe, Africa and
Asia.
2.08      OPilT's four above-mentioned ports ancd their respective ser-
vice areas are in general well served by roads and railroads. The access
routes are generally adequate even for growing traffic volumes, with the
exception of the existing road linking Tunis and La Goulette, and the
access to La Gouletbe from the south, which are being improved.
C. E>dsting Loan - 380-TUNq Port of Tunis-La Goulette ProJect
2.09        A loan of US$7.0 million was made to the Government of Tunisia
in June 1964 to improve the general-caxgo facilities at La Goulette. The
project consisted of extending the 730 m quay to 1100 m and constructing
transit sheds and ancillary works. The originally estimated total cost
was D 4.8 million (US$l11.4 million) at the then rate of exchange. Final
contract costs have not yet been agreed but are presently estimated at
about D 6.2 million. Approximately half of the increased cost is due to
the increased Dinar equivalent of the foreign exchange costs following de-
valuation of the Tunisian Dinar on September 28, 1964, and the balance to
increased quantities and prices.
2.10        The loan did not become effective until June 1965, awaiting
passage of the law creating the Office des Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT)
to replace the former "Regie des Ports". (See Chlapter 3). Work was com-
pleted in November 1967 and the Closing Date was extended from June 30, 1967
to March 31, 1968.
2.11        OPNT was responsible for carrying out the project which was
done satisfactorily with the help of engineering consultants Bureau Central
d'Etudes pour les Equipements d'Outre Mer (BCEOM). Accounting Consultants,
HoweLl & Co., are helping to establish and operate financial and costing
systems, and are training OPNT's accounting staff.
2.12        The Government and OPNT have met the requirements of the loan
except for the provision of bulk-grain handling facilities at La Goulette
which they have been unable to finance; this item is now included in the
present project at the request of the Government.



3. EXISTING FACILITIES AND ORGAI\ZATION
A.  Office des Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT)
3.01      Prior to Loan 380-TUN the ports of Tunisia were controlled by
the "Regie des Ports de Commerce", a division of the Ministry of Public
Works.  The law of February 12, 1965, established OPNT as an independent
authority, managed by a Director General who is responsible to a Board of
Directors composed of three representatives of the Government and four
representatives of port users and related interests. The Government rep-
resentatives are appointed jointly by the Ministry of Planning and
National Economy and the Mlinistry of Public Works. The M4inister of Public
lWJorks is the president of the Board. OPNT is responsible for the opera-
tion, development and maintenance of the ports of Bizerte, Tunis-La
Goulette, Sousse and Sfax; and the jurisdiction of Bizerte has been ex-
tended to cover the adjacent port of Menzel Bourguiba. OPNT also provides
pilotage, towage, and navigational aids within the port limits, controls
and supervises the quays and harbors and provides railway service within
the port limits. OPNT has a satisfactory degree of autonomy in both
administrative and financial matters. The Government intends to develop
a new port at Gabes and the necessity for its inclusion under OPNT's
jurisdiction and the consequent necessity to amend the existing law will
be discussed and agreed between the Government, the Bank and OPNT. (See
also 4.16).
3.02      With few exceptions (see paras. 3.09 - 3.11) OPNT does not
operate cargo-handling services although it provides some equipment for
that purpose. Health and immigration services, police and customs are
the responsibility of separate government agencies.
3.03      The general organization of OPNT has proved adequate to the
tasks required of it. I-lowever, strengthening of the Accounts Department
is required, both to enable the new financial and costing systems to be
operated efficiently and to enable OPNT to take over responsibility for
collecting its own revenue; this latter f2unction is at present under-
taken by Customs at a cost of one percent of revenue collected. The
accounting consultants provide practical and advisory assistance and
conduct training programs for the accounts staff. Loan 380-TUN helped
finance the foreign exchange costs of these services up to March 31, 1968.
3.04      OPNT appreciates the importance of providing an efficient ac-
counts department, using modern    commercial accounting methods, and
able to produce financial data for the use of management. This is a
relatively long-term process and management must be able to understand
and use the reports. Consequently, the present project includes pro-
vision for further training and advisory services.



B.  Operations
(i) General
3.05      The locations of the ports now controlled by OPNT and the port
of Gabes are shown on HMap Ho. 1 and details ofOPINT's facilities are given
in Table 1. Day and night pilotage is provided at all ports and tug
services are provided as necessary either by OP;IT or privately.  Bulk-
loading facilities are available at La Goulette for iron ore and phos-
phates, and at Sfax for phosphates.  Crude petroleum is imported in bulk
for the refinery at Bizerte and refined products are distributed by
coastal tanker.  Tunis-La Coulette is the principal port for general
cargo. All ports have adequate transit shed and open storage facilities
provided by OPMT.
3.06      Cereal imports are handled at La Goulette by discllarging grain
in bulc from ship to ordinary transit sheds, where it is bagged by hand
for distribution to the flour mills in Tunis. It takes about 28 days for
a consignment of 20,000 tons to be handled in this way. Large ships have
to be lightered outside the port in order to enter. Bagged export grain
is hoisted aboard ship and then emptied into the ship's hold. Such
methods are expensive, wasteful of labor, and entail uneconomic use of
general cargo facilities. This situation will be alleviated when the new
bulk-grain berth and storage facility to be provided in the project (5.02
(e)) are available.
3.07      Now that the La Goulette project is completed, traffic will be
diverted from the old congested wharves in Tunis to the extent possible.
liaintenance of the Tunis-La Goulette canal has been stopped and the canal
will find its own bed-level. This is expected to limit the use of the
canal to ships drawing 5.5 m and reduce cargo traffic using Tunis to about
453,ooo tons per annum. Passenger ships have started to use the new
passenger terninal at La Goulette.
3.08      OPUT maintains the ports, the breaknjaters, and the entrance
channels; dredging is done by one bucket-dredger which is in poor condi-
tion and beyond economic repair, and by one grab-dredger for operations
alongside the quays. Except for the island breakwater at Bizerte, the
breakwaters are in good condition.
(ii) Cargo-Handling
3.09      Movement of cargo from ships and within the ports to the sheds
or stacking areas is done by cargo-handling companies which employ all
necessary labor.    The most important of these companies is STAM, in which
Government has a majority share interest, the balance being held privately.



- 6 -
STAM operates in all OPNT ports and provides exclusive service at Tunis-
La Goulette, where it employs 1,200 permanent and 600 casual dockers.
Separate charges are made by the cargo-handling companies for stevedoring
and for cargo movement in the ports.
3.10        STM4 normally hires portal or floating cranes from OPNT for
its stevedoring operations or uses ships' gear. The reliability of the
portal cranes is such th,at their use is limited particularly at La Goulette,
and this results in slow handling of vessels. The floating cranes are
also old and slow, but their use is generally limited. STAM has its own
tractors, forklift trucks, and mobile cranes for cargo movement from ships'
side to shed or stacking area but much of this is beyond its economic life.
Details are given in Table 2. The regulations governing STAM's operations
in the ports require it to obtain approval from OPNT to operate new equip-
ment in excess of its present holding. Authorization is not required to
replace existing equipment.
3.11       ONT's cargo-handling equipment, also detailed in Table 2,is
essentially for hire to consignees and their agents for handling goods
onto or from their own vehicles, or to STAM for its operations. Much of
this equipment is also beyond its economic life and OPNT has been unable
to meet the requirements of importers and exporters in recent years. Con-
signees are not normally permitted to use their own equipment except in
the case of special consignments. OPNT does not handle cargo in the ports
it controls, but recently at Bizerte, Sousse, and Sfax it has undertaken
the protection of goods in sheds and on open storage areas; if this
proves successful it will probably extend this to Tunis-La Goulette.
3.12        Labor relations in the ports are good.  There is, however, a
labor surplus in the country and efforts to reduce port labor are resisted.
The permanent labor force employed by STAM (1200 men) is consistent with
present traffic handled, and may need to be increased, or additional
machires purchased, to meet forecast traffic increases.   However, the
need for casual labor over and above the existing permanent labor force
will be reduced by the introduction of more efficient equipment, as is
proposed under the project. The need to reduce the existing casual labor
force by retirement through natural causes over the next ten years and
limitation of recruitment has been discussed with the Government which
agrees with the Bani'ts viei% on this matter.
3.13        Port regulations, including those relating to cargo-handling
procedures, are presently under review. The new regulations, when pro-
mulgated, will give OPNT sole jurisdiction in these matters within the
port   areas.
3.14        OPNT has taken out and maintains adequate insurance against
insurable port operating risks consistent with sound business practice.

4. TRAFFIC AiD PORT DEVELOMENT
A. Shipping
4.01      In 1967, 4,112 ships totalling 6.0 million nrtL entered Tunis-
La Goulette, Bizerte-Menzel Bourguiba, Sfax and Sousse. Tunis-La
Goulette accounted for about 45°, by number and 51% by tonnage, of the
vessels. The corresponding figures for Sfax, second in importance, were
37% and 27%.
4.02      At Bizerte the number of ship-calls has increased considerably
since the country's first oil refinery began operations nearby in 1963
(Table 4). At Sfax, increasing general cargo and phosphate traffic has
caused an increase in ship-calls. No clear trends in number of ship-
calls can be observed at Tunis-La Goulette and Sousse.
B. Present and Future Traffic (Tables 5 - 9)
(i) General
4.03      The start of the petroleum refinery at Bizerte in 1963 pro-
duced an increase in traffic of about 1.1 million tons in the following
year, 550,000 tons in cargo unloaded and about the same in loading
(Table 7). In 1964 the steel mill adiacent to Hienzel Bourguiba also
started up and importation of coke and iron ore commenced. Growth of
overall traffic in 1965 was about five per cent. 1966 produced a
significant increase in iron ore loadings of over 40%, 390,000 tons, and
a moderate increase in other categories. Importation of cereals in Tunis-
La Goulette has increased each year from 95,000 tons in 1964 to 311,000
tons in 1967, but the rate of increase is not steady and depends to a
large extent on the domestic harvest of hard wheat. Future average yearly
imports are forecast at 200,000 tons. (Table 6)
4.04      There was thus a continuing growth in traffic, without a
regular pattern, up to 1967, when the Middle East crisis seriously af-
fected traffic through Tunisian ports. Shipping lines imposed a sur-
charge on all freight through North African ports, resulting in a fall of
about 700,000 tons in total traffic from 8.2 million in 1966 to 7.5
million tons in 1967. This figure, however, was still slightly greater
than that for 1965, and is expected to resume its upward trend by 1968.
4.05      Future total traffic through OPNT ports is expected to in-
crease at an average rate of a little less than four per cent annually,
from 8.2 million tons in 1966 to 12.9 million tons in 1977 (Table 5)
based on 1966 figures. The future rate of traffic growth takes into
account availability of mineral deposits, developments in economic
activity, changes in demand, etc.
1/ nrt - net registered tonnage.



- 8-
(ii) Bulk Traffic
4.o6      La Goulette exports sizeable quantities of iron ore and some
200,000 tons of phosphates annually (Table 6); the Government expects to
increase exports of phosphates through La Goulette to 0.5 million tons per
annum, but no specific date has been fixed, and the increase has not been
included in the traffic projections. Since 1963, Sfax and Bizerte-Menzel
Bourguiba have emerged as the most important bulk ports (Tables 7 and 8),
the former for phosphates (2.4 million tons in 1967) and the latter for
crude oil and refined petroleum products (1.4 million tons in 1967), iron
ore and steel. Most of the shipments of petroleum products from Bizerte
appear as imports in the other three ports, the refinery largely serving
domestic needs.
4.07      Exports of iron ore from Tunis-La Goulette since 1963 were steady
at an average of about 675,000 tons except for 1966 when a little over one
million tons were exported. Future loadings of iron ore from Tunis-La
Goulette are to be limited to about 800,000 tons per annum until 1980,
including 150,000 tons for Menzel Bourguiba, while new possible sources are
explored. To ensure a market for this volume, the Government is negotiating
a three-year contract for the supply of 550,000 tons to ITALSIDER, an Italian
steel producer. An important condition of the contract is the ability to
use bulk carriers of 35,000 deadweight tons requiring 11.6 m depth of water
in the entrance channel and 11.0 m at the iron ore berth. The Government's
present policy is also to increase phosphate exports through La Goulette and
this will be considerably assisted by the availability of a deeper entrance
channel.
4.o8      Indications in the Tunisian Transport Survey draft report of
ITALCONSULT,dated July 1968, are that the production of phosphates in the
Gafsa region might be increased to about 9 million tons of saleable products
per annum by 1980 subject to investment by Tunisia of over $30 million in
each of the 1969/72, 1972/76 and 1976/80 four year plans; appropriate
allocation has been made in the 1969/72 program to be reviewed by the Bank
in the Spring of 1969. Exports are expected to increase as follow3s, and may
increase beyond these figures:
Year                         Tonnage of Saleable Products
(millions)
1969                                     3.7
1970                                    h.0
1972                                     5.0
1980                                     8.2 - 9.0
The projections of traffic in this report have not included export tonnages
through Sfax in excess of 3.3 million as no assurance of the required invest-
ments to achieve higher output has been given to the Bank, and the forecasts
quoted by ITALCONSULT require careful checking.
h.09      Traffic through Bizerte-Menzel Bourguiba is expected to double in
the next decade, largely because of planned capacity increases of both the
refinery and the El Fouladh steel works (Table 7). At Sousse, traffic will



- 9 -
increase in liquid fuel imports and in exports of salt; total traffic is
expected to increase from 235,000 tons in 1966 to some 640,000 tons by 1977
(Table 9).
(iii) General Cargo
4.10      Tunis-La Goulette handled about two-thirds of all general cargo
traffic between 1963 and 1966, but this decreased slightly during and after
1964 due to reduced Franco-Tunisian trade, while for the four ports as a
whole it remained more or less constant.
4.11      General cargo traffic at Tunis-La Goulette (Table 6) is expected
to resume growth as the Tunisian economy continues to expand. Commercial
relations with France have returned to normal assuring a return of some of
Tunisia's important exports (e.g. wine) to their traditional market. Pres-
ently the largest share of this traffic goes through Tunis' old port but
most of it will be handled by the modern facilities at La Goulette just
coming into operation. General-cargo traffic movements through Bizerte-M4enzel
Bourguiba and Sfax are expected to continue to increase in line with economic
growth in the areas served by these ports (Tables 7 and 8).
C.   Port Development
4.12      The Government has a provisional ten-year development plan (1963-
1972) for Tunisia and a more specific four-year plan for the period 1965-
1968. No separate development program exists for OPNT's ports but the
Bureau d'Etudes, formed within OPNT's organization, is preparing a program
the outlines of which are given below.
4.13      In addition to the works included in the proposed project, future
major works are expected to consist of providing additional berths at La
Goulette and reconstruction of the existing general cargo facilities at
Menzel Bourguiba.
4.14      With the 1,100 m of quay, La Goulette has a capacity of about
900,000 tons of general cargo at a normal handling rate. Allowing for
450,000 tons being handled at Tunis, the combined capacity of the port
complex is about 1.35 million tons. General cargo in Tunis-La Goulette is
expected to reach about 1.34 million tons in 1972; by 1977 it is expected
to have increased to about 1.85 million tons and 3-4 new general cargo
berths will be required.  If traffic develops as forecast, work on these
berths could start about 1972, however, the effects of containerization of
general cargo will have to be considered. Estimated cost of construction
which will be required at La Goulette is US$8.5 million equivalent including
$5.25 million foreign exchange.
4.15      An industrial trading estate is being developed near Menzel
Bourguiba, and improvements will be required to the existing port to handle
its raw materials and products. The cost has not been estimated and no
provisional date has yet been set for commencement of this work.
4.16      The present maximum capacity of Sfax to handle phosphate exports
is about 3.3 million tons per annum; beyond this amount nvestments to



- 10 -
improve storage and loading capacity and to nerimit use by larger vessels
would be required. However, the Bank has been informed that the Government
proposes to build a new port at Gabes, and the Government has requested
Bank assistance in constructing a new railway line from the Gafsa mining
complex to Gabes. The justification for constructing the new railway line
is the subject of discussions which are to be held between the Bank,
ITALCONSULT and the Government. The Government has undertaken that some
3.0 million tons of phosphates will continue to be exported through Sfax,
thus assuring OPINT's proJected financial position. However, depending
upon the decision of the Government on the Gafsa to Gabes railway connection,
it may be that continued exportation through Sfax will prove uneconomic.
Therefore, when the Gabes port is completed, the Bank should review the
position and possibly relieve the Government of its commitment to export
3.0 million tons of phosphate through Sfax. In such case the Bank and the
Government would also have to discuss whether the port of Gabes should be
included in OPNT and on what terms and conditions.
4.17      Following issue of the final report of the Tunisian Transport
Survey, just completed, the Government and OPNT will discuss future port
investment with the Bank. This will cover the period to 1976 and include
the development of the port at Gabes. The Banl will be given the opportunity
to comment on these developments. (see 5.12)
5. THE PROJECT
5.01      The Project consists of the following items:
(a)   dredging to increase the depth and width in entrance channels and
approaches and alongside bulk facilities at La Goulette, Sfax and
Bizerte, to permit access of larger bulk oil and ore carriers;
(b)   provision of a small suction dredger and attendant tug for main-
tenance dredging of OPNT's ports;
(c)   provision of cargo-handling equipment including tractors, forklift
trucks, and mobile cranes at Tunis-La Goulette and Sfax, and the
rehabilitation of seven 7-ton portal quay cranes at La Goulette;
(d)   restoration of the island breakwater at Bizerte to insure adequate
protection inside the harbor;
(e)   provision of a new bulk-grain berth and storage installation on
the south side of La Goulette harbor;
(f)   training of OPNT staff in accounting and financial management and
provision of accounting consultants;
(g)   provision of engineering consultants to assist OPNT in the
execution of the project.
The total estimated project cost is US$10.73 million equivalent, including
US$8.5 million equivalent in foreign exchange.
5.02      The items comprising the project are further described below:



(a)  Dredging
(i)   The entrance channel to La Goulette harbor will be dredged
to 11.6 m and a channel leading to the iron ore berth to 11.0 m so that the
iron ore berth can be used by bulk carriers of 10.5 m draft and the proposed
cereals berth by vessels of 9.5 m draft. About 1.7 million m3 of spoil are
to be dredged at an estimated cost of US$1.23 million. The Government has
agreed that it will carry out necessary sheet piling of the front of the
iron ore berth so that it can be deepened to 11 m now and eventually to 12 m;
and has indicated the necessity for this dredging, to meet the requirements
of its existing contract with ITALSIDER.
(ii)  The 4,500 m entrance channel at Sfax has a width of 50 m over
3,000 m of its length, increasing to 150 m at its seaward end.   This is to be
widened over the necessary length to 60 m, considered the minimum safe width
for passage of single vessels.  About 300,000 m3 cf spoil are to be dredged
at an estimated cost of US$210,000.
(iii) The petroleum products berth at Bizerte, which serves the
refinery, presently has an available depth of 9 m; the main entrance channel
from the open sea has a depth of 12 m.  Deepening to 12 m alongside the berth
will provide accommodation for vessels of about 50,000 dwt, a size currently
in regular use in the distribution of crude petroleum. About 230,000 m3
of spoil are to be dredged, including some 30,000 m3 of rock, at an estimated
cost of US$410,000.
(iv)   Bulk supplies of iron ore and coke for the El Fouladh steel
vorks are imported through Menzel Bourguiba; the depth alongside the bulk-
cargo wharf is to be increased from its present 7 m to 10.5 m, to permit
importation of coke by larger bulk carriers. About 100,000 m3 need to be
dredged at an estimated cost of US$70,000.
(b)  Provision of Dredger and Attendant Tug
Maintenance dredging in OPNT's harbors will amount to between
210,000 and 2h0,000 m3 per annum. The existing bucket dredger is beyond
economic repair and cannot do this work, although the present hopper barges
can be used. A 200 m3/hour capacity suction dredger, with 1,000 m of de-
livery pipe, is therefore included in the project, together with a 750 HP
tug, to position the dredger for work in the harbors, to tow it between ports,
and to move the hopper barges when necessary. This tug can also supplement
the harbor tugs for ship movements when not in use for dredging operations.
Entrance channels to the ports require little annual maintenance dredging
and this will be accumulated and done at long intervals by contract; the
new dredger can clear local storm accumulations. It will also have a
surplus capacity for minor capital improvements or for use in maintaining
Government fishing harbors. The estimated cost of the dredger and pipeline
is US$700,000 and the tug US$240,000.
(c)   Cargo-Handling Equipment
(i)   The tractors, forklift trucks, and mobile cranes owned by
OPNT and STAM are generally old and uneconomic to maintain and there is need
for a 10-ton mobile crane at Tunis and La Goulette. Similar equipment to be
procured is appropriate to the needs of OPNT and STAM (Table 3). The
equipment required by STAM will be made available upon terms a.d conditions,
acceptable to UPVT "TANI aid the Bank, which have been agreed. The estimated
cost is US$600.O00. being U13$270.000 t'or STAM and US,) o.uOO0 for OPNT.



- 12 -
(ii) The 1,100 meter quay at La Goulette has three portal cranes in
service, out of the seven available, due to poor condition of the elec-
trical circuits and equipment. The cranes have been under-utilized in
the past, due to their unreliability and the small amount of general
cargo traffic at La Goulette prior to its modernization. The newly
completed port works are expected to increase the use of the quay cranes
gradually to an average of about l 500 hours per crane annually, resulting
in more rapid turn-around of vessels. The cranes are in good overall con-
dition, except for the electrical installations, and still have at least
15 years useful life. Accordingly, necessary improvements to the electri-
cal installation, together with ancillary work to bring the cranes into
full service, are included in the project at an estinated cost of
US$275,000. Spare parts at an additional cost of US$30,000 are also
included.
(d) Bizerte Breakwater
The oil berth serving the refinery at Bizerte is located in the
outer harbor on one of the two breakwater arms. The entrance is protected
by an island breakwater about 610 m long, situated about 500 m from the
entrance in 17 m of water. The island breakwater has suffered serious
storm damage and requires substantial reconstruction to enable it to con-
tinue to protect the harbor generally and the oil berth in particular.
The work requires special equipment and will include tests of the stabilit7
of the construction. The estimated total cost is US$700,000.
(e) Bulk-Grain Berth and Storage Facility at La Goulette
The bulk-grain installation to be constructed on the south side
of La Goulette harbor comprises concrete storage silos of 30,000 tons
capacity with appropriate mechanical equipment for loading or discharging
vessels and conveying grain to or from the silo at a rate of 250 tons/hour.
The new berth which will serve the installation consists of separate
dolphins with the center one supporting the mechanical loader/discharger.
It will be dredged to 10.0 m and will be designed for future dredging to
12.0 m. The estimated cost of the grain-handling facility is US$3.3 million
and of the berth, Us$455,000 - a total of about US$3.8 million equivalent.
The storage facility will be leased by OPNT to the Office des Cereals on
terms and conditions which have been agreed.
(f) Staff Training in Accounting and Financial iIanagement
and Accounting Consultants
There is need to strengthen the staff of the Accounts Department
of OPNT (see 3.03) and the present accounting consultants, Howell & Co.,
are satisfactorily conducting a training program approved by the- anz.
The present phase commenced in January 1968, and is expected to be completed
in 1969. The Bank agreed that foreign exchange costs incurred up to March
31, 1968, to a maximum of US$30,000 were to be met from Loan 380-TUIN.
Estimated costs of the OPNT training program from April 1, 1968 and the pro-
vision of a fellowship abroad for a trainee financial manager (para. 7.13)
are included in the present project, together with accounting consultant
services to assist OPI'T during the training period of the accounts depart-
ment staff. The total estimated costs for training and supervisory work
from April 1, 1968 are US$270,000.

5.03      OPNT has agreed. to retain engineering and accounting consultants
satisfactory to the Bank.

- 14 -
5.05      The cost esti-Mates are consi dered realistic. Dredging costs
have been based on recent contracts for similar types of dredged material.
The estimated costs of cargo-handling equipment and of consultants'
services are in line with those charged recently on contracts or studies
with which the Bank has been associated. Engineering contingencies are
about 15%0 for the bulk-grain storage and handling equipment 121-g for
dredging, 5%+ for cargo-handling equipment and 10% for others.  The con-
tingency item for increase in prices is equivalent to about 6,% of all
project items.
Foreign Exchange Content
5.06      The average foreign exchange component (about 80%) is higher
than is normally the case in port projects due to the composition of the
project; the cargo-handling equipment and the dredger and tug will be
procured abroad and involve little local expenditure, as will the mechan-
ical equipment for the bulk-grain handling installation. The foreign ex-
change component of dredging is calculated at 80% which is normal.
Disbursement Procedure
5.07      It is recommended that disbursement of the loan be on the basis
of actual approved foreign currency expenditures. The estimated schedule
of disbursement is as follows:
US$ '000
1968          195
1969        1,715
1970        3,1485
1971        2,655
1972         1450
8,500
Local Currency Costs
5.08      As is indicated in Section 7, OPNT's cash position is sound and
it should have no difficulty in providing the local currency costs of the
project.
Procurement
5.09      The contracts for procurement of equipment and execution of
dredging and other works will be let in accordance with the Bank's pro-
cedure for international competitive bidding. OPNT is already familiar
with the Bank's requirement in this respect.
5.10      The project is expected to be completed within a period of four
years. OPNT is considered competent to execute the project with the help
of engineering and financial consultants as indicated.



- 15 -
5.11      It is recozmmended that if any funds remain undisbursed on
completion of the project, consideration be given to providing additional
cargo-handling equipment, subject to a check on the situation by a super-
vision mission; some of the equipment which is at present within its
normal operating life should need replacement in another three or four
years time.
5.12      The Government has agreed to prepare successive port development
programs at least until December 1976; it will produce the first four-year
plan not later than December 31, 1969 and will give the Bani    opportunity
for comment.       It will take into account the Transport Survey Report
at present under   revieu.      It has also been agreed that, until the
project has been ccrpleted, CPNIT shall not incur major capital expenditures,
other than on the project,without prior agreement of the Banlc.
Thereafter OPNT shall consult with the   Bar<{  before undertakin- mnajor
capital expenditure.
6. ECONCMIC JUSTIFIGATION
6.01      The objective of the project is to ensuire more efficient opera-
tions in the OPNT ports.  -7'e. quantifiable benefits attributable to the
project take the fc v; D lower shipping costs resulting from the use of
larger v'-.,ela, faster turnaround of ships, and improved operating
efficiency deriving from new facilities and equipment.   In the first
instance, most of these savings will accrue mainly to foreign shipping
lines although, eventually, they will benefit the Tunisian economy pri-
marily in the form of lower shipping rates and reduced transport costs.
A.   Capital Dredging
(i) Tunis-La Goulette
6.02      The proposed capital dredging to 11.6 m in the access channel and
to 11 m in the harbor channel will permit larger ships to call at this port.
6.03      About 100,000 tons of cereals - or half of total imports - are
imported annually from the United States through La Goulette.   For this
long-haul tonnage, the use of bulk carriers with nearly twice the capa-
city of present vessels is estimated to yield annual savings in shipping
costs of US$75,000.
6.04      The Government is presently negotiating a three-year contract for
the export of 550,000 tons of iron ore per year to Italy (para. 4.07). This
will leave about 100,000 tons a year for export to northern Europe, or a total
export of 650,000 tons a year estimated for 1971-1980.
6.05          On the basis of escinated unit savings of USjO.10 and US6'0.22
per ton for shipments to Italy and to the U.K., respectively, total annual
savings in shipping costs will be US$77,000.



- 16 -
6.o6      About 200,000 tons of phosphates are exported anntually from
Tunis-La Goulette to various points in the Y'editerranean. Annual savings
in shipping costs will be about US$10,000 assuming no further growth in
tonnage.
6.07      Given the surrounding tourist attractions, about 12 large
cruise vessels a year, which cannot now call at La Goulette, could be
expected to do so once the proposed dredging is done. On the basis of
a net contribution in foreign exchange of US$10 per tourist, the resulting
annual benefits will be US$30,000.
6.o8      Assuming a project life of 25 years and increased maintenance
dredging costs of US$5,000 a year, the proposed dredging will yield a
return of 10%.
(ii)   Sfax
6.09      Widening the entrance channel at Sfax would result in faster
ship turnaround. With 500-800 vessels calling annually and unit savings
of 20 minutes per vessel, total annual savings will be US$12,000, or the
equivalent of 8 ship-days.
6.10      Widening the channel will also enable about 120 vessels, or
2h0 passages, per year to use one tug instead of two. At an estimated
saving of US$125 per passage, total annual savings will be US$30,000.
6.11      Assuming maintenance dredging costs of US$14,000 every five
years, and discounting the benefits over a period of 25 years, the
project will yield a return of 11%. It is possible, that with the
development of Gabes the number of vessels calling at Sfax, and consequently
the return, will be reduced.  However, no benefit has been included for
the additional safety of harbor operations in the above calculations and
these benefits may be expected to balance the loss due to reduction of
shipping.
(iii) Bizerte
6.12      Crude oil shipments to Bizerte are projected to increase from
735,000 tons in 1967 to 1.74 million by 1977 (Table 7). In the absence
of data, it is conservatively assumed that only 10% of total crude oil
imports will come from the eastern Mediterranean, while 90% of imports
will come from La Skhirra (Map No. 1).
6.13      The project would permit the use of tankers almost three times
the maximum size of vessels presently operating between Lebanon and Bizerte.
The resulting freight cost savings will be US$1.25 per ton, or a total of
US$160,000 in 1973, and US$220,000 a year beyond 1977. Discounting the
benefits over 25 years, the proposed investment will yield a return of
about 25%.

(iv) M2nzel Bourguiba
6.14      The limited amount of dredging proposed for this port will
permit the use of larger coke carriers, thus eventually reducing pro-
duction costs at the El Fouladh steel works.    The planned expansion of
steel production will result in a corresponding increase in coke imports
from 80,000 tons in 1966, to 120,000 in 1971, respectively.
6.15      In estimating the benefits, however, it has been assumed that
a constant volume of 40,000 tons a year will continue to come from the
U.S., but in larger vessels than at present.    The resulting savings in
shipping costs, discounted over 25 years, yield a return of 23 ,J.
This excludes possible savings on coke imports from European sources.
B.   Dredger and Tug
6.16      The Government has requested replacement of the existing
uneconomic dredger by a new dredger and tug which will have an annual
output of 300-400,000 m3.   The annual maintenance dredging required for
OPNT ports is between 210,000 and 240,000 m3.
6.17      Over a period of 25 years, the total capital and operating cost
of maintenance dredging by OPNT, using its own equipment, will be US$2.2
million, discounted at 10 5 (Table 10).
6.18      The alternative would be to have the maintenance carried out
by contract dredging at regular five-year intervals.    The unit price of
contract dredging is estimated to range between US$0.60 and 0.80 per m3,
with a probable price of US$0.70 per m3.   Table 10 shows the present
value of the cost of contract dredging discounted   at 10, ior  25
years, at the alternative unit prices.   It is concluded from this that
contract dredging is a more efficient alternative at unit prices of up to
about US$0.75 per m3.   At US$0.80 per m3, dredging by OFlT equipment will
result in savings of US$112,000 versus a loss of US$178,000 at the most
likely price of US$0.70 per m3.
6.19      On the basis of the preceding analysis,    contract dredging
appears to be the more efficient alternative at a discount rate greater
than seven per cent.  The Bank discussed the analyrsis *e-th the Govern-
ment which desires that the dredger and tug remain in the project.    Its
reasons are: (a) the surplus capacity can be utilized for dredging and
improving other Tunisian harbors, mainly fishing ports; (b) OPNT will
be able to meet most emergency needs without incurring possibly high costs
and delays; (c) some savings in scarce foreign exchange may be expected
if OPNT owned the dredging equipment.    The added costs of OPNT's dredger
may be regarded as an "insurance premium" to achieve these results. Given
the amounts involved, the dredger and tug are considered acceptable for
inclusion in the project.

C.   Cargo-Handling Eauipment
6.20      Without adequate cargo-handling equipment, the project ports
would suffer increasing congestion.   Delays to ships waiting for berths
would arise, and the time required for loading and discharging would
increase, leading to surcharges on shipping rates.
(i)  Tractors,, 'orklift-trucks, and hobile Cranes
6.21      The quantifiable benefits accruing as a result of the purchase
of new equipment are several-fold: (a) Reduced turnaround time for ships;
much valuable time is lost by ships loading and unloading without adequate
equipment to handle the cargo.    (b) Reduced repair and maintenance costs;
these savings would take place for a period of about 5 years; afterwards
none of the old equipment would be operational and if no new equipment were
acquired, additional labor would have to be hired. (c) Increased efficiency
of operations; the new equipment would result in increased output. (d) Re-
duced breakage, losses due to pilferage, etc; but because of insufficient
data no attempt has been made to quantify these savings.
6.22      Total net benefits from cargo-handling equipment, over the
expected 10-year lifetime of the equipment, are estimated at US$140,000
for Tunis-La Goulette and US$4O,000 for Sfax annually.    These benefits
give a return of 177 for Tunis-La Goulette and 20,; for Sfax.
(ii) Portal Cranes
6.23      All of the seven portal cranes at La Goulette are in relatively
good condition although only three are operational (see para 5.02(c)(ii)).
Repairing and modernizing the cranes is more economical than replacing
them with new ones, so the latter alternative has not been considered in
the economic justification.
6.24      It is estimated that on the average) the use of portal cranes
would reduce ship turnaround time by speeding up loading/unloading
operations by 10)',  compared oith th-e use  o' s-i-ols -:ear,  where
available.   Some 52 ship-days could be saved annually.    At an average
ship operating cost of about US$1,000 per day, benefits would amount to
some US$52,000 annually.
6.25      The portal cranes would increase operating efficiency with more
cargo being handled at the same total labor cost.    Assuming that some five
percent would be saved on the average cost of handling a ton of general
cargo, annual savings would amount to some US$20,000.
6.26      Other benefits which have not been quantified include the
speedier handling of cargo from the quay to the transit sheds, thus
relieving possible congestion.   This is not too significant now, but
it will increase in importance with increasing traffic.    i4oreover,
some 25 <  of 7editerranean   slips  wh,iich  call  at Tunis-La Goulette
do not have their own gear and the cranes would facilitate the operations
of these vessels.



- 19 -
6.27      The above quantifiable benefits yield a return of 17% over a
period of 15 years.
D. Breakwater at Bizerte
6.28      The existing island breakwater has suffered considerable storm
damage and unless prompt reconstruction is undertaken, further deteriora-
tion will occur and the breakwater will fail to provide adequate pro-
tection. Without this protection, operations at the oil berth would be
subject to delays and interruptions during rough weather. The principal
benefit is measured by the value of ship time which would be lost if the
breakwater were not reconstructed.
6.29      In 1972 Bizerte will import about 1.3 million tons of crude
petroleum. About 90% is assumed to come from La Skhirra (para. 6.12)
with 10% from more distant sources in the eastern M4editerranean. Assum-
ing that 75% of oil from La Skhirra is carried by 20,000 ton vessels and
that all the remaining imports are carried by 50,000 ton tankers, about
42 vessels and 8 tankers would be required per year. It is also estimated
that about 190 coastal vessels of 5,000 ton capacity aie required annually
to slhip from Bizerte nearly 950,000 tons of refined petroleum products,
for distribution along the Tunisian coast. The average daily cost is
estimated at US$2,800 per tanker, US$1,600 per vessel and US$700 per
coastal vessel.
6.30      Rough weather of the kind necessitating protection by an island
breakwater occurs about 150 days a year at Bizerte. Without the break-
water, the average delay per ship would be two days for tankers and vessels,
and three days for coastal vessels. Assuming that only one-third of ship
calls occur during rough weather, the annual benefit would be over
US$190,000. It will be twelve years before an additional investment be-
comes necessary. Discounting the benefits over 12 years, the investment
would yield a return of over 12%, without taking into account the likely
growth in traffic between 1972 and 1980.
E. Bulk-Grain Berth and Storage Facility at La Goulette
6.31      It is expected that the construction of a bulk-grain handling
and storage facility and related berth will improve productivity. The
annual maintenance cost is estimated at about US$100,000 for 25 years, the
expected life of the project.
6.32      The principal benefit is the reduction of losses from pests,
disease and weather which will result from the improved storage and handling
methods. This is estimated as equivalent to three per cent of total grain
imports -- an average saving of $450,000 a year.
6.33      The saving in ship turnaround time is estimated at US$300,000
annually on the basis of 200,000 tons of cereal imports. This is based on
an estimated reduction in the time required to unload a 20,000 ton vessel,
with a daily cost of US$1,500, from the present average of 28 days to 8
days with the new facilities.



- 20 -
6.34     ALnother major benefit is the reduction in labor cost. With
present methods, it takes 28 days with 100 men per day, at US$2.40 per
man-day, to unload a 20,000 ton vessel. This will be reduced to 8 men
a day, for only 8 days, or a total of 64 man-days. This reduction,
mainly in casual labor, would result in annual savings of US$66,000.
6.35      One general cargo berth is presently devoted to the handling
and storage of cereals for 280 days a year.  This represents 805
occupancy, the practical capacity. In the light of the prevailing excess
capacity of general cargo facilities, the diversion of this berth to cereals
does not represent an economic cost. By 1973, however, the demand for
general cargo facilities is expected to reach a level that would require
the use of the berth.  Assuming an 80 % utilization  factor and   a
daily economic cost of US$800 for the berth, release to general cargo
uses would have an annual value of US$224,000 which is attributable as
an economic benefit to the present project.
6.36      Considering the above net benefits over a period of 25 years,
the proposed investment in the cereals berth and handling facilities is
justified, yielding a return of 15%a.
7. TARIFFS AND FINANCES
A. Tariffs
7.01      OPNT charges ships for wharfage, harbor dues, pilotage and
towage, and consignees for storage. Other charges cover use of the
canal between Tunis and La Goulette, hire of cranes and other equipment,
supply of fresh water and miscellaneous services. Wharfage based on
tonnage loaded and unloaded is the largest source of income at. all ports
providing about 32%o at Tuniis-La GCulette,  70"  at  Biserte, 27' at Sousse
and 50'% at Sfax.  ;t Tunis-La Goulette, the principal polt for -eneral
imports, storage accoui-its_for about 25? of total revenue.
7.02      There has been no general revision of rates since 1952. The
only rate increases have been on ships dues in 1953 and 1954 awd wharfage
in 1958; there was also a small change in the tariff structure in 1967
when OFNT took over the protection of open storage cargoes at Bizerte,
Sousse and Sfax. Under Loan 380-TUN, the Government retained consultants,
Societe d'Etudes Techniques et Economiques (SETEC), to study and make
recommendations on the tariff structure. OPNT are considering the draft
report; its proposals, if adopted, would result in an increase of about
15% in total revenues.



- 21 -
7.03      The present tariff structure is inadequate to provide a proper
system of rates for the various facilities provided by OPNT, and the
rates are not sufficiently related to the costs of providing the facilities.
SETEC's draft report does not recommend any change in the structure and
does not take costs properly into account in considering the rates. OPNT
has agreed to institute a comprehensive system of tariffs which shall be
reasonably related to the costs of providing its services and facilities,
and that it will not grant any exemptions therefrom, nor any preferential
treatment except for certain classes of users.
B. Present Finances
General
7.04      The present cash position oP OPNT is sound and generally
stronger than was forecast in the appraisal report for Loan 380-TUN.
This is due mainly to a greater total volume of traffic passing through
Tunis-La Goulette, and the other OPNT ports. Total operating costs were
only slightly higher than projected, largely because of economies
introduced by OPNT, and to the hLigh proportion of fixed operating costs.
7.05      Total net operating revenues for the years 1964-1966 amounted
to nearly D 2 million, twice the amount forecast; and the present
estimates for 1967 show a substantial improvement over the forecast
figures.  The Regie des Ports and its successor, OPNT, were thus able
to provide the local currency costs for the Loan 380-TUN project,
service the former Regie's debt, commence service of the Bank loan in
1967, and still have funds available for capital purposes.
Revenue Accounts
7.06      Financial data for the years 1964-1967 are given in Table 11,
and are summarized below with comparative forecasts from the 380-TUN
appraisal report. The accounts for the year 1967 as submitted have
been revised to incorporate the inventory revisions, adjustments to the
old Regie account, and completion of the 380-TUN project.

Existing Assets
7.09      The original valuation of the fixed assets of the former Regie
des Ports is being reviewed and brought up to date by a special Government
committee following suggestions of the consultants and Bank staff.
The net book value as of December 31, 1966, used for the purpose of this
report, represents a reasonable value at current replacement costs less
accumulated depreciation.
Outstanding Debt
7.10      A schedule of the outstanding debt taken over from the former
Regie - D 6.209 million at December 21, 1966 - is given in Appendix 1.
The outstanding loans, all due to the Government, are on easy terms,
carrying interest at 1½5S   per  annum iiith  maturity dates to  2008.
These debts add little to OPNT s annual financial burden.



- 24 -
Audit
7.11      The law creating OPNT did not require external auditors to be
appointed, but does require the budgets to be submitted to the Government
and provides for the Minister of Finance to appoint a Financial Controller.
The Controller makes his reports directly to the Miinister who is now pro-
viding the Bank with copies.
7.12      So long as the present accounting consultants are retained by
OPNT, the Bank may accept the accounts prepared under their super-
vision, together with the Controller's Reports, The Borrower has agreed
that independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, will be appointed
prior to the conclusion of the services of the accounting consultants.
Accounts Department
7.13      At present the accounts of OPNT are prepared under the super-
vision of the accounting consultants, who also provide training in
accountancy and financial management to OPNT's staff. The present project
includes their services until at least December 1969. The amount included
for such services is US$270,000, including US$250,000 equivalent in
foreign exchange. OPNT appreciates the desirability of senior management
staff being aware of the need for and the practical use of accurate
accounting information. OPNT has informed the Bank that it proposes to
send abroad for advanced training in financial management a suitably-
qualified person with a view to his becoming financial manager. It will
consult with the Bank on the program for his training. Accounting
consultants will be retained until the appointment of a suitable financial
manager in consultation with the Bank.
C. Future Finances
Revenues
7.14      Detailed financial forecasts for 1968-1973, based upon the
forecast traffic, are given in Table 11. A projected Cash Flow Statement
is given in Table 12, Pro Forma;Balance Sheets in Table 13, and a fore-
cast of Debt Service in Table 14. The Assumptions used in preparing
these forecasts are detailed in Appendix 2, and include adjustments to
the tariffs to produce 10% additional gross operating revenue from
January 1, 1970.
7.15      A summary forecast of OPNT revenues and ratios for the alternate
years 1968, 1970, and 1972 and for 1973 is given below:

at least two times, which is adequate. Operating ratios will fall from
63% in 1968 to 47% in 1973. The relatively low, and declining operating
ratios are due to the fact that OPMT does not undertake cargo-handling
operations, which would entail high dock labor costs and increase the ratio.
7.17      Net revenue surpluses, after depreciation, interest payment, and
annual payments to Government of D 20,000 in lieu of taxes, are substantial
- 20% of gross revenues in 1968, rising to nearly 40% in 1973.
7.18      Without a tariff increase, and on the basis of the present traf-
fic forecasts, the financial rate of return would average a little less
than five per cent during 1969-1971 and would be about six per cent for
1973. However, OPNT is now realizing the physical benefits of the new
facilities at La Goulette and should be able to obtain a corresponding in-
creased benefit in financial terms. As previously mentioned (para. 7.02)
consultants are considering tariff changes that will increase OPNT's
revenues, but their final recommendations will not be available until later
this year. The present forecasts indicate tariff adjustments that would



- 26 -
increase the gross revenues by 10% from 1970 and give a rate of retuirn
on average net fixed assets of 6.4% in that year rising to eight per
cent in 1973. An acceptable rate would be at least six per cent in 1971
and OPNT has agreed to adjust tariffs if necessary to achieve this rate,
and seven per cent in 1973. Agreement has also been reached that after
1973 rates above seven per cent will be agreed upon from time to time
between OPNT and the Bank.

million over the years 1967-i973 plus a balance of about D 1.0 million
brought forward from 1966. There will be ample funds available to meet
foreseeable local currency costs; and provide reserves for contingencies.
An indication of future development needs is given in paragraphs 4.11
4.17  the largest of which is a further expansion of La Goulette, and
funds would also be available for this purpose.
Balance Sheets
7.21        A summary of the forecast pro-forma balance sheets (Table 13)

7.22      The amended valuation of the fixed assets has been taken into
the Balance Sheet at the figure net of depreciation as of December 31, 1966.
The depreciation reserves therefore commence with the total charge from
1967 onward, apart from a small figure for depreciation on new acquisitions.
Depreciation on assets taken over has been calculated on the gross replace-
ment value.

Future Debt
7.23      Completion of the transfer to OPNT of debt incurred under
Loan 380-TUN is taken as December 31, 1967. The resulting Debt/Equity
ratios in Table 13 of less than 50/50 are reasonable, and show a de-
clining trend after 1971. The amoumt of debt service in relation to
the debt is discussed below (7.26).
Financial Rate of Return and Tariff Covenant
7.24      The tariff covenant for Loan 380-TUN provides that tariffs
shall be maintained to produce revenues sufficient to cover all operating
costs and interest on debt and to provide cash funds for the renewal of
assets and for debt amortization, and to leave a reasonable surplus for
financing expansion of port facilities. No rate of return was specified.
It is now agreed that a rate of return of at least six per cent in 1971,
and seven per cent in 1973, increasing thereafter, be a condition of the
Loan.
7.25      Government equity is free of interest and amortization under
the law creating OPNT and all taxes are consolidated into a nominal
annual payment of D 20,000. The Debt/Equity Ratio averages about 45/55,
and of the total debt, about 50% is original debt with interest at 132 %
and long periods of amortization (7.10).  Average annual interest on
average debt is about four per cent; while total debt service is less
than seven per cent of average debt.
7.26      It is clear that in earning an acceptable financial rate of re-
turn, OPHT will generate considerable cash balances, even after meeting
all presently known commitments. However, as stated earlier, (Para. 5.12)
the Government has agreed, in cooperation with OPNT, to submit a four-
year port development program before the end of 1969 and successive pro-
grams thereafter covering the period at least to 1976. Some projects
that are likely to be included in the program are referred to in Paras.
4.12 - h.17 and it would appear that the accunulated cash balances will
be required for financing those projects. The question of disposal of
these balances has been discussed with the Government and it has been
agreed that they will remain with OPMIT until the program, including the
financing thereof, has been prepared and discussed with the Bank.
7.27      Under present law all surplus funds of OPNT have to be de-
posited with the Treasury, which is reasonable. Although it is under-
stood that nominal interest of one percent will be credited, this has not
been taken into account in the forecast. lIowever, the free availability
of these funds to OPNT is important and the Government has agreed that
these funds shall be at the disposition of OPHT and may be withdrawn at
any time.

8.  CONCLUSIONS AND T?ECO7i ENDATIONS
8.01      The Second Tunisian Port Project provides for improvements to
OPNT's harbors and harbor approaches by dredging and breakwater restora-
tion work, for procurement of a dredger, construction of a bulk cereal
installation, and improvement in the operations of the ports by provision
of cargo-handling equipment, assistance in training OPNT staff in account-
ing and financial management and accounting consulting services. The
project is technically sound and of economic benefit to the country. The
financial situation of OPNT is and will continue to be satisfactory.
8.02      During negotiations of the proposed loan the following matters
were discussed and agreed with the Government of Tunisia and OPNT:
A. Loan Conditions agreed with the Government
1) Improvement of the iron ore berth at La Goulette to give 12 m
depth of water alongside (5.02 (a) (i)).
2)  Production of a port development program in conjunction with
OPNT by Deceriiber 1969 and including the port of Gabes, and suc-
cessive programs at least until December 1976 (4.17 and 5.12).
3)  Availability of OPNT's cash funds on deposit with the Treasury
(7.27) and disposal of surplus OPNT balances (7.26).
B. Loan Conditions agreed with OPNT
1) Terms and conditions on which OPNT will make cargo-handling
equipment available to STM4 (5.02(c) (i)), and the bulk-grain
storage facility to the Office des Cereals (5.02(e)).
2) Appointment of engineering consultants and retention of account-
ing consultants acceptable to the Bank (5.03 and 7.13).
C. Other Items
At the time of commencement of operations of the port of
Gabes the Bank would have to discuss whether that port should be
included in OPNT, and on what terms and conditions.
8.03      The project is a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of US$845
million equivalent to OPNT for a period of 30 years, including a 10
years' grace period, at §6j interest per annum, with the Government
of' Tunisia as the Guarantor.

SECOND TUNISIAM PORT PROJECT
Information Regarding Debt to Government Taken over by OPNT
The total original amount of the debt was D) 8,580,000, all
of' which originally derived from French sources. Of this total D 500,000
obtained by the Government in 1947 from the Comptoire Nationaux D'Escompte
de Paris (CHEP) was fully paid off in 1967.
The balance of D 8,080,000 was made available to the Regie by
the Tunisian Government out of funds provided by the French Government
in French francs. The balance outstanding at December 31, 1962 was
D 6,861,000, Because ff the devaluation of the French franc in 1958,
which was not followed by Tunisia, the Tunisian Government had agreed
to devalue these loans and convert them at the new rate as from
September 1, 1960   However, during 1967?, the Goverrment decided to 're-
value these loans at the old rate of exchange as of December 31, 1966-
This resulted in an increase of L 924 635 in the amount of these deltse
This adds relatively little to the annual burden on OPNT, since tht
whole of this debt is on generous terms, the interest rate being lv
per annum.  Of the original D 8,080,COO, D 6,631,000 was for a period
of 50 years, D 1,088,000 for 25 years and D 361,000 for ten years.  The
balance outstanding.after re-valuation as of December 31, 1966 was
D 6.187 million,

SECOND TUNISIAN PORT PROJECT
BASES ANI ASSUNIPTIONS USED IIi TINANCIAL
PROJECTIONS
1.        Operating revenue has been estimated on the basis of new
traffic forecasts recently completed by consultants and revievwed and
modified slightly by Bank staff in the light of later information. The
possibility of the possible transfer of traffic from Sfax to Gabes has
not been taken into account.
2.        Operating revenues have been calculated on the present tariff
to 1969. For 1970 and onmard tariff adjustments are assumed to earn an
additional 10%7 gross operating revenues.
3.        Estimated rentals from leasing the grain silo and associated
equipment to the Office des Cereales, and cargo-handling equipment to
STA1, have been calculated so as to recover the original capital cost
over the expected lives of the assets plus a reasonable return on the
average net value. No provision has been made for additional revenues
that may be earned from the projected cash surpluses either from interest
on deposits or revenues from other investments.
4.        Provision has been made for maintenance dredging to start in
1971 the year after the expected completion of the project dredging, at
an estinmated cost of D 75,000 annually.
5.        It has been assumed that in each year commencing in 1968 OPMT
will spend D 200,000 on plant replacements and miscellaneous additional
fixed assets.
6.        It is assumed that the project in Loan 380-TUN was transferred
to OPNT at December 31, 1967, and that at that date OPIIT assumed a debt
to the Government of the equivalent of US$7.986 million, less US$85,ooo
repayed to the Bank by OPNTT on behalf of the Government in August 1967.
7.        Provision has been made for a Bank loan to OPNT of us$i8.5
million   equivalent at 6V    for - a period of 30 years, including
a grace period of ten years.
