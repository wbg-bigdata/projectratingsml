3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The Project objectives were to: (i) alleviate acute power shortages in the Sichuan grid; (ii) assist in the
introduction of power sub-sector reforms in Sichuan Province; (iii) support power tariff rationalization; (iv)
promote technology transfer for extra-high voltage (EHV) transmission; (v) strengthen institutional
capabilities for environmental and resettlement management; and (vi) upgrade management and operation
capabilities through staff training.

While creation of the 500 kV transmission infrastructure between the 3,300 MW (Bank-financed) Ertan
hydro Project and the Sichuan Province, was essential for meeting the province's critical power needs at
least cost, transformation of Sichuan Electric Power Corporation (SEPC) from a semi-autonomous
government agency to a modern power company was vital for efficient functioning of the greatly enlarged
power system.

The Project's objectives were consistent with the Government's reform strategy of: (i) commercialization
and corporatization of provincial power bureaus; (ii) introduction of competition and transparency of
operations; (iii) establishment of a tariff policy consistent with the competitive business framework; and
(iv) transfer of new technologies. The objectives were also consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), to: (i) facilitate transition of provincial power companies to autonomous, business-oriented
entities; (ii) alleviate power shortages with minimal environmental impact; and (iii) accelerate power sector
reforms.

This first Bank-financed project for SEPC presented both physical and institutional challenges. The
Project supported the first EHV transmission network in a terrain which called for new technologies.
Power sector reforms were multidimensional and risky, signaling, as they did, a fundamental change in the
way the regional power systems were operating. With adequate consulting services and an extensive
training program, project implementation was considered to be within the Borrower's reach.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the Project were not revised during project implementation.

3.3 Original Components:
Physical components: (i) construction of about 2,260 km of 500-kV transmission lines; (ii) construction of
five 500/220 kV transformer substations (5,250 MVA) and one 500-kV switching substation; and (iii)
reinforcement of the existing transmission network.          Environmental components: (i) establishment of
environmental management and monitoring programs; and (ii) resettlement and rehabilitation of persons
affected by transmission network expansion. Technical assistance components: (i) strengthening SEPC's
capability to implement an Action Plan comprising improvements in organization, accounting and financial
management information systems; (iii) strengthening environmental and resettlement management
capabilities of SEPC; and (iv) provision of engineering and construction management services and training.

3.4 Revised Components:
There were no changes to the Project's components during implementation.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The Project's quality at entry is rated as satisfactory.          Its objectives were well oriented towards
Government's (and Bank's) strategy to remove infrastructural bottlenecks to sustain rapid economic
growth and, in parallel, progressively reform the sector to meet the needs of a socialist market economy.
Measures to strengthen SEPC's environmental management and resettlement capabilities were essential for

ensuring rapid power system growth in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. In practice,
though, the original Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), proved inadequate during implementation.

The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) correctly identified construction delays and cost overruns as major,
though manageable, risks facing the Ertan Hydro Project and the Project's transmission system. It sought
to minimize those risks through improved procurement arrangements, enhanced project management,
substantial consulting support and ample physical and price contingencies. Still, the Project suffered
completion delays ranging from six months to two years; the slower than anticipated demand growth served
to moderate the otherwise potentially adverse economic impact. Identifying risks of lower than needed
power tariff adjustments, the Bank secured agreements with the Government on action plans for pricing
reforms.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The Project's overall outcome is rated as satisfactory. The Project financed infrastructure that was a high
priority for the economic development of Sichuan Province. Without the transmission facilities constructed
under the Project, SEPC would not be able to meet about 20 percent of provincial power demand at a time
of rapid economic growth. On the institutional side, the Project's main contribution was helping SEPC
implement the Central Government's restructuring strategy at the provincial level. In addition, SEPC
improved its technical capabilities in transmission line construction as well as environmental monitoring
and management. Furthermore, the Project went beyond original expectations to make Sichuan Province
one of the first areas with a competitive market for power generation.          In contrast, the Project's
achievements in the development of tariff policy were not nearly as far reaching. Instead of eliminating all
of the preferential tariff categories, by the closing of the Project, SEPC had achieved 80 percent of this
goal, though the average tariff was still below the estimated long-run marginal cost of supply. However,
SEPC, throughout the Project remained a financially viable company and the projections for the next seven
years show that SEPC will likely sustain this achievement.

Physical Objectives

The Project substantially achieved its physical objectives ­ alleviating potential power shortages by
constructing a 500-kV transmission network to bring power from the Ertan Hydroelectric Project to
Sichuan Province. There was a two-year delay in the completion of some subcomponents but the delay did
not result in unserved power demand, due to slower growth than originally anticipated. In 2002, the
transmitted 14.6 TWh of electricity from the Ertan plant met a significant portion of power demand from
consumers in Sichuan and Chongqing.

Institutional and Policy Objectives

The Project fully achieved its institutional and policy objectives for SEPC, albeit with some delays and
shortcomings. SEPC was successfully transformed from a government bureau (burdened with social
services and non-core businesses) to an independent, financially viable power company.

Commercialization and Corporatization of SEPC: SEPC installed improved accounting and financial
management systems by end 2001, a year behind schedule. The Provincial Government took steps towards
power pricing reform. The two-track power pricing system of applying different prices for consumers in
the same category was unified. Time-of-day tariffs were introduced for customers 50 kVA and above and
various fees/surcharges were abolished. The regional economic/financial crisis, forced the Provincial



                                                     - 3 -

Government to continue the application of preferential electricity tariffs to selected customers
(energy-intensive industries, high-growth customers, newly-established enterprises with foreign direct
investments, and municipal and residential lighting). It considered this a temporary emergency measure
and not a policy reversal, and responding to Bank's concern that this action could undermine SEPC's
financial viability, it substantially reduced (at the time of ICR completion) application of preferential tariffs
to only about 20 percent of the customer base. Public sector management is, therefore, rated as modest.

In line with the Central Government's reform strategy, SEPC divested itself of: (i) government functions,
transferring those to the Sichuan Economic Commission (SEC) in June 2000; (ii) social services units,
which are now operating independently, though still under SEPC ownership; and (iii) non-core businesses,
which is in progress and expected to be completed by the end of 2004. Power plants jointly owned by
SEPC and other investors became limited liability companies in 1999, while those fully owned by SEPC
did the preparatory work for restructuring, separating their accounts, and establishing autonomous
management. Following approval by the State Council, in April 2002, of a National Plan calling for
separation of generation, transmission and distribution companies and the introduction of competition in
generation, SEPC started to develop the skills and capacity to implement a competitive power generation
market. By the end of 2004, SEPC's generation units are expected to be fully separated, transforming
        1


SEPC into a limited liability transmission/distribution company. Baring a few shortcomings, but with
some additional market-oriented steps, the implementation of the Action Plan envisioned at appraisal is
considered to be very satisfactory, and accomplishment of the sector policy and institutional development
objective is thus rated as substantial.

Financial Performance: Except for two years, SEPC complied with both financial covenants (Debt Service
Coverage Ratio (DSCR), of at least 1.5 after 1998, and Self Financing Ratio (SFR), of at least 30 percent
after 2000) (see Annex 1 for details). The Company's profitability declined during 1997 to 2002, due to:
(i) the slowdown of sales forcing the Provincial Government to implement a preferential tariff that provided
discounts to stimulate electricity demand; and (ii) substantial investments in expanding rural and urban grid
networks to fulfill the Government's social-benefit mandate - both factors beyond the control of the
Company. Still, the Company's financial projections for 2003 to 2010 indicate an annual average SFR of
about 40 percent, and a DSCR of 1.2 to 1.4 and SEPC would be able to meet its capital and operation
costs, depreciation and debt service requirements. With declining investment, the abolition of the remaining
preferential tariffs, and increases in the average tariff, performance would improve. SEPC's forecasts for
the period of 2003 to 2010 show an increasing return on equity along with manageable financial leverage.
During the course of further sector restructuring, resulting in unbundling of the Company, SEPC would
need to assure appropriate transmission prices and debt service capacity. Taking into account past and
expected performance, the achievement of financial objectives is rated as modest.

Transfer of Contemporary Technologies for Extra-High Voltage Power Transmission. SEPC admirably
acquired the expertise to build and operate high-voltage power transmission lines and substations in
difficult terrain. In recognition of this achievement, the State Power Corporation of China named the
Changshou substation, constructed under the Project, as the best 500-kV substation in the southwest
region.

Enhanced Capability for Environmental Management and Resettlement Planning: Intensive training for
SEPC management and officials, successfully established the institutional capabilities for environmental
management and resettlement planning and this contributed to enhanced environmental awareness of SEPC
operating units. SEPC and the China Electric Power Construction Engineering Consultant Corporation
Southwest Company (SWED) improved their skills through training and hands-on planning and



                                                        - 4 -

implementation of resettlement activity. The acquisition of this capability and its continued strengthening
should contribute to improved environmental performance in future projects (see Annex 8 and 9 for
details).

Upgrading of Overall Management and Operational Capabilities: Through undertaking major training
programs in various fields SEPC has developed adequate capacity in (i) EHV transmission systems; (ii)
safeguard policies; and (iii) corporate and institutional reforms, including, corporate planning, utility
management, financial planning, power pricing, and competitive power market development.

Note 1: This was not envisaged at appraisal, but was in line with the Government's sector strategy in 1999. The
plan has been developed following a comprehensive study commissioned by SEPC. ("Design and Planning of the
Development of Sichuan Electricity Market on the Grid Side" by Mercados Energeticos S.A.)

4.2 Outputs by components:
Transmission Network Expansion (US$726 million in SAR, US$770.4 million actual). This component
was completed in a technically and environmentally sound manner and on schedule. Implementation of the
EHV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) contract was substantially delayed, but SEPC skillfully managed to
find alternative solutions, by-passing the GIS through the first Ertan-Zigong line using 500-kV outdoor
type GCB.

Resettlement and Rehabilitation (US$12.2 million in SAR, US$63.6 million actual). Resettlement costs
were considerably higher than at appraisal as the latter were based on rough surveys that proved overly
optimistic. The RAP prepared according to Bank's requirement at that time, did not contain sufficient
baseline data. Supplemental resettlement plans had to be formulated and final documents reinforcing the
original RAP had to be prepared and agreed with the Bank. Interviews of populations resettled indicated
that: (i) most were satisfied with the relocation process, which was successful in restoring their previous
living conditions; and (ii) most farmers losing their land recovered their incomes and livelihoods through
land redistribution, cash compensation, and other rehabilitation measures.           Laws and regulations for
environmental protection and natural resources conservation of the affected area were satisfactory complied
with.    While SEPC did not create an effective internal monitoring system, external monitoring and
evaluation was carried out smoothly.

Technical Assistance (US$24 million in SAR, US$18 million actual). SEPC successfully implemented
813 staff-months of training, which have substantially strengthened the Company's operational capability
in various fields (para. 4.1). The consulting services for project management played a major role in
procurement of sophisticated equipment and the construction of transmission lines in difficult terrain.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The Project's economic benefits are linked with and complementary to those of the Ertan Hydroelectric
Power Project. Therefore, the calculation of the ex-post economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the
Project was accomplished by updating the ex-post EIRR for the Ertan Project (Bank ICR of June 2002), by
incorporating the actual transmission costs. On this basis the estimated EIRR of the Project, is 14% based
on tariffs that reflect the consumers' willingness to pay, including value-added tax (VAT) and
quantification of environmental benefits of developing a hydroelectric plant instead of coal and gas-fired
thermal plants (see Annex 3 for details). The environmental cost of air pollutions on human health and
welfare as well as on global climate change attributed to alternative thermal power plants are considered as
the environmental benefits. The ICR also estimated a separate EIRR for the transmission network only.
With benefit based on the margin between selling prices and power purchase prices of the prospective
Transmission Company and capital costs for only the transmission network. This EIRR is 13% (see



                                                      - 5 -

Annex 3 for details). This EIRR is conservative, since consumer surplus benefits have been ignored as
also the environmental benefits of developing a hydroelectric plant instead of coal and gas-fired thermal
plants.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable to this Project and not estimated at appraisal.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Considering that SEPC, at appraisal, was a government agency with financial performance poor compared
to other power companies in China, the overall institutional development impact on SEPC is rated as
substantial. As a result of actions taken, SEPC has become one of the provincial forerunners in the
development of a competitive power market. Also it has established a solid capability in designing and
operating an EHV transmission network.            Its capabilities in the design and implementation of
environmental and social policies have improved significantly. Despite some shortcomings in tariff policy
and modest achievement of financial objectives, SEPC has developed into a financially viable corporate
entity with financial projections indicating that the Company is likely to sustain this development in the
future.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were three major external factors that adversely affected project implementation ­ natural disasters,
changes in administrative status of Chongqing, and a regional financial crisis. Several serious accidents in
1998 and 2001 resulting from frequent heavy ice, strong winds, flood and terrain slides, resulted in project
implementation delays. The change in the administrative status of Chongqing to a municipality in March
1997 and the creation of the Chongqing Electric Power Company adversely affected project management
and supply and demand forecasts. The administrative change delayed the construction of the transmission
network located within the jurisdiction of the Chongqing Municipality, as the Local Government did not
cooperate actively in terms of land acquisition and resettlement activities. In order to minimize adverse
effects, the responsibility for the 500-kV component of the whole Project remained with SEPC during the
Project's implementation period. In terms of electricity demand, Chongqing constructed several of its own
power plants to meet its power demand.          Consequently the municipality reduced its planned power
purchase from Ertan from about 2,000 MW, to only about 1,000 MW. Finally, the 1997 economic and
financial crisis that struck the region led to a reduction in power demand in Sichuan Province. The
consequent decline of loss-making, state-owned enterprises weakened power demand further and affected
the Project adversely.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The levels and timeliness of power tariff adjustments fell short of the appraisal estimates, resulting in
partial noncompliance with financial covenants. The Project also experienced procurement delays due to
the lack of Government delegation of sufficient approval authority to SEPC. In 1997, the Bank rated the
progress towards meeting the development objectives, due to the Central Government interference in
procurement, "highly unsatisfactory." Another factor that adversely affected project implementation was
the delay in securing counterpart funds. The Sichuan Investment Company which was supposed to finance
part of the local costs pulled out of the Project because it required higher profitability criteria on its
investments. Loan effectiveness was delayed substantially due to: (i) delay of the Central Government in
securing alternative counterpart funds; and (ii) delay in the central authorities and the Provincial
Government reaching a timely agreement with the Ministry of Finance on a counter guarantee.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:



                                                     - 6 -

An overall two-year delay in project implementation partly resulted from: (i) contracting and
commissioning problems with GIS bidding procedures; and (ii) shortcomings in project management by the
implementing agency, including inadequate coordination among the relevant government departments and
agencies, and application of procurement procedures. Inadequate staffing of accounting and financial
management units led to slow progress in institutionalizing the capability of the new accounting and
financial management system. Finally, the Company's limited capabilities in data gathering and reporting
precluded creation of an effective internal monitoring system of resettlement activities.

5.4 Costs and financing:
SEPC's total financing requirements, including interest during construction (IDC) of US$113 million,
amounted to US$965 million, close to the appraisal estimate of US$1,079 million (including IDC of
US$204 million) (see Annex2 for details). The actual composition of the foreign and local costs differed
dramatically from the appraisal estimate. Higher than expected local costs of construction of 220 kV
largely offset the cost savings in foreign costs, while (in US dollar terms) the lower than expected inflation
offset the higher than expected exchange rate. Of the Bank loan (US$270 million), about US$163 million
was disbursed and a substantial amount (US$95 million) was canceled (US$65 million and US$30 million
in July and November, 2001, respectively). About 98% of the Loan closed on December 31, 2002 as
originally scheduled. At Government's request, a partial extension of the Loan to December 31, 2003 was
approved by the Bank for the installation of the Energy Management System (EMS) costing US$3.6
million. The relative shares of State Development Bank (SDB), Sichuan Investment Company (SIC), and
SEPC as local financing sources were planned to be 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. However, SDB
funded 91% of the local costs and SEPC 8%. With hindsight, a firm commitment should have been
secured at appraisal from SIC, which is owned by the Provincial Government.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The Project's sustainability is rated as likely. The Project has been constructed in a technically sound
manner with due attention to environmental and social issues. There is little doubt that SEPC would
operate and maintain it successfully. A satisfactory EIRR abodes economic sustainability. The strong
commitment of the Central Government as also that of the Company to power sector reform in Sichuan
Province reduce the risks of a reversal of what has been already achieved in this area, although deepening
of reforms in the future could be a slow process. Given the forecast robust electricity demand and healthy
financial projections, SEPC is likely to continue generating positive net income over the coming years; yet
the need to further improve the level and structure of tariffs cannot be over-emphasized (power tariffs,
which currently amount to 37fen per kWh, will gradually increase to about 40fen per kWh or the estimated
long-run marginal cost of electricity supply and would increase SEPC's DSCR to 1.4 by 2010). A network
pricing policy, which is currently under discussion with the Government, is expected to take into account
SEPC's increasing debt service burden due to having undertaken heavy investments in transmission and
rural grid network expansion in the past; the decisions taken need to be watched.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
SEPC has started to prepare for operation in a competitive market and testing bidding procedures and
market software. In line with the country's restructuring policy, generation assets of SEPC are being
separated and transmission and distribution assets will be incorporated into a grid company. SEPC is
establishing a detailed plan for these structural changes. The transition to regular operations will require
continued Bank involvement in Sichuan power sector reforms. The Bank expects to do so through its
dialogue with the Government on the national reform plan approved by the State Council to separate
generation and network businesses at all administrative levels and establish two national grid companies
with regional and provincial subsidiaries. SEPC has agreed to keep the Bank informed about further

developments in reorganization and sector reforms. The separation of Chongqing from the Sichuan
Province resulted in transferring the ownership of a part of the transmission network to Chongqing Electric
Power Company (CEPC). CEPC took over assets and would pay to SEPC the related part of the principal
and interest of the IBRD loan.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Project was well conceived to ensure the sustainability of Bank-supported investments in the Ertan
Hydroelectric Project. Clearly recognizing shortfalls in SEPC's institutional capability to conduct adequate
environmental and social measures and implement reforms, the Bank provided adequate environmental and
social safeguards and incorporated measures to foster development of an efficient and financially sound
power enterprise. The technical assistance under the Project was substantial. During Project preparation,
the Bank fielded well-staffed multi-disciplinary missions to China which worked with the Borrower to
develop an action plan to remedy all potential deficiencies. The Bank tried to help the Borrower diversify
financing sources but with limited success in obtaining them for meeting foreign costs. Environmental and
resettlement action plans were consistent with the Bank's safeguard policies at that time, but which proved
inadequate during implementation. The Project included a long list of performance indicators but failed to
define particular indicators that should be reviewed during supervision, especially with regard to
institutional reform. Moreover, while the Project's legal agreements clearly set forth the obligation to
implement the Action Plan for the Government and SEPC, its implementation was not well defined.
Overall, The Bank's performance at appraisal is rated as satisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bank maintained a substantial (though not adequately proactive) level of dialogue with SEPC and the
Government on pricing and sector reform. The Bank fielded adequately staffed supervision missions,
especially in the Project's early stages. The Bank missions identified implementation problems and gave
appropriate remedial advice. A technical operations manual was developed by the cooperative effort
between the Bank and the Borrower. The Bank called attention to shortcomings in tariff policies; however,
it could have been more proactive in assisting the Borrower in implementing the Project's pricing policies
and achieving the relevant financial indicators, addressing the impacts of company and sector restructuring
and economic downturn. Overall, the Bank's performance in supervision is rated as satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's overall performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal and supervision of the Project
is rated as satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory.          There was close cooperation at the time of
preparation between the Government and the Bank. The Government committed the time bound reform
action plan of the power sector including institutional reform of SEPC and tariff rationalization. The
Central and Provincial Governments were very supportive of the Project.           SEPC and the Borrower
diligently conducted feasibility studies necessary to design and manage the Project with minimal adverse
environmental and social impacts.        SEPC also successfully conducted environmental and social
assessments in a timely manner. The Government of China showed its commitment by signing the sector
reform action plan/program. Project risks associated with delays in implementation of the Ertan Hydro and
Sichuan Power Transmission Projects were adequately addressed.




                                                    - 8 -

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Overall Government performance is rated as just satisfactory.             The performance of the Central
Government was satisfactory. It took the initiative on power sector reforms and simplification of the tariff
structure. However, the Provincial Government failed to take active measures to adjust tariff levels, which
could have improved the financial status of SEPC. But this action was significantly influenced by the
economic/financial crisis, and while the Government forced tariff discounts for certain key consumers, it
later limited this application to only 20% of the customer base. Government's actions were not of a
magnitude that impaired SEPC's ability to maintain a positive income; of course tariff increases could have
helped the Company better meet its debt service coverage targets.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Overall, SEPC's performance is assessed as satisfactory. While there were substantial delays in the
procurement of GIS component and implementation of the Project, SEPC made commendable efforts in
implementing temporary measures that substantially reduced negative impacts on the Ertan Hydro Project.
In response to adverse developments during construction, SEPC took adequate actions to address several
unforeseen problems: administrative separation of Chongqing from Sichuan Province, seasonal flooding,
and lower than expected electricity demand. The two-year delay in project completion could have been
substantially shortened, but there was no compulsion to force the pace of construction in view of the slower
than expected increase in system demand. SEPC implemented institutional reforms, such as the transfer of
most of the governmental function from SEPC to SEC and separation of operations of service and
social-benefit operations from its core business.      While SEPC failed to provide timely resettlement
monitoring and evaluation reports, it successfully implemented the external resettlement monitoring
program and institutionalized environmental and social policy and procurement management. The agency's
accounting and financial management capacity improved appreciably; a comprehensive system has yet to
be developed and further improvement of accounting and financial management capability is necessary.
SEPC partially complied with financial covenants, but this was due to several factors outside its control.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory. Although tariffs remain lower than economic
levels, this situation is expected to improve; the Provincial Government has already abolished most
preferential tariffs.

8. Lessons Learned

Project Design

·        Major sector reforms require a flexible approach with performance indicators emphasizing
satisfactory progress in an agreed overall direction rather than acting as detailed benchmarks that may turn
out to be unrealistic.
·        To minimize project implementation delays, especially for critical components, it is important to
secure financial arrangements before Board presentation; it would be prudent to obtain written
commitments from local financiers.
·        t is important to develop a detailed plan for compensation at the time of appraisal, with evaluation
of unforeseen risks and provision for suitable cost escalation. In the case of transmission projects, the
resettlement analysis needs to be closely aligned with facilities design, particularly with emphasis on
selecting a route that minimizes social impact.

·        While the Project has demonstrated that it is possible to construct high-voltage transmission
networks in mountainous areas at reasonable cost, procurement design should carefully evaluate the
capacity and capability of local contractors as well as the interface of specifications with foreign suppliers.

·        In evaluating the progress in projects requiring substantive restructuring, the Bank should
periodically review the key indicators to determine if they remain valid or need fine-tuning. When projects
experience major external shocks the development indicators may not provide fair assessments of progress.
The Bank should then try to view the situation from the perspective of the Borrower and re-evaluate or
modify the indicators or help the Borrower create a strategy to handle the external shocks in a manner
consistent with the general direction of the project's goals.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Most of the Borrower's comments (Annex 10 and 11) are incorporated in the ICR. It is noted that the
implementing agency expressed reservations about the unsatisfactory rating on the Provincial
Government's performance assigned in the draft ICR sent to it. Its comments are:

"We think the performance evaluation is generally complete and objective, however, the unsatisfactory
evaluation of Provincial Government's performance is in our opinion inaccurate and incomplete. It does
not adequately and rightly reflects the important role-played and great contributions made by the Sichuan
Provincial Government during the whole process of the Project.           We hope the above comments are
satisfactory to you and your colleagues, and hope it is acceptable to you if we suggest the Bank revise the
previous performance evaluation of the Provincial Government from unsatisfactory as satisfactory.

The rating has been reconsidered and changed to "satisfactory."

Rate of Return = net income / avg. rate base
Self Financing Ratio (%) = (net income after tax + depreciation - repayment + business expantion fund) / 3 year average of capital expenditure
Operating Ratio (%) = operating expense / operating revenue
Debt/Total Capital (%) = LT liability / (LT liability+Equity)
Debt Service Coverage (times) = (net income after tax + interest + depreciation + business expantion fund) / debt service
Note: The formula to calculate business expantion funds was revised in 2001 and this table is based on the new formula.

Key Assumptions of Projection

·               An annual electricity sales increase of average 11% is assumed in the Sichuan Province after 2004, while
sales to Chongqing and East China are assumed to be almost constant at the level of 2003.
·               All power plants except one hydro plant are separated from SEPC's assets after 2003 and power purchase
prices from power plants SEPC fully owned previously are assumed at a cost recovery level of 2001 based on SDPC
(former NDRC)'s notice in 2002.
·               The projection is based on the scenario that SEPC continues to operate transmission and distribution
businesses up to 2010.

Additional Annex 8. Implementation of Environment Management Plan

  Introduction

  The Sichuan Transmission Line Project was designed to construct 500 kV power transmission network
  to connect the Ertan Hydroelectric Project to the Sichuan power grid. A list of the transmission line
  segments and substations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The locations of the various project
  components are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.

  Environmental Development Objectives

  In additional to the objectives of providing additional electrical transmission capacity and ensuring
  service reliability, the Project also included at least two environmental development objectives, as
  follows:

  a. Developing Environmental Capacity - the Project has clearly contributed to development of
  environmental capacity within three clearly defined groups. The first of these was SEPC, which
  established and staffed its own internal Environmental Protection Office. The SEPC Environmental
  Protection Office received environmental training, including overseas training in Canada, where
  environmental assessment, design, and management skills were obtained. Throughout the Project, the
  SEPC Environmental Protection Office was responsible for managing the Project Environmental
  Management Office (PEMO), which included the environmental monitoring and supervision group
  from SRIEP, and the various construction contractors, each of which was required to designate an
  environmental contact within its own organization.

  Now, as the Project moves into operation, the SEPC operating units, under the direction of the SEPC
  Environmental Protection Office, are increasing their level of environmental awareness. The second
  group whose environmental capacity has increased directly as a result of the Project is the monitoring
  and supervision consultants, especially SRIEP, which prepared the EIA and carried out the
  environmental monitoring and supervision on behalf of SEPC. The third group that has increased its
  environmental capacity as a result of the Project includes the construction contractors. Through
  participating as a member of the Project environmental management team, and the group which was
  required to implement environmentally sound construction measures under the direction of the
  supervision team, the construction contractors leave the Project with a greater appreciation for
  environmental aspects of project design and construction.

  b. Promoting Environmentally Sound Design and Construction ­ through the process of
  environmental capacity building, environmental training, supervision, and management, SEPC, its
  environmental consultants, and construction contractors have succeeded in constructing a project using
  environmentally sound design and construction practices.

  For the first time in China, helicopter reconnaissance was used as a means of identifying the optimal
  transmission line routing, including alignments that would avoid sensitive ecosystems. Areas identified
  as environmentally unique or sensitive, including those containing remaining natural forests, were
  avoided by routing transmission lines around, rather than through them.             Towers incorporated
  staggered leg designs, which facilitated minimal disturbance to soils, particularly on steep slopes where
  the alternative would have been to cut benches and expose soils to forces of erosion.




                                                 - 23 -

Where system reliability wasn't threatened by potential ice storms, SEPC adopted twin circuit designs
into the 500 kV transmission lines. Although this had been done for 220 kV transmission line projects
in the recent past, the Sichuan Transmission Line Project was the first one in China to incorporate dual
circuit systems into a single set of towers. This was done in part to minimize the extent of right-of-way
clearing that would have to be carried out.

Construction contractors adopted other environmentally sound construction practices, including: use of
foot paths and human porters to carry materials into tower sites, thereby reducing the need to cut new
access roads; use of temporary access roads where roads were required; stringing conductors under
tension to minimize damage to vegetation (as well as to conductors, themselves).

Other Significant Outcomes and Impacts

In general, the impacts that were predicted in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report dated
September 1993, which was prepared by the Southwest Electric Power Design Unit, have been those
that have accrued during project construction and operation.          Likewise, the mitigation measures
identified have largely been successful in avoiding or minimizing adverse environmental affects.

However, at least three impacts were not foreseen during the planning stage of the Project. These
include:

a. Conflict with Military Firing Range ­ during the design phase of the Project, the detailed routing
survey failed to identify a military firing range at which the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army (PLA)
tests ground-to-air missiles that are fired at airborne drones. The potential conflict between the
preferred alignment and the military range was not exposed until construction had commenced on the
Project. Notwithstanding that the civil government had given approval for the Project, the PLA was
not prepared to relocate the firing range. Therefore, SEPC had to find alternative routing. Two
alternatives were considered, one of which would have required removal of 6,300 mu (420 ha) of trees
to create the new section of right-of-way, and required a detour of 2 km. A second alternative, which
was shorter (i.e., required only an additional 800 m of line), and required no removal of forest, was
eventually chosen as the best alternative.

b. Noise Exceedences at Switchyards/Substations ­ through post-construction (i.e., operation phase)
environmental monitoring it has been determined by SRIEP that noise levels at the property boundary
exceed the Chinese standards for three locations (Zhaojue Switchyard, Hanggou and Longwang
substations). At Zhaojue, the standard for nighttime noise is exceeded at only one sampling point, and
by only 0.8 dBA. This level falls within the acceptable margin of error for noise sampling equipment,
so is not considered significant. However, at Hanggou and Longwang substations, the noise levels at
the boundary of these two sites exceed the nighttime standards at numerous sampling locations (almost
3 dBA at Longwang; more than 14 dBA at Hanggou). Notwithstanding these exceedences, there are no
residential dwellings within 100 m at any of the switchyards or substations. At 100 m from the
boundaries, the noise levels are well within acceptable limits. Therefore, to ensure there will be no
future complaints from residents that might construct houses within 100 m from the boundary of these
substations, SEPC has applied for a restriction on any future housing construction in this zone. Since
these lands are presently used for cultivation, it is unlikely that planning permission would have been
granted to build houses here anyway.

c. Exceedence of Wastewater Effluent Discharge Standard from One Substation ­
post-construction monitoring of substation wastewater effluent discharges has determined that at one


                                                - 24 -

substation (Longwang), the effluent discharged from the substation's domestic septic treatment system
exceeds the Chinese standard, but only for one parameter, phosphorous. SRIEP determined that this
was due to two factors: i) the staff are washing their laundry using phosphate-based detergents; and ii)
the septic tank has not been cleaned out for some time and, therefore, are unable to process the
domestic wastewater to the extent that a tank with more volume for biological processing would
provide. SRIEP recommended that the septic tank be pumped out to improve its performance. If
retesting of the effluent stream following septic tank cleanout indicates that phosphorous exceedences
are still a problem, then the staff at Longwang substation should be encouraged to use a non-phosphate
detergent.

The results of the post-construction (i.e., operation phase) monitoring of substations carried out by
SRIEP demonstrates the benefits of this activity in identifying potential residual impacts that were not
anticipated during Project design.

Project Sustainability

The Project is deemed to be environmentally sustainable on at least two levels. First, the environmental
management capacity developed within SEPC, SRIEP, and the construction contractors is expected to
continue beyond the conclusion of the Project.         This will be aided by the continuing pace of
improvement in the standard of living within the civil society of China. As people become better off
financially, they will expect more and better environmental management of projects. Notwithstanding
that the Project is now wrapping up, the Environmental Protection Office has become a permanent
fixture within SEPC. Already, SEPC is applying the environmental experience gained on the Sichuan
Transmission Line Project to new 500 kV substations that are being constructed without World Bank
financing, proving that the process of ongoing and sustainable environmental management of power
sector projects is not dependent on Bank financing. Construction contractors, who had little experience
with environmentally sound construction practices at the start of the Project, leave the Project with new
skills that will be applied to future projects.

Secondly, the environmental mitigation works will carry on beyond the Project. As part of its routine
maintenance activities, SEPC operating units carry out monthly inspections of each transmission line
tower constructed as part of the Project. Although the inspection is primarily focused on ensuring the
structural integrity of the towers and transmission line conductors, they are also used to determine the
status of environmental mitigation works, such as drainage and slope stability measures.
Post-construction monitoring of substations is also being carried out by SRIEP, on behalf of SEPC.

Lessons Learned from Implementing the Project

With respect to environmental issues, the following experiences and lessons were learned from this
Project:

a. Creation of the environmental unit within SEPC has facilitated environmental planning and
environmentally sound construction

b. Environmental awareness has been significantly raised within the SEPC organization, its
consultants, and the construction contractors, all of whom now recognize the need to develop a good
project EIA and implement it by way of an EMP.

c. The Project designers, contractors and SEPC staff need to work together from the outset of the


                                                - 25 -

Project to design environmental protection measures, incorporate these into design documents, and
implement them effectively.

d. Training through foreign visits to examine successful environmental measures or application of
technologies has been very worthwhile. For example, a training visit to Canada to see how helicopters
are used in selecting transmission line routes was the catalyst to applying this technology in China.
The Project was the first of its kind in China to use helicopter reconnaissance to select optimal routing
alternatives, which avoid environmentally sensitive areas.

e. Carrying out environmental supervision of large infrastructure projects early in the construction
phase ensures that the proper tone is set for environmental supervision and management, especially if
this is combined with training sessions involving the implementing agency, monitoring and supervision
staff, and construction contractors.

f.  Post-construction monitoring of switchyards/substations has been effective in identifying
unforeseen impacts, for which effective mitigation measures have then been applied.

Additional Annex 9. Implementation of Resettlement Action Plan

Original Plan

The Sichuan Power Transmission Project was designed to construct 500kV power transmission network for
Ertan Hydroelectric Project, with the IBRD loan of US$ 275 million. The Project consists of six 500kV
substations and seven sections of 500kV transmission lines.                 All of the components involved land
acquisition and resettlement (Table 1). During the Project appraisal, Sichuan Electric Power Company
(SEPC) prepared a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) based on a survey conducted during a project
feasibility study, which was reviewed and approved by the Bank. During project implementation, to ensure
successful resettlement and rehabilitation, supplement resettlement implementation plans were prepared for
Chenjiaqiao, Changshou, and Panzhihua Substations in 1997, 1998, and 2000, respectively. According to
the RAP and supplement resettlement implementation plans, the Project required the acquisition of 2,310
mu land areas, relocation of 2,082 households, and demolition of 292,790 square meters of houses. The
total resettlement costs were estimated at RMB140.4 million.

Resettlement Scope

The land acquisition and resettlement affected 57 counties, 264 townships, and 1,525 villages in Sichuan
Province and Chongqing Municipality. By the end of 2002, the land acquisition and resettlement, as well
as construction had already been completed for all the substations and transmission lines components. A
total of 1,802 mu of land areas were acquired for the Project with 719 mu for substations and 1083 mu for
transmission lines. Along with land acquisition, a total of 727,486 square meters of houses were removed,
and 3,582 households were relocated. Compared with the RAP and supplement resettlement
implementation plans, the amount of land acquired for transmission lines during the implementation of the
Project was reduced, while the number of relocated households and the number of demolished houses
increased significantly. (Table 2).

Most of such changes were due to the fact that early estimates in the RAP were based on the initial survey
during the feasibility study, while actual implementation was based on a detailed survey of all affected
households. According to the final design documents, total demolished houses amounted to 620,500 square
meters, and relocated households amounted to 3,062 households. These figures well exceed the original
estimates by 110percent and 50percent, respectively.        The adoption of different measuring criteria and
new construction after the survey accounted for a further increase.

Quality of the RAP

Although the supplement resettlement implementation plans for three substations (Chenjiaqiao, Changshou,
and Panzhihua) were carefully prepared according to the Bank requirements, the original RAP prepared in
the early 1990s did not articulate entitlements and resettlement policies for affected people and villages. As
a result, it was difficult to assess the delivery of entitlements for those affected people and villages that
completed land acquisition and resettlement in early years. A significant improvement in quality of the
RAP during the 1990s indicates the development of the Bank's requirement on resettlement issues.




                                                     - 30 -

The Bank requested that SEPC's project office recruit an independent resettlement monitoring and
evaluation company for the Project. The China Electric Power Construction Engineering Consultant
Corporation Southwest Company (SWED) was selected to carry out independent resettlement monitoring
and evaluation, which began two years after project implementation started. From 1997 to2002, SWED
prepared five monitoring and evaluation reports which provided detailed assessments of resettlement
implementation for all components. Given the weakness of original RAP, the monitoring reports in early
stages focused more on whether livelihoods and living conditions were restored to previous levels than
whether compensation was delivered following the RAP standards. During the implementation of three
substations (1998-2001), the monitoring and evaluation efforts began to focus more on whether the delivery
of entitlements followed the resettlement implementation plans.

Compensation Policies

With regard to a resettlement policy and compensation standards, given that the Project was implemented in
over vast areas and a long period, the original RAP did not effectively specify detailed compensation rates
and rehabilitation measures. Instead, the original RAP included a range of county and city resettlement
compensation standards for reference. Although this range of compensation standards provided flexibility
for resettlement implementation, it was difficult to use it to assess levels of compensation rates delivered to
affected people and communities. The Bank identified the shortcomings of the original RAP in the early
stages of the supervision missions, and requested detailed implementation plans for the 500kV substations,
Chenjiaqiao, Changshou and Panzhihua, which were implemented after 1996. For the latter substations,
the resettlement implementation plans specified clear compensation rates and rehabilitation measures, and
provided a good basis to measure the actual implementation.

According to monitoring and evaluation reports, most of the compensation rates adopted into the Project
were adequate for providing replacement value to the affected people. For example, compensation rates for
lost houses were RMB150-180 per square meter for houses of wood earth structures, RMB220-240 per
square meter for houses with brick wood structure, and RMB280-320 per square meter for houses with
brick concrete structure.    For some substations located in some suburbs, such as Chenjiaqiao and
Panzhihua, compensation rates were even higher. These compensation rates proved adequate for the
affected people to rebuild their lost houses. Based on people's location and income, compensation and
rehabilitation for acquired farmland ranged from less than RMB8,000 per mu in Zhaoju Substation to
RMB26,000 per mu in Longwang Substation (near Chengdu).

Implementation Status

The land acquisition and resettlement for 500kV transmission lines began in 1995 and completed in 2002.
Among them, the land acquisition and resettlement for: the Ertan-Zigong Circuit 1 transmission line was
conducted between 1995-1996; the Ertan-Zigong Circuit 2 transmission line and Zigong-Chengdu lines
were completed in 1996-1998; the Ertan-Zigong Circuit 3 transmission line and Zigong-Chongqing lines
were completed in 1998-2000; and Chenjiaqiao-Changshou line and Ertan-Panzhihua line were completed
in 2000 and 2001 respectively. For 500kV substations, all of them will involve land acquisition and
resettlement. Among them, Zhaojue, Honggou, and Longwang substations carried out land acquisition and
resettlement in 1996. The remaining three substations (Chenjiaqiao, Changshou and Panzhihua) completed
land acquisition and resettlement in 1997, 1998 and 2000 respectively in accordance with supplement
resettlement implementation plans,

Institutional Arrangement




                                                     - 31 -

SPEC's Ertan 500kV Transmission Construction Administration Bureau was responsible for the
management of overall Project resettlement . The implementation of land acquisition and resettlement of 13
project components was carried out by a number of different construction companies, which worked closely
with local county and city land administration bureaus and township and village officials. Among them,
Sichuan Provincial Transmission Construction Company (SPTCC) was responsible for a large portion of
project components, including all substations and two thirds of transmission lines.          More than ten
construction companies from different provinces were responsible for implementing the rest of the
transmission line components. Each construction company had a resettlement unit with a number of
experienced staff handling various aspects of resettlement implementation, from detailed surveying to
signing compensation contracts. SEPC, SPTCC, and construction companies worked closely with local
government agencies in delivering compensation and implementing rehabilitation measures.

In spite of adequate resettlement implementation capacity at the project level, without a systematic internal
reporting system, SEPC was unable to monitor resettlement implementation for various components
effectively, particularly for the transmission line projects. In fact, lack of effective internal monitoring
capacity was mentioned a number of times by the Bank supervision missions. As a result, it was difficult
for the Bank to systematically oversee resettlement implementation of the transmission line components
during project implementation. Such shortcomings can be attributed to the lack of commitment, shortage of
full time resettlement staff, and inadequate training and resources within the SEPC project team.

Implementation Outcomes

By the end of 2002, the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement for the Project was complete.
For the whole Project, a total of 1,802 mu of land areas were acquired, including 719 mu or 40 percent, for
six substations and 1,083 mu, or 60 percent, for seven sections of transmission lines. Along with land
acquisition, a total of 727,486 square meters of houses were removed, and 3,582 households relocated, a
significantly higher number than estimated in the RAP. The total costs of resettlement and land acquisition,
including compensation for restoring various infrastructure facilities, amounted to RMB454.9 million, 224
percent higher than projected in the RAP (RMB140.4 million). Of the total costs, RMB380.8 million, or
83.7 percent, was for transmission line components, and RMB74.0 million, or 16.3 percent, was for
substation components.

Because of limited amount of land acquisition, average 0.7 mu per each affected village, the construction of
500kV transmission lines was expected to have only limited economic impact on affected villages and
individuals. All of 3,521 relocated households, an average of 2.3 households per affected village, were
resettled a short distance away in the same villages, were provided with replaced housing plots by their
villages, and were connected with necessary services free of charge. The compensation rates for the lost
houses, averaging RMB262 per square meter for all seven transmission lines, were considered adequate to
rebuild larger and better quality houses for the affected people. According to the monitoring reports, the
completed new houses were indeed larger and better than those which were demolished. Most relocated
households were quite pleased with relocation process.

The economic rehabilitation was mainly achieved through a combination of cash compensation to affected
people and readjustment of farmland in the affected villages, although a small number of affected people in
Honggou, Changshou, and Chenjiaqiao Substations were rehabilitated through conversion to non-farm
status. For the construction of six 500kV substations, a total of 719 mu land areas were acquired, 92
percent, or 661 mu, of which was cultivated land. Due to the relatively concentrated area of land
acquisition, ranging from 61 mu to 199 mu for each substation, land acquisition had certain economic
impacts. Given that all land compensation, averaging RMB16,680 per mu, was fully distributed among


                                                     - 32 -

affected villages and individuals and most affected families still have sufficient farmland for their own
grain production, the majority of affected people have been able to restore their income and livelihood by
engaging in various farming and non-farming activities, including new activities associated with the
construction of the transmission projects. Only a small number of households, particularly those in which
the entire family converted to non-farm status in Chenjiaqiao Substation, are struggling to achieve a better
livelihood and income than before their relocation. Due to lack of skills and employment opportunities
after moving into the town center, their livelihood and income did not improve, although their living
conditions improved considerably. In this regard, the lesson learned here is that it is desirable to avoid
moving a large number of farmers completely off the farm. The better approach, like the case in Honggou
and Changshou, is to redistribute the remaining farmland and the total land compensation so that at least
each family has some farmland for its grain production and some cash for other non-farm activities.

In general, resettlement was carried out satisfactorily in accordance with the RAP and supplement
resettlement implementation plans agreed by the Bank. All compensations and entitlements were delivered
to the affected villages or individuals, as planned.

Lessons Learned

Key lessons reinforce those derived from other Chinese power projects. It is necessary to:

(a)      improve resettlement planning at project preparation stage to allow better assessment of
compensation rates, and the preparation of more accurate cost estimates.
(b)      carefully appraise proposed institutional arrangements for resettlement to ensure adequate staff,
training, and resources for internal and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation.
(c)      carefully review proposed economic rehabilitation measures and to ensure proper economic
rehabilitation options for all types of affected people, particularly those in a vulnerable group.

                                             (LOAN 3848-CHA)
                                                  (DRAFT)

PROJECT BACKGROUND


Sichuan Province is one of the richest provinces in terms of hydropower potential in China, however, the
development of hydroelectric power resources remained at a very low level in the 80's and the early years
of the 90's of the last century, the fast-growing provincial economy had long suffered a severe shortage of
electricity supply.   In 1993, The Bank-financed Ertan Hydroelectric Power Project with a designed
generating capacity of 6x550MW Ertan started. Sichuan Power Transmission Project was designed to
evacuate the electricity to be generated by the hydroelectric power project to Chengdu and Chongqing
regions, the two major industrial cities and load centers in Sichuan. The Project would build a new 500 kV
power transmission network and upgrade the existing 220 kV transmission network in the Province.

The foreign cost of the Project was financed by a Bank Loan (Loan No.3848-CHA) of USD 273 million
equivalent, including a TCC credit of USD 3 million for project preparation. The proceeds of the Bank
loan were allocated to procurement of major 500 kV equipment, systems and materials, and designated
engineering and training services. The negotiations on the loan agreement and project agreement were
completed between the World Bank and a Chinese Government delegation representing the borrower, the
People's Republic of China, in Washington in January 1995. The loan was then on lent as agreed through
the Sichuan Provincial Government to Sichuan Electric Power Corporation, the owner and implementing
entity of the Project.

The Project was designed with the following objectives: a) alleviate the acute shortage of electricity by the
construction of a 500 kV transmission network for connecting the then undergoing Ertan hydroelectric
project to the Sichuan power grid, b) reinforce the existing 220 kV power transmission network, c) assist in
designing and implementing a time-bound program to implement power sub-sector reforms in Sichuan
Province, d) support the implementation of further power tariff rationalization, e) promote transfer of
contemporary technologies for EHV transmission technologies, f) strengthen institutional capabilities for
environmental management and resettlement planning,            and g) upgrade management and operation
capabilities through well-focused staff training programs.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The physical implementation of the Project took almost eight years to complete from the start of the first
component, Ertan-Zigong line 1, in October, 1995 till commission of the last project component, the 500
kV Panzhihua substation and associated transmission line in August, 2002. At the same time, the agreed
programs on reforms, environmental management, resettlement, training and consulting services have also
achieved its set objectives.

Construction      Regardless a half year's delay in the start of the Project and a prolonged delay of 14
months in the procurement of GIS equipment, the major components of the Project had been, on the whole,
implemented and commissioned on schedule as adjusted or revised, meeting the target date of starting to
evacuate Ertan power in August, 1998, when the first generating unit was put on line, thanks to a series of
strong measures taken and great efforts made by SEPC.



                                                    - 34 -

Chongqing's separation from Sichuan and the ensuing creation of a new Chongqing electric power
company in 1997 presented a potential legal issue, which might adversely affect the progress of the Project.
At the Bank team's suggestion, it was decided that SEPC remained the owner and implementing entity of
the entire Project till the final completion of the Project, including those components, which would be
constructed in Chongqing, and would be ultimately be operated and owned by Chongqing electric power
company The right decision contributed to the subsequent smooth progress and timely completion of the
Project.

Procurement. Bank financed procurement of goods and services under the Project was carried out in
accordance with the Bank procurement guidelines as agreed and required in the project and loan
agreements. Local financed procurement of goods and works was also implemented through competitive
bidding processes whenever and wherever possible and practical. As a result, the Project achieved a
considerable foreign cost saving and a well-controlled local cost spending as compared against the
budgeted project cost.

Sector and corporate institutional development         The goals set out in the Action Plan to corporatize and
commercialize SEPC have been realized. With the transfer of government functions previously delegated
to SEPC to the newly created electric power division in the Sichuan Provincial Commission on Economic
Relations and Trade, SEPC is now functioning fully as a business organization with operational autonomy.
Over the past four years, in response to a changed scenario in the provincial power industry and
much-improved supply situation, efforts have been made to introduce competition to promote efficiency.
Market forces now have a role to play in the operation of the power sector.

Tariff reform has been carried out over the past years to rationalize the tariff structure and raise step by
step the depressed tariff to a reasonable and sustainable level. In 1997, the irrational differentiated regional
consumer price for electricity was unified in Sichuan. Time-of-day and seasonal rates, reflecting better the
actual cost of supply, were introduced and gradually extended to various categories of consumers,
generators, and wholesale energy transactions. The price variance among time-of-day and seasonal rates
was also increased. The averaged consumer power price, though still lower than long-run marginal cost of
supply, was gradually raised from 26.99 fen/ kWh exclusive of taxes in 1996 to the present 29.234
fen/kWh in Sichuan.

Extensive training has been carried out during the implementation of the Project, which contributed
constructively to successful completion of the Project, subsequent healthy operation and maintenance of the
Project, and enhancement of the capabilities in operation and management of SEPC and other participants
on the Project. Consulting services provided by well-selected consultants also played a role.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE
The various components of the Project were completed according to the implementation schedule, which
was made based on the planned commission dates of Ertan units. By now, the Project has been operating
reliably for four years since 1998, when the first batch of components were energized along with the
startup of the first unit at Ertan hydroelectric power station.

The scheduled completion of Ertan units was to put on line one, two and three units in 1998, 1999 and
2000 respectively, actual progress turned out to be two units 1998, and four units in 1999, well ahead of
the preset schedule. The much-advanced schedule caused difficulties both in absorbing in Sichuan and
Chongqing the energy that could then be generated, and difficulties to the power transmission project,
which was proceeding as planned. By 2001, when the last line from Ertan to Zigong came on line, the

problem was solved. So far, a total of 42 TWh of Ertan energy has been transmitted over the Project to
Sichuan, Chongqing and East China.

The financial performance of SEPC from time to time during the duration of the Project fell short of
meeting both financial covenants agreed between the Bank and the borrower, which required SEPC to
achieve a self-financing ratio no less than 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% respectively for the year 1996,
1997, 1998 and 1999 and afterwards, and maintain a debt service coverage of 1.2 times for 1997 and
before, and 1.5 times for 1998 and later years. The major reason for noncompliance was due to lower
power tariff raise and intensive and concentrated investment in urban and rural networks starting from
August, 1998, however, with the decline in investment in the following years, and the abolition of
preferential power prices effective on August 1, 2002 and a proposed further tariff increase beginning in
December, 2002, it is projected the financial covenants will be complied with from the year 2003 and
onward.

SEPC, the beneficiary of the Project, would like to express its appreciation for the assistance and
cooperation extended to SEPC by the Bank team at the preparation stage for Bank loan and during the
entire implementation stage. Their recommendations made at the regular supervision missions and site
inspections have been a major contributor to the successful completion of the Project. Timely guidance
relating to Bank policies in procurement and loan operations was provided by the Bank team. During the
duration of the Project, the Bank team has maintained a good working relationship and good
communications with SEPC, and has shown a high sense of responsibility and high level of professional
qualifications.

FUTURE OPERATION
There existed a great concern for the evacuation and absorption of Ertan energy in the first one or two
years since it began production in 1998, when Sichuan like most provinces in China has been experiencing
a sharp unexpected slowdown in load growth, while on the other hand, a speedy increase in generating
capacity. Nevertheless, the total generation of Ertan has been evacuated and absorbed as planned since its
operation through SEPC's efforts and Government's strong support. For the last three years, Sichuan has
seen rapid growth in the demand for electricity thanks to the steady and fast development of its economy. It
is expected the power consumption will grow at 16 to 17% this year in the province. Ertan and its
associated transmission project are now playing a key role in meeting the ever-increasing demand for
electricity in Sichuan, a role that was exactly envisaged at the time of project design.

The Sichuan-Chongqing 500 kV power transmission network built under the Project now connects with the
ongoing Three Gorges power transmission project, which is the first step to interconnect the
Sichuan-Chongqing, Central China and East China power grids to form the Central China power grid. For
the first time in its history, Sichuan is now exporting its hydropower to the coastal provinces through the
interconnected power network, which has long been a dream for generations. A total of 1.42 TWh of
electric energy has been exported to East China from May till October this summer.

Sichuan is now constructing Nanchong 500 kV power transmission project to reinforce the existing 500 kV
network. Study is also going on to construct the fourth 500 kV line from Ertan to Zigong to increase the
transmission capability to meet more stringent requirement in stability raised by recently updated Chinese
stability criteria.

Additional Annex 11. Borrower's Comments

"We have duly received the draft ICR for Sichuan Power Transmission Project prepared by the Bank.
Upon reading and discussing the Report by SEPC departments and project staff concerned, we would like
to present the following comments for your consideration.

On the whole, we think the Report is a good one, in that it adequately and objectively evaluates the
preparation, construction and operation of the Project, the achievement of the project development
objectives, and outcomes of the Project. It further goes on to analyze and summarize in detail the
implementation of each component of the Project, including the scheduled versus actual progress, quality
achieved and budgeted versus actual cost, and the major factors and events affecting the implementation of
the Project components. In the latter part of the Report, it evaluates the performance of all the major
participants of the Project, the Bank, the borrower represented by the Central Government and Sichuan
Provincial Government and the implementing agency SEPC. We think the performance evaluation is
generally complete and objective, however, the unsatisfactory evaluation of Provincial Government's
performance is in our opinion inaccurate and incomplete. It does not adequately and rightly reflect the
important role played and great contributions made by the Sichuan Provincial Government during the
whole process of the Project.

Ertan hydroelectric power development project was then the largest one of its kind proposed to develop in
China, it included the Ertan hydroelectric station project and the transmission project. As pointed out in the
report, the development objectives of the Ertan project was clearly in line with the strategy of the Chinese
Government to develop environmentally sound energy resources to alleviate the then acute electricity
shortage and the Bank's country assistance policy.         The Ertan hydroelectric station project and the
associated transmission project were eventually chosen among numerous candidate projects by the Central
Government to apply for Bank financing, the bank loan applications were finally approved by the Bank
upon appraisal, thanks to the great efforts made by the Sichuan Provincial Government in selecting and
preparing the Project and its commitments to assist SEPC in carrying out associated resettlement action
plan, environmental management and monitoring program, reform action plan and power tariff
rationalization and to contribute part of the counterpart funds.

At the start of the Project, the construction of the Ertan hydroelectric station was at its peak, which
required huge amount of fund injection by the Sichuan Provincial Government (almost half of the financing
requirements of the station). Sichuan was and still is an under-developed province in the west region of
China with limited financial resources.       With the support from the Central Government, the State
Development Bank, the Provincial Government-owned Sichuan Investment Company, and SEPC discussed
and agreed that to meet the financing requirements of the Project SDB would increase its share of fund
contribution to substitute the planed share of funds committed to inject by SIC.

During the years of project implementation, the Project had been one of the key capital construction
projects of Sichuan province, which drawn special attention and support from the Provincial Government.
The Provincial Government had set up a special steering committed chaired by senior provincial leaders to
oversee and coordinate the implementation of the Project. It further required the local governments of the
cities and counties which the lines of the Project would cross set up similar organizations to take care of
issues related to land acquisition and resettlement and provision of logistic support in implementing the
Project.

With the commission of the Ertan station and the transmission project, the power generation and supply

capacity greatly increased in Sichuan, however, on the other hand, demand growth turned out to be much
lower than projected mainly due to slowdown in economy growth and industry readjustment. A temporary
oversupply struck the power sector during the first years beginning in 1998. To make things worse,
Chongqing was then not part of Sichuan and it greatly reduced its power purchase commitment from Ertan.
The absorption of Ertan energy presented a tremendous difficulty to the Sichuan Provincial Government.
In order to stimulate the over-depressed power consumption, especially new loads and increased loads to
take up the surplus through developing energy intensive industries and attracting new investments into
Sichuan, the Provincial Government adopted the preferential power tariffs. These measures increased
power demand, which basically absorbed the Ertan energy, and at the same time promoted the development
of the provincial economy. Unfortunately, the implementation of the preferential power tariffs exacerbated
the already bad financial position of SEPC. With the recovery and gradual speedup of the provincial
economy in development momentum, the power demand growth in Sichuan is now accelerating, as a result
the Sichuan Provincial Government has abolished part of the preferential treatment in power tariffs and is
considering further abolition action.     SEPC's financial position will gradually reverse the trend of
deterioration. From the perspective of the provincial economy on the whole, it is beneficial to adopt
reduced power tariffs during a certain short period to stimulate load growth to absorb the clean and low
cost hydro energy which would otherwise be wasted, although the adoption of low pricing would put a
heavy financial burden on the power utility.

It was originally projected that SEPC would start to comply with the financial covenants starting from
2003 and onward with the abolition of preferential power tariffs, however, it will take more years for SEPC
to achieve full compliance, particularly the debt coverage ratio, according to the latest projections taking
into consideration of separation of SEPC's generation business. The raise of power tariffs by the Sichuan
Provincial Government over the years of project implementation fell short of meeting the requirements of
ensuring SEPC to comply fully the agreed financial covenants, which was mainly attributed to its concern
for the entire provincial economy, in particular, the non-performing SOEs during the difficult time of
reorientation and reshuffle. We hope the Bank can accommodate on this point. We agree as suggested in
the Report that it may be more reasonable and realistic to set more flexible and adjustable financial
covenants to better reflect the actual fast-changing situation of the province and its power industry. As a
matter of fact, whereas the financial performance of SEPC fell short of meeting the financial covenants, it
did not impose noticeable adverse impact on the operation and development of SEPC and on its capability
to raise financial resources for investment loan repayment needs. We believe the power tariff will be raised
in the near future to a sustainable level in Sichuan with the development of its economy, the progress in
power industry restructuring and the subsequent establishment of a sound power market in the province.

We hope the above comments are satisfactory to you and your colleagues, and hope it is acceptable to you
if we suggest the Bank revise the previous performance evaluation of the Provincial Government from
unsatisfactory as satisfactory.

Here once again, we would like to express our hearty thanks to the Bank, especially yourself and the Bank
team under your leadership for the great help and assistance to SEPC in successfully implementing the
Project."
