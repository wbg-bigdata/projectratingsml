MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
1NTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIREC2-`ORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SICHUAN POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent of $270 million
to help finance a Sichuan Power Transmission Project. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
The proceeds of the loan would be onlent through Sichuan Province to the Sichuan Electric
Power Company (SEPC) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, with SEPC
bearing the foreign exchange risk.
2.          Background. Expansion of the supply of power and improvements in the
industry's efficiency are critical to sustaining China's rapid economic growth, mitigating
adverse environmental impacts of energy development, and improving living standards.
China is steadily improving the efficiency of energy use through reliance upon economic
prices for energy and a well-developed institutional network for energy conservation.
Energy use-GDP growth elasticities have been exceptionally low since the early 1980s, and
especially during the last few years. Consumer prices for the major forms of energy now
largely reflect economic costs.  Electricity conservation is promoted through a
comprehensive network of specialized agencies at the central, provincial and local levels,
and electricity conservation investments are made through a variety of programs
coordinated with provincial power companies and industrial consumers. Even with yet
more dramatic success in conservation, however, generation capacity must increase by at
least 17,000 MW a year in order to avoid exacerbation of the serious power shortages that
already exist. The Government has adopted the strategy of constructing large and cost-
effective power plants to meet demand and accelerate the replacement of obsolete and
heavily polluting plants with more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable units.
3.          To continue the efficiency improvements and increase capital mobilization
necessary for further development of the power industry, China is now actively pursuing
an ambitious program of power sector reforms. Particular progress has been made in
recent years in sector decentralization, improvements in cost recovery through major tariff
reforms, and diversification of financing sources, including development of a variety of
independent power generation schemes. The pace and depth of the sector reforms have
picked up during 1993 and 1994, and the Govemment's integrated agenda for action now
includes (a) commercialization and corporatization of power companies, including
achievement of greater enterprise autonomy, (b) further measures to rationalize power
tariffs, (c) realignment of the regulatory and legal framework, including the promulgation
of a National Electricity Law, and (d) active encouragement for diversification in financing
for power development, including private sector participation. Although consensus exists



- 2 -
at the national level on the basic directions of the program, the difficult task of
implementing the reform program at provincial and local levels throughout the country is
just beginning. While actions have been initiated on all of the above topics, measures to
transform the power entities into commercial companies are now a focal point in the
overall effort.  These measures include separating the producing entities from the
Government, granting them autonomy in business decision-making, and subjecting them
to market forces in an arms-length regulatory framework.
4.          In line with Bank-wide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in
China places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last
two years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through the Bank's Institutional
Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector work on power
sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing further resources to meet the capital
needs of the sector development (through informal sector work). The energy conservation
support program includes technical assistance through the Global Environment Facility
(GEF), lending support in selected industrial projects, environment and energy, and
development of a series of new GEF investment operations. The power sector lending
program nowfocuses on assistance for the detailed aspects of implementation of the power
sector reforns, primarily at provincial levels, as well as reducing the power shortages that
continue to hamper development.
5.          Sichuan Province, where the proposed project is located, is one of the less
developed provinces in China. The proposed project is part of the giant Ertan project that
the Bank began supporting in 1991. For the purpose of financing, the Government has
divided the project into three phases; ongoing Ertan-Phase I, the proposed Sichuan Power
Transmission Project, and a future Ertan-Phase II Project to complete the overall project.
The Ertan project, with its output of 3,300 MW and 17 billion kWh a year of nonpolluting
hydropower, will supply 25-30 percent of the total power requirements in Sichuan
Province. Even with those additions to supply, increased sector efficiency through further
market orientation are crucial for sustained growth in the province, the most populous in
China. Implementation of power sector reforms in many ways lags behind that in more
advanced provinces where the Bank has been active in supporting the reforms through
other lending operations. The process of restructuring the management of the power
industry of the province from management by a government department to management
by a suitably autonomous power company is just beginning. Although based upon existing
well-developed institutions, SEPC was established as a company only in 1993. Recent
years have brought substantial progress in power price reform, but in this area as well,
Sichuan also lags behind other provinces.
6.          Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are to (a)
alleviate an acute shortage of electricity by the construction of a 500-kV transmission
network for connecting the ongoing Ertan hydroelectric project to the Sichuan power grid,
as well as reinforcing the existing power transmission system; (b) assist in implementing
power sector reforms in Sichuan Province, through a time-bound program; (c) support the
implementation of further power tariff rationalization; (d) promote transfer of



- 3 -
contemporary technologies for extra-high voltage transmission networks; (e) enhance
institutional capabilities for environmental management, and resettlement planning and
implementation; and (f) upgrade management and operation capabilities through well-
focused staff training programs.
7.          The reform agenda supported under the proposed project will focus on
increased autonomy and accountability of the newly created provincial power company and
on further reform of the power pricing system. To this end, a time-bound Action Plan has
been agreed. The enterprise reform component would include (a) revision of the company
charter based on the new company law; (b) separation of government functions from the
operational, management and commercial functions of SEPC; and (c) implementation of
adequate new accounting, reporting and auditing systems. Reform of the pricing system
would include a progressive phasing out of the multi-tier pricing system, measures to
improve transfer pricing mechanisms between the existing wide variety of power sellers
and purchasers, and the design and implementation of seasonal and time-of-day tariffs to
reflect the variation of supply costs of the mainly hydro system.
8.          Project Description. The proposed project would include (a) construction
of a new 500-kV network consisting of about 2,260 km of transmission lines, five
transformer substations (5,250 MVA) and one switching station, and reinforcement of the
existing transmission network; (b) provision of engineering and construction management
services; (c) carrying out of environmental management and resettlement programs; (d)
extension of technical assistance for implementation of the SEPC's Action Plan, and
development of accounting and financial management systems; and (e) design and
undertaking of specific training programs. The feasibility study and design report for the
transmission network component were completed by expatriate and local consultants in
1993. Following the Bank's Guidelines, international engineering consultants have been
selected to assist in finalizing designs, procurement of goods and works, and construction
management. Funding in the amount of $3 million out of the China Reform, Institutional
Support and Preinvestment Project-CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA) has been approved for
engineering and preparation of the project. An Environmental Assessment Report (EAR)
has been prepared in accordance with the Government and Bank environmental rules for
power projects. The EAR has been approved by all authorities, and submitted to the Bank.
The construction of the 500-kV transmission network is on the critical path for connecting
the ongoing Ertan hydroelectric plant (supported under Loan 3387-CHA) to the Sichuan
power grid. The Ertan project is progressing on schedule and within budget. The Ertan
Hydroelectric Development Corporation was created in connection with the previous Bank
loan; it is operating effectively as the first independent entity created in China for
developing hydropower resources.
9.          The total financing requirements for the proposed project, including interest
during construction (IDC), are estimated at $1,078.7 million equivalent. The State
Development Bank-SDB (70 percent), the Sichuan Investment Corporation-SIC (20
percent), and SEPC (10 percent) would cover the financing of local costs and IDC. The
Bank loan of $270 million would cover the full foreign exchange requirements, excluding
IDC. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts

and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A project map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13468-CHA dated January 20, 1995,
is being distributed separately.
10.         Project Implementation. SEPC will be responsible for implementation of
the project.  A specialized construction unit has been created to manage project
implementation. SEPC is a well-established power entity with the necessary capability for
carrying out large power projects, and project implementation arrangements appear to be
appropriate. Assistance in construction management will also be provided by the expatriate
and local engineering consultants during project implementation.   Procurement
arrangements for the project are being made to enable its efficient and timely
implementation.
11.         Project Sustainability. The institutional and financial sustainability of the
project will be secured by the planned strengthening of the beneficiary organization,
corporate autonomy and management capabilities, in line with the Government's reform
program for the sector. The new sectoral policy allows increased corporate autonomy in
managerial, procurement, financial and personnel matters. Financial covenants under this
projxct would help to enhance the beneficiary's capability for cost recovery to finance debt
servicing and internal cash generation for self-financing of future investments.
12.         Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The lessons learned from the
previous power projects and especially the Second Power Transmission Project are being
taken into account in preparing the proposed project. Based on these lessons, particular
attention is being given to proper assessment of project costs, improved and accelerated
procurement procedures, enhancement of the role of project construction management,
timely appointment of engineering consultants, effectiveness of technical assistance, staff
training, and implementation of study recommendations. Supported by the use of CRISPP
funds, implementing agencies have shown improvement in carrying out management
development, staff training and studies.  Commitments related to meeting financial
performance targets and enterprise reform are also being fulfilled more consistently.
13.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project complies with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for China, as presented to the Board on August 3,
1993.  That strategy highlights the need to support economic reform and promote
corporatization and development of a regulatory framework, while assisting infrastructure
modernization in an environmentally responsible manner. The proposed project also is a
central element in the Bank's power sector strategy, designed through recent sector work
(para. 4). The key objective of the Bank's involvement in this project is to provide an
operational context for implementation of China's power sector reforms in a major less-
developed province, focusing on (a) detailed design and implementation of specific reforms
to increase the market orientation of the provincial power entity, strengthen its autonomy,
and improve its financial capabilities, and (b) increases and rationalization of power tariffs.



14.         Agreed Actions. The Government agreed to: (a) take necessary measures
to enable SEPC to implement the Action Plan in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and
(b) onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan through Sichuan Province to SEPC on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. SEPC agreed that it would: (a) prepare by
September 30, 1995, in consultation with the Bank, a detailed program for implementation
of the Action Plan and, thereafter, implement the Action Plan in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank; (b) carry out the management development and staff training program; (c) carry
out the environmental management program and relocation of persons affected by the
project in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (d) furnish the Bank with audited projects
accounts, statements of expenditures, and financial statements within six months of the end
of each fiscal year; (e) take all necessary measures to ensure that its internal cash
generation is sufficient to meet operating expenses, taxes, and financial obligations in
1995; (f) take all necessary measures to ensure that its self-financing ratio is no less than
10 percent in 1996, 15 percent in 1997, 20 percent in 1998, 25 percent in 1999 and 30
percent thereafter; (g) not incur additional debt unless a forecast shows its internal cash
generation would provide a debt service coverage of no less than 1.2 times during 1996-97
and 1.5 times thereafter; and (h) furnish to the Bank each year a rolling eight-year
financial plan.
15.         Environmental Aspects. The proposed project is designated as Category
B for environmental assessment purposes. The project is located in a mountainous and
semirural agricultural area. Alternative routes for the transmission lines and transformer
substation sites were considered, and the selected route requires the least amount of land,
affects the least number of people, and offers the smallest impact on the natural and human
environment. The project's main environmental issues relate to worker health and safety,
transmission line impacts (noise and electromagnetic fields) and the influence of the
construction labor force on local infrastructure. Mitigating measures included in an
environmental management plan, which meets both Chinese and World Bank environmental
requirements, will be carried out to minimize project impacts.
16.         The transmission  lines will cross sparsely  populated  areas, and
approximately 8,000 people will be affected by the project. This would, inter alia, involve
certain relocation of the population presently living within the future corridors of the
transmission lines. A comprehensive resettlement action plan (RAP) has been received.
According to the RAP, the affected people and communities will be compensated
adequately according to both national and local regulations.   A  well-organized
environmental and resettlement unit also has been set up by authorities and the beneficiary
to handle the resettlement planning and implementation. The arrangements for resettlement,
which have been made through a participatory process with land users and local
authorities, are satisfactory. Institutional strengthening of the beneficiary's environmental
and resettlement capabilities is included within the project. Environmental and resettlement
specialists have participated in the preparation and processing of the proposed project.
17.         Project Benefits.  This large power project will greatly increase the
critically needed power transmission capability in Sichuan Province and the Southwest
China power grid as a whole. According to comprehensive analyses, the project is clearly



- 6 -
a critical part of the least-cost development program for meeting future power supply
needs, as it provides the means for transmitting power to consumers from the 3,300 MW
Ertan Project, which is already well under construction. The intemal economic rate of
return (IERR) for the full Ertan Hydroelectric Project (including sunk costs) and
investments in the transmission line is estimated at 17 percent. The IERR for only the
proposed transmission project is about 37 percent. Other intangible benefits include
institutional development, improved power grid operation, and the favorable influence on
society at large by helping relieve hardships caused by the acute power supply shortages.
18.         Risks. In view of the advanced preparatory works, risks associated with
project construction, cost overruns, and implementation delays in both the Ertan
hydroelectric plant and the proposed project are within reasonable limits and manageable
with the agreed supervision arrangements and involvement of competent engineering
consultants. Particular attention will be given to the safety aspects of the project, and to
capabilities and performance of major contractors. Implementation of the power sector
reforms in an efficient and timely manner represents another risk that would be addressed
through adequate technical assistance and continuous supervision of the project. The
government has given assurances that tariff increases required for SEPC to achieve its
financial targets will be forthcoming, and China's record in this regard has been good.
The economic risks would be minimal.
19.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

(a) As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
