INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL FOR A SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$30 million to the State of Israel to help
finance the first phase of a national sewerage program. The loan would
have a term of 25 years, including five years of grace, with interest at
7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Israel" (EMA-47a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 16,
1972. A Country Data Sheet (Annex II) and a map of Israel are attached.
3.        Israel has made strong and successful efforts to promote economic
growth, encourage immigration and maintain security. Besides continued
growth, increased attention has been given in recent years to two other
objectives, namely export promotion and full employment.
4.        Israel's gross domestic product expanded slightly faster in 1971
than in 1970, while overemployment persisted. Both gross fixed capital forma-
tion and national savings rose considerably in 1971 reaching 28 percent and
11 percent of GNP respectively. Consumption grew by only 2.5 percent in
1971, after an 11.2 percent jump in 1970, due to a marked slow-down in pub-
lic consumption in real terms. However, given the high level of defence
expenditures, the central government deficit remained at 10 percent of GDP
and the resources gap at 18 percent. Increased demand in 1971 put further
pressure on the price level. The general price index rose by 11 percent,
and price increases were especially pronounced for housing and various
services, as well as for imported goods in the wake of the devaluation in
August 1971.
5.        For the first time since 1965, imports grew relatively less than
exports. Total export earnings in dollars rose by 29 percent (8 percent in
1970), as a result partly of larger tourism and transportation services,
and partly of higher citrus and diamond exports. Government policy sup-
ported export growth through the devaluation of the Israeli pound in August
1971 from IL 3.50 to IL 4.20 per dollar, while export incentives were main-
tained. Imports of goods and services rose by 14 percent (20 percent in
1970) with the rate of growth for the private sector being balanced by a
temporary slowdown in Government imports. The large deficit of $1.2 billion
on goods and services was more than covered by unrequited transfers, which,
together with foreign investments and loan capital amounted to about US$1.54
billion, as compared to US$1.24 billion in 1970. Consequently, Bank of
Israel foreign exchange holdings increased by US$275 million to US$675 mil-
lion by the end of 1971. They increased further to US$1 billion by mid-1972.



- 2 -
o.        Agricultural output increased by 9.6 percent in 1971 (as compared
with 6.6 percent in 1970), while agricultural exports in current dollars
increased by 19.1 percent, as compared with 9 percent in 1970. The Govern-
ment continues its promotion policies to expand rural development and in-
crease production for exports. Water and labor are major constraints, yet
a growth target of 5 percent between 1971 and 1975 is considered attainable,
if programs to use water saving equipment and to rationalize production can
effectively be carried out.
7.        Industrial output increased by 12 percent in 1971 (10 percent in
1970), and industrial exports in current dollars rose by 25 percent (15 per-
cent in 1970). The recovery of the diamond polishing industry, after several
years of slump, accounted in large measure for the increase. Industrial
growth has been tle result of persistent Government promotion efforts, par-
ticularly through investment incentives which boosted profits to a level
which is high by international standards.
3.        Income from international tourism rose from US$60 million in 1970
to US$118 million in 1971, accounting for almost 10 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. About 650,000 tourists from abroad visited Israel in 1971, 48 per-
cent more than in the preceding year.   This was largely due to the reduction
in political tension in the Middle East, but also to a stepped-up Government
effort to promote group tourism from Western Europe. Lack of hotels appears
to be a growing constraint for an immediate further expansion of the industry.
9.        The Government aims at an annual rate of real GDP growth of 8 per-
cent over the next five years. It considers it necessary to accommodate im-
migration which is expected to rise to about 63,000 this year (almost equal
to the natural population increase) and to meet the Government's high current
expenditure. This growth target is largely based on the expectation of con-
tinually expanding exports. Substantial incentives are being offered for
this purpose. About half of Israel's total exports go to Europe and about
half of these go to the six original EEC countries with which Israel main-
tains a limited preference agreement. The terms of the trade arrangements
to be negotiated with the enlarged European community may have an important
effect on Israel's future export potential.
10.       The most recent figures available to the Bank indicate that Israel's
debt stood at $2.9 billion in June 1971 and that the debt service ratio was
26 percent. However, a sizable part of Israel's foreign debt is normally
rolled over, with the result that effective debt repayments are considerably
less than a debt service ratio might imply. Taking this factor and Israel's
relatively easy access to funds on concessional terms into account, Israel
is creditworthy for additional lending on conventional terms, even allowing
for the possibility that Israel will continue to increase its exterual debt
in the coming years.



-3-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
11.       The Bank has to date made eight loans for projects in Israel total-
ling US$184.5 million. Three loans have been to the Industrial Development
Bank of Israel (IDBI) for industry financing (US$60 million), one for the
expansion of a potash plant (US$25 million), one for the Port of Ashdod
(US$27.5 million), two for highways (US$52 million) and one for agricultural
credit,(US$20 million). Foreign exchange earnings and employment opportuni-
ties are being increased particularly through the IDBI loans which have fi-
nanced investment in export industries, and through the agriculture credit
project which has financed the production of flowers and vegetables for the
European market. The two highway projects and the ports project contributed
to basic infrastructure improvements needed to service the rapidly growing
economy and population. Project implementation on the whole has been satis-
factory. Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of September 30, 1972 and provides details of the state of execution
of ongoing projects.
12.       Israel's high and fast growing per capita income and its relatively
easy access to foreign funds make it a marginal borrower for Bank funds.
However, its persistently high capital requirements resulting from the need
to absorb a growing number of immigrants and to increase productivity and
exports in order to improve its balance of payments warrants continued Bank
assistance. As in the past, such lending should concentrate on agriculture
and industry, and in future may also include technical education where new
forms of instruction are being experimented with.
13.       A second agricultural credit loan is being prepared for presenta-
tion to the Executive Directors in the next fiscal year. There have been no
IFC operations in Israel, but IFC is presently considering an investment in
a chemical enterprise.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
The Sewerage Sector
14.       Provision for sewerage has lagged behind other forms of infrastruc-
ture. Population trebled since 1950 and now stands at 3.1 million. Most
communities and urban areas have some form of sewerage system, but in many
instances crude or inadequately treated sewerage is discharged into rivers,
dry river beds or the sea.
15.       Potentially the most serious consequence of inadequate sewerage
treatment and disposal is the deterioration of fresh water resources.
Israel's combined surface and groundwater resources are presently esti-
mated at 1.5 billion cubic meters per year, and total water use has
virtually reached this level. The most important sources of pollution of
fresh water are municipal and industrial effluents and agricultural chemicals.



- 4 -
Further deterioration of this situation could create a serious health hazard
and restrict present water use, which in turn would adversely affect agri-
cultural production, and also tourism development through beach pollution.
16.       To check this development, the Government has drawn up a national
sewerage program estimated to cost about IL 500 million (US$119 million) for
which it has requested Bank assistance. From this program the highest prior-
ity works (hereafter termed "investment projects") with a total cost of about
IL 316 million (US$75 million) have been selected as the first phase for the
proposed project. The Bank loan of US$30 million would cover the foreign
exchange component estimated at 40 percent of total cost.
Project Description
17.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Israel Sewerage Project"
(No. PU-107a) dated November    , 1972, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
The proposed project was appraised in April and Jlay 1972. Negotiations
were held in Washington in October 1972. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. Kuberski, Director General of the Ministry of Interior and head of the
delegation, Mr. Kantor, Water Commissioner of Israel and Project Director,
and Mr. Losovik, General Counsel of the Bank of Israel.
13.       The project would cover construction of sewers and treatment fa-
cilities over a period of five years. Its 78 investment projects would serve
75 urban communities. They include three regional schemes which would pro-
vide joint facilities for several of these communities in the Haifa, Ayyalon
and Tel Aviv areas. About 500 km of sewers and force mains, 80 pumping
stations and 40 treatment plants would be constructed, serving 2.3 million
inhabitants or about 75 percent of total population, when completed by 1977.
Investment projects will be located within the 1948 cease-fire line (see
attached map).
19.       When completed, the investment projects will permit treated ef-
fluents to be used for agricultural irrigation or discharged into rivers
and the sea without causing serious pollution or health hazards. In the
three regional schemes a further stage of treatment would be required to
allow re-use of effluents for industrial purposes or recharging of ground
water aquifers for general re-use. This tertiary treatment is not included
in the project and the Government is presently studying the most suitable
and economic methods for it. Through such treatment it will be possible
to increase the present water resources by about 170 million cubic meters
(or about 10 percent) by 1985. The Government will finance the necessary
facilities for this treatment from its own sources.
Project Cost and Financing
20.       Total project costs are estimated at US$75 million.    The largest
categories of expenditures would be treatment works (35 percent) and sewers
(16 percent). Engineering would* require about 9 percent while physical and



-5-
price contingencies are expected to require about 24 percent. These esti-
mates are based on unit prices for similar works. The price contingency
calculation assumes an annual price increase of 5 percent.
21.       The proposed Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange component
estimated at 40 percent of total cost. The State of Israel, through its
Central Government budget, will finance approximately 30 percent of project
costs, while the remaining 30 percent will be covered by two of the largest
commercial banks in Israel, Bank Leumi Le-Israel and Bank Hapoalim. These
two banks are traditionally involved in short and medium-term financing of
municipalities. The Government would cover any cost overruns and would bear
the exchange risk.
22.       The foreign exchange component has been calculated on the basis of
the expected direct imports of goods and the estimated foreign content of
goods produced locally and of civil works contracts.
Project Organization
23.       Local Government in Israel is traditionally decentralized.    By and
large, it has proved itself capable of running municipal services including
those for sewerage. Except for a few cases where physical interconnections
warrant regional cooperation, the project envisages that individual local
government authorities assume responsibility for execution and later opera-
tion of investment projects. However, in order to ensure satisfactory and
uniform standards in execution, operation and maintenance, central supervi-
sion is required. At present, supervision is shared among several Govern-
ment departments, none of which is adequately staffed to supervise the pro-
posed project. In order to provide central supervision, Government has
appointed its Water Commissioner as Project Director. He has already com-
prehensive responsibility for regulating the production and supply of fresh
water, and has the power to control the discharge of effluents and to enforce
minimum standards of treatment. His field of responsibility will be expanded
to include supervision of the construction, operation and maintenance of
project facilities. In order to be able to discharge these functions, his
office will be adequately staffed. The financial control of the Ministry
of the Interior over local authorities and the supervisory competence of
the Ministry of Health with regard to general sanitary standards to be
maintained by local authorities will not be affected by this arrangement.
Flow of Funds
24.       The local authorities will finance 100 percent of their investment
projects from loans out of a pool of funds to be administered by the two
commercial banks (para. 21) and to which these banks will contribute 30 per-
cent and the Government 70 percent. The Bank loan would be made to the
State of Israel to reimburse the Government for 40 percent of the total cost
of the investment projects as expenditures to carry out such investment proj-
ects are made by the local authorities. The movements of the combined funds
will be monitored through centralized and consolidated accounts to be main-
tained by the Government.



-6-
25.       The local authorities will borrow from the pool at 9 percent in-
terest for 25 years without grace period; the Government contribution to the
pool (part of which will be out of the proceeds of the Bank Loan) would be
made at 8 percent and for 25 years with a 5 years grace petiod while the com-
mercial banks' contribution would be made for 16 years without grace period.
A particular feature of the banks' cohtribution to the pool of funds is that
the service payments on their funds will be linked to a coht-of-living index
as is customary in Israel for all commercial bank development loans; the
Government will be responsible for imeeting these "linkage" costs.   The
differential between the rate at which the Government would borrow from the
Bank (7-1/4 percent) and the rate at which it would make funds available to
the pool (8 percent) will partitlly help the Government to defray the linkage
costs and to cover the foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan.
26.       The local authorities will be required to charge sewerage tdriffs
which will be sufficient to covet operation and maintenance expenses; plus
debt service.  The introduction¶ of cost-oriented tariffs is an important ob-
jective of the ptoposed project since in the past tariffs bore often little
relationship to cost.
27.       The cycle of project apprdval, financ'ihg and repayme'nt may best
be described in chronological order: a municipality participating in the
project will submit its investment project to the Project Director for ap-
proval. Upon his recommendation, the Ministry of Interior will authorize
the municipality to conclude a load agreement with one of the t4d cotmer-
cial banks. Tender dbcuments will then be submitted to the Baik through
the office of the Project Director. The tepoft on bid evaluations will
subsequently be submitted to the Bank followed in due course by copies of
the accepted tenders. The appropriate commercial bank will then disburse
out of its loan as proj6ct works progress. As a project loan is being dis-
bursed, the commercial bank will request the Government periodically to re-
imnburse 70 percent, which would represent the combined shard&4 of the Go'vern-
ment and the Bank.   The Government subsequently would obtaib from the Bank
reimbursement of 40 percent of the amounts disbursed under project loans to
cover the original cost of an investment project.
28.       The form of the draft loan agreements between the   6v'ernnient and
the two commercial banks have been approved d'uring nego'tiatio'ns and their
execution is a conditiodn of effecfiveness of the proposed'Bank loan. For
the project loan agreements between the commercial badnks and the local autho-
rities a standard loan agreement has been agteed upon and the Government has
undertaken to assure that this standard agreement be utilized.    A condition
to the same effect is included in the Government's-agreement wit-h the commer-
cial banks.
29.       Since the project has been prepared and appraised on the basis
of current priorities for sewerage investments, changes in the composition
of investment projects may become necessary during thi later part of the
implementation period. Peovisions have been made to allow for a limited
amount of such changes'. Works to be tendered during the next 18 months,
however, have been firmly agreed upon. Anhy subsequent changes would re-
quire prior Bank approval.



-7-
Procurement and Disbursement
30.       Procurement will be subject to international competitive bidding,
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Bids will be compared on the basis
of c.i.f. prices and domestic manufacturers will have a 15 percent margin of
preference or the actual duty, whichever is less, in competing with foreign
suppliers; no account will be taken of any preference granted by Israel to
EEC countries. Contracts for civil works will be combined as far as prac-
Licable for groups of project borrowers so that each tender will amount to
not less than $250,000. Israeli firms are expected to win most of the civil
works contracts and contracts for relatively small items of equipment.
31.       Expenditures made for engineering costs after December 1, 1971,
not exceeding in total US$250,000 would be retroactively financed under proj-
ect loans from the commercial banks and would be elegible for reimbursement
under the Bank loan.
Project Supervision
32.       Because of the large number of relatively small investment projects,
supervision procedures would be adapted accordingly. The Project Director
will periodically send reports to the Bank on technical and financial pro-
gress, in which he will indicate particular difficulties as they arise.
Bank supervision missions will concentrate on such problems, but will also
investigate project progress on a spot check basis. Any later changes from
the agreed list of investment projects (see para. 29 above), will be appraised
by Bank supervision missions.
Justification
33.       The project will have a considerable direct effect on the preserva-
tion of Israel's productive resources and particularly its scarcest resource,
i.e. water, and will help to avoid a growing public health and environmental
pollution hazard. Its benefits are not readily quantifiable but are judged
to exceed the financial rate of return on the project investment, which should
amount to 9 percent. The project will also help improve local authorities'
financial position by introducing cost-oriented tariffs and requiring them
to maintain financial records audited by independent auditors.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Loan Agreement between the State of Israel and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article 3, Section IV (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
35.       The draft Loan Agreement contains covenants normally included in
agreements for water supply and sewerage projects. Attention is drawn, how-
ever, to the following particular provisions of the draft Loan Agreement:



- 8 -
(a) Section 8.01 establishes as a condition of effectiveness
of the Loan Agreement that the Borrower shall have entered
into lending agreements with the two commercial banks on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank;
(b) Section 2.02 (c) (iii) establishes as a condition of disburse-
ment for each investment project that a project loan agreement
between the local authority in question and one of the two
commercial banks shall have been entered into in conformity
with the requirements of Section 3.02 (b) (v) of the draft
Loan Agreement;
(c) Section 2.02 (c) (iv) establishes as a further condition of
disbursement for each investment project that the local
authority in question shall have enacted the necessary by-
laws to enable it to set its tariffs as necessary to meet
the requirements of Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment; and
(d) Section 3.03 requires the appraisal by the Project Director
of each proposed investment project and the Bank's review
and final approval of each investment project, prior to
the Government granting permission for one of the two
commercial banks to enter into a project loan agreement
with the local authority in question.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

B. PROJECT EMECUTION AND DISBURSEMENTS
Uoan 689-IS of 1970
(Industrial Development
Bank of Israel - IDBI)
IDBIts portfolio and financial position are sound. Its
earnings record is satisfactory. IDBIts volume of operations increased
significantly during 1971 compared to 1970; 1972 is expected to be another
record year, both in terms of loan approvals and profits. IDBI was granted
a six month extension of the terminal date for submission of projects under
Loan 689-IS from June 30 to December 31, 1972. The delay in committing the
loan was due to the devaluation of the Israeli Pound in August 1971 and the
consequent need for reappraising several large projects and to lack of pro-
jects with a large enough import content. IDEI still expects to fully dis-
burse the loan before the closing date of December 31, 1973, but a six month
extensiQn may be required.
Loan 709-IS of 1970
(Agricultural Credit
Project)
Progress under this project is very satisfactory. Disbursements
are on schedule and it is foreseen now that the loan will be fully disbursed
by March 1973, that is nine months ahead of the previous forecast. Exports
of project crops have increased substantially in 1970/71 ranging from 16%
for subtropical fruits to 32% for grapefruit and vegetables.
Loan 781-IS of 1971
(Second Hizhway
ProJect)
The Second Highway Construction Project consists of 12 different
roads, of which the Ayyalon freeway in Tel-Aviv is the major one. The construc-
tion of four roads, including the Ayyalon freeway, has commenced and progress
is satisfactory. ILan disbursements are expected to commence shortly and the
loan is expected to be fully disbursed prior to the closing date of June 30,
1976. The vehicle dimension and axle-load study, now being undertaken by
the Public Works Department, will not be completed by December 31, 1972, as
had been specified in the Loan Agreement, and the terminal date for its
completion will have to be postponed by at least six months. A supervision
mission is scheduled to visit Israel in December 1972, and will discuss the
timing of the study.
