I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Bank involvement in Mauritanian iron ore dates back to 1957, when
Societe Anonyme des Mines de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFERMA), a company owned
predominantly by French, British, German and Italian interests, requested the
Bank to finance the exploitation of a high-grade iron ore deposit in the Kedia
mountains (Map IBRD-13583). The Bank loan, made in 1960 1/. amounted to US$66
million, out of a total project cost of US$190 million.
1.02      Even during MIFERMA's init:ial appraisal of the Kedia project it was
apparent that although the mountains contained a satisfactory reserve, it
was limited. The sponsors therefore intended from the outset, to explore and
develop the so-called "guelbs" (a number of iron ore outcroppings nearby),
in order to continue to make use of the large infrastructure investments -
notably the 650 km railway and port facilities-once the Kedia ore was ex-
hausted. This exploration work was largely carried out during the 1970s.
1.03      Since start-up in 1963, mining has proceeded smoothly, and by 1973
a production level of about 10 million tons of ore per year (tpy), had been
reached, i.e., well above the 6 million tpy output originally intended. Even
the nationalization of MIFERMA in 1974 did not seriously disrupt iron ore
deliveries, and following successful negotiations with the former share-
holders--which led to a US$90 million nationalization compensation - a
normal business relationship was resumed.
1.04      In 1976, due to the impencling exhaustion of the known iron ore
reserves in the Kedia mountains, the Government of Mauritania and the Societe
Nationale Industrielle et Miniere (SNIM) - the state corporation which had
taken over the MIFERMA operations - requested the Bank to help finance the
Guelbs iron ore project. This project, is to be carried out in two phases.
The first phase, which will partiaLly replace the Kedia mining operations, is
to be carried out between 1979 and ].982, and will develop the El Rhein mine.
The second phase (1986-1989) will develop a second mine (Oum Arwagen), after
which time the Kedia operation will cease. Although this appraisal deals
primarily with the first phase, it is imperative that the second phase be
forthcoming, both in order to maintain the projected ore output of 12-14
million tpy, and to assure the continued financial viability of SNIM.
1.05      The process of project preparation for Board presentation has been
a lengthy one. A first identification mission in January 1977, was followed
by an appraisal mission in October 1977, led by C.W. Lorenz (Chief), and
Y.A.A. Duvivier (Industrial Projects Department), who were joined by repre-
sentatives of most of the Arab and European co-lenders. I`he complexity of
the project required a total of 12 missions up until April 1979, because: (i)
SNIM had to be reconstituted, and made into a viable and creditworthy borrower
1/   Loan 249-FR, March 17, 1960.



(principally through the divestiture of its highly unprofitable copper opera-
tions); (ii) four lenders' meetings had to be convened in order to develop a
viable financing plan; (iii) meetings with banks and iron ore consumers were
necessary in order to structure an acceptable security arrangement for the
parties involved; and (iv) extensive working sessions had to be held with
SOCOMINE (Societe de Cooperation Miniere et Industrielle), the project con-
sultant, in order to ensure proper project management.
1.06      The first phase of the project is expected to be completed by end
1982, and total financing requirements - including working capital, interest
during construction and normal and extraordinary contingencies - are expected
to be approximately US$500.7 million equivalent, of which US$456.1 million (or
91%) is expected to be in foreign exchange. The financing plan for the first
phase envisages US$338 million of long-term loans, US$120 million of new
equity to be provided by five new shareholders, the Arab Mining Co. (ARMICO),
the Islamic Development Bank, the Kuwait Foreign Trading, Contracting and
Investment Co. (KFTCIC), and the Governnents of Morocco and Iraq, in addition
to US$42.7 million from SNIM's internal cash generation.
1.07      The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million will finance the ore handling
equipment, miscellaneous items in the beneficiation plant, the ore wagons and
the civil works contracts, as well as interest during construction on
the Bank loan itself.
II. THE MINING SECTOR
A.   Description of the Sector
2.01      Mining is the most important sector of the Mauritanian economy.
It consists primarily of the exploitation of iron ore and, to a lesser extent,
of copper and gypsum.
1.   Iron Ore Operations
2.02      The exploitation of iron ore in Mauritania dates back to 1963, when
MIFERMA commenced operations with a French, British, Italian and German con-
sortium as the principal shareholders. This same consortium also purchased
a major proportion of the ore output. Since MIFERMA's nationalization in
1974, the mines have been operated by the Complex Minier du Nord (COMINOR) -
SNIM's primary operating unit. Since the beginning, production capacity has
increased steadily; rising from the 6 million tpy originally envisaged, to
about 11.5 million tpy. The most recent significant expansion took place in
1973, when somewhat lower grade pits were brought into production. The
operations are located inland, about 650 km eastnortheast of Nouadhibou,
the port of shipment, which is connected with the mining town of Zouerate by
rail.

2.   Copper Operations
2.03      The Societe des Mines de Mlauritanie (SOMIMA) was created in March
1967, 1/ to mine the copper deposits of Akjoujt (200 km Northeast of Nouak-
chott). SOMIMA exploited copper ox:.de ore and produced a concentrate based un
the TORCO process, which had a very high fuel cost. Furthermore, the arsenic
content of the copper concentrate made marketing difficult, and the product
therefore sold at a discount from world market prices.
2.04      From the commencement of operations in 1971, major technical diffi-
culties were experienced, and most of the time SOMIMA operated at less than
50% capacity, turning out a profit (of UM137 million) only once, in 1973,
when copper prices reached an all time peak.
2.05      In late 1974, as a result of the increase in fuel prices and rapidly
deteriorating copper prices, the sh.areholders closed the mine. To maintain
jobs, the Government of Mauritania took over the copper company, and integrated
it with SNIM. SOMIMA resumed operations in the second half of 1975, and its
continuous high losses seriously afEected SNIM's overall financial position
(para. 3.21) thereafter. As a result, the Government was obliged to separate
SOMIMA from SNIM in March 1978, and, in turn, to halt copper operations in May.
3.   Gypsum
2.06      The large deposits of gypsum found to the north of Nouakchott have
been exploited by SNIM since 1973, with the entire output (roughly 17,000 tpy)
being sold to the Rufisque Cement Plant in Senegal, as part of an agreement
whereby Senegal purchases Mauritanian gypsurn, and accords a 12% rebate on
the price of cement sold in Mauritania in return. Recently, the Government
decided to separate the gypsum operation from SNIM.
B.   Contribution to the Economy
2.07      Iron ore mining by COMINOR is the mainstay of the Mauritanian economy
and its development throughout the 1960s has been the principal determinant
of the country's rapid economic growth. By the mid-1970s, COMINOR directly
accounted for 21% of Mauritania's GDP at factor cost, and 80% of its exports.
It is the second largest employer in the country after the Government - with
1/   The share capital was distributed as follows:
Charter Consolidated .................................  44.6%
Islamic Republic of Mauritiania .........................  22.0%
French Group ........         ........................  18.4%
IFC ................................  15.0%



- 4 -
a total of about 4,800 workers 1/ - and provides about 25% of total public
revenues. Aside from these direct contributions, iron ore mining also sup-
ports a host of other economic activities in Mauritania. Moreover, the con-
tinuous exploitation of this resource is necessary to finance the development
of other sectors, which would in time constitute a renewable base for the
country's economic growth.
1.   Contribution to GDP
2.08      As mentioned above, COMINOR directly accounts for 21% of GDP at
factor cost, but its total contribution is considerably higher.

2.09      Iron ore mining has a substantial indirect impact on GDP.  Many
industrial and construction enterprises work mainly, or exclusively, for
COMINOR. An analysis of the services sector also shows that mining creates --
directly or indirectly -- local added value amounting to about 25% of public
utilities, commerce, transport, and services. In addition, since mining
accounts for one-quarter of total current public revenues directly, it pro-
vides the means for substantial expenditures in the services sector.

2.10       In summary, iron ore mining generates about 20% of the added value
in the other industrial and construction sectors, and about a third in the
services sector.  This, in turn, represents about 10% of GDP - implying a con-
tribution of some 31% in toto. On the other hand, were the iron-ore mines to
close (ie. were the Guelbs project not to be executed and t:he current Kedia
operations to cease for lack of ore), the ensuing reduction in GDP would
almost certainly be more severe than these calculations indicate, as the
resultant excess capacity in the services sector would lead to uneconomic
levels of operation, and so to a further reduction in value added. In
addition, there would be multiplier effects on demand for public and private
services, as both Government and private spenders would be forced to rearrange
the uses of their remaining disposable incomes.
2.11      Beyond the reduction in GDP, a closing of the iron ore mines would
also cause a de facto destruction of the present capital stock in both the
mining and services sectors, as most of these investments would become
obsolete long before a comparable source of income (and so demand for their
services) could be generated.
2.   Public Revenues
2.12       In 1976, total taxes received from COMINOR amounted to DM 1,208
million (US$26.9 million), or 29% of total public revenues. Of these, taxes
from mineral sales amounted to UM 702 million, while UM 405 million related
to personal income tax - the remainder being generated by import duties and
other miscellaneous taxes.
2.13      Aside from this direct contribution to Government revenues, a sub-
stantial part of the income of employees and enterprises in public admin-
istration, public utilities, commerce, and services is supported by iron ore
mining. A closure of the mines would therefore cause a further decrease
in Government revenues, as the taxes on the personal incomes of the people
affected would decline, along with the taxes on the imports related to these
incomes.  In this context it should be noted that the income tax base in
Mauritania is extremely narrow, consisting only of the public sector and
a relatively small number of private firms, many of which work directly with
COMINOR.
2.14       In conclusion, the total loss in Government revenues which would
result from the closure of the mines would most likely be such as to severely
impair, and perhaps even prevent, the attainment of the country's social and
development goals.  Indeed, the capacity of the Governnent to maintain basic
health, education and social expenditures would be in question.
3.   Balance of Payments Effects
2.15      At present, iron ore exports account for 80% of Mauritania's foreign
exchange earnings. Even assuming a major expansion in fish exports, iron ore
would still represent 70% of exports of goods and non-factor services for



- 6 -
some time to come.  The continuation of iron ore production is, therefore,
also essential in order to maintain Mauritania's capacity to import the
intermediate and capital goods which are necessary for the development of
the country. If iron ore exports were to disappear, only a substantial
devaluation would permit Mauritania to balance its external accounts. Such
a devaluation would have further severe disruptive effects on development,
because of the resultant sharp changes in relative factor prices, and the
likelihood that foreign exchange rationing would have to be introduced in
order to secure essential imports. It is also likely that the remaining
foreign exchange earnings would be insufficient to cover the food bill (50%
of Mauritania's food requirements are imported), and would thus cause mass
migration.
4.   Employment Effects
2.16      Iron ore operations currently provide 4,300 direct jobs to
Mauritanians. These, in turn, sustain the entire population of Zouerate
(30,000 people), along with a substantial proportion of that of Nouadhibou
(also about 30,000 people) where the only other industry-fishing-directly
employs less than 1,000 workers. The closure of the iron ore mines would,
therefore, directly affect between 40-50,000 people. Furthermore, as dis-
cussed above, if mining indirectly accounts for a third of service sector
value added, then probably almost a third of employment in the services
sector, or 6,500 jobs, would be lost. Employment in public administration
would also be affected, as a large component of the civil servants' salary
bill is supported by royalties on iron ore exports. The repercussions on
the economy of a loss of employment of this magnitude would be difficult to
exaggerate.
2.17      Both resettling these individuals in some other part of the country,
and finding them alternative employment would be difficult. There are no
significant alternatives in industry, while the sparsity of farmland would
*not offer a viable alternative, and would require investments in housing and
social services which are beyond the Government's means.
III. SNIM -- THE COMPANY
A.   Background and Ownership
3.01      As noted earlier (para 2.02), the iron ore operations, originally
established by MIFERMA in 1963, were nationalized in 1974.  The effects of
this change of ownership were fortunately not disruptive. Even though the
question of compensation remained unresolved for almost two years, the former
shareholders did not interrupt their iron ore purchases, and a satisfactory
compensation agreement between the Government of Mauritania and the former
shareholders was reached in January 1976. This called for a total payment of
US$90 million from Mauritania, of which US$40 million was to be paid in cash,
and US$50 million was to be paid in five equal annual installments. The cash
payment was funded by a KFTCIC (Kuwait Foreign Trading, Contracting and



- 7 -
Investment Company) loan to the Government, at an interest rate of 8% for 6
years. The first US$10 million installment for December 1976 was paid by
COMINOR, while the 1977 installment was paid by the Government. SNIM is to
be reimbursed for the initial installment as part of a royalties rebate
package to be granted by the Goveronent from 1978-85 (para 8.14), under whi<>
the Government has also agreed to assume the liability for the remaining
installments.
3.02       SNIM was established in 1972, as a State Company into which COMINOR
was subsequently incorporated after the nationalization of MIFERMA. Other
than COMINOR, which alone generates 90% of SNIM's revenues and constitutes
95% of fixed assets, SNIM includes a few minor ventures such as: (i) SNIM
Explosifs (SNIMEX), an explosives factory which is entirely captive to the
iron ore mine, (ii) Department de Commercialisation des Produits Petroliers
(DCPP), 1/ a petroleum products distribution system, 40% of whose output
is sold to the iron ore operations; and (iii) the gypsum operations referred
to in para 2.06 above. In 1979 SNIbI will commence operation of SNIM/Acier, a
mini steel mill to smelt COMINOR-generated scrap for the production of rebars
for the local market (Annex 3-1). SNIM has its head-office and support ser-
vices in Nouakchott; these include a technical department for miscellaneous
project studies, a geological research group, and training facilities. In
addition to separating the gypsum operation from SNIM (para. 2.06), the
Government is making plans also to separate the DCPP from SNIM. As the DCPP
is a profitable enterprise, the Government will compensate SNIM for all
financial effects of the separation and has agreed to discuss with the Bank
the level of an adequate compensation. In any event, SNIM would not be
prevented from directly importing iLs oil at world market prices should the
price of oil on the local market be higher.
3.03       The Government passed a decree officially separating SOMIMA, the
copper company, from SNIM, on March 31, 1978, and actual operations were
terminated on May 31. The associated financial settlement was reached on
.August 10.  Under this, the Government has agreed to assume SOMIMA's debt
on SNIM's behalf. While there is a project under consideration to mine the
underlying sulfide ore body and produce blister copper, the Bank has voiced
strong doubts as to whether: (i) the envisioned smelter technique could in
fact produce blister; and (ii) the ore's arsenic contamination could be
reduced to levels which would not seriously impair the marketability of the
final product. UNDP is presently financing a prefeasibility study.
B.   Organization and Management
3.04       SNIM was initially constituted as a State-owned Company, placed
directly under the responsibility of the President of Mauritania, and admin-
istered by a Board of Supervisors. In April 1978, following the divestiture
1/   Originally called UCPP - Unite de Commercialisation des Produits
Petroliers -



8 -
of SOMIMA, the company was reconstituted as a State-controlled, limited
liability corporation (Societe d'Economie Mixte a Majorite d'Etat), permit-
ting private and foreign ownership. The new SNIM is to be administered by a
Board of Directors, chaired by a Mauritanian Governnent official and whose
vice-chairman is a representative of the foreign shareholders.
3.05      SNIM's organization chart is shown on the following page (Chart
3-1). As can be seen, all operational units report directly to the Director
General, who is assisted by a Secretary General. As mentioned earlier,
COMINOR's position within SNIM is of exceptional importance, and its or-
ganization chart is therefore shown on the subsequent page (Chart 3-2).
3.06      Although COMINOR's mining operations are physically dispersed
between the mining town, which is 650 km inland, the railroad line, and the
railroad maintenance yard and port facilities at Nouadhibou, operations have
thus far been carried out in a smooth and efficient manner. This has been
essentially due to: (i) an experienced and qualified expatriate staff which
dates back to the operations prior to nationalization; (ii) a very capable
Mauritanian General Manager; and (iii) a cooperative attitude on the part
of the Government. In addition, MIFERMA's key management figures, who left
after nationalization to form the consultant firm SOCOMINE, have remained
closely involved with the management of COMINOR on a full-time basis ever
since, and have in fact been chosen by SNIM to be the Guelbs project managers.
3.07      Also, in order to assist the Director General of SNIM, SNIM has
agreed to employ prior to December 31, 1979, an experienced Director of
Operations who will manage all technical, operational and personnel aspects of
the mining, railroad and port operations. He will also be closely involved in
coordinating the efforts of SOCOMINE and SNIM's project group at Zouerate.
3.08      Until 1977, the high caliber of SNIM's technical management was not
matched by that of the financial management. While COMINOR's financial man-
agement was adequate, that of the other operating units, and of SNIM itself,
was poor. The problem was compounded by the steady addition of other diverse
operating units, the continuing losses of SOMIMA, and the hasty development
of SNIM's central organization in Nouakchott. Corrective measures commenced
in 1977 with the hiring of a high calibre financial director and the contract-
ing of the assistance of Helios (France), a reputable international auditing
firm. Some progress has already been achieved, but further improvements are
necessary. In particular, improved financial appraisal of new projects and
other investments is required, along with the establishment of a new corpo-
rate planning capability. SNIM has given assurances that (i) further
strengthening of the financial department will take place; (ii) it will keep
separate accounts for all its operating units; and (iii) it will not commit
itself to new projects, or take over projects from others, without the
prior consent of the Bank.

3.09     SNIM's head office in Nouakchott has grown considerably over the last
three years into a complex of some 520 persons. In addition to the facili-
ties provided by this organization, overseas commercial and personnel ser-
vices are provided by recruitment and marketing agencies in Paris and a pur-
chasing agency in Zurich. The cost of these facilities has been increasing
rapidly; the technical department has been expending considerable funds in
geological and other research, the construction of a new Head Office building
in Nouakchott has required a heavy capital outlay, and SNIM's support services
have been expanded to provide for the construction of a new State-owned re-
finery in Nouadhibou, as well as the initiation of other industrial ventures.
As a result, total operating costs of SNIM's central organization amounted to
US$14.7 million in 1978, of which the Paris and Zurich offices alone accounted
for more than US$3.0 million. This rapid expansion has led to some redun-
dancies within the support services of SNIM's operating units, while both the
divestiture and closure of SOMIMA, and the cessation of overhead expenditures
for the oil refinery, should permit drastic reductions to be made in the
central organization. Similarly, although activities not directly related to
iron ore mining may in the long term yield benefits to SNIM and the country,
they put considerable pressure on SNIM's cash-flow in the short term and thus
on its ability to provide adequate equity for the Guelbs financing. They are
therefore prime candidates for reduction. SNIM has now presented a compre-
hensive program which will substantially cut overhead costs over a 3-year
period. This will be partially achieved by closing the purchasing office
in Zurich and transferring its activities to Mauritania, and by consolidating
the two Paris offices into one, in line with the reduced needs of the company.
3.10      SNIM's training efforts are concentrated in a modern training center
in Nouadhibou, on the job training in Zouerate, supplemented by a facility
in Nouakchott and a trainee program abroad. While there is a clear need for
intensive training at all technical levels, duplication is involved in having
training dispersed in 3 locations. It appears that training in Nouakchott,
primarily in clerical, administrative and accounting procedures, is largely of
benefit to the country, rather than SNIM, as many trainees leave after program
completion. The Bank has recently financed 1/ a training center in Nouakchott,
which will become operational towards the end of 1979, at which time SNIM
should phase out those aspects of training which are duplicated in the new
center. Training in SNIM's Nouadhibou facilities concentrates on teaching
basic mechanical and electro-mechanical skills. The success rate there, meas-
ured in terms of the number of successfully promoted personnel retained within
SNIM, is astonishingly high. Out of a total entry of 226 persons at the
beginning of 1977, only 15% had been lost at the end of that year. Finally,
on-the-job training takes place at Zouerate. Such training of equipment oper-
ators is also very successful - all 53 candidates at the beginning of 1977
became successful operators. There are 10 expatriate technical instructors
and 9 Mauritanian instructors involved in this latter training effort.

3.11      In the future, the major task of the training centers will be the
education of the Mauritanians required to manage the Guelbs iron ore opera-
tions, and so reduce the need for additional expatriate staff. These require-
ments are as follows:

Although personnel from the diminishing Kedia operation will be transferred
to the Guelbs project, a considerable increase in mining machine operators is
nonetheless required. However, SNIM is well equipped to provide the necessary
training for these.
3.12      External financial support is justified for those training and
research activities whose benefits accrue primarily to the country, rather
than SNIM itself. SNIM is therefore preparing a program to find external
financial support for such activities, and is to periodically report to the
Bank on the progress of this effort.
C.   Past Operations
3.13      Mining of iron ore in the Kedia mountains occurs over a 25 km east/
west stretch: including Tazadit pits 1 through 9 in the east, followed by
Rouessa pits 1 through 9, and Segala Azouazil and F'Derik 1 and 2 in the
west (Map IBRD-13584). The remaining ore reserve in the Kedia mountains as
of the beginning of 1979 was about 88 million tons. Under the existing ex-
ploitation schedule, this will be completely mined out by 1990/91. Exploita-
tion of Kedia has been, and will remain, conventional, with excavating shovels
and front-end loaders loading the blasted ore onto dump trucks, which deliver
the material to three primary gyratory crusher stations. These then either
transport the ore via secondary and tertiary crushing stations to the stock
areas (Rouessa), or deliver it directly to the storage areas (Tazadit and
F'Derik). The ore wagons are loaded by bucket-wheel reclaimers, via load-
out stations with a charging capacity of between 26 to 30 80-ton wagons at
the Tazadit and Rouessa stations, and 14 wagons at F'Derik. At the end of
June 1978, the operations at Zouerate employed 2,225 men, of which 115 were
expatriates.
3.14     The railroad line connects the mining town of Zouerate with the Port
of Nouadhibou, some 650 km to the west. Daily traffic currently consists
of two trains, each 2 km long and transporting up to 15,000 tons. This
gives the line an annual capacity of 11.5 million tons. The line could,
however, easily accommodate 12 million tpy on a three-train-per day basis

and, with additional sidings, up to 14 million tpy could be transported. The
railroad maintenance department is organized as shown on the following page
(Chart 3-3). The Nouadhibou and Zouerate services are the most important
divisions, each operating three or more equally-spaced, fixed maintenance
stations along the track. Ore transport is effected by 26 Alsthom diesel
electric locomotives, and 1,080 ore wagons.
3.15      The main railroad shops at Nouadhibou have developed a rigorous
overhaul system over the years, which is essential for effective operation
in desert conditions. The main features for locomotive maintenance are: (i)
daily three-hour, routine servicing; (ii) 7,500 and 15,000 km partial over-
hauls; (iii) 30,000 km full overhauls; and (iv) total disassembly after
275,000 km, and re-assembly over a period of 17 days. Currently, 111 expatri-
ates are employed in the railroad operations, along with 1,127 Mauritanians.
3.16      At the mineral port, located about 14 km south of Nouadhibou, the
ore trains are subdivided into lots c,f 15 cars. Each car is emptied by an
ore car tipper which can handle 40 wagons per hour. After this the ore is
transported by conveyors to the crushing and screening station, and eventually
deposited by two stackers alongside the port, in an area capable of holding a
total of 2 million tons of ore. The mineral is carefully stocked according
to the 9 Kedia qualities marketed. l`he reclaiming of the stocks is effected
by 3 bucket wheels, with a capacity of 3,000 tons per hour each. These units
are augmented by power shovels. The shiploader can handle 5,500 tons per hour
and can charge 100,000 tons in about 30 hours if the ship demands only one
quality of ore. Currently the pier handles ships up to 150,000 dwt. The port
department employs a total of 514 persons (of which 68 are expatriates) in
operating and managing these facilit:Les, which are capable of handling a total
of 12 to 14 million tons per year. A layout of the port area, with a func-
tional description, is given in Chari: 3-4.
3.17      Port, railyard and mining operations are supplemented by adequate
*power generation in Nouadhibou, as well as in Zouerate. Social infrastruc-
ture includes an integrated primary and secondary school, a modern hospital
in Zouerate, and adequate housing and sports facilities for staff and workers
in both Zouerate and Nouadhibou.
3.18      The physical security of CtDMINOR's entire iron ore operation remains
potentially threatened by guerilla attacks. The attacks of the Polisario
against the mining town of Zouerate in the spring of 1977, and the frequent
disruption of railroad operations in late fall of the same year and there-
after, taxed COMINOR's management heavily. However, while the successful
spring attack caused about 30% of the expatriate staff to Leave and had a
temporary negative effect on the morale of those remaining, it resulted in a
lowering of operating costs because of salary savings due to expatriate
departures. Additional lowering of operating costs were simultaneously
achieved through improvement of the ore-handling system and reductions in the
cost of truck haulage. While these simultaneous operational improvements
would indicate that management has been more than successful in Mauritaniz-
ing key posts at the mine (which, te an extent, is certainly due to the
elaborate training programs COMINOR has mounted), there is, nevertheless,
a limit as to how many expatriates can be lost without affecting efficient

operations. Efforts must therefore be made to hire and retain the necessary
key expatriate personnel.   In addition, whether the Company could cope with
other continuing disruptions of the railway line and keep up proper maintenance
despite such disruptions over extended periods of time remains to be seen.
Whilst the mining town of Zouerate ncw appears well protected by mobile
Mauritanian units surrounding a walled defense perimeter, which is in turn
permanently manned by Moroccan troops, the railroad line to the coast remains
vulnerable to guerilla attack, and this has already had repercussions on
COMINOR's excellent track maintenance system.  However, it should be noted
that since the new government took over on July 10, 1978, the ceasefire
proclaimed by the Polisario has held, and no military incident has occurred
since. It is to an extent a measure of confidence that all maintenance
stations along the track have been remanned and are operating normally.
Nevertheless, due to events in the early part of 1978, iron ore sales for
1978 amounted to 6.5 million tons instead of the 8.6 million tons originally
projected.
D.   Past Performance and Recent Financial Position
3.19      As noted earlier, COMINOR is the most significant entity in SNIM,
representing about 85% of total sales, or 90 to 95% of the Company's sales
excluding SOMIMA. The financial position of SNIM is therefore, predominantly
determined by COMINOR's operating results. Recent sales and financial data
for COMINOR - for which separate financial statements and accounts are kept -
are summarized below and are detailed in Annex 3-2:

COMINOR's, and before 1974, MIFERMA's, sales and profitability have varied
closely in line with the cycles in the world iron ore market, and the general
level of economic growth in the major steel producing countries. Sales and
profitability peaked in 1973-74, when the completion of MIFERMA's expansion
program, resulting in a total capacity of 11.5 million tpy, coincided with a
very strong demand for iron ore world-wide. Average FOB prices for Kedia ore
further increased to US$15.6/ton in 1975, but sales volumes began to decrease,
as the first effects of the recession of the steel industry in the major
producing countries were felt.
3.20       Profitability was further reduced in 1977 as export prices dropped
almost US$1 per ton on average against 1976 and as security problems seriously
affected operations. In 1977, the net effect of the security problems was
to reduce exports from an estimated 9.5 million to 8.4 million tons, with a
corresponding reduction in net cash flow of US$12 million. In 1978 the
production further dropped to 6.5 million tons resulting in a net loss for
COMINOR of about US$10 million. The last two years' results cannot however
be considered a valid illustration of COMINOR's earning capacity under normal
operating conditions. It should also be noted that in bad years COMINOR's
financial results have been further adversely affected by the tax system,
under which, since 1976, COMINOR has essentially been paying an export royalty
of 10% of FOB sales, regardless of the operation's actual net profits. This
system has been perpetuated because of the Government's need to keep its main
source of revenues steady, rather than depend on fluctuating income taxes or
dividends. The Government has however, agreed to change the rate of taxation
- at least during the project execution period (para. 8.07).
3.21      Within SNIM, the positive results generated by COMINOR have in the
past unfortunately been offset by the substantial losses of SOMIMA, and, for
the last two years, by the heavy expenditures of SNIM's Nouakchott organiza-
tion as well (para. 3.08). This is illustrated by the financial data summar-
ized below from that provided in Annex 3-2.

b   After allocation of 83% of SNIM's overhead to COMINOR.  (If, for example,
the high cost of SNIM's Nouakchott training center could be financed
otherwise, the loss is reduced to US$2.2 million).
From 1975 to 1977, SNIM's consolidat.ed results reflected the poor perfor-
mance of SOMIMA, which generated average net losses of US$20.3 million and
cash shortfalls of US$11.8 million per annum throughout the period. As the
above tables indicate, excluding SOMIMA, SNIM has been an essentially profit-
able venture, with the exception of a net loss incurred in 1977 and 1978.
This result, however, stemmed principally from COMINOR's low profit generation
in the face of security problems, coupled with the high royalty payments
referred to above, and was combined with the first effects of the ambitious
program initiated by SNIM in 1975 for the development and diversification of
its central organization.
IV. THE MARKET FOR IRON ORE
A.   The Demand for Crude Steel and Production
4.01      Forecasting of future steel demand is particularly difficult given
the present depressed market and the uncertain prospects for the steel industry
in traditional steel producing counlries. This is demonstrated by various
recent forecasts (EC, UNIDO, IISI, AISI and the 1977 Bank study) 1/ which
differ substantially.
1/   EC = European Community, IISI = International Iron and Steel Institute,
AISI = American Iron and Steel Institute.



- 20 -
4.02      The latest published (1977) forecast of the IISI was the following:
Crude Steel Demand in 1981 and 1985
(In Million Tons of Crude Steel Equivalent)
1977-85
Projections    Annual Rate
1981   1985    of Growth %
Total World                                             995   1,058       +4.9%
World, excluding Centrally Planned
Economies (CPEs)                                     606      717         _
of which
Industrialized countries                          512      588       +4.7%
Developing countries                               94      129       +8.4%
The above projection is roughly in line with UNIDO's forecast 1/ of 1,069
million tons in 1985, but is considerably higher than the 900 million tons
that the 1977 Bank study 2/ would suggest for the same year.
4.03      For the purpose of this market study, three new demand forecasts
have been prepared. The first 2 forecasts, prepared by the Bank's Economic
Analysis and Projection Department (EPD), use a trend line (based on the
elasticity of demand for steel and GNP growth) for specific groups of coun-
tries, assuming future growth rates of GNP lower than the historic ones. The
first of these (Case A) uses a trend line adjusted for a decline in elastici-
ties below historic values after 1977. The second forecast (Case B) uses as a
"high case" the unadjusted historical trend line i.e. with historic elasticity
values. The third forecast, the base case, was prepared by the Bank's Indus-
trial Projects Department, and uses as a base the 1977 actual consumption
(instead of the high base of 1974/1975 used by other studies), and a growth
rate of 3.4%, 3/ against the historical 4.5% for the period of 1955-77. Cases
A and B generate projections which are perhaps over-optimistic and out of line
with views expressed by industry sources. The base case, on the other hand,
is conservative but not unreasonable considering present expectations. The
three projections are detailed below:
1/   UNIDO Draft Worldwide Study of the Iron and Steel Industry 1975-2000
(December 1976).
2/   International Prices for Rolled Steel Products, Report commissioned
by the Bank, by Mrs. Caroline Doggart (June 1977).
3/   IJsing for specific groups of countries specific growth rates of
steel consumption intermediate between those of the 1977 Bank study
and Case A above.

4.04      A forecast of world steel production has been established by compar-
ing data from different sources (IISI, 1977 World Bank study, UNIDO, AISI 1/
and various project feasibility studies), and by making various corrections
regarding capacity utilization, probable delays in start-up of new plants,
and export patterns. In particular, production from plants in LDCs has
been discounted in 1980 and 1985 by 10% and 15% respectively below announced
production capacity, to account for longer than expected implementation delays
and slower than foreseen learning curves in new plants. A likely pattern of
crude steel production, corresponding to the Base Case of steel demand, would
look as follows:

The country by country production forecasts corresponding to the summary
table above are detailed in Annexes 4-1 to 4-5 inclusive. Total production
in Market Economies is projected at 514 million tons of crude steel in 1980
and 617 million tons in 1985. Net exports to CPEs are estimated to be about
10 million tons 1/ during the eighties. The resulting steel production
available for consumption in the Market Economies corresponds to the "Base
Case" demand forecast of para. 4.03.
B.   The Supply of Iron Ore
4.05       During recent months, documentation on iron ore developments
has been compiled on a country-by-country basis, in order to establish the
degree of certainty with which additional iron-ore capacity is likely to be
forthcoming. The following categories of capacity additions, with their
varying degrees of certainty, have been differentiated:
(i) expansions and new projects currently under implementation,
to be completed prior to 1981;
(ii) other expansions and new projects which are firmly planned
to come on stream by 1981;
1/   The forecast of the Japan Iron and Steel Exporters Association foresees
continued steel imports into the CPEs. Net imports of steel by the CPEs
reached 10.7 million tons in 1975.



- 23 -
(iii)  planned increases in mining capacity to be completed during
1983-85 through expansions of existing and new mines; and
(iv)  possible increases in mining capacity by 1985, through
expansions of existing ancl new mines, the implementation
of whicti is not yet assured.
4.06      Production estimates under categories (i) and (ii) can be forecast
fairly reliably, since they generally relate to firmly committed capacity ex-
pansions. On the other hand, forecasts for the period 1983 to 1985 (catego-
ries (iii) and (iv)) are less reliable. Many projects, though well developed
on the drawing board, are not yet firmly planned, and will tend to slip if
market expectations are not forthcoming.  The total production of all mines
which could be operative by 1985 should therefore be considered a "possible"
maximum. Furthermore, the production of all new projects cannot entirely be
treated as incremental, since some of these projects replace existing mines.
To take these factors into account (as well as realistie capacity utilization
sites) nominal capacities have been discounted by 10% in the projections of
available production given here.
4.07      The supply of iron ore worldwide is essentially dominated by the
seaborne iron ore trade. Available seaborne iron ore exports consist of net
exports of iron ore-producing countries, calculated as the total iron ore pro-
duction minus internal requirements. Annexes 4-1 and 4-2 contain detailed
forecasts of seaborne iron ore supply from major export areas. In these
forecasts, the portion of ore production not available for exports i.e.
required for the domestic steel industry, has been estimated on the basis
of the Base Case steel production forecast of para. 4.03. The resulting
projected seaborne iron ore supply is summarized below:

C.   The Demand for Iron Ore
4.08       Total iron ore requirements can be derived from steel production
forecasts. However, the ratio of iron ore to crude steel varies with such
factors as Fe content and the use of scrap as a source of additional iron
units. Such factors have been examined on a country-by-country basis. The
iron ore/crude steel ratio for Japan, the EEC and other countries where the
conventional blast furnace is the major route for steel making, was assumed
to be 1.2, which corresponds to an average iron-ore grade of 56% Fe. Steel
producers with existing or future direct reduction capacities are projected
to use a factor of 1.5 for the conversion of iron ore to sponge iron. On the
other hand, the actual average ore/crude steel ratio for the US in the 1970s
has been only 1.07, which reflects the high use of scrap in that country.
4.09      The demand for seaborne iron ore in major steel producing countries
(Annex 4-3) is, of course, also determined by domestic iron ore production, 1/
particularly in the US. Since 1950, US domestic ore supplies have steadily
decreased, to the benefit of imported ores. Although reserves are available
to cover the entire US demand in the foreseeable future, benefication of
taconite iron ore resources is expensive. Whether the US mining companies,
and the steel companies who operate many captive mines, are willing or able
to commit substantial additional financial resources to taconite mining and
expensive benefication (pelletizing) plants remains open to question. For
the purposes of this study, it has been conservatively assumed that the US
will not allow imports above the 1965-75 average, which means a domestic
iron ore production of no less than 70% of their total requirements.
4.10      Another important domestic market exists in France, where the
Lorraine region produces about 50 million tons of ore annually. However, all
market studies consulted indicate that this region will produce increasingly
less in the future because of: (i) the low grade and high phosphorus content
of the ore; (ii) ever-increasing mining costs as the mines get deeper; and
(iii) rail transportation costs to inland steel plants, which are increasingly
uncompetitive with ocean freight costs to coastal steel mills. Although at
least a partial phase-out of the Lorraine iron ore mines will be inevitable,
the analysis in this report assumes that for socio/political reasons only a
slight reduction in the volume of domestic iron ore volume supply will occur
through 1985.
4.11      The demand forecast for seaborne iron ore in other industrialized
countries, and steel producing LDCs which are not iron ore exporters, are
detailed in Annexes 4-4 and 4-5. The total demand for seaborne iron ore
corresponding to the three cases of world steel demand/production detailed
above, is projected below:
1/   Recent market studies of SNIM, IRSID, CVRD and Ecole des Mines (Paris)
have been used to estimate domestic iron ore supply.

/a   Cases of world steel demand described in para 4.03.
While the major steel producing countries (US, Japan and the EEC) will continue
to dominate world iron ore demand in the foreseeable future, other markets, par-
ticularly in LDCs, will grow faster, albeit from a very low base. Thus, the
share of the seaborne trade in iron ore going to the major steel producing coun-
tries is expected to shrink from 90-95% in the mid-70s, to about 80% by 1985.
At the same time, demand for seaborne iron ore in developing countries is pro-
jected to increase from less than 5 million tons per annum in the mid-70s, to
about 15 million tons in 1980 and 43-53 million tons in 1985. In addition,
recently initiated exports to CPEs are expected to grow, tespecially to main-
land China.

4.13      The supply/demand base case for seaborne iron ore shows in a rela-
tively small oversupply in both 1980 and 1985. But the 12 million tons of
excess iron ore in 1980 could easily diminish, or entirely disappear, if:
(i) US domestic production turns out to be lower than assumed, because of
insufficient investments in mine expansions or new mines in the near future;
(ii) production of low-grade ore in Europe is further decreased due to dec-
lining grades and increasing operating costs; (iii) ore to steel conversion
ratios in LDCs are worse than assumed, because of less efficient operations
than those of traditional steel producers; and (iv) the USSR production
available for export to other CPEs is lower, due to emerging problems of lower
grades, deeper pits and exhaustion of reserves, particularly at mines located
near existing steel centers (Ural, Krivoi-Rog). On the other hand, should
the iron ore supply become potentially tight due to one, or a combination, of
the above factors, it can reasonably be assumed that capacity utilization at
existing mines could be increased, at least over the short term, so that a
supply/demand balance would be forthcoming without necessitating additional
investments.
4.14      As indicated, the supply/demand balance for 1985 could turn out
to be tight. In practice, however, the projected shortfall of iron ore sup-
ply, as derived under cases A and B, is unlikely to occur as existing mines
have sufficient flexibility to rapidly expand production temporarily. Also,
it can be assumed that there would be some advance warning of such strong
demand for iron ore, and that this would, in the first instance, spur rela-
tively cheap and quick expansions in mining capacity in the period 1980-85.
The overall effect is expected to be a fairly balanced supply/demand situation
through the mid-1980s, with the possibility of oversupply developing once more
towards the end of the period 1985-90, when new mine investments, such as
Carajas in Brazil, will start production. It should also be noted that the
Guelbs Project should not experience substantial marketing problems, since the
increment in iron-ore supply which the project will introduce on to the world
market is rather small (3-4 million tpy, or less than 1% of total net exports).
E.   Pricing of Iron Ore
1.   International Prices
4.15      Like most major commodities, iron ore prices fluctuate between high
and low cycles of about five years. Although many major cornmodities have
gained in real terms over the past 25-years, iron ore prices have remained
generally constant. Thus iron ore prices of the late 1950s compare to those
of the late 1960's and, although abnormally high prices were experienced in
1974 and 1975, prices are now back on the flat trend line that has prevailed
throughout the past 25 years.
4.16      World market prices for iron ore are generally quoted CIF Rotterdam,
and are calculated on the basis of iron units contained. Price differences
are related to the types of ore, which are generally categorized as fines,
run-of-mine (R-0-M), lumpy, and pellets. Historical Rotterdam prices have
been as follows:

Sinter feed, such as the concentrates to be produced by the Guelbs, would
generally fall under "Fines." However, since sufficient lumpy high-grade
ores and run-of-mine material are increasingly hard to come by, fine ore
with a predictable granularity, such as the Guelbs concentrates, is likely to
be increasingly used as a replacement. This process of (gradual) replacement
is expected to be accompanied by an increase in prices for "Fines," but the
price forecast presented in this report ignores such a possibility.
4.17      Since most of the seaborne-traded iron ores are similar in their
respective grade categories, FOB prices tend to be comparable as well. What
then becomes important are the freight rates.  These fluctuate greatly but
also clearly favor ores close to major markets, such as Mauritanian ores for
Western Europe, as indicated in the following table.

2.   Prices for the Kedia and Guelbs Ores
4.18      Total production costs (inclusive of depreciation and financial
charges) and returns on equity for existing efficient mining operations are
important yardsticks for future price levels, as it can be assumed that sales
prices will generally allow reasonable returns to efficient producers over
the longer term. The following are indicative costs for some major existing
mines:

/a   Adjusted for pellet feed.
/b   Break-even cost.
4.19      CIF costs (in 1977 terms) of some major new iron ore projects
are estimated to be the following: US$15/ton for Mt. Nimba; US$16/ton for
Mt. Klahoyo, and about US$17/ton for Carajas--all expected to come on stream
by 1985, or somewhat later. This would compare to a projected average of
US$15/ton (mix of Kedia and Guelbs products) in 1983, and US$14/ton in 1991,
for Guelbs concentrates, also in 1977 terms . As shown in the above table,
the competitiveness of Kedia/Guelbs material is further enhanced by a freight
advantage in the European market, over the Australian, Brazilian and other
West African producers. This plays an important role in a buyer's market
situation such as exists at present, and such as is expected to redevelop in
the late 1980s.
4.20      For the purposes of financial projections, the FOB Nouadhibou price
in 1977, of US$15.2/ton, has been taken as a base, around which the actual
sales price for Kedia ore is expected to fluctuate year-by-year, according
to the projected market cycles (para. 4.15). After a drop in 1978 and 1979
due to poor short-term prospects and to the high silica content of the ore
which SNIM is marketing at the requests of its clients, prices have been
assumed to gradually recover and again to reach the 1977 level of US$15.2/ton
in constant 1977 terms in 1982. In line with the projected balanced supply
and demand situation after 1981, prices have been assumed to rise to pre-1977
levels (in constant terms) in the 1984-85 period. Thereafter, they would
gradually decline again during the next low cycle. By 1990/91, prices are
assumed to have recovered to the 1981 levels. The resulting price variations
are as follows:

4.21       For the Guelbs ore, a similar pattern of price changes has been
retained, but around a base price of US$16.9/ton in constant 1977 terms. This
price is about 10% higher than that of the Kedia ores because of a higher Fe
content (65% instead of an average of 55% for Kedia). The Guelbs ore is also
likely to command an additional premium in view of the magnetic characteris-
tics of two-thirds of the output. This, however, has not been taken into
account.
4.22       It should be noted that, with the iron ore prices as forecast
above, new mines such as Mt. Klahoyo and Carajas with their projected higher
FOB costs, might be expected to be financially marginal. ODn the other hand,
this could perhaps indicate that a real increase in prices ought to be forth-
coming after 1990, once a larger proportion of these new, more expensive, iron
ore mines are in operation, requiring higher prices to achieve a reasonable
operating profit.

4.23      Laboratory testing of the Guelbs ore qualities, magnetite and
hematite has been completed. In gerneral, the results show that Guelbs sinter,
when mixed 20:80 with a known, accepted sinter base feed, will have the
following results in blast furnace operations:
(i) increase productivity;
(ii) decrease overall fuel consuumption; and
(iii)  slightly increase the mechanical resistance of the
sinter.
The table on page 30 summarizes the laboratory test findings carried out with
magnetite ore in Japan, in order to determine the sinter efficiency of the
ore.

Similarly, commercial tests in Europe demonstrated that a 20% to 30% replacement
of various feeds (such as Morro Agudo base Feed, Venezuelan fines, and normal
Cockeril base feed) with each of the Guelbs qualities brought about productivity
gains in the blast furnace of up to 11% (with an average of 6.2%), and fuel
savings of up to 6.6% (with an average of 4.9%). This confirms that the
Guelbs material is a prime sinter feed, which permits a reduction of sinter
costs when mixed with various well-known European and Japanese base feeds.
2.   Future Sinter Demand
4.24      The cost of coke and iron units constitutes, on average, 80 to 85%
of the production cost of iron making. For this reason great efforts are
being made to decrease these cost items. A reduction in the cost of coke may
perhaps be achieved in the long run by way of "form coke", which is a blend of
different coals of poor, or non-coking quality, treated to form a high-quality
coke briquette. However, while several techniques exist to produce form coke,
this has not yet resulted in any substantial cost savings. A major concern
of the iron and steel industry is, therefore, to optimize coke and iron unit
consumption, as well as general blast furnace productivity. Competition in
this respect between the various iron ore feeds, such as pellets, lumpy ores,
natural fines, and concentrates, is thus likely to become more severe in the
future. A premium demand may therefore be assumed for: (i) a high iron con-
tent feed; (ii) a feed with high thermal efficiency, to minimize fuel and
reductants consumption; and (iii) good physical resistivity in the blast
furnace, for optimal productivity.
4.25      In terms of iron units, pellets or sinter feed concentrates are
normally of equally high grade. The advantage of sinter, however, lies
in the fact that it can be self-fluxing, thus reducing coke consumption,
whilst pellets can only be made self-fluxing at additional cost, and are not
suitable for transportation thereafter. A recent SOFRESID study indicates
that, theoretically, cost savings of US$8 per ton of pig iron could be achieved



- 31 -
by using 100% sinter in the feed, instead of 100% pellets. This is primarily
due to: (i) savings in the grinding required for pellets; (ii) smaller
initial capital outlays; and (iii) overall reduction in thermal requirements.
4.26      In addition, the SOFRESID comparison does not take into account
the fact that the coking plants attached to normal blast furnace (BF) oper-
ations in Europe and Japan produce coke breeze of the order of 60 kg per ton
of pig iron. This coke breeze - which can seldom be sold, even at low prices
--is recycled into the sinter strand, and thereby results in an added thermic
benefit not found with the pellet route. In terms of mechanical properties,
the pellet is perhaps superior to the finer sinter, but only to a very limited
extent.
4.27      It has become general practice in the EEC and Japan to feed the
blast furnace with a charge of agglomerated feeds (sinter and pellets) varying
from a minimum of 60% to a maximum of 100%. Within these parameters, the
blast furnace operator accepts no more than 20% (acid) pellets and 20% graded
ore (lumps). The steady historical growth of the use of agglomerated feeds,
at the expense of natural lumpy ores and fines, is illustrated below:

4.28      The present tendency in Europe and Japan is to use increasingly
larger percentages of self-fluxing sinter in the blast furnace (at least 70%).
The scarcity of natural high-grade :Lumpy ores of the non-decrepitating kind
will result in a growing use of agglomerated feeds as a substitute. Within
this framework, however, pellets will be used in BF operations only as far as
necessary, as pellets are more expensive and their acidity poses problems for
the burden preparation. The growth of pellet use is expected to level off in



- 32 -
both Japan and the EEC, perhaps not only for cost reasons, but also due to
the fact that sintering installations with sufficient capacity to handle feed
requirements corresponding to the projected growth of steel production until
the mid-80s are already available. This will enhance the market prospects of
good sinter feed.
3.   Conclusion
4.29      The Kedia hematite ores, in the form of both natural fines and
lumpy material, constitute well-established sinter and direct BF feeds in
Europe and, more recently, in Japan. This production will be gradually
replaced by the Guelbs self-fluxing magnetic sinter feed, which shows com-
parable, if not superior, properties when compared to currently used European
and Japanese ore feeds in terms of: (i) fuel savings on the sinter strand;
and (ii) productivity gains in the BF. As it is now foreseeable that the
demand for prime sinter will grow in the EEC and Japan, the relative dis-
advantage for COMINOR of marketing a new product should be more than com-
pensated for by the good characteristics of the Guelbs concentrates.  SNIM's
marketing efforts will be facilitated by the good relationship SNIM has
maintained with its traditional clients, particularly the reputation for
reliability which SNIM enjoys among iron ore producers.  Letters of intent
or expression of interest covering more than 50% of SNIM's production have
already been obtained, and the Government has agreed not to authorize any
entity other than SNIM to market SNIM's products.
G.   Local Sales
4.30      Samia, a Mauritanian company with a participation of KFTCIC, is
currently considering the possibility of erecting a pellet plant of about 2
million tpy capacity to supply Quatar, Iraq and, at a later date, Saudi Arabia
with Direct Reduction (DR) pellets. This plant has been engineered to use
Guelbs magnetite as feed. However, since Samia's ore requirements would
represent a large proportion of the Guelbs magnetite production the feed
requirement of the pellet plant might affect the marketing of SNIM's ore. It
has been recommended by the Bank that discussions should be held between
Samia, SNIM and Kobe Steel who has engineered the plant and who would be in
charge of the construction, to ensure coordination with SNIM's marketing
strategy. In any event, it has been agreed with the Government and SNIM that
SNIM will always sell its ore at world market prices and for convertible
foreign exchange and that it will not enter into any contract or marketing
arrangement which would preclude SNIM from maximizing its sales revenues and
its profits.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objective
5.01      The Guelbs project consists of opening new mines and constructing
beneficiation facilities, in order to replace the declining production of
the current Kedia ore bodies, which will be exhausted by 1991. The project



- 33 -
will be implemented in two phases, and will increase production capacity from
11.5 million tons to about 14 million tons per year by 1984.  hne first phase
will bring a new ore body, El Rhein (located 22 km northeast of Zouerate),
into production in 1983.  This ore bcdy is of a lower grade than that of the
Kedia Mountain and has different physical characteristics. Major capital
expenditures are therefore required, in the form of beneficiation facilities,
in order to upgrade the ore to acceptable market levels. The second phase
will open mines at Oum Arwagen (12 kmi east of El Rhein). These arze to come
into production in 1988, to replace the final ores from Kedia. The granting
of the mining concession for both El Rhein and Oum Arwagen is a condition of
loan effectiveness. This report deals primarily with the first phase.
B.   Technical Description
5.02      The geology of the region has undergone severe movements of the
earth's crust. The resultant formations have been attacked by erosion and
reduced to a peneplain from which a ifew "Guelbs" (mountain remnlants) and
"Kedias" (mountain chains) still emerge. These remnants are often iron-
bearing. In the case of the Kedia mountains near Zouerate, the concentra-
tion of iron is as high as 55 to 65% Fe, which has given rise to the present
iron ore operations. The Guelbs on the other hand, contain a lower concen-
tration of iron, averaging about 30 to 40% Fe.
5.03      The El Rhein deposit is triangular in shape, extending 1,600 m in a
north-south direction, with the peak of the triangle to the south. The whole
structure forms a syncline, the axis of which dives 300 to the north.  The
deposit continues below the plain where, in fact, most of the ore reserves are
located. Oum Arwagen is a mountain chain of 14 km in length. Only a small
part of this area has been drilled out and added to the ore reserve of the
project (Map IBRD 13584 page 13).
5.04      Proven ore reserves at El Rhein and Oum Arwagen are 285 and 101
million tons, respectively.  To this must be added the remaining 95 million
ton reserve of the Kedia, to yield a total proven reserve inventory of 481
million tons. Probable extensions of these ore bodies could add another 180
million tons. Furthermore, in the general area of Zouerate, more than a dozen
mineralized Guelbs are known to exist, indicating a substantial long-run
potential.
5.05      The overall mineralogy of the Guelbs ore is simple.  It consists
of a facies of coarse and fine magnetite, as well as coarsc and fine hematite
(referred to by SNIM as oxidised ore), with a ratio between the two of 2:1
respectively. The mean mining grade has been established as being about 38%
Fe. The mineralogical studies undertaken to establish the first parameters
for the pilot plant flow sheet were extensive. During the period 1971 through
1975, both laboratory-type and semi-industrial tests, were carried out in
France, the US, the UK, Canada, Germany and Japan. Due to the lack of ex-
tensive water resources at the prospective mining site, a dry milling process
has been chosen for which successful tests were obtained from Aerofall Mills
Ltd of Canada. Also, Swedish and French tests established that lc>w-intensity,
magnetic separators were probably the best route toward developing a successful
flow sheet.



- 34 -
5.06      To supplement the earlier laboratory work, a pilot plant was erected
in Zouerate in June 1974, to: (i) separately treat ail major ore types; (ii)
determine the permissible mixtures between magnetic and oxidized ores, so as
to arrive at an optimum recovery level, and (iii) produce sufficient concen-
trates for a testing campaign in Europe and Japan, in order to ascertain the
suitability of Guelbs sinter feed for the blast furnace (para. 4.23).
5.07      Mining at El Rhein, as in the existing Kedia operations, will be done
in open pits, using 9-inch drills for blast hole preparation, 8 to 13 cubic
yard shovels for loading, and 85 to 120-ton dump trucks for dispensing the ore
into the primary crusher. The entire mining machinery will work in three
eight-hour shifts, 18 shifts per week, assuming a 300-day per year work
cycle. The benches will be 15 m high. The design of the final pit is based
on an optimized computer design, given the economic cut-off point of 28%
Fe, and a mean 38% Fe of crude ore. The final pit slope has been somewhat
arbitrarily fixed at 500, which appears conservative, as the slopes at Kedia
are considerably steeper. The waste to ore ratio is 2:1. Mining operations
at Oum Arwagen (Phase 2) are identical, with the exception that the bench
height will be 12 m, and the cut-off grade somewhat lower, at 26% Fe, due
to a slightly lower waste to ore ratio.
5.08      Primary crushing will be done at the El Rhein crushing yard to pro-
vide greater flexibility of operation. Ore from the Oum Arwagen mine will
be loaded on railwagons at several loading points (in order to cut down on
expensive truck haulage), and brought to the primary crusher at El Rhein.
Concentrates from the El Rhein plant will be transported to F'Derik, on a new
45 km railway line linking the new operation to the existing rail system.
5.09      SOCOMINE first proposed magnetic dry pre-concentration at the El
Rhein plant, to be followed by wet concentration near Nouadhibou. After
considerable trials, they now propose a new flow sheet (TSR 1/), which essen-
tially involves a finer grinding of the preconcentrate (to 400 microns) at
the mine, and eliminates the proposed beneficiation at the port. This TSR
alternative results in satisfactory metal recoveries of 82% and a Fe content
of about 65%. This new flowsheet results in: : (i) savings in transport;
(ii) having all treatment facilities at one location for better control; and
(iii) removal of difficulties connected with treating concentrates with
seawater (contamination, corrosion). The flow sheet for the ore concentration/
beneficiation is shown on the page 36 (Chart 5-1). The crushed ore (200 mm)
is homogenized at the mine dump, and conveyed to the semi-autogenous mill.
The dry dust overflow is caught in the baghouse and discharged to the tailings
area. The mill discharge and classifier underflow are sent through a 1.6 mm
mesh screen, with the underflow being directed to the magnetic separators.
The overflow is sent to the aerofall mill. The preconcentrates, or middling
products of the oxide are ground and treated in the oxide plant and crushed to
400 micron. Fine concentrates are also ground and treated in the oxide plant.
Two products are recovered: (i) magnetic concentrates; and (ii) oxidized

concentrates. They are conveyed to load-out bins to be transferred to the ore
wagons. A general layout of the El Rhein industrial plant is given in Chart
5-2. _/
5.10      The bulk of the new power will be consumed by the grinding (aerofall
mills) operation, and the benefication plant. In addition, power must be gen-
erated for the electric shovels, for workshops and services and for the town-
ship. Since the generator station at Zouerate is worn out and cannot be
expected to supply adequate reliable power, a new power station with asso-
ciated standby facilities is required. Peak power during the first phase will
be 34 IW. This will increase to 63 MW at the beginning of the second phase.
5.11      A new road linking Zouerate with El Rhein will be constructed during
Phase 1. Due to the excellent topographical conditions, very little embank-
ment will be necessary. The access rcad from El Rhein to Oum Arwagen will not
be constructed until Phase 2. This will be 11.5 km long, and of more rudi-
mentary design, in line with requirements of normal mining traffic.
5.12      An additional 528 housing units will be necessary in the mining
town of Zouerate, in order to accommocLate the additional manpower needed for
the project.
5.13      During Phase 1 (1979-82), transport requirements will increase to
upwards of 14 million tons of ore per year. This will require three trains
per day in each direction, and will necessitate the purchase of four addi-
tional main locomotives and 293 x 100 ton ore wagons, as well as the con-
struction of additional minor maintenance facilities in Nouadhibou. During
Phase 2 (1986-89), COMINOR will also construct a new single access line
between El Rhein and Oum Arwagen, to be operated by trains of 32 ore wagons,
pulled by one locomotive each. The total additional equipment requirement for
this line will be 4 diesel electric locomotives, and 159 x 77 tons ore wagons
with rotating couplings and side openings for lateral tipping. Maintenance
facilities at Zouerate will remain unchanged. Total additional personnel re-
quirements will be 114 employees for El Rhein/Oum Arwagen, and 162 employees
for the main line.
5.14      The existing port handling and loading system described in para.
3.16 and Chart 3-4 will be retained. Nevertheless, in order to bring the
loading capacity up to 14 million tons per year, a number of modifications
will be made. Reclaiming facilities will be strengthened by adding a crawler-
mounted bucket wheel, and the capacity of the shiploading conveyor line will
be upgraded by 40%. The main acquisition, however, will be a new shiploader,
as the old one, now rated at 5,200 tph, has already undergone several modifi-
cations and had to be partially rebuilt after a serious accident in 1973.
The new shiploader, with a longer boom length of 25 m and a loading capacity
of 7,500 tph, will give the necessary capacity, whilst the old equipment will
be used as standby. If the pellet plant project (para. 4.30) were to be
1/   The second half of the plant, designated as line B, will be needed for
the second phase only, which starts up in 1988.

implemented, the loading angle of the shiploader would have to be modified,
which should not pose any technical problems. In any event, this will be
the only modification required for the totality of SNIM's industrial plant
at Nouadhibou.
C.   Water
5.15      The supply of water for social as well as industrial purposes
is of great importance in the eastern Sahara. At present, Nouadhibou is
supplied with water by pipeline from a strong aquifer at Boulanouar, which is
located some 80 km to the east of the railway line. Zouerate, on the other
hand, gets its water from a number of producing wells along the Kedia moun-
tains. These tap fossil, and, to a lesser extent, renewable water resources.
An adequate and continuous drilling program will be necessary in order to
develop the requisite water resources during the Guelbs exploitation period.
While the industrial use of water will not have to be appreciably increased,
the increase in manpower will mean a higher overall water consumption. Thus,
the total water consumption of 850,000 cubic meters (cum) in 1977 is projected
to increase as follows:
Guelbs Water Requirements
(In cum Per Year)
Uses                         Supply
Social   Industrial    Total        Sweet    Brackish
Phase 1         775,000   332,000    1,107,000   857,000   250,000
Phase 2         869,000   372,000    1,241,000   991,000   250,000
5.16      Such a detailed drilling program has already been initiated, and the
following potential sources of water supply are currently under development or
exploration: (i) the north border of the Kedia mountains - under production;
(ii) the Breccia zone of d'Idjill - one promising, new operating well; (iii)
the border of the Taoudeni Basin near the Kedia - contains both sweet and
brackish water; and (iv) the Boulanouar aquifer - where new wells will be
developed, and water wagons could supply Zouerate in case of an extremely hot
year. Currently proven reserves will cover the Guelbs operation's require-
ments for a period of 30 years. Additional reserves will, however, have to
be developed thereafter. The Company will furnish the Bank with annual
reports on the status of water reserves and prospecting efforts.
D.   Ecology
5.17      The pollution generated by COMINOR's iron ore operations is not
significant. Dust generation at the port can be at times severe, but prevail-
ing winds tend to blow the dust towards the open sea. Dust generation at the
crusher station at Rouessa has, however, been observed to be very severe
whenever the waterspraying system is out of order. There is therefore a
covenant in the loan agreement to the effect that COMINOR will continue to
operate its installations with due regard to ecological and environmental
safety standards, and to carry out a long-term study on the effects of dust



- 39 -
inhalation by the workers in order to determine whether adequate protection
exists. The Company will report annually to the Bank on dust levels, and
if needed, suitable equipment will be installed to protect the workers.
VI. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      Total financing required for Phase 1 of the Guelbs project is
estimated at US$500.7 million equivalent, of which US$456.1 million is in
foreign exchange, as shown below. A more detailed breakdown of capital costs

In addition to the above, approximately IJS$10 million 1/ was expended over the
period 1970-77, in geological investigations, pilot plant testing, feasibility
studies, and preliminary engineering studies.
6.02      The equipment costs used here have been derived from estimates
prepared by SOCOMINE, with the assistance of SNIM. The original estimates
were prepared in early 1976, and were updated in late 1977 on the basis of
mid-1977 quotations or SNIM's current replacement costs for its ongoing
operations. Cost estimates for mining and other equipment have been pre-
pared on the basis of detailed equipment lists and are considered adequate.
Those for civil works, transportation and erection are estimates based on
contract prices for the Segazou expansion of the Kedia deposit, or on the
cost of other works recently or currently carried out by SNIM. They, also,
are considered reliable. It should be noted that the foundation character-
istics are well known, and that soil conditions for the port components may
readily be established since these works are a simple extension of the exist-
ing installations. Construction costs for the railway extension are estimated
on the basis of COMINOR's ongoing experience in track replacement, and recent
realignment works of some sections of the main line.
6.03      The project will be totally exempt from import duties.  Freight
estimates, including transport from the port of Nouadhibou to Zouerate, are
based on COMINOR's current experience, and amount to about 10% of the FOB
value for mining equipment, 4% for other equipment, and 15% for structural
steel and railway stock. Engineering, procurement and project management have
been estimated separately for the various project components, at 15% of the
total cost of the beneficiation plant, 6 to 10% for other fixed plant and
infrastructure, and 3% for mining equipment and railway stock. Physical con-
tingencies amount to 15% for the beneficiation plant, material handling and
storage and power plants, 10% for the port installation, and 3% for the other
project components. In view of the fact that the design and specifications of
the different project components are already well defined, and that the overall
working conditions are very familiar to both SNIM and SOCOMINE, these physical
contingencies--amounting to a total of about 10% of base costs--are considered
reasonable. Price contingencies have been estimated on the basis of average
escalation rates of 8% per annum for 1977-79, and 7% thereafter. An additional
extraordinary contingency of US$20 million (4.4% of total project cost) has,
however, been added to reflect the particular problems which may affect the
implementation of this project. Total contingencies are, therefore, estimated
at US$137.7 million, or 27% of total project costs. These are not out of line
with total contingencies on similar mining projects in other countries.
6.04      Incremental working capital requirements--estimated at US$33.5
million--have been calculated on the basis of COMINOR's historical needs,
and the anticipated operating schedule. Detailed calculations are provided
in Annex 6-2.
1/   SNTM has treated these as sunk costs for the purpose of future investment
decisions. In the financial statements they have either been charged
off during the year of expenditure, or capitalized (and are in the
process of being amortized), according to their potential impact on
future operations.

6.05      For Phase 2 of the Guelbs, to be constructed over the period
1986-89, capital costs have been estimated on the same basis. The total
estimate amounts to US$436.9 million in current terms, and is detailed below:

In addition, during the period of transition between Phases 1 and 2, SNIM
will purchase about US$36.8 million of additional mining equipment, in order
to handle the large amounts of overburden that will have to be cleared for
mining to evolve from hill into pit exploitation.
6.06      Based on the capital cost estimates presented above, the total
fixed asset cost (i.e. base cost plus physical contingencies) for Phases 1
and 2 would be approximately US$517 million in mid-1977 terms. This repre-
sents a cost per annual ton of about US$37 which, as shown below, compares
favorably with other iron ore projects under construction, or recently
completed):

The Guelbs project cost is probably lower than that of the other projects
because of the limited infrastructure required. If a new railroad and port
were needed, and particularly if a new greenfield pellet plant was essential,
the above cost would be increased by 100-150%.
B.   Financing Plan for Phase 1
6.07      The total financing required for Phase 1, of US$500.7 million, will
be provided by equity and loans from foreign sources, and by SNIM/COMINOR's
cash generation, as shown below:

6.08      The proposed foreign contributions, amounting to US$458 million
(or 91% of financing requirements), would cover 100% of the foreign exchange
cost of the project. However, SNIM's financial effort will still have to
be substantial, as during the period 1979-82 SNIM will have to expend
some US$38.6 million on new investments and replacements for the Kedia



- 43 -
operation, as well as repay about US$48 million of existing debt, 1/ mostly
in foreign exchange. Annex 6-3 gives a year by year breakdown of SNIM's total
investment expenditures. COMINOR's internal cash generation during this
period is therefore, critical to the successful financing of the project.
Equity financing will amount to US$120 million, which is expected to result
in a debt/equity ratio of 50:50 at the SNIM consolidated level, at the end of
construction of Phase 1.
6.09       The capital increase of US$120 million will be subscribed by the
KFTCIC, ARMICO, the Iraqi Government, BRPM of Morocco and the Islamic Develop-
ment Bank. About US$77 million comprised of 25% of the nominal price of the
shares newly issued plus the capital contributed as a premium in excess of par
value is expected to be paid in very shortly. The remaining capital will be
paid in, according to the project's expected requirement timetable. The
submission to the Bank of an acceptable calendar is a condition of loan
effectiveness. The share capital of the foreign shareholders will represent
28% of SNIM's recently reconstituted capital.
6.10       The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million equivalent, will be made
directly to SNIM for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the prevailing
interest rate (7.9% p.a. at present), plus a guarantee fee (2.1% p.a.) payable
to the Government of Mauritania, to bring SNIM's total financing charges to
10% p.a. Such a Bank loan would cover 13% of the project's foreign exchange
cost. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by SNIM.
6.11       The terms and conditions of the other foreign loans are detailed
in Annex 6-4. The loans of the Saudi Fund and the OPEC Special Fund are made
directly to the Government, which will relend them to SNIM. The Kuwait Fund,
AFESD and the Abu Dhabi Fund will lend directly to SNIM. The weighted average
interest rate is about 3.3%, with an average maturity of 17 years, including
over 4 years of grace. The EIB loan will be made directly to SNIM, at an
interest rate of between 5.25% and 6% p.a., with an associated maturity of
15 years (including 5 years of grace). The Caisse Centrale loan will also
be made directly to SNIM, and will consist of a blend of a direct loan and
suppliers' credits, guaranteed by the French Government, at an average
interest rate of 9% p.a. for an average period of about 15 years, includ-
ing 3 years of grace. The Japanese DECF contribution will be a loan of Yen
36 billion (US$16 million equivalent) to SNIM at 4%, for 25 years, including
7 years of grace. Finally, the African Development Bank loan will consist of
two loans of US$6 million each, both to be made to the Government, at 8% p.a.
for 15 years, including 5 years of grace. In the financial projections it
has been assumed that all of the above loans which are to be made to the
Government will be onlent to SNIM in foreign exchange and under the same
terms. Effectiveness of foreign loans totalling at least 80% of the total
external loans financing for the project and satisfactory assurance that the
loans representing the remaining 20% will be forthcoming will be a condition
of loan effectiveness.
1/   This does not include US$30 million of outstanding compensation payments
due to the former shareholders of MIFERMA, since assumption of this
liability by the Government has been confirmed.



- 44 -
6.12      US$20 million of additional equity (para. 6.03) has been added to
the basic financing, as a minimum contingency to provide a measure of security
against the extraordinary risks of this project. In addition, it must be
considered possible that slippage and/or cost overruns could increase the
financing requirement substantially, even though the estimates presented
above (para 6.01) are thought to be reasonable and the implementation schedule
(para 7.05) attainable. In similar projects elsewhere, financially strong
shareholders have been asked to provide unlimited overrun commitments or,
where unlimited commitments have not been forthcoming, the committed overrun
financing has been at least 30-40% of the base cost. In this case, however,
it is proposed only that the Government provide a full project completion
guarantee. There is, nonetheless, thought to be satisfactory assurance of
adequate financing for project completion since (i) SNIM's consolidated cash
surplus should amount to over US$44 million by 1981 and US$69 million by 1982
(para. 8.18); (ii) the Company's debt:equity ratio is not expected to fall
below 50:50 or its current ratio below 2:1 after 1981, which should permit the
Company to raise additional long-term debt (estimated at up to US$30 million)
should the bank deem such borrowings appropriate; and (iii) the commitment of
certain of the shareholders and of the colenders to the project and to
Mauritania is such, that even without a formal commitment, they would consider
themselves obligated to maintain the financial viability of SNIM, on which the
Mauritanian economy depends.
6.13    To ensure that SNIM will generate the cash necessary for its contribu-
tion to the project financing and for other recurrent needs, the Government
will grant a reduction in royalties, whereby the export levy on iron ore will
be reduced from 10% of FOB iron ore exports, to an average of 6.5% (as detailed
in para. 8.07), during the construction period of the project. These rates
will however be reviewed on an annual basis in light of the company's actual
financial situation and will need the approval of the Bank (para 8.07). In
addition, in order to further ensure project completion, tihe Goverament bas
agreed to defer SNIM's royalty payments, and so increase the company's retained
earnings, should cost overruns require additional funds (para 8.07).
VII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Organization and Management
7.01      The project organization chart is shown on the following page
(Clhart 7-1). SOCOMINE, a French consulting firm, has been contracted by
SNIM to be responsible for overall design, construction supervision, start-up
and commissioning of the project, and to assist SNIM during the first years of
operation.  Considering the project's size and SOCOMINE's relatively small
manpower of 18 professionals, the consultant and SNIM have been led to seek
assistance from various other well-known French consultant groups, namely
SOFRESID, SGTE (Societe Generale de Techniques et d'Etudes) and FCB (Fives
CaiL, Babcock). In addition, SOCOMINE will utilize the capabilities already
avaîlable within SNIM for preliminary mine development, laying of railroad
tracks, and erecting railroad stations. Specifically, SOCOMINE will sub-
contract to the consultants the following tasks:

(iv)  expediting and inspection - SOFRESID;
(v) scheduling and cost follow-up (partly) - SOFRESID and SGTE; and
(vi)  supervision of construction - COMINOR assisted by SOFRESID and
SGTE.
7.02      Once the go-ahead decision has been taken, the SOCOMINE team will
be attached to the project as full time consultants, and organized as shown
on the following page (Chart 7-2). Although it might appear that SOCOMINE's
manpower base is small, the fact that SOCOMINE'S senior management are all
former MIFERMA managers who were involved in both the implementation and the
subsequent operations of this company, has reassured the Bank that SOCOMINE
will be up to the task. Specifically SOCOMINE has moved decisively to (i)
better distinguish the lines of responsibility between SOCOMINE, SNIM and all
other entities participating in the project implementation; (ii) study and
develop the total manpower requirements and appropriate organization for the
tasks to be performed; (iii) improve the procedures for, and thus speed up,
bid evaluation and procurement; and (iv) better define the methodology and
systems used in the area of scheduling and cost control. The estimated cost
per man-month for SOCOMINE's consultants is US$6,500 and the total cost of
SOCOMINE's services, including the cost of subcontracts to SOFRESID, SGTE and
FCB, will amount to approximately US$6.7 million p.a. In order to guarantee
that the fullest attention is given to the project it has been agreed that
SNIM shall ensure that SOCOMINE will not take on any additional major engage-
ments which might be detrimental to the project implementation.
7.03      SOCOMINE's responsibilities include overall design and layout,
preparation of bid documents and vendors lists, bid evaluation, and contract
preparation, overall control and coordination of equipment supply and erection
at site, and daily planning and coordination. Detailed engineering will be
provided by the consultant firms.  Under the guidance of SOCOMINE, COMINOR's
project group will closely coordinate activities at the construction site.
7.04      Problems which need highly technical know-how will be referred to
an expert committee which will act as a periodic review board. The committee
will consist of Mr. Coursin (senior engineer of SOCOMINE), representatives
of the Institute de Recherche de la Siderurgie (IRSID), and Mineral Services
Incorporated (MSI), and Mr. A. Dor, an independent consultant. All have been
closely involved in the feasibility study of the Guelbs project, particularly
in designing the pilot plant at Zouerate. As the most critical equipment
items in the project are the Aerofall Mills, and as FCB has no experience in
building equipment of the size needed in the concentration plant, detailed
engineering will be checked at regular intervals, and will be subject to

approval by MSI and/or Mr. Dor, as they have both been intimately involved
in the original design of the system for Aerofall Mills in Canada. Adequate
arrangements for the functioning of the expert committee and the extent of
its review/approval responsibilities have been agreed upon. Although relatively
complex, the package of all the above arrangements is expected to result in
adequate project management.
B.   Implementation
7.05       The project management contract between SOCOMINE and SNIM has
already been signed. The foreseen date of completion of all physical work and
delivery is January 1, 1983, which is reasonable. However, the official date
of completion of Phase 1 is the date on which the El Rhein iron ore mine shall
have produced 3.1 million tons of concentrate during a period of 6 months and
is expected to be end 1983. The dates above are imposed by the long construc-
tion and erection time of the Aerofall Mills, and suppose that orders for
this critical item as well as for the generating sets can be placed by early
September 1979. A definitive implementation plan, and detailed critical path
schedule are being worked out by SOCOMINE, and will be presented to the Bank
shortly. A summary schedule is illustrated in Chart 7-3.
C.   Procurement, Disbursement and Allocation of Bank Loan
1.   Procurement
7.06      Procurement for the project will be carried out in accordance with
the rules of the lending agencies, which generally require international com-
petitive bidding (ICB). Preparation of the bid documents is being carried out
by SOCOMINE and the other consultants, who will assist SNIM both in selecting
contractors and in contract negotiations. Procurement has been divided into
18 packages, separating supply of imported equipments from construction work
in Mauritania. These arrangements, previously used by SNIM on other works,
appear best-suited for this kind of project in Mauritariia. A detailed pro-
curement schedule is given in Chart 7-4.
7.07      The Bank loan will finance the following equipment items, all in
foreign exchange and all to be procured under ICB or international shopping
procedures in line with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines: (i) all ore-
handling equipment in the beneficiation plant; (ii) miscellaneous equipment
in the beneficiation plant; (iii) railroad ore wagons to transport ore over
the main line; and (iv) the civil works contract. The proportion of the Bank
loan allocated to the latter has been estimated to cover the total foreign
cost of the contractor's equipment and back-up maintenance personnel. Local
costs will be born by SNIM. International shopping for Bank financed items is
not expected to surpass some US$2.0 million (or about 10% of the total value
of items) under categories (i) and (ii) above. There will be no international
shopping under category (iii); and the list of items to which international
shopping will apply, has been agreed with the Bank. None of the equipment
items in the project are produced locally and, therefore, no local suppliers
will be prequalified for such items on the Bank list. For the civil works

contract there might be a local contractor interested in bidding. However,
because of the large size of the contract, it is likely that the local contrac-
tor would participate through a joint venture with established foreign entre-
prises. Depending on the terms of the venture, it will have to be established,
following Bank guidelines, whether the joint contractors would be entitled to
the normal 7-1/2% preference granted to local contractors in the evaluation of
bids.
7.08      Financing of the railroad ore wagons will be shared between the
OECF (Japan) under untied financing, and the Bank. Since the OECF procure-
ment guidelines require that the bid price, as well as the final contract,
be quoted in Yen, the wagons will be financed in parallel. This may easily be
achieved since the cars are to be procured in several lots (starting in 1979
through 1981), according to a standard design, and the lots can be structured
so as to accommodate the earmarked amoints of the two institutions. The
tentative allocation of procurement packages between the Bank and the other
sources of financing is detailed on the following page.
2.   Allocation of Bank Loan and D)isbursement
7.09      The allocation of the Bank loan will cover the following foreign
exchange items:

Total                                                     60.0
7.10      The financing of interest during construction is justified, as it
relieves Mauritania of the burden of p.aying hard currency (of which it finds
itself desperately short at this time), during project implementation.
7.11      As noted above, the Bank loan is expected to be disbursed against
100% of foreign expenditures, except for the civil works contract should it be
won by a Mauritanian firm, according to the following schedule:

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Methodology Used in Financial Projections
8.01      Separate projections have been made for COMINOR and for the rest
of SNIM. Since COMINOR exports all of its production at prices set in US
dollars, and since all capital and operating costs for the Guelbs project
(which primarily involve imported items in any case) have been estimated in
US$, the financial projections for COMINOR have also been prepared in US$.
The remaining entities comprising SNIM on the other hand, consist primarily
of existing operations, geared largely towards the local market, for which
budgets are therefore prepared by SNIM in local currency terms. Hence, the
corresponding financial projections have also been made in UM. Finally,
consolidated statements for SNIM as a whole have also been generated in UM,
using an exchange rate of US$1.00 = UM 45. The projections have been ex-
pressed in current terms, through the application on mid 1977 prices of an
average rate of inflation of 8% p.a. for 1978-79, and 7% p.a. thereafter.
The main assumptions used in the financial projections are summarized below,
with more details provided in Annex 8-1.
B.   Production Build-up and Sales
8.02      The production build-up assumed for both the Kedia and the Guelbs
ores is based on SNIM's short-term sales forecasts and a recently revised mine
exploitation program prepared by SNIM/SOCOMINE. This assumes a reduction in
ore exports in some years, in line with the market developments projected in
the market chapter of this report. COMINOR's sales, assumed equal to
production, would evolve as follows:

COMINOR's Projected Ore Sales
(Million Tons)
1978   1979   1980   1981  1982   1984   1986   1988   1990
(Actual)
6.5 /a  9.3    10.0   10.7  10.7   14.0   13.0   12.0   13.0
/a   The low sales volume of 6.5 million tons of ore for 1978 results
from both the cumulative impact of inadequate maintenance and
production disruption which were due to guerilla activity in that
year.
These projected sales reflect a cyclical pattern comparable to that experi-
enced historically in the international iron ore market, and include a slow
improvement up to 1980 (due to a gradual recovery of the steel industry
starting in the late seventies), with a simultaneous increase in COMINOR's
production capacity as Phase 1 starts up. This is followed by a high level of
sales between 1983-85 when world market demand and supply are expected to be
in balance. After 1985, however, when many new iron ore mines might possibly
come on stream, another low cycle in the market is projected, with reduced
sales as a consequence.
C.   Operating Costs
8.03      Operating cost projections for the iron ore operation were first
prepared by SNIM/SOCOMINE in 1976, but were revised in mid-1977, and again
updated in early 1979. This updating included a revision of operating costs
of the beneficiation plant and adjustments to the costs of mining, handling
transport and overheads, to take actual 1976-78 data into account. Also,
the detailed budget prepared by SNIM for 1979 was taken into account. In this
context it should be noted that following a general improvement in operations
and cost control in the recent past, combined with some reduction in expatriate
manpower and a general commitment to austerity, some costs are presently lower
in real terms than they have been during the last three years. However,
should there be resumption of Polisario activity, which in late 1977 and the
first half of 1978 had a negative effect particularly on maintenance costs,
operating costs would have to be expected to return to their higher 1978
levels and, more importantly, production and exports could be expected to
drop below projected levels. For the purpose of the projections, it has been
assumed that operations which returned to normal by end 1978 will remain under
such condition.
8.04      Fuel is an important component of COMINOR's operating costs, rep-
resenting 4 to 6% of the total. Currently, SNIM imports fuel through DCPP
(its petroleum products distribution organization) and sells it to COMINOR
at approximately international prices. However, the Government has recently
taken the decision to separate DCPP from SNIM and has allowed SNIM to import
its fuel directly, without having to purchase it from an independent Govern-
ment fuel distribution organization. At the same time, the Government has



- 55 -
agreed not to require SNIM to purchase its fuel from the newly-built refinery
at a price higher than the world market price. Indeed, because of its uneco-
nomical size, the refinery would require a much higher sales price if it is to
be financially viable, and COMINOR would be unfairly handicapped if it were
required to purchase its fuel at such a price in the future.
8.05      Depreciation on existing and new assets has been calculated in
accordance with SNIM's normal accounting practices. This involves straight
line depreciation over a period of 20 years for civil works, 10 to 14 years
for railway stock and facilities, and 3 to 5 years for fixed and mobile equip-
ment respectively. This appears to be excessively rapid in some cases and SNIM
will therefore review its depreciation practices during the course of 1979.
D.   Dividends
8.06      No dividend policy has yet been specified for SNIM, and discussions
between the Mauritanian Government and the new shareholders on the subject
are still on-going. For the purpose of the financial projections, the dis-
tribution of dividends has been assumed equivalent to an annual return of 10%
on all new shares, except during the construction periods for both Phase 1 and
Phase 2. In any event, SNIM will not be allowed to declare or pay dividends
unless (i) certain specific financial ratios are met (para 8.20); and (ii) SNIM
has accumulated the retained earnings necessary to ensure sound financing of
Phase 2 (paras. 8.08 and 8.16).
E.   Royalties
8.07       In recent years COMINOR has not paid income tax, but has been sub-
ject to a royalty of 10% on FOB ore sales instead; while SNIM's other units
have been charged taxes proportional to sales. Under the draft of a Convention
Particuliere, detailing the conditiorLs of establishment and operation of the
reconstituted SNIM, all these charges will be replaced by a single royalty on
ore exports for a period of 20 years. For the period 1978-83 this royalty
will be equal to a certain percentage that increases with the volume of
exports, according to a series of simple formulae. Basically, these imply
a levy of about 5% of FOB value on exports of up to six million tons p.a.,
roughly 5.5-6% on total exports of up to 10 million tons, and 6.5-7.0% on
exports of up to 14 million tons p.a. These rates will, however, be subject
to an annual review carried out in the light of the actual financial situation
of the company and with the approval of the Bank (para 6.13). For the year
1984 and thereafter this will be rep:Laced by a single rcyalty rate of 10% of
FOB value, regardless of sales volume. The Government has, however, agreed
to defer SNIM's royalty obligation in order to enable the company to meet
possible cash shortfalls (para 6.13). SNIM is not subject to import duties
but does pay miscellaneous indirect taxes on goods, personnel and services,
which together amount to roughly 3% of FOB ore export value. The signing of
a Convention Particuliere satisfactory to the Bank between the Government
and SNIM detailing the fiscal provisions mentioned here above as well as
other economic and juridic conditions under which SNIM will operate, is a
condition of loan effectiveness.

F.   Financing of Phase 2
8.08       It is anticipated that Phase 2 of the project will be financed by
US$250 million in new loans, the balance (US$187 million) being derived from
SNIM's cumulated cash surplus. The anticipated composition of these loans is
as follows: (i) US$100 million from international institutions for 14 years,
including 4 years of grace, at an interest rate of 10% p.a.; and (ii) US$150
million of suppliers' credits, bearing an interest of 8% p.a. with reimburse-
ment over 8 years, commencing as of the commissioning of Phase 2.
G.   Other SNIM Units and Head Office
8.09      The financial projections for SNIM's other operating units are
based on data submitted by SNIM--essentially the actual operating results
of the existing units, the feasibility study for the new mini-steel plant,
and detailed sales projections for each of the different units. Steel mill
output--primarily reinforcement bars for construction--is projected to in-
crease gradually from 1,500 tons during the first quarter of 1979, to 10,000
tons in 1980. Except for the period 1981-83, when 20-30% of production is
to be sold in Senegal, the output is expected to be for the local market
alone, at a price corresponding to the current price of imported steel (in-
cluding about 20% of CIF value in import duties). Production and sales of
SNIMEX, the explosives factory, are projected in line with COMINOR's explo-
sives requirements. Gypsum production, for export to Senegal, is projected
at about 17,000 tpy until end-1979. Starting in 1980, an additional 26,000
tpy will be extracted for sale at cost to a new plaster project, in which
SNIM is to have a minority holding. Sales of petroleum products by DCPP are
expected to increase at about 4% per annum until the late 1980s, while the
proportion of its total sales going to other SNIM units--currently 55%--is
expected to decrease as the local market outside SNIM develops. As already
mentioned in para. 3.02, these last two units will, however, eventually be
divested from SNIM.
8.10      Operating costs of SNIM's central organization in Nouakchott are
projected on the basis of budgets prepared by SNIM, which assume a gradual
but substantial reduction below 1976-77 levels following the implementation
of the reorganization and streamlining program which SNIM has recently
prepared (para. 3.09). This program, the details of which have been reviewed
by the Bank, is expected to be implemented over 4 years gradually generating,
by the end of this period, recurrent cost savings in the central organization
of 30%-40% compared to 1977-78 levels. SNIM committed itself to implement
this program and to review its results with the Bank from time to time. Costs
other than operating costs consist primarily of additional expenditures for
the completion of the Head Office building and expenditures on special studies,
research, exploration and training. The possibility of transferring the
headquarters from Nouakchott to Nouadhibou is currently being discussed by
the Government and SNIM. The costs of this transfer would be to some extent
compensated by the recurrent savings resulting from a simultaneous reduction
in all overhead costs not directly related to the iron ore operations. Before



-  7
implementing the decision, a detailed cost/benefit analysis wiil be undertaken
to ensure that the transfer would not jeopardize the progranr of overhead costs
reduction to which SNIM is committed.
8.11      Repayment of loans pertaining to SNIM units other than COMINOR, re-
late primarily to a US$2 million loan for the office building, loans totalling
FF 17.6 million (US$3.6 million) for the training centers, a IJS$2,4 million
equivalent soft-term loan from Abu Dhabi, and a FF 27 million (USS5).5 million)
suppliers' credit for the steel project. In addition, other miscellaneous
loans totalling about US$5 million were oustanding at the end of 1978. A
further US$4.2 million of committed loans is expected to be disbursed to the
other SNIM units in 1979, whilst a US$5 million revolving credit from the
Union des Banques Suisses (UBS) is ex,ected to be renewed îri 1980.
8.12       In early August 1978, the Government and SNIM reached agreement on
the financial separation of SOMIMA and the liquidation of the miscellaneous
debts (comprised of advances made by SNIM in favor of the treasury, advances
made for the refinery, plus compensation payments made, or ialling due, to
the former shareholders of MIFERMA, less taxes owed by SNIM to the State).
The terms of this agreement constitute a significant effort by the Government
to put SNIM on a sound financial footing, and may be summar:Lzed as follows:
(i) the undisbursed portion as of January 1, 1978 of the long term debts
contracted by SNIM on SOMIMA's behalf and SOMINA's current expenses paid by
SNIM on the State's behalf after the separation of SOMIMA w-ill be taken over
by the State; and (ii) UM 1,383 million (US$30.8 million-representing the
balance as of January 1, 1978 of the net State debt to SNIM referred to above
including the outstanding amounts of the long term debts contracted on SOMIMA's
behalf - ) will be paid back by the Government in the form of a credit over
the period 1978-85, according to a specific repayment schedule, whereby prin-
cipal and interest 1/ payments would correspond to a rebate of about 25% on
projected royalties. This has been confirmed with the Government.
8.13      Following the separation of SOMIMA, SNIM's negative working capital
(excluding that of COMINOR), increased to about UM 1,393 million (LJS$31.0
million) by the end of 1979 of which UM 3,068 million (US$68 million) was
comprised of payables and bank overdrafts, essentially reflecting SOMIMA's
cumulated cash losses. It has now been agreed that the UM 1,780 million
(US$39.5) that SNIM has outstanding in the form of overdrafts witt, a consor-
tium of local banks will be repaid in 1979, with the additional equlity paid
in. Effective repayment of these bank overdrafts or conclusion of a satis-
factory agreement to this effect will be a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loan.
1/   Equivalent to about 5.5% p.a.



- 58 -
8.14       The Government has agreed that SNIM will not have to cover any of
the compensation payments pertaining to the nationalization of MIFERMA,
either directly to the shareholders or as repayment of loans contracted by
the Government to cover previous payments. This is implicit in the amounts
of the rebate of royalties referred to above (para. 8.12).

While COMINOR's projected results fluctuate widely, on the whole, performance
is expected to be satisfactory. COMINOR is projected to have generated a
cumulated cash surplus of about US$62 million by the end of 1982 and about
US$103 million by the end of 1983. This cash surplus remains a major potential
source of financing for any cost overruns not covered by the basic financing
plan.
8.16       Similarly, COMINOR's cumulated cash surplus is projected to increase
by a further US$118 million (current terms) over the period 1983-90, even after
having contributed some US$187 million to the financing of Phase 2. During
the same period, COMINOR's debt:equity ratio is not expected to exceed 55:45
or its debt service coverage ratio to fall below 1.8. It must be recognized,



- 59 _
however, that the projected cumulative cash surplus for the entire period
1979-90, of US$180 million, would be wiped out if revenues from iron ore sales
were to fall below the levels assumed for the period, by a mere 5% on average.
However, given the conservative export prices and cyclical sales volumes assumed
in the projections, this is thought unlikely, and the expectation that Phase 2
of the Guelbs project can be implemented without major financial difficulties
appears, therefore, to be reasonably good. Finally, if worst came to worst,
COMINOR's financial situation could be remedied by deferring the export royalty
obligations for some years.
2.   Other SNIM Units Excluding COMINOR
8.17      Although COMINOR dominates SNIM, the latter's financial situation
is also greatly affected by the results of its other units. Combined finan-
cial projections for all these other units are given in Annex 8-3. Excluding
the equity, the net cash shortfall of these units, for the critical period
1978-82, would amount to about UM 2,5'90 million (US$57.6 million). Therefore
of the total new equity, US$65 million will be used in 1979 and 1980 to cover
the losses of the other units and to restructure their working capital. In
particular the reimbursement of the overdrafts SNIM has with local banks
as a result of the losses incurred by SOMIMA (para 8.12) is one of the main
causes of the large cash shortfall of the other units during the first year.
It implies a cash drain on the company of about UM 1,780 million in 1979 which
will not be fully compensated during the period 1979-82 by the tax rebates
which are to compensate SNIM for the SOMIMA losses which the Government has
agreed to assume. However, even excluding these the net cash shortfall
directly attributable to the other units is still substantial as it amounts to
about UM 1,700 million (US$38 million). DCPP, SNIMEX and the gypsum plant all
have a positive contribution margin. That of the steel plant on the other
hand is negative during its first 4 years of operation until 1983, as the
normal losses of the learning process are compounded by the heavy repayment
burden of the suppliers credits (up to 1982-83) for which the original loan
period was too short in relation to the nature of the project. However, as is
indicated by the data for 1983-85, even with a positive contribution from the
steel plant, the consolidated margin is inadequate to cover the head office
and support services expenditures generated by these very same units. In this
context, however, it should also be rnoted that there is some contention as to
the proportion of these expenditures which may rightfully be attributed to
COMINOR. In the financial projections COMINOR has been allocated as general
overheads only the costs of the overseas offices (Annex 8-1, page 4), or about
16% of the net total, whilst in the financial and economic rate of return
calculations (for maximum conservatism), all those overheads pertaining even
very indirectly to the iron ore operations have been included (Annex 8-5,
page 1). This means that the overhead cost allocated to COMINOR in this case
amounts to 70% of the total for SNIM as a whole. In any case, past overhead
expenditures have been excessive (in relation to SNIM's requirements) and have
therefore been tabulated separately in Annex 8-3 in order to show the signif-
icance of the assumptions that SNIM' s planned overhead reduLction programme
(para 3.09) will prove successful, and thus allow maintaining such costs
relatively constant in real terms, despite an increase in the volume of
COMINOR's annual operations of the o-rder of 65%.

/a   After deduction of SNIM's contribution to the financing of Phase 1 and
Phase 2 of the Project.
Except during 1978-82, when the cash losses of other units have a negative
effect, SNIM's financial situation is generally similar to that of COMINOR.
SNIM's net consolidated, cumulative cash surplus for the period 1979-82 is
projected to amount to US$69 million and US$138 million for the period 1983-90.
With an overall debt service coverage ratio which will be on average above
2.0, and a projected maximum debt/equity ratio of 50:50, throughout the
period 1979-92, SNIM should be able to borrow some additional funds if
required. The conclusions drawn above (para. 8.16) at the level of COMINOR,
with respect to the financial viability of the operation, and the expectation
that Phase 2 will be adequately financed, therefore, remain valid at the
consolidated level. In order to ensure that SNIM's cash generation will
be preserved for Phase 2 (and for Phase 1 overruns if necessary), SNIM has
committed itself: (i) not to distribute any dividends, unless retained



- 61 -
earnings accrue according to a schedule agreed upon with thes Bank 1/; and (ii)
to place the cumulated cash in a special account at the Central Bank. Simi-
larly, the Government will guarantee that any foreign exchange deposited in
this account will be made available to SNIM, as and when required for the
purposes of Phase 1 cost overruns and of Phase 2 financing.
I.   Break-Even Point
8.19       In 1986, at full production of Phase 1, the profit break-even point
for COMINOR would be about 66% of production capacity. Altiernatively, average
export prices of ore at full production could fall by 19% before COMINOR would
show a loss. The cash break-even point would be only 57% oF capacity due to
the favorable lending terms.
J.   Financial Covenants
8.20     SNIM has agreed to the following financial covenants:  (i) to main-
tain at all times, unless the Bank should agree otherwise, a debt/equity ratio
not exceeding 60:40, a current ratio of at least 1.3:1 and a debt service
ratio of at least 1.5:1; (ii) until completion of Phase 2 of the project, not
to contract any additional loans above US$5 million annually without prior
consent of the Bank; (iii) not to undertake--without prior consent of the
Bank--any new projects, either on its own behalf, or through subsidiaries, or
any capital expenditures outside the project aggregating to more than US$5
million annually; and (iv) not to invest in any other corporate entity more
than US$2 million annually without prior approval of the Bank. SNIM will not
distribute any dividends unless the above financial ratios are met and the
retained earnings are accumulated as cash up to the amounts required for the
financing of Phase 2 (para. 8.18).
K.   Trust Arrangement and SNIM Operational Account
1.   Purpose
8.21      To provide the Bank and certain other lenders with an adequate debt
service payment mechanism as well as with some additional, albeit limited,
security, and to help maintain SNIM on a sound financial footing and minimize
its dependence on the Government with respect to the foreign exchange it needs
for its operations, the Bank has sought to obtain agreement that:
(i)  proceeds from the sale of iron ore will be allocated as a
matter of priority to debt service payment, and not diverted
for other purposes; and
(ii)  sufficient foreign exchange for SNIM's day-to-day operation
of its mine related facilities will be at its disposal at all
times.
1/   US$25, 75, 125 million, respectively, by 1983, 1984 anil 1985.

2.   Description
8.22      Under normal Mauritanian foreign exchange procedures, all proceeds
from exports must be repatriated. By derogation thereto, part of the iron
ore export sales proceeds will be kept abroad as follows.
8.23      SNIM will covenant that SNIM's purchasers will be instructed to
make all payments of sales of proceeds directly to a designated account at
its bank, the Societe Generale of Paris (SG Paris). SNIM will be under
an obligation to put into all its sales contracts a provision to that effect.
As a condition of effectiveness, such payment instructions shall have been
given with respect to the existing sales contracts.
8.24      A Set-Aside Agreement will be entered into between SNIM, the Central
Bank of Mauritania, the lenders and the SG Paris, and a Trust Deed will be
entered into between SNIM, the Central Bank, the lenders and the Law Debenture
Corporation of London, the latter acting as trustee. SG Paris, as recipient
of all iron ore sales proceeds will be under permanent irrevocable instruc-
tions to transfer monthly (with priority over any other allocations or trans-
fers of proceeds received) to a trust account in London such amounts as will
be required to (i) accumulate therein the necessary amounts for the next
semiannual debt service payment due (through equal monthly deposits of 1/6 of
the next semiannual payment due and (ii) accumulate and maintain therein a
permanent cushion equivalent to the next semi-annual payment due. The table
on the following page details year by year what amounts are affected by the
trust arrangement.
8.25       Societe Generale of Paris will further be under permanent instructions
in the Set-Aside Agreement to transfer monthly out of the remaining funds,
certain minimum balances to a "SNIM Operational Account". Such amounts will
be determined on the basis of annual budgets for COMINOR's anticipated foreign
exchange operating expenses which will have received prior approval from
the Central Bank. The remaining funds will then be repatriated to Mauritania
and credited to SNIM's account at the Central Bank.
8.26      In addition to the above, as security for their loans SNIM will
provide the participating lenders collectively under a Security Agreement
with (i) an unconditional global assignment of all future sales proceeds from
the sale of iron ore and (ii) specific assignments of sales proceeds under
contracts covering at all times 50% of the iron ore production. SNIM also
covenants in the Loan Agreement not to assign sales proceeds to any other
party, unless agreed by the Bank. The lenders have agreed not to notify the
purchasers of these assignments except in the event that:
(i)  SNIM fails to instruct any purchaser as provided in
paragraph 8.24 and such default shall continue for a
period of 30 days after notice from one of the lenders
to SNIM;
(ii) SNIM changes existing payment instructions to its buyers;

(iii)  SNIM fails to provide the lenders with assignments with
respect to ore sales contracts together with a copy of
such contracts within 30 days after notice from one of
the lenders to SNIM;
(iv) SNIM assigns sales proceeds under any contract in a
manner inconsistent with the above requirements; and
(v)  the funds transferred during any given month to the trust
account are inferior to the monthly debt service deposit as a
result of a deliberate action by SNIM, or as a result of an
attachment by third parties of funds in the domiciliatory
account in Paris or of sales proceeds due to SNIM.
The right to notify the assignments to the purchasers and instruct the
purchasers to pay into a collective account at the SG Paris may be exercised
independently by two representatives of the lenders designated by the lenders.
However, a majority of two-thirds of the lenders could veto the decision of
notification. Therefore, before notification, all other lenders will have to
be informed and will have seven working days to respond. As a condition of
loan effectiveness, the global assignment and specific assignments covering
existing contracts shall have been provided to the lenders.
8.27      The above arrangements will protect the lending institutions par-
ticipating in the arrangement without penalizing the Government unduly as it
deals only with obligations related to the Guelbs project. The table on
the previous page details year by year what annual amounts would be affected
by the trust arrangement, should all the colenders participate. These
amounts vary over the next 14 years from 4 to 14% of annual sales proceeds
and average 11%. 1/ At the same time the "SNIM Operational Account" will
strengthen the company by assuring that foreign exchange will be available
for its day-to-day operations. Agreement on the principle of these various
arrangements has now been reached. Together with payment instructions for
all existing contracts and specific assignments covering 50% of the produc-
tion, the conclusion of the Set-Aside Agreement, of the Trust Agreement and
of the Security Agreement will be conditions of effectiveness.
L.   Financial Rate of Return
8.28      The incremental financial rate of return for the combined Phases 1
and 2 is 5.4% before royalties, and 1.39% after royalties. If the US$20
million of extraordinary contingencies are not included, the rates of return
are 5.8% and 1.7% respectively. These returns have been calculated by com-
paring the situation "with" the Guelbs project with a situation "without" the
project; in the latter case COMINOR would maintain production at the Kedia at
1/   Assuming also the participation of one third of SNIM's existing
creditors exercising their rights of negative pledge.



- 65 -
an average rate of 8 million tpy, which would assure a reasonable profit,
until exhaustion of the deposit in 1990. Details on the incremental financial
cost and benefit streams are given in Annex 8-5 1/.
Incremental Financial Rates of Return - Sensitivity Analysis
(in %)
Base Case (before royalties)                              5.4
10% Increase in Investment Costs                          4.3
10% Increase in Operating Costs                           2.9
10% Decrease in Revenues                                  1.6
10% Increase in Revenues                                  8.8
Slippage 1 year in start-up                               4.8
Base Case (after royalties)                                1.3
US$20 million contingency eKcluded                         5.8
The incremental rate of return does not provide a good indi.cation of COMINOR's
financial situation, as it is compensated for by the higher returns accruing
to the existing operation. Also, no adjustment has been made in the calcula-
tions for the costs that would be incurred on closure in 1990-91, if the proj-
ect were not to proceed, such as for resettlement and welfare payments, since
these are not, strictly speaking, SNIM costs. Furthermore, the overwhelming
concern of the major shareholder, the Mauritanian Government, is the high
economic benefit of the project, extending the life of the mine, and thus
developing in the long term, the major productive sector of the country's
economy and the only sustainable activity in the northern part of Mauritania.
M.   Auditing and Reporting
8.29      SNIM has its 1978 accounts audited by the French firm Helios and
has agreed to have its future accounts audited annually, by auditors accept-
able to the Bank and to submit these to the Bank within four months after the
end of the year.
N.   Major Risks
8.30      The major risk faced by SNIM/COMINOR is related to the recent
Polisario guerrilla activity which could be very damaging to the future of the
entire mining venture.  Were such activity to resume at the level attained in
late 1977 and early 1978, it is possible that the company would not be able to
maintain a financially viable operation. In any case, it would have to be
expected that the contribution the -existing operations are assumed to make to
the financing of the project would decrease. The financial projections assume
continued cessation of such guerrilla activity or at least a substantial
reduction from the levels reached in 1977-78.
1/   A proportion of SNIM's head office costs that are indirectly related to
COMINOR, has been added to the financial cost streams derived from the
financial projections, resulting in an aggregate allocation to COMINOR
of about 70% of the total head office and support service expenditures
generated by SNIM's as a whole.



- 66 -
8.31      The risk related to project implementation is two-fold:  the quality
of project management itself and the possible damaging effect of guerrilla
activity during implementation:
(a)  While SOCOMINE, the project manager, is a relatively small
concern, it is staffed with experienced people many of whom
occupied management positions during the implementation and
operation of the original MIFERMA project, and it will in
addition be reinforced by qualified people from several large
consulting organizations. To ensure that the entire SOCOMINE
staff will be assigned to the project full-time during imple-
mentation, a covenant precludes SOCOMINE from taking on any
outside activities which might be detrimental to the project
implementation. With this restriction, overall project manage-
ment during implementation is expected to be satisfactory; and
(b)  Implementation could be adversely affected by a renewal
of guerrilla activity, damaging essential equipment and
seriously delaying project completion. Therefore, to provide
COMINOR with access to the financial resources which might in
such a case be needed, an additional US$20 million in the form
of equity has been included as an extraordinary contingency in
the financing plan.
8.32      While the Government will guarantee repayment of the Bank loan to
SNIM, a direct debt service payment mechanism will also be set up (paras. 8.21-
8.27), to be built up and replenished by the Company's receipts from its iron
ore exports. This will assure automatic repayment of debt for a period of at
least 6-12 months, thereby providing the lenders with an opportunity to seek a
solution in the event of difficulties. At the same time the Government will
allow SNIM to open an operating account to be maintained outside Mauritania
and to be replenished directly from iron-ore sales revenues. This should
ensure that SNIM has sufficient foreign exchange to meet its operational
requirements at all times.  Furthermore, to safeguard the Company's financial
resources and ability to properly execute and operate the project, and to
avoid any management diversion from other tasks, SNIM will not proceed with
any investments that are unrelated to its iron ore operation without the
prior consent of the Bank.
8.33      Another potential risk is that Phase 2 would not be implemented
as scheduled, with the consequence that, after exhaustion of the Kedia
reserves, COMINOR would only be able to count on a production of 6 million
tpy from Phase 1, and would therefore operate below the break-even point.
To counter this threat, the financing plan for Phase 1 has been designed so
that implementation of Phase 2 would not, under reasonably foreseeable cir-
cumstances, be retarded because of financing problems.  The proposed financing
should put SNIM on such a footing, that even a financing plan for Phase 2
including a somewhat larger amount of debt, or a larger proportion of commer-
cial loans than is proposed here (para. 8.08) would still be acceptable.
Furthermore, it can be expected that many of the Phase l lenders and investors



- 657 -
would be willing to contribute to the financing of Phase 2.  The financial
projections also indicate that, over the period 1983-90 (i.e., the years
presently envisaged for completion of Phases 1 and 2, respectively) inclusive,
SNIM will generate cash in excess of the US$187 million projected as their
own contribution to the Phase 2 financing. Finally, the covenant limiting
dividends distribution should cause SNIM to retain the necessary cash genera-
tion, whilst that on the Government (para. 8.18) should ensure that the
associated foreign exchange is also available.
8.34      The project faces the normal market risk of any iron ore export
project. Nevertheless, SNIM is expected to produce a good quality iron ore
at internationally competitive costs, and any marketing difficulties should
therefore, at most, be temporary. Also, the incremental amount of iron ore
which the project will introduce ontc the world market is relatively small.
In any event, letters of intent amounting to about 50% of its production have
already been obtained, and the general response from the ore purchasers to
the sales campaign initiated by SNIM for the Guelbs production is quite
favorable.
8.35      Finally, the project is not expected to face any particular risks
as regards mining and transportation, since these are merely an extension
of activities presently being carriecl out. Operations of the concentration/
benefication plant, on the other hand, will constitute a new activity for
the Company. However, since the process to be employed is relatively simple
and well-proven commercially, and adequate training of operators is envisaged,
no extraordinary difficulties are expected in running this plant satisfactorily.
IX. ECON041C ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.01     In calculating the incremental economic rate of return (for which
the major assumptions are given in Annex 9-1), the financial cost streams
have been amended by excluding payment of all taxes (export royalty and
all indirect taxes), and shadow pricing Mauritanian labor costs. Indirect
taxes represent, on average, about 3% of FOB ore export value. The costs of
Mauritanian laborers and foremen have been shadow priced at, respectively,
30% and 50% of the financial costs. The corresponding reduction in operating
costs is about 7%. Similarly, the local components of project construction
work by contractors, and by SNIM's own force, have been reduced to take into
account indirect taxes and shadow-priced labor. The corresponding reduction
is about 3% of capital costs. These assumptions are conservative for in
comparing the "with" and "without" project situations, the shadow price of
labor in 1990 at the time the Kedia deposits would otherwise be exhausted,
would be very much lower, due to the lack of alternative sources of employ-
ment and the financially satisfactory nature of the project.  All costs and
benefits in the return calculations are expressed in 1977 real terms.



- 68 -
9.02     The benefit streams have been amended to take into account the
cost of closing the mine, the town site of Zouerate, the communities along
the railway line, and the Nouadhibou facilities, should the project not be
implemented. Few alternative means of employment or subsistence are avail-
able in Nouadhibou, and none exist in the desert. Once the existing Kedia
deposit is exhausted, all mining of iron ore would come to a halt and most
of the population - estimated at 40,000 - would have to be resettled in other
parts of the country (near the capital Nouakchott or in the agriculture lands
along the Senegal river). Because of the shortage of adequate infrastructure
and the high cost of building in Mauritania, as well as of creating alter-
native urban or agricultural employment, the resettlement cost is expected
to be high. On the basis of new or on-going projects with comparable compo-
nents in Mauritania and neighboring Senegal, the resettlement cost has been
estimated at a minimum of US$2,000 per person.
9.03     The results of the incremental rate-of-return calculations are shown
in the following table, indicating a "Base Case" economic rate of return for
the combined Phases 1 and 2 of 11.8%. If the US$20 million of extraordinary
contingencies are not included, this rate of return increases to 12.4%.
The detailed calculations and sensitivity tests are shown in Annex 9-1.

Base Case                                                               11.8

US$20 million contingency excluded                                      12.4
The economic rate of return is relatively high compared to the financial rate
of return, because of the important indirect taxes paid by COMINOR and the
high labor content of the operating costs. The sensitivity tests indicate
that there is little likelihood that the project would have an unsatisfactory
economic rate of return.
B.   Foreign Exchange Effects
9.04      One of the most important benefits that Mauritania will receive from
the project is its foreign exchange earnings. At full production, Phases 1
and 2 are expected to yield incremental net foreign exchange earnings after
debt service of US$14.0 million and US$51.0 million p.a. on average (in real
terms) respectively. The payback period for the total foreign exchange com-
ponents of the two phases is estimated to be about 3 years from startup of
Phase 2. Combining the existing mining operation with the two Phases of the



- 69 -
project, COMINOR is projected to yield total net foreign exchange earnings
of US$60 million p.a. in real terms, on average, over the period 1979-92.
Further details on the foreign exchange effects are contained in Annex 9-2.
C.   Other Benefits
9.05      Implementation of the project will maintain the mining operations
in existence, as well as further deve]op them. This, as outiined in Chapter
II, is crucial to Mauritania in order to sustain Government revenues and
foreign exchange inflows, and to create direct and indirect employment effects.
In addition, the project will ensure the continuing existence of SNIM, which
through its training programs, geological research and project promotion, is
the main instrument for future development of mining activities and industry
in Mauritania.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 1 of 8
MAURITANIA--GUEI,BS IRON ORE PROJECT
SNIM UNITS OTEHER THAN COMINOR
A.   Introduction
1.        Besides COMINOR, SNIM includes the following units or departments:
(i) Departement de Commercialisation des Produits Petroliers (DCPP)--
an organization for the distribution of petroleum products.
(ii) a gypsum mining and sales operation.
(iii) SNIM Explosifs (SNIMEX)--an explosives factory
(iv) SNIMACIER--a new mini-steel plant (due to commence production).
(v)  The "Siege", a central organization, comprising the head office,
training and research units.
Up until early 1978, SNIM also included SOMIMA, the copper mining
operation, and was responsible for supervising the implementation of a new
oil-refinery in Nouadhibou. In March 1978, SOMIMA was divested from SNIM and
it was decided that the refinery wou:Ld not be incorporated into SNIM if and
when it should be made operational.
B.   DCPP
2.        DCPP was first created under the name UCPP in 1973, when the
Government gave SNIM the authority to set up an organization for refining
and distributing oil products.  The main reasons for this course of action
was: dissatisfaction with foreign companies (who had handled imports and
distribution up to that time) due to their erratic supply, rising prices and
above all lack of interest in expanding their networks. SNIM was viewed as
being the only Mauritanian organization capable of handling the logistics of
such an enterprise and, in addition, oil was critical to SNIM's own mining
activities.
3.        Since 1975, DCPP has been the sole importer for the Mauritanian
market; it supplies its own distribution system as well as those of its
remaining private competitors, BP and Mobil. It has expanded its network by
buying out Shell Senegal (in Mauritania) in 1975 and Texas Mauritania in
1976 and by building new stations such that, in 1978, the DCPP network was
comprised of: (i) main depots in Nouadhibou, Nouakchott and Dakh la; (ii)
29 filling stations; (iii) 4 airport depots; and (iv) about: 30 tank trucks.
The stations are maintained and supplied by DCPP, while the manager pays rent
and receives a salary on a commission basis. DCPP's work force consists of
about 60 persons, including 4 expatriates. Maintenance of the truck fleet
is carried out separately in the wor-kshops of SNIM's central organization.



- 74 -
ANNEX 3-1
Page 2 of 8
4.        DCPP has a clear marketing advantage through its import function
and its role as supplier to captive markets in the form of both SNIM and the
Government. Consumption of oil products in the Mauritanian market has been
estimated at 200,000 cubic meters in 1978 with a share of 82% going to DCPP
(in 1975 its share was 36%) and the remainder to Mobil and BP. SNIMNs needs
alone account for 45% of the total market whilst Gas-oil constitutes the
largest proportion of sales volume of around 2/3 of total demand.
5.        The sales prices of oil products are fixed by the Government accord-
ing to a complex formula at levels varying according to location within the
country. These prices include miscellaneous taxes plus a reasonable margin
above import cost for the importer/distributor and are regularly revised. In
late 1977, for example, the sales price, ex-depot Nouakchott, for gas-oil
was computed as follows:
Price per lOOL
(UM)
CIF price                                    694
Taxes                                        788
Import/Distribution Margin                    95
Total                             1,427 (US$31.7)
SNIM is exempted from taxes on fuel for its own internal consumption require-
ments. The import/distribution margin is sufficient, both to cover operating
costs and to provide an adequate return on investment and DCPP is therefore a
profitable operation. Net profit in 1977, for example, reached UM 66 million
on net sales (excluding taxes) of UM 1,153 million (or 6%).
6.        As already mentioned in para. 3.02 of the text, the decision has
been taken to separate DCPP from SNIM. Because of the positive cash flow
generated by DCPP, this separation will imply a net loss for SNIM, which the
Government has nonetheless agreed to compensate. The compensation level will
be discussed and approved by the Bank. A preliminary study based on the
financial projections indicates that SNIM's cumulative net loss would amount
to US$130 million by 1992 in current terms.
C.   Gypsum Operation
7.        Since 1973, SNIM has mined the gypsum contained in a high-quality
dune deposit about 60 km from Nouakchott, which currently has reserves of some
14 million tons. Mining is a very simple quarry operation with trucks and
shovels and involves about 10 people. Production is currently roughly 17,000
tons per year, all of which is sold to the Rufisque cement plant near Dakar in
Senegal at a delivered price of UM 1,640/ton (US$36.4).  SNIM trucks trans-
port the gypsum to the Senegalese border and, on their return trip, carry
Senegalese cargo back to Nouakchott.



- 75 -
ANNEX 3-1
Page 3 of 8
8.        Although small, this venture is profitable.  On the basis of sales
of 17,000 tons, 1978 net revenues (after deduction of the expensive trans-
port within Senegal's border) are projected at UM 16 million and net profit at
UM 6 million (US$133,333), or 38%.
9.        The export market in Senegal is fairly secure since the closest
competing sources are in Morocco. However, miere exportation does not fully
exploit the local value added potential of the gypsum, while at the same
time Mauritania is destitute of indigenous building materials.  A project is
therefore under consideration to build a 22,000 tpy plaster plant, producing
both materials for plastering and components, such as blocks and panels. This
output would substitute about 2 for 1 for imported cement and reduce foreign
exchange outflows, which for cement are currently the order of US$3 million
p.a. (60,000 tpy at a cost of about US$50/ton CIF Nouakchott). The technical
feasibility of the project has been studied by Pfeiffer/Belgochaux of Germany
and Belgium, but neither a market study nor a comprehensive feasibility study
has yet been undertaken. Capital costs are estimated at UM 253 million
(US$5.6 million). The project would be established as a private company,
primarily by private interests but with a minority participation by SNIM. To
this end, SNIM plans to use UM 27 million (US$600,000) from a line of credit
provided by Caisse Centrale specifically for such small-scale projects. At
full production the plaster plant would require an input of 26,400 tpy of
gypsum; this would be sold to them by SNIM, at cost.
10.       Gypsum could also be used in clinker-grinding to produce cement from
imported clinker. Preliminary proposals for such a plant, with a capacity of
100,000 tpy of cement have been made to SNIM.  It is unlikely, however, that
this project will go ahead in the near future.
il.       A Government-level decision has also been taken to divest SNIM of
its gypsum operation (para. 3.02 of the text). Because of the small size of
the operation, the financial implication on SNIM will be minimal, especially
since the Government has agreed to compensate SNIM for any present or future
losses resulting from separation activities (para. 3.02.).
D.   SNIMEX
12.       SNIMEX was started by SNIM; in 1975 near Nouadhibou in order to
produce the explosives required by COMINOR and SOMIMA.  It is a small plant,
mixing and packing the imported components for resale as two explosive prod-
ucts, SNIMEX (a mixture of TNT and nitrates) and ANFO (a mixture of ammonium
nitrates and fuel oil). In the past, production has averaged 1,700 tpy of
SNIMEX for COMINOR and 400 tpy of ANFO for SOMIMA, but capacity is suffi-
cient to supply the 2,600 tpy peak requirement of COMINOR during the first
years of Guelbs operation. About 50 persons work at the plant, of which only
one is an expatriate.  The UM 90 million (US$2 million) initial investments
were financed by a UM 33.5 million boan from Caisse Centrale (fully repaid
by early 1978) and by SNIM's cash generation. SNIMEX sells its production at
a price equivalent to those of imported explosives i.e. UM 47.7/kg (US$1.06)
in 1977/78. At these prices, SNIMEX more or less breaks even. However, in
1978, it incurred losses of UM 36 million on sales of 52 million because of the



- 76 -
ANNEX 3-1
Page 4 of 8
low level of production of explosives due to the slowdown of COMINOR's activi-
ties. In 1979, a slight profit of about UM 1 million (US$22,000) on sales of
UM 90 million (US$2 million) is projected.    SNIMEX is, therefore, a viable
alternative to the import of ready-to-use explosives.
E.   SNIM/ACIER--THE STEEL PROJECT
13.       SNIM has just completed construction of a small steel plant in
Nouadhibou, for which the projected output is 10,000 tpy of reinforcement
bars. Essentially, the plant consists of an electric arc furnace and a
rolling mill. Production will be based on the high-grade steel scrap gene-
rated by COMINOR (through the continuous replacement of the railtrack and
wheels of the ore wagons). Previously, COMINOR's rate of generation averaged
between 6,000 and 9,000 tpy; this is projected to increase to about 10,000
tpy during the 1980's. In addition, in anticipation of project start-up,
some 16,000 tons have been accumulated at Nouadhibou over the past 2 years.
14.       The purpose of the plant is to supply rebars to the domestic con-
struction industry, whose demand is currently estimated at about 5,000 to
6,000 tpy 1/ and is projected to increase at about 10% p.a.  During the first
four years or so of full production, SNIM/ACIER will, therefore, have to
export to Senegal.  Prospects for such exports are reasonable:  the quantities
involved are small; Senegal has no domestic source of supply; several dam and
irrigation projects requiring such steel are to be constructed in the border
areas of Senegal and Mauritania in the near future; and SNIM has in fact
already received a letter of intent from a trading company, DAVOB in Dakar.
Production and exports are projected as follows:

SNIM expects to sell the steel at an average wholesale price of UM 25,700/ton
(US$555) in 1977 terms, which is equivalent to the current price of imported
steel, determined as follows:

public buildings and mosques were constructed simultaneously.

On the basis of a current import price CIF Dakar of UM 16,000/ton, and in view
of the major rebate on custom duties allowed within the framework of agree-
ments between the two countries, SNIM expects to sell to Senegal at about UM
UM 16,500/ton ex-factory.
15.       The project engineering, construction and staff training have been
carried out by the French firm, STEG, under a turnkey contract, with the
assistance of Italian steel producers, OMAV, of the Brescia area who special-
ize in mini-steel plants. Construction was completed in the second half of
1978 and production is expected to commence during the first quarter of 1979.
The key components of the plant are the electric furnace with a capacity of
12,000 tpy (on the basis of 3 shifts) and the rolling mill with a capacity of
18,000 tpy (on a 1-shift basis). The plant will employ about: 130 persons, of
whom about 20 will be expatriates. Total project cost including interest
during construction and working capital was UM 505 million (US$11.2 million).
External financing consisted of: (i) a UM 190 million loan at 4.5% p.a. for
12 years from Abu Dhabi and (ii) a UM 291.4 million loan bearing an interest
rate of 7.2% p.a., plus a COFACE insurance premium from the Credit Commercial
de France, for about 7 years including 2 years of grace. This second loan,
has a repayment period that is too short for this kind of investment and will
therefore penalize SNIM/ACIER heavily during its first few years of production.
16.       The transfer cost for COMINOR scrap is estimated at UN 2,500/ton
(US$55) in line with the price that such unprepared scrap could fetch (FOB
Nouadhibou) on the world market. This transfer price is very favorable to
SNIM/ACIER. On the other hand, the cost of imported refractories and power
(UM 4.5/kWh) will be high. SNIM projects total operating costs at IJM 21,100/
ton and UM 19,500/ton (1977 terms) for production levels of 7,800 tpy and
10,000 tpy, respectively. When compared with the projected sales price of
UM 16,000 to 25,000/ton, this leaves cnly a small margin to cover capital
charges. As a result, as shown in the projections of Annex 8-3, SNIM/ACIER
is expected to experience average cash losses of about UM 50 million p.a. in
current terms during the first 4 years of operation.

F.   SNIM/SIEGE
17.       The central organization, "Siege" includes the Company's headquarters;
the support services and research and technical department in Nouakchott, the
training units; and the European offices. In early 1978 its personnel con-
sisted of about 600, 1/ of which some 150 were expatriates including about 80
in the European offices. This heavy central organization was developed along
the lines proposed in 1974-75 by SEMA, a French management consulting firm, at
a time when it was envisaged that SNIM would develop into a 10,000-man group.
18.       The headquarters in Nouakchott include the general management depart-
ment, the "secretariat general" (which deals with new works, buildings, public
relations and supplies), the financial department, the personnel department
and the technical department. The technical department consists of a geo-
logical research unit and a group dealing with general technical studies;
it is also responsible for supervising the gypsum mine. The financial depart-
ment is still incomplete as it does not yet have an internal audit unit or a
corporate planning capability.
19.       The personnel department handles personnel planning and training.
It controls the CAFM training school in Nouadhibou and the CAPAT training
school in Nouakchott. It also controls training programs abroad. On the
whole, there is some duplication between this department, the personnel unit
of COMINOR and the administrative office in Paris. The support services
include workshops, stores and a procurement unit. The workshop maintains the
service vehicles as well as the trucks used for the transport of gypsum and
DCPP's equipment.
20.       The European offices include the marketing office and the adminis-
trative office in Paris and the purchasing office in Zurich. The marketing
office basically handles all of SNIM's iron ore (and formerly copper concen-
trate) marketing aspects. The administrative service deals with the recruit-
ment and general administrative questions relating to expatriates. The
Zurich office handles procurement on the basis of instructions from SNIM in
Mauritania.
21.       The capital expenditures and operating costs of this large organiza-
tion have been high. Total operating costs reached UM 654 million (US$14.5
million) in 1977. Of this, UM 156 million was for the European offices,
UM 117 million for the CAFM training center and UM 146 million for SOMIMA and
the refinery. The capital cost of the CAFIM amounted to about UM 300 million
(US$6.7 million), representing an investment per student of US$33,500. This
is extremely high. Operating costs at Nouakchott are worsened by the high
cost of rented housing and other benefits provided to staff and of the
1/   Some of this personnel was dealing essentially with transport and other
support services for SOMIMA.



- 79 -
ANNEX 3-1
Page 7 of 8
rented office scattered through the town as SNIM has only recently acquired a
building of its own. This building is still under construction and its high
cost (UM 340 million, for the building, plus UM 180 million for equipment and
furniture) will heavily burden SNIM's future cash flow.
22.       SNIM now plans to reduce the costs of its central organization
substantially by narrowing the scope of its activities, consolidating services
currently spread between the different central departments and the operating
units and reducing staff and manpower at many levels.  The proposed reduction
program would primarily consist of:
(i)  consolidating personnel services between Nouakchott,
Nouadhibou and Paris;
(ii)  eliminating positions in Nouadhibou which duplicate
those in Nouakchott;
(iii) reducing the number of expatriate teachers and technical
assistants in the training centers;
(iv)  reducing general training abroad for Mauritanians, wherever
this is not directly required for some specific function;
(v)  consolidating the procurement department in Zurich with the
Mauritanian office;
(vi)  eventually consolidating the remaining departments of the three
European offices into one;
(vii) reducing geological researc:h and technical studies;
(viii) reducing the units handlingr public relations, purchasing
new works, etc.; and
(ix)  generally eliminating any activities which were previously
needed for SOMIMA and/or the refinery.
This program should lead to a 30%-40% recurrent reduction as compared with
1978 operating costs and a drastic reduction in capital expenditures,
as is illustrated in the financial projections in Annex 8-3.
G.   PARTICIPATIONS
23.       SNIM also holds participations in the following ventures:
(i)  a 52% participation in SAMMA (Societe d'Acconage et de
Manutention) a trading and investment company which generated
revenues of UM 194 million in 1977;



- 80 -
ANNEX 3-1
Page 8
(ii)  a 33-1/3% participation in MEPP (Compagnie Mauritanienne
d'Entreposage des produits Petroliens), an oil products
storage tank facility in Nouadhibou, which SNIM owns together
with Mobil and BP;
(iii) a 51% participation in COMETE (Compagnie Mauritanienne
d'Etudes Techniques et Economiques), a small engineering
firm in Nouakchott, which generated revenues of UM 66
million in 1977;
(iv) an 81.2% share in SIRCA (Societe de Fabrication et de Commercial-
isation de Produits pour le Batiment), a tile manufacturing
plant with sales of UM Il million in 1977; and
(v) a 20% share in SOMAR (Societe de Representation et de Services),
a trading firm in Dakar, which represents SNIM in Senegal.
SNIM also holds 30% of the shares of a geological research consortium for
phosphates with BRGM, GEOMIN and SSPT (Senegal), which has a total capital of
FF 1.5 million. It also holds 50% of the geological research consortium with
BRGM for uranium prospecting in the Diaguili region.

MAURITANIA - GUELBS IRON ORE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS AND OTHER BASES OF THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.        Financial projections have been prepared separately for (i) COMINOR
(i.e. SNDI's Iron Ore Operations) and (ii) SNIM's other units (both opera-
tional and administrative). These have then been consolidated to produce
pro-forma statements for SNIM as a whole.
Assumptions employed in common are as follows:
(a)  The projections have been made in current terms with an
inflation factor of 8% p.a. for 1979, and 7% p.a. thereafter.
The term constant refers to mid-1977 prices throughout;
(b) no interest on cumulative cash surpluses has been imputed;
(c) of the US$120 million new equity included in the financing plan
US$55 million have been added to that of COMINOR, (Annex 8-2,
page 2) and US$65 million to the other units in order to cover
their cash shortfalls in 1979 and 1980 (Annex 8.4, page 1).
In 1979 US$76.8 million has already been paied in (para 6.09)
whilst the remaining US$43.2 million has been assumed to be
contributed by end 1982, date of project completion; US$15
million in 1980 and 1981 and US$13.2 million in 1982.
(d) dividends on both new equity elements have been estimated to yield
a nominal equivalent annual rate of return of 4% p.a. up to
1992. Under the assumption that payments will be made only
in 1983-85 and 1989-92 inclusive, this yields a payment of
10% of share capital in each of the years dividends are paid.
(e)  it has been assumed that SNIM units other than COMINOR will
not pay any income taxes throughout the period of 1978-99
and that during this period returns to the Government will
accrue in the form of royalties on ore exports alone. 1/
(f)  depreciation for all units has been estimated on the basis
of prevailing accounting practices within SNIM, i.e. straight
line over 20 years for civil works, 10 to 14 years for railway
stock and facilities, and 3 to 5 years for mobile and fixed
equipment.

2.   Iron-Ore Operations (COMINOR)
(a)  The sales volumes for both Kedia and Guelbs ores have been assumed
equal to production, and are forecasted as follows:

These projections 1/ were devised by SNIM/SOCOMINE on the basis of (i) exist-
ing long term contracts; (ii) letters of intent already signed; (iii) the
favorable outcome of the Guelbs concentrates testing campaign-executed by
the existing consumers; and (iv) the Bank's Market analysis as outlined
in Chapter IV.
(b) The corresponding prices of iron ore are based on the Bank's world
market projections, combined with the 1977 FOB Houadhibou price of US$15.20/ton
for Kedia ore, and a projected base price of US$16.90/ton for Guelbs ore (all
in constant 1977 terms). 2/ The latter is some 11% greater than the former
due to an average Fe content of 65% in the case of Guelbs ore, as against 55%
for Kedia ore. Although a premium for Guelbs Sinter, due to its magnetic
qualities could be expected, this has not been taken into account.  For 1979
and 1980 the price projections also take into account the fact that, as a
result of specific demands from the cre purchasers, ore with a high silica
content will be marketed during these years at a price slightly lower than
the price initially forecasted. The resultant estimates of ore prices
for indicative years are tabulated below:
1/   See SNIM "Projections Financieres 1978-88" and Project Files Section 7.

(c) Operating costs have been derived from two sources:  (i) with respect
to the continuation/expansion of existing activities, i.e., the Kedia mining
operations, rail transport, ship-loading activities, etc., current actual data
have been used as the base and the common inflation factor applied (para. 1-a)
above, (ii) with respect to new activities, recurrent costs have been pro-
jected as per detailed studies undertaken by SOCOMINE, e.g., in the case of
the beneficiation plant a breakdown has been provided, item by item, in terms
of fuel and power consumption, manpower and spare parts requirements, etc. 1/
Similarly both Guelbs and Kedia running costs have been estimated on a detailed
basis, in which costs are projected to vary from year to year, according to
the cumulative total mined at that date, and so the stripping ratio, depth of
mining etc. involved. 2/ For 1979 the detailed budget prepared by SNIM was
taken into account and was verified to be consistent with the operating costs
projections.
In addition manpower costs have been assumed to decline as a result
of the gradual Mauritanization of foremen and low level technicians' posts
at the mine. This has been estimated on the basis of 1.25 Mauritanians to
replace 1 expatriate over the period 1979-86 in the case of the existing
operations, and 1987-94 in the case of the new El Rhein activities.

Details on the precise numbers and levels of posts involved are not
available, but on the basis of rough estimates--in terms of constant 1977
US$--this policy is expected to yield operating costs reduct:ions of the
following orders of magnitude, on an annual basis. 1/

Finally, that proportion of SNIM's total overhead costs that pertains
to COMINOR has been set equal to the projected costs of the Zurich and Paris
offices (para 3.09) in the tabulations, 2/ and to 70% of total overhead costs
in the rate of return analysis. Remaining overhead charges are accounted for
in the projections made for SNIM units other than COMINOR.
3.   SNIM Units Other than COMINOR:
(a) Overhead Costs:
For the purpose of financiaL projections, the "siege" (head-office/
central organization) has been treated as a separate unit, with the exception
of the costs of the overseas offices which have been allocated as operating
costs to COMINOR. As outlined in Annex 3-1, pages 6 and 7, SNIM is currently
implementing the overhead cost reduction program; using the 1977 historic
cost as the basis for deductions for all items, SNIM have arrived at the
following estimated 3/ cost savings:
During the first phase of this program, the Zurich and Paris
offices will be cut back, yielding net benefits of UM 9.5 million in 1979,
and UM 42.0 million in 1980 onwards. In addition, there will be a further
reduction of UM 5 million during 1979, as a result of the ,-losure of SOMIMA.
These reductions are reflected in COMINOR's operating costs (Annex 8-2
page 1).

During the Second Phase (i) àll the external offices will be re-
grouped into one, in an as yet unspecified location, whilst all purchasing
functions are co be repatriated to Mauritania. This should yield a further
cost reduction, of UM 25.4 million p.a.; (ii) external training will be reduced
to the minimum yielding cost reductions of UM 20 million p.a. from 1979-83
and UM 15 million thereafter; (iii) domestic training costs will be reduced
by UM 5 million in 1979 and UM 25 million in 1980 and thereafter; (iv) the
opening of the new building and resultant physical consolidation of office
space, equipment and recurrent expenditures is expected to reduce operating
costs by UM 20 million in 1979 and UM 30 million in 1980 and thereafter,
whilst the cutback in related expatriate staff will yield an additional
UM 5 million per annum from 1979 onwards; (v) as a result of the divestiture
of SOMIMA, expenditures on purchasing services have been reduced by UM 5
million in 1978, and will be further reduced by UM 8 million in 1979 and UM 10
million per annum thereafter, (vi) the units handling new works and public
relations will be cut back, reducing annual costs by UM 4 million and UM 15
million respectively from 1979 onwards; (vii) the transport costs will be
reduced by UM 5 million per annum from 1979 onwards--largely as a result of
the phasing out of SOMIMA's transport requirements--and finally (viii)
certain geological and other research activities will be reduced to a minimum,
yielding a cost reduction of UM 40 million per annum for 1979 onwards. The
financial projections assume that all of these objectives will, in fact, be
attained.
(b)  SNIM Other Operating Units:
Detailed operating costs and sales programs have been forecast by
SNIM for each of the individual operating units: 1/
(i) DCPP costs and revenues are projections from a historic
base, according to the specific projected fuel needs of the
Guelbs and Kedia and the state-owned power plants, combined
with a general rate of growth of 4% per annum applied
to the rest of the market. The current real prices and
conditions of purchase and sale of petroleum products
have been assumed to remain unchanged;
(ii) Similarly, the projections for SNIMEX are derived from
historic costs, in the light of detailed projections
of the explosives requirements of COMINOR, and a
transfer price based on the 1978 import cost, net of
duties;

(iii)  In view of their relative insignificance, costs and
revenues for the Gypsum operations have been projected
to continue at 1977 levels (in real terms) until 1982,
and to double thereafter as the plaster plant comes
into operation. It has been assumed that Gypsum will
be supplied to this plant at cost;
(iv)  The costs/revenues for SNIM/ACIER are based on detailed
projections included in a feasibility study prepared by
STEG--the consultants. The sales price is assumed
equal to the current import price including duties,
of US$571/ton;
(v)  Working capital requirements have been estimated by SNIM
on a detailed basis for each of the operating units,
starting from the assumption that such requirements
will return to normal levels for all units during the
course of 1979;
(vi)  SOMIMA was divested from SNIM on March 31, 1978, and the
copper company's outstandirig debts, including those
vis-a-vis the rest of SNIM, have been taken over by
the Government. It has been assumed that the latter
will be repaid (as outlinecl by the Government) 1/ as
part of a royalty rebate package over the period
1978-84 (para 8.12) as follows:

(vii)  Loan disbursements and debt service for these units have been
projected on the basis of a detailed schedule prepared by
SNIM; 1/ and
(viii)  Similarly SNIM has calculated detailed replacement costs
for each of these operating units.  These are included under
investments in the financial projections.
(c) Additional Assumptions are as follows:
(i)  that the net returns accruing to SNIM through its
participation in various entities (Annex 3-1) will
be zero throughout, and that its total involvement
in such participations will remain unchanged. In
view of the relative insignificance of the sums
involved, this assumption is justified;
(ii)  the SNIM's outstanding overdrafts with a consortium
of local banks (para. 8.13) totalling US$39.5 mil-
lion will be repaid in 1979; and
(iii)  that SNIM will roll over a US$5 million loan from
UBS at the beginning of 1980, for a further 5 years.
Finally, tabulated projected investments for SNIM Siege include
the remaining outlays for the head office building, plus extraordinary train-
ing expenditures (since the latter are not recurrent and reflect investment
in human capital).

MAURITANIA - GUELBS IRON ORE PROJECT
FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Input Data
The incremental, internal financial rate of return calculation for
the project is based on incremental cost/benefit streams in 1977 real terms,
obtained by comparing the financial data for COMINOR as a whole with a
hypothetical case "without the project" in which only the production of the
existing Kedia mines would be available until their exhaustiLon. The methodo-
logy and assumptions were the following:
(a) For the case "without the project" it was assumed that
COMINOR would have to maintain production at Kedia at an
average rate of 8 million tpy until exhaustion of the deposit
in 1990 in order to attain the breakeven point. This production
level is higher than the 5-6 million tpy assumed Ito be the
Kedia's share in COMINOR total output in the case "with the
project". Costs of additional investments and replacements for
Kedia have been recalculated accordingly;
(b)  A scrap value of 5% of fixed assets and 100% of working capital
was assumed in the case "without the project". The scrap value
of fixed assets in the case "with the project" was assumed at 25%
in the year 2000 since in this case production from the Guelbs
would continue after that date;
(c) Operating costs of COMINOR have been increased to include that
part of SNIM's overheads pertaining indirectly to COMINOR. The
total overheads pertaining to COMINOR (the indirect ones plus
those included in COMINOR's financial projections) have been
assumed at 70% of SNIM's total overheads; and
(d) Preinvestment expenditures for the Guelbs, prior to 1979, esti-
mated at US$18.6 million have been added to the capital costs.
All calculations are based on a 25-year period which includes 16 years of full
production of the Guelbs Phase 2.

MAURITANIA - GUELBS IRON ORE PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
The incremental economic rate of return has been calculated on the
same basis (with and without the project) as the financial rate of return.
The incremental costs and benefits streams have been derived from cost/benefit
streams shown in Annex 8-5, with the following modifications:
(a) Mauritanian personnel costs have been shadow priced at 30%
and 50% of the financial costs, respectively, for labor and
foremen. The corresponding reduction in operating costs is
7%. This is a conservative assumption in view of the non-
marginal nature of the project, and the lack of alternative
employment opportunities that would be available, were the
project not to be implemented and the Kedia deposits ex-
hausted in 1990;
(b)  The various indirect taxes have been deducted from the
operating costs. Their aggregate represents an average
of roughly 3% of FOB ore export value;
(c) Similarly, Mauritanian personnel costs have been shadow priced
and indirect taxes deducted, in the local components of initial
capital costs and replacement costs, representing civil works
and erection works carried out by contractors, as well as the
same works and replacements carried out by SNIM's own forces,
throughout project life. The corresponding reduction averages
3% of capital costs;
(d)  The costs resulting from the closure of the mine have been added
in the case "without the project". They consist of the cost of
resettling the population of Zouerate, F'derik, the railway main-
tenance stations and part of the population of Nouadhibou which
will have no alternative means of subsistence in these desert
areas and would have to be relocated in other parts of Mauritania
if the mines were to be closed. The corresponding costs includ-
ing moving, the creation of basic-work and other infrastructure,
etc., have been estimated at US$2,000 per person on the basis of
comparable costs for existing or new rural and urban resettlement
projects in Senegal and Mauritania. The resettlement cost for
the 40,000 persons assumed to be involved has been spread over
the 1990-92 period; and
(e)  No shadow pricing of foreign exchange has been assumed since
100% of iron-ore sales revenues, 70% of recurrent operating
costs, 90% of investment outlays and 70-80% of replacement
costs are denominated in foreign exchange.
