MDIORANDUK AND RECOMMINDATION OF TUE PRESIDENT
OF TEE IftERNU TIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE ZXECUTIVE DIECTOIS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TEE REPUBLIC OF =UINEA FOR A
SECOND ECONOMIC )UWIGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 11.3 million (US$ 14.5
million equivalent) is being submitted for approval.  The proposed Credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would assist in
financing a project which aims at improving the Government's economic
management capacity within the framework of Guinea's structural adjustment
program.
2.        Background.  In late 1985, the Government launched a far-reaching
Economic and Financial Recovery Program based on a policy framework
favoring a market-oriented economy. The Recovery Program was supported by
an IMP Stand-By and SAP arrangements, IDA and SFA structural adjustment
credits totalling SDR 38.5 million, and the Technical Assistance Project
for Economic Management(Cr.1559-GUI, SDR 9.7 million). Although important
progress has been made in rebuilding Guinea's economic institutions, the
country's economic management remains weak, and critically so in the
absence of well established public finance and civil service management
systems.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Project is critical for the
successful implementation of the second phase of the Recovery Program
supported by SAL II (Cr.1926-GUI, approved in June 1988), and to the
substantial improvements required in revenue collection, expenditure
control, public investment programming and budgeting, and the
implementation of investment projects. IDA involvement is also expected to
enhance coordination of technical assistance for economic management.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The Project would support long-term
institution building while providing short-term responses to current
weaknesses in economic management. Specific Project objectives would be
to: (i) strengthen key government functions in the areas of planning and
investment programming, and public finance and civil service management,
(ii) facilitate the implementation of the Recovery Program, and (iii)
strengthen the Government's capacity to train public sector staff.
5.        Proiect Description.  The Project would be executed over a period
of 4 years and would help finance an integrated package of mutually
supporting operations: short- and long-term consultant services, training
*      programs, studies and financing of equipment and vehicles.  It would
include the following six components:
*            I. Economic Analysis and Planning.  Under IDA and AfDF financing, the
Project would help strengthen WPCI's analytical capacity through the
provision of about 20 person-years of resident specialists and short-term
consultants including three statisticians, a macroeconomist, an investment
programmer and a sector economist/project analyst. Expected results would
be: (i) a stronger economic data base and tiniely preparation of national



-2-
accounts, (ii) improved medium term projections and monitoring of
macroeconomic indicators, (iii) better screening of projects on technical,
financial and economic grounds, and (iv) improved programming of public
investments.
II. Public Finance Management. The Project would finance about 38
person-years of resident specialists and short-term consultants to the MEF
including ti) a senior economist and a training/personnel management
advisor, both reporting to the Minister; (ii) specialists in each of the
MEF's general directorates: Budget, Treasury, Tax, Customs; and (iii)
specialists to support the Debt and Procurement Divisions. CCCE and FAC
would finance the services of the advisors to the l4inister and provide most
of the assistance to MEF's directorates while the prcposed Credit would
finance the services of the debt and procurement advisors. Expected
results would bet (i) improved budget preparation and increased efficiency
in budget execution, (ii) increased tax and duty collection, and (iii)
increased efficiency in the debt management system.
III. Administrative Reform. The Project would help the Government
-i) rationalize the structure and staffing patterns of Guinea's
administration; (ii) conduct staff testing with the intent of progressively
adjusting the size and the composition of the civil service, and (iii)
establish a permanent personnel data base. The UNDP would finance 15
person-years of resident specialists and short-term consultants. The
proposed Credit would finance training activities and office equipment and
computers. Expected results would includes (i) new organizational
structures for central ministries and local administration, (ii) improved
civil service management based on a reliable civil service roster, and
(iii) improved administrative procedures and practices in a selected number
of key ministries and agencies.
IV. Professional Skills Development. In addition to intensive and
closely monitored on-the-job training, the Project would supports (a)
training needs assessments in MPCI and MEF; (b) CNPG's existing training
programs in economic and financial management, business accounting and
auditing; and (c) two new training programs ins (i) administrative
techniques, personnel management and office management; and tii) project
analysis and management. The Project would aiso provide fellowships for
short-term training abroad. Finally, a Junior Professional Program would
be implemented to permit the recruitment of young Guineans with solid
educational background. They would work closely with the technical
assistance personnel and could join the civil service at the end their
24-month junior professional assignment.
V. Other Support would be provided: (a) to help the BCRG establish a
commercial bank supervision division and improve the preparation of balance
of payments data; tb) for the preparation and dissemination of sound
economic legislation; and (c) for other SAL related studies and activities              c
such as the establishment of an adequate institutional and regulatory
framework for public enterprises.



-3-
VI. Management of the Recovery Program. The Project would help
establish and operate a Reform Monitoring Unit (RMU) composed of a Recovery
Program Coordinator, the Project Administrator, and an economist.
Reporting to the CCEF (the ministerial-level reform coordinating committee)
for which it would provide the Secretariat, the RMU would be responsible
for coordinating and monitoring Government economic and institutional
1       reforms at the technical level, and for administering the Project and
coordinating the implementation of its various components.
6.        The total Project cost is estimated at US$27.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$15.9 million (57Z).
The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Details on procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are
given in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Guinea are given in Schedules C and D
r-spectively. The detailed description of the Project and the project
administration and implementation arrangements are described in the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7420-GUI. A map is attached.
7.        Agreed Actions.  During the negotiations, the Government has
agreed, inter alia, on the following: (i) by October 31 of each year,
transmission to the Association for review, of draft annual work programs
by component for the following year; (ii) transmission of the reports on
training-needs assessments no later than September 30, 1989 for the MPCI
and March 31, 1990 for the MEF and the MRAFP; (iii) by December 31, 1989,
reduction of the delays in the publication of the official gazette to a
maximum of three months. The conditions of effectiveness will be: (i)
opening of local funds account and initial deposit of an amount in local
currency equivalent to US$50,000, (ii) assignment of civil servants
selected pursuant to testing in the central units of MPCI, MEF, and MRAFP;
(iii) signature of an Arrete defining the functions of MEF directorates;
(iv) appointment of the Recovery Program Coordinator, the Project
Administrator and the Chiefs of Operations responsible for the execution of
individual project components and establishment of the PMC; and (v)
availability of UNDP, AfDF, PAC, CCCE and USAID financing.
8.        Benefits.  The overall outcome would be the effective and timely
implementation of the second phase of the Recovery Program and
substantially strengthened government agencies capable of formulating and
implementing sound economic policies leading to sustained economic growth.
Specific benefits would include: (i) better-prepared and executed
:       investment projects; (ii) improved financial management, both in terms of
revenue collection and expenditure control; (iii) a more reliable civil
service personnel management system; (iv) a stronger economic data base (v)
a more coherent set of economic and financial regulations; and (vi) the
availability of nationals better equipped to perform effectively in a
liberal economic system.
.
9.        Risks.  First, the pressure to carry out the reforms
expeditiously may stand in the way of achieving long-term
institution-building objectives. This risk should be minimized by the
emphasis put on developing new procedures, selecting suitable counterparts,



- 4 -
and close monitoring of training activities. Second, the large number of
activities to be undertaken under the Project and the involvement of six
donors may create implementation and coordination difficulties. The
Project management and implementation arrangements have been designed to
provide sufficient flexibility, efficient leadership, and effective
coordination. Third, given the profound changes that the adjustment
process is introducing in the social fabric, there is a risk that the
resistance of interest groups benefiting from th3 status quo could, -t
times, delay the implementation of some reforms and thereby affect the
Government's ability to achieve some Project objectives in a timely manner.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
