INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$41.0 million to help
finance a Fourth Power Project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. The
Government would relend the proceeds of the loan to PLN (the National Power
Company) at the same rate of interest and for the same repayment period.      How-
ever, the interest on the loan to PLN would be capitalized during the grace
period and the Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Indonesia:     Development
Prospects and Needs" of April 15, 1975 (708-IND) described and analyzed
the structure of production and incomes, the recent changes in the avail-
ability of resources, and the medium and longer-term outlook for the
Indonesian economy. Country data are shown in Annex 1.
3.        In 1969, at the start of Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan, the
per capita income of the Indonesian population was probably no higher than
half a century ago.   A majority of the population lived below a minimum
welfare standard, especially on Java. Most-were dependent exclusively or
primarily on agriculture, where farms were generally very small. Under-
employment was widespread.   While the inflation of the mid-1960s had been
overcome, infrastructure was still in very poor condition.
4.        The Government's efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974) were successful in putting the economy on
the road towards development. Most physical objectives were achieved or
nearly so, and there was very substantial rehabilitation of run-down infra-
structure and government enterprises in agriculture and manufacturing. In-
vestments increased at a very fast rate, -rising from 9 to 19 percent of GNP.
While 57 percent of Government development expenditures were financed from
abroad, the reliance on foreign financing was much smaller than the level
rate of nearly 80 percent foreseen in the Plan. Real GDP increased at an
annual rate of over 7 percent. GNP per capita in current prices reached
about $120 in 1973. The Government instituted programs for the labor in-
tensive rehabilitation of infrastructure and other programs which created
substantial incomes and employment. In all, however, given the annual in-
crease in the labor force of about one million, one cannot be confident
that the employment situation improved during the First Plan period, and
from available information it is difficult to judge whether a significant
part of the poorest section of the population participated in the gains of
development.



- 2 -
5.        The Second Five-Year Plan (April 1, 1974 to March 31, 1979)
builds on the achievements of the First Plan. While the First Plan
dealt mainly with the urgent needs for stabilization under conditions
of great scarcity of resources, progress has been such that the Second
Plan can give much more weight to such problems as employment, equitable
distribution, regional growth, and education. The Plan identifies a num-
ber of specific low-income target groups and, in general, adopts an
employment-oriented development strategy. It aims at a continued growth
in investments, needed both because capital intensity will tend to in-
crease as the rehabilitation phase draws to an end, and because more
socially-oriented investments will be made. Overall, the Plan expects
GDP to grow at 7.5 percent per annum.
6.        Over the decade 1961-71, Indonesia's population grew by 2.1 per-
cent a year. However, as a result of changes in the age distribution and
declining mortality, the current growth rate is estimated at 2.5 percent.
Even under the most optimistic assumptions with regard to fertility de-
cline, the growth rate would only come down gradually, and the population
would nearly double by the end of the century. While Indonesia still has
substantial unutilized land reserves in the outer islands, 1/ these are
limited in relation to the expected population increase, and a further
large increase in population pressures - already severe on the inner
islands 2/ - must be expected. Since 1969, the Government has been
operating and gradually extending a family planning program. The number
of acceptors has been increasing rapidly. The Second Five-Year Plan
foresees a continued vigorous and much more comprehensive attack on the
population problem.
7.        During the rest of the 'seventies', average annual additions to
the labor force are estimated at 1.2 million, increasing to more than 1.4
million in the years 1980-85. Tn addition, substantial underemployment
exists, and there is the risk that even relatively simple technological
improvements may eliminate some existing employment. The Second Plan's
projections show that employment growth would almost keep up with the
growth in the labor force, but the employment thrust of the Plan needs
to be further strengthened if an appreciable increase in real labor
earnings - and a wider spread of the benefits of development - is to
be attained.
8.        A further acceleration in Indonesia's development efforts should
be possible, given the recent favorable developments in its exports,. and
especially the large increase in the price of oil. Between 1972/73 3/ and

1975/76, the net oil contribution to the balance of payments as well as to
the Government budget is expected to increase by roughly $2.5 billion, or
$20 per capita. In nominal terms, this is equivalent to about 22 percent
of the gross national income in 1972/73. In terms of real goods and serv-
ices available to Indonesia, the gain is however much smaller. The main
offsetting factor is the large increase in import prices over the three
years. Taking this into account, only 30 percent of the original gain
remains; in 1972/73 prices, the net gain is $6 per capita or $750 million
for the economy as a whole, equivalent to 6.5 percent of the 1972/73 GNP.
9.        In terms of the budget, part of the increase in oil revenues has
been used to protect the domestic consumer and the economy against the sharp
price rises in international markets through subsidies on major imported
commodities (rice, fertilizer, wheat, sugar). The prices of these commodi-
ties have risen faster than those of imports in general. Net of current
subsidies, the gains in the 1975/76 budget (as compared to 1972/73) amount
to only about 4.5 percent of the current (non-oil) GNP. Of this amount,
more than half ($700 million in current prices), is being channeled toward
toward public investments. The remainder is being used for current expendi-
tures and for payments due for the subsidies of the preceding year.
10.       From September 1972 to March 1974, the Indonesian economy was
under severe inflationary pressure, initially because of a bad harvest in
the Fall of 1972, and subsequently as a result of the worldwide increase
in commodity prices and the boom conditions in Indonesia itself. By
early 1974, the annual rate of inflation had reached nearly 50 percent.
The Government took a number of measures to remedy the situation in April
1974.  At approximately the same time, international prices of most com-
modities started to fall. Since then, the annual rate of inflation in
Indonesia has declined to about 15 percent and the Government has relaxed
some of the earlier measures.
11.       Recently, Indonesia's balance of payments and budgetary position
have been affected by the inability of PERTAMINA - Indonesia's petroleum
company - to meet all its financial obligations. During 1974/75 PERTAMINA,
which had undertaken a large and diversified investment program for most
of which it had not arranged medium- or long-term financing, faced serious
liquidity problems. It began to withhold the legally obligatary pass-
through to the Government of part of the revenues received from the for-
eign companies, as well as taxes due on its own net income. In addition,
PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due on certain of its short-term foreign
borrowings and some of its other obligations and it faced the prospect of
large similar obligations coming due in 1975/76 which it was not likely to
be able to meet. Decisive corrective action was taken early in March 1975.
The Government resolved to assist PERTAMINA so as to enable it to meet the
outstanding debt service obligations. Furthermore, in order to assure
orderly and coordinated borrowing in the international market, PERTAMINA
and all other state enterprises were instructed to refrain from independent
borrowing abroad, and Bank Indonesia was made responsible for raising from
international commercial sources the needed funds on their behalf. A system-
atic review of PERTAMINA's on-going investment projects and its investment



plans as well as contracts related thereto is currently underway with
a view to alteration, reduction and other steps where necessary. The
results are likely to have a favorable bearing on the pattern of investment
in the years immediately ahead and to result in closer control of major
investment activities undertaken by state enterprises. However, the with-
holding by PERTAMINA of part of the payments due on account of oil company
profits to pay foreign obligations and the advance of funds by Bank Indonesia
for payment of such obligations resulted in levels of foreign exchange re-
serves at the end of 1974/75 of less than $1 billion or about 2.5 months
of imports. For 1975/76, the Government expects to receive all of the pay-
ments due from the operations of foreign oil companies and PERTAMINA which
are made by and through PERTAMINA. It also expects a modest increase in
foreign exchange reserves during that year, partly reflecting planned Bank
Indonesia medium-term borrowing from private banks abroad designed in effect
to refund PERTAMINA's short-term obligations.
12.       Indonesia has a substantial potential for further productive
investment, employment and income growth. In agriculture, a vigorous pur-
suit of on-going programs in irrigation, development of new varieties and
technical services, provision of credit and current inputs, etc., promises
to yield high returns. In addition, development of new areas of food or
tree crops - partly in conjunction with a rapidly growing transmigration
program - has high priority. If production,' employment and incomes grow
rapidly, demand for agricultural products - especially the high-value
ones - will also accelerate, and there will be a need to improve market-
ing and transport facilities. The industrial potential is good, both for
modern capital-intensive natural resource-based activities and for more
labor-intensive, partly export-oriented industries. Industrial activity
needs to be widely spread to enlarge rural family income; this has impli-
cations for the choice and location of future infrastructure projects.
In addition, there is a serious backlog of economic infrastructure re-
quirements in many areas, and a need to improve social infrastructure
over wide areas of the country.
13.       With the increase in resources which have become available since
the Second Plan was prepared, the Government is now clearly set on a course
of accelerated growth in investment, employment and incomes to realize
Indonesia's potentials and improve the welfare of the broad masses of
the people. With a determined effort to mobilize additional resources,
and a judicious use of them - and assuming an international economy which
is reasonably favorable to Indonesia - very significant progress can be
made in this direction. One important element in this strategy will be
to increase employment at such a rate that the labor market would tighten
significantly. This in turn would create self-reinforcing tendencies, as
incomes and demand rise throughout the economy. Thus, the wide spread of
the gains of development is not only a prime objective, but also a vital
tool in the overall strategy. Improvement in the labor market situation
will depend critically on the direct creation of substantial new work
opportunities by the Government in agriculture and in urban and rural
public works.



14.       The resources needed to implement an accelerated investment,
employment and income growth strategy are substantial. Assuming only a
modest overall increase in the capital intensity of the investment program,
and an efficient use of resources, investments would have to double between
1975 and 1980 (for an annual growth rate of 15 percent). Investment would
increase from 23 percent of non-oil national income in 1975 to 29 percent
in 1980 which, in current prices, implies an increase from $3 billion in
1973 to $6.5 billion in 1975 and nearly $20 billion in 1980.
15.       With regard to the foreign exchange requirements for such an
investment progran it appears that, assuming relatively favorable devel-
opments in the export sector (including oil), commitments of foreign funds
to the extent of about $14 billion over the six-year period 1975-1980 will
be necessary; for the first four years the necessary commitments are esti-
mated at $2 billion per annum. In the interest of keeping the debt serv-
ice reasonable, providing for the contingency of a lower oil income, and
leaving room for future borrowing to sustain import growth in the 1980's
when export prospects look less favorable, it will be necessary to borrow
at least three-fourths of the foreign funds on concessional or semi-con-
cessional terms. Under such a borrowing program, and assuming increased
borrowing after 1980, the debt service ratio would reach 10 percent in
1.980 and about 18 percent in the late 1980's. With more pessimistic
assumptions about future prices and exportslof oil, and only a partial
adjustment of imports, the debt service ratio could rise to 15 percent
in 1980 and 25 percent in the late 1980's. Even with a foreign borrowing
of $14 billion over the next six years, the net transfer from abroad would
drop from 6.6 percent of the non-oil national income in 1973 to 2.5 percent
in 1975, 2 percent in 1980 and 1.5 percent in 1985. The Inter-Governmental
Group for Indonesia (IGGI) met recently to consider Indonesia's long-term
development needs and prospects and related 'foreign assistance requirements.
The indications were that at least in 1975/76 the prospects that these re-
quirements would be met were reasonably favorable.
16.       Along with the foreign inflows estimated in the paragraph above
the domestic savings rate would have to be raised from an estimated 21 per-
cent of the non-oil national income in 1975 to over 27 percent in 1980 to
achieve the proposed investment and growth targets. While this will be
difficult, the Government appears committed to it.     One important source
of additional savings would be the gradual reduction of subsidies, which
will become easier to achieve if prices of imported commodities continue
to fall. It would also be desirable to increase some taxes for reasons
of equity.
17.       The Government will also have to take steps to strengthen its
capacity to implement its expanding and complex development program, which
involves large numbers of people over vast geographical areas. To achieve
the objectives, the administrative apparatus and procedures of the Govern-
ment may have to be adapted in important ways. In this context, it appears
that the tendencies toward decentralization of decision making and delega-
tion of responsibility need to be strengthened. Much attention needs to be
given to staff requirements of Government agencies, and a massive training



- 6 -
effort mounted to ensure the availability of adequate staff to carry out the
various programs. To the extent that these training and staffing efforts
would take time, temporary use of additional expatriate expertise may have
to be considered if the development objectives are to be attained.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
18.       As indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue to need substan-
tial external financial and technical assistance to expand and improve
infrastructure and to expand production capabilities and employment oppor-
tunities in agriculture, mining, forestry, manufacturing, construction and
services.  With the continued growth of the economy, the Covernment will
also need to devote increasing attention to ensuring that the benefits
of development are distributed widely. Programs to increase the produc-
tivity of smallholder farmers and to resettle farmers from Java on pres-
ently unutilized areas in the outer islands, the expansion of labor-in-
tensive industry in Java, the development of new industrial activities
in Java and the outer islands, family planning, water supply, education,
health and other social programs will therefore have an important place
in the development strategy. during the period of the Second Plan. The
work of both the Bank's headquarters and Resident Staff has been oriented
toward these objectives.
19.       As of April 30, 1975, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits
amounting to $561.8 million artd six Bank loans amounting to $317.5 million.
IFC investments total $58.4 million. Future lending to Indonesia is ex-
pected to be in the form of Bank loans and IFC investments. The Bank Group
accounted for about 4.5 percent of Indonesia's total outstanding public debt
at the end of 1974. By 1978 it is expected to account for less than 11 per-
cent of total outstanding debt and less than 5 percent of Indonesia's annual
debt service obligations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1975, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       In accordance with the priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year Plans,
about one-third of Bank Group lending to date has been for agriculture.
IDA has e,tended four credits to help rehabilitate Government agricultural
estates, producing principally rubber, oil palm and tea, six to assist
rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation systems servicing millions of
smallholders on Java, two for fisheries and one each for improved deeds
multiplication, beef cattle development, smallholder rubber development,
sugar industry rehabilitation and smallholder tea development. Industry
is of growing importance to the Indonesian economy and the Bank Group has
assisted in six projects in this sector: two to expand PIJSRI's fertilizer
production capacity, two for BAPINDO and one for the Private Development
Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI) to help these development finance
companies expand their industrial lending and one for Indonesia's first
industrial estate project.   Other sectors to which loans and credits have



- 7 -
been extended are power, transportation, telecommunications, education,
population, urban housing improvement and water supply. In addition, four
credits have been made to assist the Government in preparing and formulating
appropriate development programs and projects.
21.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and almost half
of all loans and credits have been made since June 1972. Bank lending to
Indonesia began only in June 1974. The program has increased rapidly from a
relatively small base, and consequently the undisbursed portion of loans
and credits is substantial. Moreover, several credits have financed proj-
ects planned for execution over extended periods. Many, in addition, have
been associated with institutional reforms involving, inter alia, the
creation and reorganization of program and project authorities, drafting
of new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which has taken
time. Thus, a number of projects have experienced delays in the initial
stages of implementation, and some are inherently slow disbursing. How-
ever, the performance of most project agencies has improved continuously
as organizational improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian
staff have become more experienced in project execution.     Despite the
improved administrative capabilities, most development projects, includ-
ing those financed by the Bank Group, have been adversely affected by cum-
bersome budgetary, procurement and customs clearance procedures. The
Indonesian authorities recognize the need to streamline procedures and are
considering steps necessary to accomplish this. As a first step, the Gov-
ernment has requested and weIhave arranged for assistance under the Fourth
Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 451-IND) to establish an effective
control system in the National Develoment Planning Board (BAPPENAS) to
monitor the progress of development projects. Additional measures to im-
prove project administration are now under consideration by the Government.
22.       The future Bank lending program is intended to continue to sup-
port the Government's efforts to speed up economic growth and to ensure
that the benefits of development are distributed widely. Specifically,
it will give high priority to agriculture, concentrating on broad programs
of support to increase production of rice and other crops on the inner
islands and to expand resettlement and agricultural production on the
less populated outer islands. Emphasis will also be given to socially-
orientecd projects in the fields of population and nutrition, education
and urban development.   The Bank program will also continue to provide
support for the Government in developing the additional industrial
capacity and infrastructure which are essential to economic growth.
Projects for natural resource surveying and mapping, transmigration and
rural development, education, marine transport and highways have been
appraised and are expected Lo be ready for presentation in the first
half of FY1976.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Background
23.       Historically, the power sector in Indonesia has been very weak,
anid the lack-of an adequate power supply has constrained economic growth.
Prior to Independence in 1949, the very limited electric power facilities
were operated by privately-owned companies mainly for lighting purposes
in major cities. In the mid-1950's, the Goverrnment nationalized these
companies giving responsiblity for power to the Ministry of Public Works
,od Power.  Due to new and inexperienced management, inadequate financial
planning and control, and a shortage of foreign exchange for procurement
of spare parts, the Government was unable to prevent serious deterioration
of plant and equipment or to undertake any significant expansion of capac-
ity. As a result, the Government coald not satisfy the rapidly accelerating
demand for residential and industrial power, and this led to substantial,
highi-cost, private investment in "captive" generating facilities.
24.       During the period of the First Five-Year Development Plan the
Government concentrated its efforts in the power sector principally
on rehabilitating existing facilities together with modest establishment
of new facilities. During this period, public generating capacity in-
creased by about 40 percent, but the increase in demand for power far
exceeded increases in capacity. The present publicly installed capac-
ity of 7 watts per capita and the electricity consumption of 17 kwh
per capita are among the lowest in the world. The Second Five-Year
Plan therefore provides for a very substantial increase in generation
capacity and in related transmission and distribution facilities.
PLN
25.        In 1965, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) was created as the
national electricity authority under the direct control of the Ministry of
Public Works and Electric Power. PLN had little autonomy and was almost
totally dependent on Government budgetary allocations, partly out of for-
eign aid, to meet its financial requirements. Responsibility for planning
and implementing new construction continued to rest with the Ministry of
Public Works. At the time of the first Bank Group involvement in the power
sector in 1969, PLN suffered from extreme organizational and financial
wetakness. The division of responsiblity between the Government and PLN
was not clearly defined, financial records were chaotic and the company
was suffering serious financial losses. To help improve this situation,
the Bank Group helped finance (under IDA Credits 155 and 334-IND) a compre-
hensive management consultant effort for which the French firm, SOFRELEC,
was selected with Peat, Marvick and Mitchell as sub-contractors for account-
ing. After a two-year period, SOFRELEC was able to help PLN to reconstruct
its records, assess physical facilities, verify and settle outstanding con-
sumer accounts, recommend an appropriate tariff structure, prepare a func-
tional organizational plan and initiate standard procedures for accounting,



- 9 -
inventory control and consumer administration. Many of these recommenda-
tions are now being implemented. However, further efforts are necessary
to improve system planning, construction management and personnel adminis-
tration. The proposed project provides for personnel training and man-
agement assistance in these and other important areas to help PLN imple-
ment SOFRELEC recommendations.
26.       SOFRELEC also helped to prepare a new charter for PLN, which was
put into effect in 1972. The new charter gives PLN sole authority except
as it may delegate to generate, transmit and distribute power and to con-
struct, own and operate power facilities in accordance with sound commercial
practices. While the improved charter gives PLN greater authority, the Min-
istry of Public Works and Power maintains broad control over PLN's external
borrowing, investment program and personnel policies. This situation re-
flects a conscious Government policy of retaining close supervision over
important sectors of the economy and the public enterprises which operate
therein. The management board consists of a President-Director and four
directors responsible, respectively, for planning, construction, operations
and administration (including finance). The President-Director reports
to the Minister of Public Works and Power and the Directors report in
their respective fields to the President-Director. PLN has a total staff
of 21,160. However, there are an insufficient number of highly trained
staff and substantial upgrading of skills ig necessary. A large program
of overseas fellowships and in-country training is included in the pro-
posed project to improve the level of staff competence.
27.       With the improvement in financial records, it was clear at the
time of the appraisal of the Third Power Project (Credit 399-IND) in late
1972 that PLN's financial position was even weaker than had been previously
realized. To solve this problem, PLN in agreement with the Bank prepared
a financial recovery plan, which was incorporated as a central element
of the Third Power Project. The plan covers all aspects of PLN's opera-
tions and is designed to improve PLN's management capabilities and finan-
cial situation so that it can by 1978/79 cover, through sales revenues,
all operating costs, including adequate provision for depreciation and bad
debts, as well as taxes. Thereafter, PLN would cover through sales rev-
enues all operating costs and make a reasonable contribution toward new
capital investments (Section 4.03(a) Project Agreement). Indications
are that the interim target of 80 percent revenue/cost coverage has
been attained in 1974/75. A progress report on the Recovery Plan was
submitted to the Executive Directors of the Bank on July 16, 1974 (IDA/
Sec M74-230). During 1975/76, PLN, under its recovery plan, will con-
centrate on improving the performance of the construction department by
streamlining procurement, contract management and budgeting procedures.
Attention will also be given to strengthening PLN's on-going training
program and introducing a comprehensive insurance system. PLN will con-
tinue to implement its recovery plan under the proposed project (Schedule
2, Part B of the Loan Agreement and Section 2.04, Project Agreement).

Present Facilities and Expected Growth
28.       During the First Five-Year Plan period, electricity sales in West
Java increased at an average annual rate of more than 16 percent. This
growth would have been even higher if PLN had been able to expand its
capacity more rapidly. A recently-completed study by its consultant,
Chas. T. Main, indicates that PLN would have to increase its supply capac-
ity at an annual rate of 32 percent in West Java to satisfy the potential
demand by 1982. At present, PLN has a supply capability of about 325 MW
in West Java. As of November 1974, PLN had additional applications pending
in West Java for 330 MVA for 1975 and 210 MVA for 1976. To meet this demand
alone would require a tripling of generating capacity in two years. Due to
PLN's inability to satisfy rapidly expanding demand for power, private cap-
tive plant now accounts for between 40-60 percent of total installed capac-
ity (public plus captive). To cope with the rapidly growing power demand,
PLN has begun installing gas turbines as a stop-gap measure until the first
base-load unit at Muara Karauig is commissioned in late 1977. In order to
help create a sound basis for further power development on Java, Credit
399 provided funds for a system development study which will establish
power sector investment priorities. Consultants (Preece Cardew, and
Rider) have been selected, and the study was beguin in November 1974.
29.       The appraisal report estimates that PLN will be able to increase
sales at an average annual rate of about 14 percent during the period of
the Second Five-Year Plan and at 25-30 percent thereafter. To achieve
this rate of growth, PLN will need to invest an estimated $2.8 billion
between now and 1983 to provide about 3,000 MW of generation capacity
and related transmission and distribution facilities. It will also need
to continue to devote major efforts to improving its organizational effi-
ciency.  But even with organization improvements and relaxation of finan-
cial constraints, it is unlikely that PLN can fully satisfy the growing
demand for power during the coining decade.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
30.       After a review in 1969 of deficiencies in the power sector in
Indonesia, IDA provided two Credits in 1969 and 1972 (Nos. 165 and 334-IND),
totaling $55 million, which focused on the rehabilitation and expansion
of distribution facilities in. the Jakarta area. Despite delays due
to cumbersome construction management and procurement procedures and
an increase in the foreign exchange costs of the program, substantial
progress has been made in alleviating institutional bottlenecks and
in completing these projects. A third IDA Credit (No. 399-IND) in
1973 provided $46 million to assist with the development of the first
two 100 MW units of the Muara Karang power station near Jakarta. Due
mainly to international inflation, but also as a result of some changes
in project scope, the total estimated cost of the project has increased
by $54 million or more than 100 percent including a $30 million increase
in foreign exchange costs above the appraisal report estimate; the Govern-
ment will finance all the additional cost. Agreement has been reached



- 11 -
with PLN on a revised list of items to be financed under Credit 399;
under these arrangements, IDA would not contribute to financing minor
equipment or the general construction contract(s) for Units 1 and 2.
The proposed project as well as future Bank projects now under prep-
aration would further assist PLN in increasing generation capacity
at Muara Karang and other sites and in continuing the expansion of
its transmission and distribution network in West Java.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
31.       The proposed project is one of a series identified by the Bank
Group as high priority investments needed to increase power generation,
transmission, and distribution within the Jakarta-West Java region of
Indonesia. A Bank mission appraised the proposed project in December
1974. Negotiations were held in April 1975. The leader of the Govern-
ment's negotiating team was Mr. Ely Soengkono, Secretary General, Min-
istry of Public Works and Power. Appraisal Report (No. 766-IND) on
the proposed project is being circulated to the Executive Directors
separately. A loan and project summary is contained in Annex III of
this report.
Project Description
32.       The proposed project would provide for the expansion of the
Muara Karang thermal power station near Jakarta by the addition of a
third non-reheat, oil-fired generating unit of 100 MW capacity. When
commissioned in 1979, this unit will increase the total installed capac-
ity available to the West Java and Jakarta area to about 900 MW. The
project also includes the engineering design of a fourth unit at Muara
Karang of 200 MW capacity and for a study of a new site for a thermal
power station in West Java to be commissioned early in the 1980's. To
strengthen PLN's staff capabilities the project includes the construc-
tion, equipment, and advisors for three technical training centers;
an overseas fellowship program for supervisory personnel; and six man-
agement advisors to serve for a two-year period after the present
SOFRELEC team concludes its work in mid-1976. As under Credit 399,
the next stages of PLN's financial recovery plan are incorporated in
the project.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
33.       The estimated total financial cost of the project is $69.5 mil-
lion, including interest during construction on the proposed Bank loan.
The estimated foreign exchange component amounts to $50.4 million. The
cost estimates for equipment and construction were prepared by Black
& Veatch International (BVI) of the USA, the consulting firm retained



- 12 -
by PLN for engineering design of the first two units at Muara Karang.
Cost estimates for major items of equipment are based on the bid prices
for units 1 and 2 which included an option for unit 3.    The cost estimates
provide for a physical contingency of five percent for equipment and
10 percent for construction, which is reasonable because the project
design is well advanced. Price contingencies averaging about eight
percent have been estimated for major equipment items on the basis
of escalation provisions included in the bid proposals.     Appropriate
price contingencies have been included for small items of equipment
and civil works to take into account estimated levels of domestic and
international inflation. The overall price contingencies amotnt to
about.21 percent of project costs including allowances for physical
contingencies.
34.       The proposed Bank loan of $41.0 million would provide 59
percent of the total financing required for the project. The proposed
loan would finance the foreign exchange requirements of the project,
except interest during construction and the training center equipment,
which would be financed by PLN.
35.       The Bank loan would be made to the Government for a term of
25 years, including five years of grace. Unlike under previous power
projects in Indonesia, where the proceeds of IDA credits were made avail-
able by the Government to PLN in the form of equity, the proceeds oE the
proposed Bank loan would be relent to PLN under a subsidiary loan agree-
ment acceptable to the Bank; conclusion of this agreemeLnt is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan. The subsidiary loan would be
on the same repayment terms and interest rate as the Bank loan. Licwevet,
interest would be capitalized during the grace period; the Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk. The Government's contribution
to project costs not financed by the proposed Bank loan is expected
to be made available to PLN in the form of equity. The decision to
pass on the proceeds of the Bank loan as a loan rather than equity was
based on PLN's improved financial position and resulting capacity to
service debt in the future.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Bids for the supply of major equipment for the first two gen-
eration units at Muara Karang included option offers for the third unit,
which remain valid until November 1975. PLN intends to accept these
options, since the prices are reasonable and this would allow the third
unit to be completed at least six months sooner than would otherwise be
possible. Additional advantages can be expected through equipment stand-
ardization and simplified engineering and construction work. This is
acceptable to the Bank. Other items of equipment would be procured on
the basis of new tenders, in accordance with Bank Guidelines on interna-
tional competitive bidding; for purposes of bid comparison, qualified
local manufacturers would receive a margin of preference of 15 percent
or the level of customs duties, whichever is less. In the interest



- 1 3 -
of economic and expeditious project implementation, the general con-
struction contract(s) would be tendered for all three units together,
and in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A margin of preference for
local contractors has not been provided because the general construction
is basically a supply and erection contract with substantial foreign
cost involved and beyond the capability of local contractors.    However,
local contractors would, in all probability, be associated with the work
as sub-contractors.
37.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of the for-
eign exchange costs of supply contracts for imported equipment and mate-
rials and 95 percent of the ex-factory price of such items contracted
locally; 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services
and training fellowships; and 30 percent of the cost of the general
construction contracts up to $12.4 million. By disbursing 30 percent
for the general construction contract, an amount equivalent to the for-
eign exchange component for unit 3, the Bank will be closely associated
with the construction of all three units.
PLN's Future Financial Position
38.       As indicated in paragraph 27, PLN has made satisfactory progress
in meeting the interim targets set out in its financial recovery plan, and
present indications are that it will reach its target of covering operating
costs through sales revenues by 1978/79. In 1973, PLN increased its tariff
level by 40 percent. Current charges have been further increased to reflect
the higher fuel costs established in April of this year. The need for
future tariff increases will depend on the rate at which PLN is able to
improve its operational efficiency. This matter will be kept under close
and continuing review to ensure that PLN increases its tariffs as necessary
to meet the targets set out in its recovery plan and at the same time in-
creases its efficiency.
39.       In order to guard against PLN incurring an excessive debt burden,
a covenant requiring Bank concurrence for borrowing whenever the maximum
future annual debt service would not be covered by the most recent actual
annual net revenues was agreed during negotiations (Section 4.05 of the
Project Agreement).
40.       In the past, unpaid bills posed a serious problem for PLN.
Government agencies were particularly slow in paying their electricity
bills. The IDA Credit Agreement for Credit 334-IND contained a covenant
requiring Government agencies to pay their debts promptly and they have.
A similar covenant requiring payment when due is incorporated in the Loan
Agreement for the proposed project (Section 3.03). Accounts receivabl-e
for non-government customers have been reduced to an acceptable level of
about three months billing; a covenant to maintain this position has been
included in the proposed Project Agreement (Section 4.06).

Project Benefits
41.       At present, industrial expansion is seriously constrained by
the lack of an adequate power supply and improvements in the public power
sector are essential if the Indonesian economy is to grow as anticipated
by more than 7 percent annually in the next five years. The most efficient
immediate means of increasing the installed capacity in West Java is the
expansion of the Mluara Karang thermal power station in Jakarta. To make
maximum use of the site it is necessary to proceed quickly with the
installation of a third 100 MW unit and the engineering design of two
larger 200 MW units to complete the station.    This procedure will ensure
the largest increase in generating capacity in the shortest possible
time and at the least cost. The rate of return based on costs and rev-
enues estimated to be in effect at the time of project commissioning is
expected to be 19 percent for unit 3 and 17 percent for all three units
combined. The higher return for unit 3 alone is the result of certain
investments in facilities common to the entire Muara Karang Plant having
been included in the cost of the first two units. The project conforms
wiLh environmental control standards recommended by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and no major ecological problems are expected.
42.        The proposed project would continue the close association of the
Bank with the efforts being taken to strengthen PLN. Both the Government.
anid PLN, itself, recognize the problems of continuing institutional weakness
and are, with the assistance of consultants, taking steps to increase PLN's
management efficiency, financial viability, and staff productivity.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Indo-
nesia, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Perusahaan Unum Listrik
Negara, Supplemental Letters to the Agreements, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.       Features of the Agreements of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 27, 39 and 40 of this report.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agremeent of the Bank.
PART VT - RECOMMENDATION
51.        1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 127     Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well util-
ized and disbursements are 98 percent of appraisal timetable. Completion
of the project is expected to be delayed in order to complete much needed
additional drainage work, the financing of which was not provided for under
the credit. These additional costs will be met by the Government. The
revised economic rate of return on the project, which was calculated at
50 percent at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25 percent. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154     Highway:  US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Rehabilitation work was substantially completed prior to the
original closing date. However, it was necessary to postpone the closing
date by one year to December 31, 1975 to complete procurement of a small
amount of equipment and materials.
Cr. No. 155     Agricultural Estates:   US$16 M,illion Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
With recent improvements in management and much higher interna-
tional prices the financial situtation of the estate groups is improving.
The field and factory standards have now been raised to a good technical
level and the management has been advised to concentrate on cost control
in order to prepare for the time when produce prices are less attractive
than they are today. The combined efforts of the management, consultants
and IDA supervision missions are yielding good results.
Cr. No. 165     Electricity Distribution:   US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
See comment for Credit No. 334. The closing date has been
postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced eval-
uation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 193     PUSRI Fertilizer:   US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1973); Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance test and
is operating at close to rated capacity. The gas gathering and transmission
system is also completed and sufficient gas is being delivered to the plant.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by the closing date of December 31,
1975.
Cr. No. 194     Second Agricultural Estates:   US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
After initial delays, there have been considerable improvements
in management and these, combined with high prices for palm oil and rubber,
have resulted in a much stronger financial position, particularly for the
oil palm group (PNP VI). On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort is
necessary to improve fertilizer application and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment on both estate groups, there is a need
to employ expertise in financial planning and management, which are now
the main constraints on efficient development.
Cr. No. 195     Second Irrigation Rehabilitat.ion:  US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Problems of quality and progress of construction still exist,
but the consultants are tackling these vigorously, and the situation is
improving, although not sufficiently to make up for earlier delays.
Costs are likely to double the overall appraisal estimate, due to in-
flation, but the Government will provide any-additional funds required.
Completion of disbursements will be about two years behind the original
schedule. The economic rate of return is however still more than 20%.
Cr. No. 210     Telecommunications Expansion:   US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; CLosing Date: December 31, 1975
Contracts for all equipment have been awarded.    The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months due to delays in delivery of goods.     The
Government has increased the tariffs to achieve the required rate of return
and a new charter for PERUMTEL has also been published.
Cr. No. 211     Fisheries:  US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project supplies funds for the construction of 30 fully
equipped skipjack boats and technical assistance. It is about 24 months
behind the original schedule due to delays in engaging the consultants
and in executing the contracts for the shore facilities. No further
delay is anticipated. There have been very substantial project cost



ANNEX II
Page 5of 1.1 pages
increases (from $4.3 million to $8.5 million). Because of the greatly
increased skipjack prices, however, the project is still expected to be
financially viable.
Cr. No. 219     Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation is satisfactory. Civil works for the
five Technical Training Centers (TTCs) have been completed. All furniture
deliveries and installation have also been completed. About 90% of the
equipment has been purchased and about 60% delivered and installed. Three
TTCs commenced operation in April 1975 and the remaining two, will commence
in June 1975. All will operate at full capacity by January 1976 when the
new academic year begins.   Over 500 technical teachers have completed or
are about to complete their training.    Technical assistance financed by
the U.K. for the project is also satisfactory. Disbursement has improved
considerably.   Revised total project cost is now about 40% above appraisal
estimate.   The Government will finance the cost overrun.    The project is
expected to be completed ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 220     Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Construction remains about two to three years behind schedule
partly because of problems with preparation of contract documents and
subsequently due to inflation. These have now been mostly overcome.
While no further delays are e5pected, it is unlikely that the time lost
could be regained. There has been a considerable increase in overall
project costs, which is being met by the Government. The economic rate
of return for the project is still over 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246     Seeds:  US$7.5 Million Credit of May 14, 1971;
Closing Date:   September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays
in organization, management, procurement and provision of budgetary funds.
Tne latest supervision mission has reported that developnent of the seed
fann is hampered by the slow execution of a contract to develop irrigation
infrastructure and the seed processing plant.    The contract for irrigation
infrastruCtujre has been renegotiated. The establishment of rice-seed
research facilities at the project site is behind schedule due to diffi-
culties in recruiting the necessary technical assistance and delays in
providing the required facilities and the equipment. The contract for
research technical assistance has now been signed and with the reorgani-
zation of the Government's research program, this component of the project
is expected to proceed rapidly. The seeds certification service is per-
forming well and development of the Klaten Seed District is progressing
satisfactorily. This project is being kept under frequetit supervision.

Page 6 of 11 pages
Cr. No. 259     Tea:  US$15 Million Credit of June 14, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded appraisal
expectations necessitating construction and rehabilitation of 3 additional
factories. Project completion estimated for December 1977 can probably be
advanced by up to one year. Rising costs are creating pressure on fund
availabilities and the main challenge for the two PTP's will be to de-
crease working capital requirements, reduce overhead and indirect costs
and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260     Second Highway:   US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
All construction work is now satisfactorily under way. However,
the delay caused initially by slow progress in mobilizing contractors,
difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and land slides will
result in the project being completed about one year behind schedule.
Design standards for the road sections have been slightly lowered and
some savings will therefore be achieved. These and other savings are
expected to offset construction cost increases.
Cr. No. 275     Third Technical Assistance:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on this pr6ject is satisfactory. The closing date
has been postponed to complete disbursements for ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288     Second Education:   US$6.3 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Working drawings and furniture and equipment lists for all
project institutions have been completed. Physical facilities will be
completed and all project institutions will begin operations by the end
of 1976. The government has agreed to provide additional funds to meet
the cost overruns due to inflation. Postponement of the closing date
by about one year is likely to be necessary.
Cr. No. 289     Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$12.5 Million
Credit of March 9, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Civil works and equipment purchase for the main project, Pekalen-
Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be about two
years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are likely to
be substantially higher than appraisal estimates. Consultants for the
various studies are at work with their counterparts. Groundwater in-
vestigations have been delayed due to procurement difficulties. The
rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule. Dis-
bursements are also on schedule.

Cr. No. 300     PopTlation:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Although progress is being made under this project, implementa-
tion continues to be hampered by management weaknesses. Lack of clear
administrative direction has resulted in overall delays in securing bud-
getary funds- and problems of program coordination. Procurement contracts
for vehicles and other equipment have been awarded and UNICEF is assisting
in the procurement of materials and supplies necessary for various popula-
tion control programs. The civil works component is behind schedule, but
is now proceeding more rapidly as the capacity of the implementing agency
gradually improves.   The field worker progran has expanded more rapidly
than expected when the project was appraised. This project is being super-
vised closely.
Cr. No. 310     Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I):    US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Closing Date:    December 31, 1976
This credit is fully committed.    Disbursements are expected to
rise rapidly.
Cr. No. 318     Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:   US$8.5 Million Credit
of June 28, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory and disbursements are
expected to rise.
Cr. No. 319     Fourth Agricultural Estates:   US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The physical progress of the project is ahead of the appraisal
schedule and the financial position of the estate group is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 334     Second Electricity Distribution:   US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND
and 334-IND (together $55 million) has encountered substantial foreign
cost increases ($7.0 million) and implementation delays due to procure-
ment problems and cumbersome management procedures.    Many of these diffi-
culties have been resolved, but it is unlikely that the project can be
completed before mid-1978, two years behind the original schedule.
Cr. No. 355     Beef Cattle Development:   US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Closing Date:   March 31, T98
Progress on this project for development of beef cattle produc-
tion in the outer islands has suffered from serious delays caused largely
by problems in securing Government funds and in clearance of documents
by Indonesian Government departments and consequent lack of essential
equipment. Land acquisition and procurement of cattle are proving more



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 11 pages
difficult than expected, and there has been a substantial increase in total
project costs. The means of improving project performance are currently
being discussed with the Government.
Cr. No. 358     North Sumatra Smallholder Development:    US$5 Million Credit
of February 14, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project has suffered from severe financial and organiza-
tional difficulties due primarily to the lack of experience of project
management, the remote location of the project and inadequate Central
Government support.   The Resident Staff has been following the project
closely. The rubber replanting program is behind schedule, but with
progrets now being made it may be possible to accelerate the program in
accordance with appraisal estimates. Government has taken a number of
steps to overcome the problems and accelerate project implementation.
Project progress will continue to be closely monitored.
Cr. No. 387     Third Education:   US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Project implementation is proceeding on schedule, except for
a 10-month delay in equipment procurement which has now been overcome.
Manuscript testing of the first set of texts has been completed. About
34 million textbooks are scheduled to be printed in August, 1975. Dis-
tribution of textbooks to all primary schools is now being planned and
will necessitate the use of a number of government agencies.     Staff in
the provinces have been trained in the use of the textbooks and train-
ing courses have commenced for teachers. Lack of travel funds in the
provinces has impeded teacher training, but it is expected that this
difficulty will be overcome as the project management, which is effec-
tive, becomes more familiar with government procedures. Project costs
are now estimated at $56 million, 44% above the original estimate because
of increased costs of paper and teacher training. The Government is ex-
pected to meet all cost increases.
Cr. No. 388     Third Highways:  US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Construction bidding and consultant selection have been pro-
ceeding on schedule. Some cost increases, due to inflation, are
expected.
Cr. No. 399     West Java Thermal Power:   US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids received in November 1974 for the first two 100 mw units
at Muara Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time
of appraisal. This, together with construction cost increases, has
resulted in an increase in the total project cost of more than 100
percent. The Government will finance the additional cost. PLN has
satisfactorily met the first year targets in its financial recovery
plan provided for under the terms of the credit agreement.

Cr. No. 400     Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:   US$7.8 Million Credit
of June 22, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
The project nurseries are well managed and where rehabilitation
has taken place results are encouraging. Technical questions related to
loan applications by farmers have been resolved and BRI is expected to
proceed with extending credits to tea growers. The contract of the
financial advisor to BRI has been extended for another year.     Progress
on this project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 405     Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:   US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Bids for equipment required for first phase major rehabilitation
have been received; a substantial cost overrun is expected, which the Gov-
ernment has agreed to finance. Some organizational problems are now being
resolved and disbursements are expected to rise.
Cr. No. 428     Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:   US$16.5 Million Credit
of Septmber 14, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Despite recent increase in construction costs, the project
remains financially viable because revenues from the sale of plots has
risen proportionately. Construction has fallen behind schedule due to
land acquisition problems, but developed land is being occupied as fast
as it is made available. While there is still a backlog of applications
for industrial plots, the rate, of new applications has fallen off during
recent months and the estate is intensifying its promotional efforts.
Cr. No. 436     Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI):
US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
After a long start-up period and difficulties in finding and
recruiting qualified local staff, PDFCI has now reached the operating
stage. Its commitments are rising at a satisfactory rate.
Cr. No. 451     Fourth Technical Assistance:   US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479     Bali Tourism:  US$16.0 Million Credit of
June 4, 1974; Closing Date: August 31, 1979
Progress under this project is slightly behind schedule due to
the lack of experience of the implementing agency and difficulties in
coordination with other Government organizations. This situation has
steadily improved as local staff have gained experience and project
advisors have taken up their positions. Final design of the infrastruc-
ture and hotel training school is underway. Preliminary lease negotia-
tions with potential hotel investors are expected to begin in mid-May.

Cr. No. 480     Fisheries Credit:   US$6.5 Million Credit of
June 4, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This credit became effective on January 8, 1975 and is prog-
ressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 514     Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension:   US$30.0 Million
Credit of October 3, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This credit became effective on January 10, 1975 and the work
will commence soon.
Loan No. 1005 Railway: US$48.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Procurement of material and equipment was delayed due to poor
procurement organization and inadequate budget allocations for 1974/75;
however, this situation has improved since PJKA retained the services
of an international procurement agency. Due largely to a lack of spare
parts an increasing number of locomotives have dropped out of service,
causing a decline in freight traffic. To attain financial viability
as agreed in the Loan Documents, PJKA needs to increase revenues by at
least 10%. Therefore, in May 1975 freight tariffs were substantially
increased. A draft of the detailed recovery program for FY1975, due
to the Bank in September 1974, has not been received.
Loan No. 1040   Jakarta Urban levelopment:   US$25.0 Million Loan
of September 27, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The first year of the two-year Kampung Improvement Program has
been satisfactorily completed. The second year's activities are well
underway with first year savings being applied to increase the water
stupply beyond originally planned levels. The newly formed National Urban
Development Corporation is currently seeking consultants both to assist in
the development of their operations and to prepare urban projects in other
cities. Full responsibility for supervision of consultants designing the
Klender Site and Service scheme has been transferred to NUDC so as to
ensure preparation of a design with standards appropriate to the low-
income target population.
Loan No. 1049   Five Cities Water Supply:   US$14.5 Million Loan
of October 31, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980

Procurement:         Major equipment items would be procured on the basis
of options quoted by bidders for the first two units
at Muara Karang. Tenders for these bids were issued
under terms of IDA Credit No. 399-IND in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. Smaller items would also
be procured after international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Guidelines. A 15 percent
margin of preference or the level of actual customs
duties, whichever is less, would be accorded to
qualified local manufacturers. The general con-
struction contract for the units 1-3 would be ten-
dered on the basis of international competitive
bidding.
Consultants:         PLN has retained engineering consultants Black &
Veatch International (BVI) for the project and for
the design of the fourth generating unit at Muara
Karang. Consultants have yet to be selected for
the study of a proposed site for a new thermal
power station in West Java.
Economic Rate
of Return:         The economic rate of return for Unit 3 at Muara
Karang is 19 percent. For all three units it is
17 percent because some facilities common to all
three units were included in the costs for the
first two units.
Appraisal Report:    Report No. 766-IND, dated May 20, 1975.
