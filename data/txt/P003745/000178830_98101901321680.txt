APPRAISAL OF THE
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
(i)       This report covers the appraisal of the Fourth Power Project con-
sisting of the third 100 MW oil-fired generating unit of the Muara Karang
thermal power development, consulting services for the design of the fourth
unit (200 MW) of the same station as well as for site investigation of a
future development, and advisory services and training. Total cost is
estimated at US$69.5 million equivalent, of which US$50.4 million is in the
foreign exchange component. A Bank Loan of US$41 million equivalent is
proposed representing the Project's foreign exchange cost excluding equip-
ment for the training centers and interest on the Bank Loan during con-
struction. Bank financing would cover 59% of the project cost.
(ii)      The Project is the extension of the Muara Karang development,
located on the bank of the Java sea in Jakarta, for which IDA had provided
financing of the foreign exchange component of Units 1 and 2 through Credit
399-IND (US$46 million equivalent). Since the appraisal of Credit 399 in
late-1972 dramatic cost increases have occurred. Based on results of bids
for major equipment and a required design change of common facilities (in
particular the intake structure for cooling water), the total estimated
cost increased from $52 million to $106 million or by about US$54 million
out of which US$30 million are foreign exchange. It was decided that the
Bank Group would not finance any part of the cost overrun and the Government
and PLN would have to raise the funds. Consequently, IDA financing of
Units 1 and 2 represents 42% of the total cost. For all three units together
Bank Group financing amounts to 49%.
(iii)     The potential growth of the power market is very high; it has been
estimated that PLN would have to increase sales by about 30% per year in the
West Java-area to catch up with the demand it is supposed to satisfy, which
presently has to be covered through captive plant or is suppressed. Due to
financial as well as physical constraints present assumptions are that PLN
is likely to be able to satisfy at most sales increases from about 14%
(1974/75) to 30% (1983/84) in West Java (location of the Project) and 14% to
25% in other areas.
(iv)      The Muara Karang scileme is an essential element in the provision
of urgently required base load capacity in West Java. Despite the above-
mentioned cost increases, the internal economic return of the first three
100 MW units including investments required to market the station's output



- ii -
is about 17%. For the Project alone the respective return is 19%, reflecting
that investments for common facilities are included in Units 1 and 2. Further-
more, the Project represents the least-cost solution for discount rates up to
23%.
(v)       Procurement of the goods and services financed from proceeds of
the proposed Loan will be carried out on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding under Bank Guidelines. Local preference in bid evaluation
will apply to purchases of equipment and material. It is expected that use
can be made of the options quoted for major equipment in the bidding for
Units 1 and 2.
(vi)      The Financial Recovery Plan as included in the Credit 399-IND
documents is underway and PLN is expected to achieve the financial targets
stipulated therein. Positive results have been achieved in most of the
management improvement activities, particularly in the fields of training,
operation and finance. Unfortunately the efforts to improve construction
management activities are lagging behind. They will be the subject of
continued close supervision in future. Special training and management
consulting efforts included in the proposed Loan are expected to further
enhance PLN's development.
(vii)     The engineering consultants' investigations indicate that no
ecological problems are foreseen. Design standards match the ones of the
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since Indonesia has not yet
established its own standards for environmental quality.
(viii)    The proposed Loan would not only assist in financing badly needed
expansion of generating capacity, it would also provide the vehicle for
continued Bank Group involvement in the process of institution building in
PLN which started successfully with the previous Credits. Therefore,
with agreements reached during negotiations, a loan of US$41 million with
a 25 year term (including 5 years of grace) is recommended.

APPRAISAL OF THE
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested financial assistance for
a Project consisting of the third 100 MW unit for the oil-fired Muara Karang
station (Jakarta) including engineering consulting services for Unit 4, site
investigation of a future development, and advisory services and training.
Consequently, a loan of US$41 million equivalent for a term of 25 years inclu-
ding 5 years of grace covering the expected foreign exchange cost of the
Project, exclusive of equipment for the training centers and interest on the
Bank Loan during construction, is proposed. The Loan would be granted to
the Government of Indonesia which will loan the funds to Perusahaan Umum
Listrik Negara (PLN), the Beneficiary, at terms equivalent to the Bank Loan.
1.02      The Loan would be the fourth Bank Group operation in the power
sector with PLN as the beneficiary in all cases. The first two credits (165
and 334-IND) were made to help finance the rehabilitation and expansion of
the Jakarta electricity distribution system, whereas Credit 399-IND contri-
buted to the construction of Units 1 and 2 of the Muara Karang development.
1.03      All three credits provide for a comprehensive management
and accounting consulting effort aimed at making PLN a sound public utility.
Credits 165 and 334 provided the funds required for financing the consultants
and initiated the basic activities such as drafting laws and accounting
systems, and making a tariff study. With the successful completion of these
tasks, Credit 399-IND introduced an organized system of activities aimed at
leading PLN to financial recovery in fiscal year 1978/79. The proposed Loan
continues the institution building effort through financing the foreign cost
of management advisers, training specialists and overseas fellowships.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. H. Maeda and K. Stichenwirth
and is based on information obtained with the cooperation of Mr. E. B. Arnold
during the mission to Indonesia in November/December 1974.
II. THE POWER SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      Indonesia has a total land area of approximately 1.9 million km2.
But because the archipelago extends over a sea surface about 5 times larger,



- 2 -
distances are much longer than the country's size suggests-about 5,000 km
east-west and 2,000 km north-south. Latest estimates place the population
at 130 million, growing at an annual rate of about 2.5%. The population
is distributed unevenly; almost two-thirds live on the island of Java which
represents only 7% of the total land area. The population density on Java
is about 600 inhabitants per km2, one of the highest in the world.
2.02      The Second Five-Year Development Plan 1974/75-1978/79 (Repelita II)
aimed originally at annual economic growth targets in real terms of 7.5%,
with 13% for industry and 9% for mining and construction. With the increase
in oil revenues and Indonesia's debt service capacity, the rate of invest-
ment and consequent rate of growth are both likely to be reversed upward
during the 5 year Plan period. With an estimated annual per capita GDP
of US$125 in 1973, Indonesia ranks among the very poor countries in the world.
Lasting improvements to the economy will require substantial and widespread
investment in agriculture and also in the industrial, mining and construction
sectors for which a well functioning power system will be crucial. The
present installed capacity of the public sector is only about 7 watts per
inhabitant, and per capita annual consumption amounts to only 17 kwh (1973).
These are among the lowest in the world.
Sector Organization
2.03      With certain exceptions (para. 2.04), the public power sector is
synonymous with PLN, a Government-owned enterprise, responsible for genera-
tion, transmission and distribution throughout the country.  It was created
in 1961 through the merger of three nationalized utilities which in turn had
succeeded Dutch owned private electricity corporations.
2.04      Although PLN has the exclusive right for generating, transmitting
and distributing electric power, companies or individuals are allowed to
build and operate generating stations for their own purposes if PLN is
unable to provide service. In special cases, these auto-producers are
allowed to distribute electricity to consumers in the surrounding areas.
Generating stations below 50,000 kVA can be licensed by PLN but larger
stations require approval by the Minister of Public Works and Power. He
acts upon PLN's recommendation.
2.05      Inadequate and unreliable public power supply has resulted in
captive plant installations representing an estimated 40% to 60% of the total
installed capacity (public plus captive). These installations represent
uneconomic investments, but despite PLN's very large investment program
(para. 2.15), it will take years for this situation to normalize.
Existing Public Power Facilities
2.06      PLN's total installed capacity amounted to 792 MW by end-1973
(exclusive of the 125 MW Juanda hydro station operated by the Jatiluhur
Authority from which PLN purchases the output). Including Juanda, it con-
sisted of 43% hydro, 25% steam and 32% diesel and gas turbine capacity.



-3-
The installations are scattered throughout the country, some in small units
and stations. The system's largest plant is the 150 MW Tanjung Priok ins-
tallation in Jakarta. Details are given in Annex 2.
2.07      With the exception of a 150 kV link between Jakarta and Bandung,
even major load centers are not interconnected, resulting in high production
costs and poor reliability. PLN's transmission facilities include about
3,000 km of lines ranging from 25 kV to 150 kV, and an aggregate transformer
capacity of about 1,350 MVA.
Sector Planning
2.08      Past sector planning was partly determined by the foreign assistance
available and the domestic need to exchange capacity and gave insufficient
emphasis to system standardization or the need for future interconnection.
PLN's sector planning still needs strengthening. Apparently as a consequence
of the 1972 drought with subsequent blackouts due to lack of reserve capacity,
PLN's development plan as incorporated in Repelita II (Annex 12 (a)) emphasizes
generation investment but does not provide sufficient transmission and
distribution facilities to market the energy.
2.09      In order to create a sound basis for sector development on the
important island of Java, Credit 399-IND includes funds for a system devel-
opment study for the entire island. Consultants (Preece, Cardew and Rider)
have been selected and the study started in November 1974. It is scheduled
for completion in July 1976. The objective is a system development plan
which will provide the guidelines for future power development and establish
an appropriately balanced sector investment program.
The Power Market
2.10      As indicated in Annex 5, power consumption showed an increasing
growth trend between 1967 and 1973, interrupted only in 1972, a severe
drought year with generation cutbacks and blackouts. The first quarter
of 1974 again indicates a slowdown, but this is because demand is approaching
the system's supply capability. New connections are severely repressed and
this situation is expected to continue until 1975/76 when new facilities
will have been commissioned.
2.11      Development of power sales in the public power sector varied among
the supply regions, with larger increases in West Java than in other areas;
West Java, where the proposed Project is located, accounts for about 50%
of the total market. Past results are summarized below:

1971   2,354         1,786      12%             1,175          898       16%
1972   2,498         1,893       6%             1,268          960        7%

1/   Including energy purchases.
2.12      By the end of the first quarter of 1974 PLN's customers totalled
about 1,031,000, of which about 90% were residential. The breakdown of
sales by consumer classes is shown in Annex 4. The strikingly low proportion
of industrial sales underscores the extent of captive plant.
Development Plan
2.13      Future sales development will largely depend on PLN's capability
to satisfy demand. Should it wish to meet by 1982 all the demand expected
by a recent West Java market study, installations to handle annual supply
increases of about 30% would have to be commissioned during the next 7
years. While this level of demand increase is entirely plausible, PLN is
incapable of providing the necessary facilities due to physical as well as
probable financial constraints. The maximum satisfiable market development
is judged to be about (Annex 5):
(i)  West Java            14% annual increase in 1975/76 rising
gradually to 30% in 1983/84; and
(ii)  Other Areas    :    14% annual increase in 1975/76 rising
gradually to 25% in 1983/84.
These assumptions result in sales increases averaging about 14% (7% in
1974/75) during Repelita II (1974/75 - 1978/79).
2.14      To permit the above sales increases, the following investments
will have to be made during the next several years (Annex 12 (b)):

This program would add about 3,000 MW to the existing 800 MW generation capa-
city plus transmission and distribution.  Although smaller than the
investment planned by PLN (para. 2.15), it is very heavy and even if the money
becomes available, it may be beyond PLN's capability to execute.
2.15      For the purpose of comparison, following is a summary of PLN's
investments as included in Repelita II (Annex 12(a)):

Local Cost           1,131           36                738                357

This would add about 4,900 MW generation capacity and transmission/distribu-
tion facilities.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
PLN's Corporate Existence
3.01      PLN's corporate existence is based on the 1972 Electricity Act
which was issued as a Government decree within the framework of various
existing laws. The charter does not provide the company with completely
independent authority; important matters such as borrowing power, investment
policy, valuation of assets, personnel policy and salary structure and levels
are decided by the Government, represented in most cases by the Minister of
Public Works and Power. However, such Government control over important
sectors of the economy and over Government enterprises is regarded as neces-
sary and, with PLN's progressing impro-ement, the Government role in many



- 6 -
aspects of management i;as diminished. The covenant requiring Bank Group
concurrence in material changes in governing laws affecting PLN has been
repeated in the documents of the proposed Loan.
3.02      In matters of major importance the Minister is assisted by an
Advisory Board consisting of the Ministers of Finance, Industry, and National
Development Planning (Chairman of BAPPENAS, the Government planning agency).
The Advisory Board provides a useful forum for officials concerned with
economic matters to meet on problems of power sector development.
Organization
3.03      PLN's management (Board of Directors) is defined as the "represent-
ative of the Minister, to carry out all basic management functions of the
enterprise." It consists of a President Director and at least two other
Directors. In addition to the President Director, there are presently four,
responsible for planning, construction, operation,. and administration
(including accounting and finances). The members of the Board are appointed
and dismissed by the President of Indonesia upon recommendation by the
Minister. They normally serve for a five-year term, but may be re-appointed.
The President Director is responsible to the Minister and the Directors report
in their respective fields to the President Director. Decisions are commonly
made by consensus of the whole Board, a common feature in Indonesia.
3.04      PLN's regional organization (Annex 1) comprises 8 construction
regions (Construksi), 3 generation regions (Generasi), 4 distribution regions
(Distribusi) and 11 operation tegions (Exploitasi); the latter cover areas
where activities are too small to justify subdivision. The organizational
structure is oriented towards practical needs.
3.05      As of March 1974 PLN had a total staff of 21,160 (Annex 11), of
which 5,211 were temporary. Although the number of employees is high by
normal standards, reductions are unlikely because of the size of the supply
area and the Government's employment-oriented policies. Despite the large
number employed PLN suffers from a severe shortage of qualified staff; for
instance, its personnel upgrading program would require more civil and
electro-mechanical engineers annually than are presently graduating from all
technical universities in Indonesia. The scholarship program included in
the Projec; is designed to alleviate this pressing problem by upgrading
the professional skill of graduated engineers (para. 3.11).

3.06      PLN was in a clearly chaotic state at the time of the Bank Group's
first involvement in the power sector (1969).  The division of responsibility
between the Government and PLI was not defined, PLN's legal basis was un-
satisfactory, records were unavailable and the financial situation, although
confused was clearly bad. To help remedy the situation, the Bank Group
helped finance through Credits 165 and 334-IND a comprehensive management
consulting effort, for which the French firm of SOFRELEC was selected.
SOFRELEC was assisted in accounting matters by Peat, Marwick and Mitchell.



3.07      It took time before SOFRELEC could formulate recommendations with
respect to PLN's problems. Records had to be reconstructed and assets
physically identified; large outstanding consumer accounts had to be
verified and means found for their settlement; tariff levels and structure
had to be studied. The initial phase of the consultant's work took about
two years and consisted to a considerable degree of essential fact finding.
The main accomplishments during the period included:
(i) draft of the Electricity Act (promulgated in 1972 after exten-
sive discussions with representatives of the Bank Group);
(ii)  recommendations on a new structure and level of tariffs
(introduced with a general increase of 40% in June 1973);
(iii) draft of a functional organization (introduced with some
modifications in March 1973);
(iv)  preparation of an accounting system and recommendations on
cash management and control, inventory control, consumer
administration, mechanization and budgeting (in the process
of implementation throughout the enterprise);
(v) revaluation of assets (introduced as of December 31,
1971; and
(vi)  recommendations on personnel regulations and administration,
job analysis, salary'structure and training (some of the
recommendations have been implemented, others are under
discussion. A number of the recommendations meet with
Government resistance since although suitable for
a commercially oriented entity like PLN they often conflict
with regulations applicable to Government agencies).
3.08      At the time of appraisal for Credit 399-IND in late 1972 PLN's
problems were better identified than previously and recommendations for
their solution were in hand. SOFRELEC's investigations had revealed that
PLN's financial situation was worse than anticipated with high operating
losses and very low internal cash generation. Consequently a "recovery
plan" designed to improve PLN's management capabilities and to overcome its
financial weaknesses over time was made a part of the project and incor-
porated in the 399-IND documents. Its main features include:
(i) a detailed plan of activities designed to improve PLN's
operations and, as a consequence, its financial position;
(ii)  annual programs of the activities to be taken towards
improvement. These programs are discussed with and
closely supervised by Bank staff; and



-8-
(iii) improvement of PLN's finances to the point where all
operating expenses would be covered by revenues by
FY 1978/79. PLN agreed to make all efforts to meet
interim targets of 80% revenue/cost coverage in FY 1974/75
and 90% in FY 1976/77.
3.09      On July 16, 1974 the Association's Board received at its request
a status report on the recovery plan (Memorandum on the Progress under the
Recovery Plan - IDA/SecM 74-230). Annex 16 describes the present situation
and Annex 13 summarizes the prospects of meeting the financial targets.
In summary:
(i)  activities to strengthen system planning are underway.
However, progress is slow as it is with personnel training
in general because of a severe shortage of adequately qualified
personnel to be trained. Problems also arise from Government
regulations concerning salary levels and structures, and
promotions, which make incentive oriented plans difficult to
implement;
(ii)  good progress has been made in improving accounting and
financial control. Only occasional assistance by the
consultants is now required;
(iii) efforts to improve the management of construction activities
have shown fewer results than the other activities. This is
particularly disappointing since improved project implement-
ation capability is essential for PLN's full recovery. While
not entirely PLN's fault, as complex and cumbersome Government
regulations seriously delay project implementation, there is still
much that could be done within PLN itself to overcome these prob-
lems. They will be the subject of continued supervision;
(iv)  good results have been achieved in operations (maintenance
procedures and steam plant operation). Further progress in
cost economizing requires accelerated system improvements, and
this is directly linked to progress of the construction
group; and
(v)  preliminary results indicate that the first 80% revenue/cost
target in EY1974/75 was reached and expectations are that full
financial recovery will be attained by FY1978/79 as scheduled.
3.10      The efforts made to date to turn PLN into a sound public utility
have yielded positive resultj despite temporary setbacks.  On balance they
have been successful. Future activities will continue to concentrate on
management improvement largely through day to day assistance by the con-
sultants, and on personnel training. Among other points, PLN will in
accordance with the recovery plan concentrate during the next year on (for
details see Annex 16):



-9-
(i) training of about 500 employees in PLN-owned training
centers, and on-the-job;
(ii) introducing a comprehensive insurance system; and
(iii) improving the construction department (in particular
procurement and contract management, and streamlining
of budget procedures) and strengthening the organization
in the regional construction offices (Construksi).
3.11      To help strengthen PLN's organization and to overcome at least to
a certain degree the shortage of trained personnel, funds for financing the
foreign exchange cost of the following management consulting and training
elements in addition to those contained in the financial recovery plan have
been included in the proposed Loan:
(i) employment of three training specialists for about two
years with the aim of training local tutors particularly
for the planned training centers in Medan, Ujung Pandang
and Semarang;
(ii) employment of six management advisers in the fields of
generation, transmission, distribution, construction,
planning, and administration and accounting. Their
assignment would be for about two years. After initially
working together with SOFRELEC, they would gradually take
over the responsibility of supervising the implementation
of SOFRELEC's management plans through day-to-day assistance;
and
(iii) overseas fellowships for special training of about 26 middle
management executives.
It has been agreed during negotiations that qualification, experience and
terms and conditions of employment of the above-mentioned specialists should
be satisfactory to the Bank.
Government Procedures
3.12      Factors which severely hinder efficient project implementation
include:
(i) customs clearance at Tanjung Priok harbor in about 50%
of the cases investigated averaged about 70 days, in two
cases about 250 days;
(ii) budget control procedures (see below); and
(iii) procedures for establishing letters of credit and issuing
import licenses which take up to 6 months.



- 10 -
Until mid-1974, budgeted local expenditure funds were disbursed to PLN item
by item through regional treasury offices, a most cumbersome process. How-
ever, recently the Government agreed to advance budgeted funds quarterly to
provide PLN with more flexibility than before in fund management. This is
a step in the right direction and this mechanism should be refined so as to
increase further PLN's financial flexibility.
3.13      The problems associated with the customs clearance procedures
were discussed during negotiations. An understanding was reached that in
the course of the next year the Ministry of Public Works and Power will develop
specific recommendations for improvement which will be discussed with the
Bank and that an effort will be made to institute the recommended improve-
ments. This improvement effort will in the end benefit all sectors of the
economy.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      The proposed Project consists of:
(a) construction of a third unit (100 MW) at the Muara Karang
thermal power plant including engineering design for a
fourth unit (para 4.02);
A
(b) physical investigations of the site of a new thermal power
plant in West Java (para 4.03); and
(c) advisory services and training, including fellowships
(para 3.11).
4.02      The project site, located in the northwest outskirts of Jakarta,
will provide an ultimate capacity of 700 MW with five units installed. The
first two 100 MW units are being financed under Credit 399-IND and are
presently under construction. The severe inflation which has taken place
since project appraisal in late-1972 has doubled the project cost; the
foreign comaponent is now expected to be about 70% higher than the original
estimate (Annex 8).  However, no supplemental financing by the Bank is
proposed. The No. 3 unit will be a non-reheat, oil-fired type, identical
to the first two units. It will supply the Jakarta area by 150 kV transmission
lines included in the first stage of the project (Units 1 and 2). Also
included are engineering services for a detailed design of Unit 4 (200 MW)
which should be initiated immediately.
4.03      PLN will need a new site for the next thermal power plant to be
commissioned in the early 1980's when the Muara Karang site will have been
fully developed. The most probable sites presently under consideration are



- 11 -
Cilincing, in the eastern suburbs of Jakarta, and Cirebon, about 200 km east
of Jakarta. The consultants for the on-going Java System Development Study
financed under Credit 399-IND will determine the site priority and optimum
development scheme for the station from the viewpoint of overall system
planning. The proposed study would concentrate on physical investigations
of the first priority site such as geology, oceanography, environment and
transportation requirement and would include a preliminary design and cost
estimate of the plant.

_  . =    _
4.05      The cost estimate for the Muara Karang project was prepared by
Black & Veatch International (BVI) of U.S.A., the consultant retained for the
first stage. The cost of the major equipment is based on bid prices for
Units 1 and 2 which included an option for Unit 3. Other costs of supply
and construction including the local component are based on recent experiences
of a similar project at Semarang, Central Java, and the local bidding on



- 12 -
civil works for the Muara Karang Units 1 and 2. They represent early-1975
prices. About two-thirds of the engineering cost are for detailed design
of Unit 4 which will be 200 MW. Since the project design is in an advanced
stage, a physical contingency of 5% for equipment and 10% for construction
should prove adequate. Price contingencies averaging about 8% for major
equipment supply are based on escalation provisions included in the proposals.
Tnis is low because some suppliers offered firm prices for certain items.
For other items annual inflation rates of 12% in 1975, 10% in 1976 and 8%
thereafter for equipment and 16% in 1975, 14% in 1976 and 12% in later years
for civil works have been applied. The overall price contingency amounts to
21% of the project cost including the physical contingency.
4.06      The estimated total cost of Unit 3 amounts to US$47.8 million
equivalent after deducting the engineering cost for Unit 4 and interest on
Bank loan during construction. This represents a unit cost of US$478/kW
installed. Adding to this the revised cost of Units 1 and 2 (Annex 8) the
total cost for 3 x 100 MW is now estimated at US$153.8 million. This includes
the cost of transmission and other common facilities required for the final
capacity of 700 MW. If adjustments are made for the cost of common facilities,
the average cost for the three 100 MW units is US$397/kW and US$442/kW in-
stalled, , before and after price escalation. This is of the correct order
of magnitude for 100 MW and similar sized oil-fired units at early 1975 prices.
4.07      The cost estimates for the study, advisory services and training
have been prepared by PLN based on man-months required for such activities
and recent experiences of building similar training centers.
Amount of Loan
4.08      The Project's foreign exchange component of US$50.4 million equiv-
alent represents 72% of the total cost of US$69.5 million equivalent including
interest during construction on the Bank loan. This percentage is high
because major civil works are included in the first stage project partially
financed by Credit 399 IND. The proposed Loan would cover the foreign ex-
change cost of the Project, except for the supply of the equipment for the
training centers which is not suitable for international competitive bidding
and the interest on the Bank Loan during construction; these items would be
financed by PLN and the Government. The total amount of the Loan would be
US$41 million, representing 59% of the total capital cost of the Project,
including interest during construction on the Bank Loan.
Engineering and Construction
4.09      Credit 399-IND prov des financing for engineering services of Units
1 and 2. PLN has retained BVI for this purpose and intends to extend the
contract to cover Units 3 and 4. The service for Unit 3 is for the detailed
design and construction supervision with an estimated man-month requirement
of 255. The service for Unit 4 will cover the detailed design, preparation
of bidding documents and bid evaluation with an estimated man-month require-
ment of 626; this is high because of a new design required for a larger unit.



- 13 -
This arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank and the proposed Loan includes
financing of this contract extension.
4.10      Major items of site development such as site fill and building
an intake canal are being carried out by local contractors under the first
stage. The second stage site development including piling, minor mechanical
works and some preparation works for Unit 4 will also be locally contracted.
These works are financed by PLN. However, as with Units 1 and 2, general
construction contractor will be employed for structural, mechanical and
electrical construction including erection of major equipment. The contracts
include sizeable foreign exchange costs which will be financed under the
proposed Loan. In the interest of expediting and economizing the construction
work, it was agreed during negotiations that the general construction
contract(s) would cover the erection of all three units (paras 4.14-4.15).
4.11      PLN has established a construction team for the Project within its
headquarters. Unit 3 is scheduled for completion in mid-1979, one year after
the commissioning of Unit 2.
4.12      The study of the next thermal power site will be carried out by
engineering consultants satisfactory to the Bank under a separate contract.
The study is expected to take about one year with an estimated man-month
requirement of 100.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      Bids for the supply of major equipment for Units 1 and 2 included
option offers for Unit 3 valid until November 1975. PLN intends to exercise
the options since prices are reasonable under the present market situation
and, more importantly, the construction period would be shortened by at least
six months; additional advantages can be expected through equipment standard-
ization and simplified engineering and construction work.
4.14      Assuming PLN exercises the option for major equipment, remaining
items to be procured are control equipment, structural equipment and the
general construction contract. Procurement will follow international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. During nego-
tiations PLN agreed to let the general construction contract(s) covering all
three units under international competitive bidding since the Bank finances
a portion of the foreign exchange cost of the contract(s). Since some
structural equipment could be supplied by local industries, the Loan
documents include the usual margin of preference for local manufacturers.
Some civil works will be financed locally and the general construction con-
tract, which will likely be beyond local capability, will largely be a supply
and erection type with some local subcontractor participation. Hence, there
are no grounds for a local preference for civil contractors and none is
provided.
4.15      Disbursement will be made against the full foreign exchange cost
of equipment, materials and consulting services. Should local manufacturers



- 14 -
win contracts for equipment and materials, disbursement would be made against
95% of the ex-factory price, the remaining 5% representing the estimated
average of local taxes. For the general construction contract(s) covering
all three units, disbursement will be made against 30% of the total expend-
itures up to US$12.4 million. This would represent the full foreign exchange
cost for Unit 3 included in the contract(s). No disbursement will be made
for expenditures prior to Loan signing. The estimated schedule of disburse-
ments of the proposed Loan is shown in Annex 9. Any surplus funds remaining
after completion of the Project will be cancelled, unless there are good
reasons for applying savings to related works.
Ecology
4.16      No major ecological problems are expected.  The consultants have
carried out surveys on meteorological and oceanographic conditions, and
the flora and fauna in the vicinity of the project area. Since Indonesia
has not yet ruled on matters of environmental quality, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) standards have been used as design criteria. The
calculated maximum particulate concentration at ground level due to power
plant exhaust gases is well below the EPA standards and a mechanical preci-
pitator will be sufficient to remove solid particles in the gas. Space is
provided for future installation of electrostatic precipitators, should it
become necessary. A 75 meter stack will keep the sulphur dioxide pollution
below EPA ambient air standards even for the high-sulphur mid-eastern oil
which PLN might use instead of more valuable low-sulphur indigenous oil.
Cooling water from the plant will be discharged directly into the Java Sea
which forms a very shallow Area with a mudsilt for about one kilometer from
the shoreline. The thermal plume of the discharged water is expected to
dissipate before it reaches the area where any consumable fish or shellfish
of significant value exist.
V. JUSTIFICATION
Power Market in West Java
5.01      During the First Five-Year Plan period (1969-1973) electricity
sales in West Java increased at an average rate of 16.3% per year. This
growth rate, although high,does not reflect the economy's real needs for
power. It would have been much higher if PLN had been able to satisfy all
the potential demand. PLN severely restricts consumer connections in order
to keep the maximum demand within its capability. This has given rise to a
substantial installation of expensive self-generating plant by industries,
commercial buildings, hotels and even by domestic consumers. Although exact
figures for these captive plants are not known, the total installed capacity
is estimated to equal the supply capability of PLN. A 100 MW addition to
system capability in 1972 was loaded in less than two years and at the end
of 1974 maximum system demand was 300 MW against a total capability of
325 MW, leaving little operating reserve.



- 15 -
5.02      As of November, 1974 PLN had applications for new connection in
West Java of 330 1VA for 1975 and 210 MIVA for 1976. This alone would
require tripling of generating capacity in two years. It is apparent that
during the next few years demand growth will depend entirely on PLN's
capability to supply. According to a study done by consultants (Chas. T.
Main) PLN would have to increase its supply capability at an annual rate
of 32% in Central and West Java, to fully satisfy suppressed demand by 1982.
Based on this, PLN will try to fill the supply/demand gap as much as possible
by installing gas turbines until the first base-load Muara Karang unit is
commissioned in late 1977. PLN has already secured financing for 13 gas
turbines with a total capacity of 284 MW; three have been commissioned.
It is seeking financing for an additional 200 MW. However, considering
PLN's weakness in construction management and its inadequate distribution
systems, a more realistic assumption of satisfiable demand increase would
be 14-20%"o per year up to 1980 and 25-30% thereafter. The market forecast
for 1979 when Unit 3 will be commissioned would therefore be as follows:
Fiscal Year                    1974       1979      Rate of Growth
% p.a.

/1   The first interconnection between Central and West Java is expected
to be completed by December, 1978.
5.03     -The investment program based on this forecast (Annnex 12 (b)) shows
that generation capacity of the combined system at the end of 1978 will con-
sist of 38% steam, 37% gas turbine and 25% hydro power. Heavy dependence
on gas turbines which consume about 50% more fuel than steam power to
produce the same amount of electric energy indicates the urgent need for
baseload steam power. Hydro alternatives presently under investigation will
in the future replace gas turbines, which will then be transferred to other
small, isolated systems.



- 16 -
Economic Justification
5.04      Although the proposed Project is the only realistic solution to
provide badly needed base-load capacity in 1979, a comparison was nevertheless
made of the Project with gas turbines as a possible alternative. The Muara
Karang project is more economic than gas turbines for discount rates up to
23%.
5.05      The economic value of alleviating acute power shortage by
investing in the proposed Project cannot be fully quantified and is thus
not expressed in any estimate of return on investment. Consumers are willing
to pay more for the power supplies. This is evidenced by the large amount
of expensive self-generation and by the number of applications for new
connection (paras 5.01-5.02). A minimum estimate of the economic return on
investment was calculated by comparing the costs attributable to the Project
(net of duties and taxes) -- including the cost of transmission/distribution
associated with the marketing of the project output -- to the additional
revenues derived from it at tariffs expected to be in effect at the time of
project commissioning. In doing this the fuel cost was adjusted to reflect
world market prices which are about 65% higher than the controlled price in
Indonesia. On this basis the return of the Muara Karang project is 19% for
Unit 3 and 17% for all three units (Annex 7). The return for Unit 3 is
higher than for three units combined because certain common facilities have
been included in Units 1 and 2.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
PLN' Financial Situation
6.01      Since 1971 when the first annual accounts based on SOFRELEC's
comprehensive inventory and revaluation program were available, gradual
improvement has been made in line with the objectives of the recovery program
(paras. 3.06 - 3.10).

6.03      Some information used for the above table is provisional due to
deficient data collecting before 1973. Nevertheless it provides an apprecia-
tion of PLN's unfavorable situation before the introduction of the recovery
plan. Operating revenues covered only slightly more than cash expenses.
Even in the absence of any debt service, less than 20% of the relatively
small investment program was financed through internal cash generation.
6.04      Annex 13 shows financial results expected for the future, based on
the following assumptions:
(i)  all costs are valued at 1975 prices and no future escalation
has been assumed. This is reasonable since PLN's tariff
schedule permits fuel and other operating cost inflation
effects to be passed on through tariff adjustments (para 6.08);
(ii)  revenues are based on present tariff levels plus one
assumed additional tariff increase of 10% in 1978/79;



- 18 -
(iii) PLN's progress in improving its finances permits on-lending
of funds provided by the Government rather than equity con-
tribution as was required by the documents of Credit 399-IND.
Consequently it was assumed that Government financing for
investments committed after the date of signing of the proposed
Loan would be in the form of loans rather than equity. This is
the most pessimistic assumption since it is likely that part of
the Government funds will in fact be provided as equity. In
no case will PLN be liable to make debt service payments before
1978/79 (end of the recovery period). Financing for projects
committed before signing of the proposed Loan would continue
to be provided as equity;
(iv) the modified investment program (para. 2.14) has been used
for projecting capital costs;
(v)  comparatively high personnel and material expenses have been
projected. These are due to planned personnel upgrading
programs involving salary increases and termination payments,
and a heavy equipment replacement program; and
(vi) fuel expenses include the price adjustments effective
April 2, 1975 (Annex 13).
A summary of the projected financial results during the recovery period is

6.05      PLN is expected to meet the targets set in the financial recovery
plan despite sales lower than would be possible if all potential demand
were satisfied by the end of the recovery period. Nevertheless, even in
continued absence of debt service requirements up to 1978/79, internal cash
generation is not expected to finance a significant portion of the investment
program. Government assistance will still be required for a number of years
as equity or as loans with a grace period on interest and amortization at
least until 1978/79. Consequently the Government has agreed during negotia-
tions to provide PLN in future the funds it needs in a form not requiring
debt service payments during the recovery period. Funds committed before
signing the proposed Loan will continue to be provided as equity as stipulated
in Credit 399-IND.
6.06      To ensure PLN's financial recovery as planned, the financial
performance covenant as included in Credit 399-IND (para. 3.08) will be
continued. A change to a more conventional test (rate-of-return or
contribution-to-investment covenant) is expected to be made in connection
with a subsequent loan. Intensive supervision will continue to monitor
PLN's financial development.
Subsidiary Loan
6.07      Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government will
re-lend the proceeds of the proposed Loan to PLN at terms equivalent to the
ones charged by the Bank. In addition, PLN will be permitted to capitalize
the interest charges during Project construction to avoid debt service pay-
ments during the recovery period. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank Loan.
Debt Service Limitation
6.08      To avoid excessive borrowing, or borrowing at unreasonably short
term, an objective debt service limitation test was agreed on during negotia-
tions. The covenant provides that PLN is permitted to incur debt as long as
the maximum future debt service is at least covered by the most recent actual
net revenues. In case debt service coverage is not provided, Bank concurrence
has to be sought for the borrowing.

Tariffs
6.09      The tariff structure proposed by SOFRELEC introduced low and medium
voltage charges to conform with the cost of service and changed the block
structure from increasing to decreasing unit prices for incremental con-
sumption. In addition, peak load tariffs were applied to a larger number of
consumer classes than before. This was put in force on June 12, 1973 in
slightly modified form. Annex 10 shows the new tariff and compares it to
the earlier one.
6.10      PLN's charges to its customers consist of:
(i)  the basic tariff as shown in Annex 10;
(ii)  transportation cost of fuel from PERTAMINA's terminal to the
location of consumption; and
(iii)  interim price adjustments for increases in the price of fuel
and other current expenses.
Government approval is required for adjustment of the basic tariff but
charges under (ii) and (iii) can be made after informing the Government.
6.11      Together with the introduction of the new structure, the tariff
level was increased by 40% with the understanding that additional increases
would be required for meeting the financial targets. However, the prime
emphasis of the recovery plan is cost economizing and the need for tariff
increases will depend on the rate at which PLN is able to improve its opera-
tional efficiency. This matter will be a subject of close and continuing
review to ensure that PLN will adjust its tariff level as may be necessary.
Audit
6.12      According to its Act, PLN must be audited by the Directorate
General of State Financial Control. This is a sub-directorate of the Govern-
ment's Supreme Audit Council in charge of auditing state enterprises operated
on a commercial basis. A second sub-directorate deals with Government ac-
counting audits (for instance ministries and Government departments).
6.13      PLN is audited on a permanent basis with the help of local audit
offices (branches of the audit council) in the provinces and sometimes
sub-contracted local auditors in headquarters if sufficient audit staff is
not available. In addition to routine control special audits are carried
out irregularly upon request of the Government.
6.14      The state auditor's office has a staff of about 500 accountants.
Judging from discussions which included the scope of the reports the Bank
wishes to receive, and from a preliminary report, audits are carried out
competently. Although PLN would not object to additional audit by a
private firm, it is felt that such audit would not contribute substantially
to the understanding and efficiency of PLN's operations. A private firm



- 21 -
would be particularly hampered by the long distances involved and lack of
regional offices. Consequently the standard audit covenant has been included
in the documents of the proposed Loan with the understanding that the Directorate
General of State Financial Control is acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports
will be sent to the Bank annually not later than 6 months after the close
of the fiscal year.
Accounting, Billing and Collection
6.15      The consultants have designed a modern accounting system and this
has been introduced throughout PLN's operations. The important areas (Java
and parts of Sumatra) are in the process of mechanization and computeriza-
tion with good results so far. The distances and sometimes primitive
transport facilities make it difficult to get records from outlying areas
to headquarters in time to permit timely closing of the books but this is
being overcome by dispatching accountants from headquarters to the regional
office to assist in finalizing the accounts and to handcarry the results
back to headquarters.
6.16      At the time of previous appraisals, large arrears in accounts
receivable posed a serious problem. This was particularly true for various
Government agencies. Consequently, in the course of negotiations for
Credit 334-IND, the Government agreed to settle its debt and has since done
so. Outstanding amounts from non-government consumers have been kept within
acceptable levels. By the end of FY 1973 accounts receivable represented
about 3-months billing. To ensure that billing and collection continue to
be handled efficiently:
(i)  the covenant requiring the Government agencies to pay
its debts to PLN promptly when due has been repeated; and
(ii)  PLN agreed during negotiations to restrict accounts
receivable of customers other than Government agencies
at the end of any month to not more than the amount
billed during the previous 3-months period.
6.17      PLN is generally slow in settling its accounts payable and this
has adversely affected its reputation with suppliers, very likely resulting
in higher price quotations than would have otherwise been the case.
Consequently the convenant requiring PLN to settle its debt within one
month after they are due has been repeated. The one-month time allowance
should be sufficient for settling most disputes.
Insurance
6.18      PLN does not presently insure its property in operation although
insurance against hazards of acquisition and transportation and delivery of
goods is regularly arranged. However, SOFRELEC is preparing an insurance



- 22 -
proposal which is expected to form the general basis for asset insurance.
As an interim measure agreement was reached in Credit 399-IND that the
Government will provide PLN with the funds required to cover normally
insurable damage minus an amount equivalent to US$100,000. This stipulation
has been repeated in the documents of the prospective Loan.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During Loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) Bank concurrence will be sought before amendments to legis-
lation affecting PLN are introduced (para. 3.01);
(b) consultants acceptable to the Bank will be retained for
design, procurement and construction supervision of the
Muara Karang 3 unit, design for Muara Karang 4, and site
investigation work for a new thermal power site (paras.
4.09 and 4.12). Appointment of competent training specialists
and management advisers will be on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.11);
(c) local preference will be taken into account in bid evaluation
for equipment (para 4.14);
(d) all future funds provided by the Government to PLN will be
made available in a form not requiring debt service payments
during the recovery period. Funds committed before Loan
signing will continue to be provided as equity (para. 6.05);
(e) the financial recovery plan as included in the documents
of Credit 399-IND will continue to prevail (para. 6.06);
(f) the Government will re-lend the proceeds of the Loan to PLN.
Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and PLN is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank
Loan (para. 6.07);
(g) PLN will not incur debt without Bank concurrence unless its
maximum future debt service is at least covered by historic
net revenues (para. 6.08);
(h) PLN will have its accounts audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.14);
(i) the Government and its agencies will pay their debts when
due (para. 6.16);



- 23 -
(j) the aggregate amounts outstanding from sales of power to
non-Government customers at the last working day of each
month will not exceed the amount of billing issued in
respect of the 3-months period terminating on such day
(para. 6.16);
(k) PLN will pay its debts within one month after their respective
due dates (para 6.17); and
(1) satisfactory insurance arrangements will be made by Government
and PLN (para. 6.18).
7.02      With the agreements reached on the above, the Project would be
suitable for a Bank Loan of US$41 million equivalent, on terms of 25 years,
with a 5-year grace period.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Economic Justification
Economic viability of the Muara Karang project has been examined
in four different ways:
(1) least cost solution
(2) internal financial return
(3) internal economic return
(4) effect on economy
1.   General Assumption
(a) Investment Cost
Muara Karang Unit 3
total project cost        $50.78 million
less price contingency   $(8.88)
less engineering Unit 4 $(3.00) "
base cost            $38.90 million
Muara Karang Unit 1 and 2
total project cost         $106.0 million
less price contingency $(6.1) "
base cost            $99.9 million
Gas Turbines
A recent international competitive bidding on a 20 MW unit
for the Pulo Gadung industrial project in Jakarta revealed a
varying unit cost of $160-200/kW installed at a substation,



ANN4EX 7
Page 2
excluding costs of site development, transmission lines,
and engineering. A consultants' estimate indicates a
much higher unit cost of $350/kW for a complete unit
including contingency. An informal quote obtained from
a manufacturer shows $200/kW for a bunker C-fired unit
including fuel treatment facilities, but excluding site
development, transmission lines and engineering. Hence,
for the purpose of the study, a unit cost of $240/kW was
used as a today's unit cost for a complete set of gas
turbines.
(b) Operation and Ilaintenance Cost
2% of the capital cost was assumed as an annual O/M
cost for both Muara Karang and gas turbines.
(c) Fuel Cost
PLN purchases its fuel oil at a controlled price which
was raised as of April 2, 1975 from Rp 12/liter to Rp 19
liter ($7.28/barrel) for Bunker C and from Rp 19/liter
Rp 22/liter ($8.43/barrel) for diesel oil at Pertamina's
(national oil company) terminal. For calculations of the
internal financial return, this controlled price was used
since PLN's tariffs are based on it and fuel cost variations
are recoverable through fuel surcharges.
For calculations of the economic return and the least
cost solution, todays world market price for Indonesian oil
of $12/barrel was used for both Bunker C and diesel oil.
Although diesel oil prices are normally about 50% higher than
Bunker C prices, this difference was not taken into account
since no free market price exists in Indonesia. This would
penalize steam power generation against gas turbines.
(d) Heat Rate
Muara Karang:        2,300 kcal/kWh
*    Gas Turbine:          3,400 kcal/kWh
(e) Operating Pattern
The plant would be operated at a 75% plant factor for
the first 10 years and, thereafter, would be shifted to the
upper portion of the load curve with decreasing operating
hours. A plant factor of 55% was assumed for the last 5
years of the 30-year plant life. Gas turbines as an alter-
native would follow the same operating pattern but with a
plant life of 15 years.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
(f)  Incremental Revenues
PLN's average revenue per kWh sold is at present
Rp 20.0 after adjustment for the increased price of
fuel. In order to financially break-even by 1978 as
required in connection with Credit 399-IND, PLN will have to
raise its tariffs to Rp 21.8/kWh, excluding any additional
increase which might become necessary due to inflationary
trends. Incremental revenues from the Project based on
these tariff levels were used as the minimum benefits of
the Project in calculations of the internal financial
return. It was assumed that in the first year of
operation only a half of the energy generated by the
Project would constitute incremental sales and the
remaining half would only replace existing gas turbines
and thus save fuel costs. From the second year, all
energies available from the Project would represent in-
crenental sales. System losses of 20% were also assumed
throughout the period.
(g)  Cost of Transmission and Distribution
Although the cost of transmission lines from the Muara
Karang plant to the grid is included in the project cost,
additional investment to market the output of the Project
is required for the Iistribution system. During Repelita
II PLN plans to invest Rp 147.6 billion on transmission
and distribution in the West Java area for rehabilitating
existing systems and for expanding new systems. Since
the existing systems are old and in chaotic condition,
about one half of the investment would be required for
rehabilitation and only the remaining half (Rp 74 billion)
would contribute to expanding the system capacity to meet
an incremental generating capacity of 610 MW during the
same period. In the following calculations Rp 74 billion
was pro-rated as follows:
Unit 3    74 x 100/610   =    Rp 12.1 billion ($29.2 million)
Unit 1-3  74 x 300/610   =    Rp 36.3 billion ($87.5 million)
2.   Least Cost Calculation
Although the proposed Project is the only realistic solution to
provide badly needed base-load capacity, a comparison was nevertheless made
of the Project with gas turbines as a possible alternative. The Muara
Karang project was proven to be more economic than gas turbines for dis-
count rates up to 23%.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
3.   Internal Financial Return (IFR)
In view of sharply increased costs of Units 1 and 2, internal
financial returns were calculated not only for Unit 3 but also for three
units as a whole. Internal financial returns thus obtained are as follows:
tariffs at Rp 21.8/kWh at Rp 20.0/kWh
Unit 3                          23.8%                21.5%.
Units 1-3                       22.0%                19.8%
4.   Internal Economic Return (IER)
(a) Since no established methodology is available to quantify economic
benefits of electricity supply, incremental revenues from the Pro-
ject were used as the minimum benefits as was the case for IFR.
However, the fuel cost was shadow-priced by using the world market
price of $12/barrel. IER's thus obtained are as follows:
tariffs at Rp 21.8/kWh at Rp 20.0/kWh
Unit 3                          18.6%                16.1%
Units 1-3                       17.1%                14.7%
(b) As the most conservative economic evaluation, fuel replacement
benefits by substituting Muara Karang Unit 3 for existing gas
turbines were compared to the project cost, disregarding all
the benefits to be derived from additional electricity avail-
able to the economy. Benefits thus evaluated are found larger
than the cost for discount rates up to 11%. This would repre-
sent the hypothetical lowest limit of the economic return on
the Project.
5.   Effect on Economy
The consultants, Chas T. Main, made efforts to develop a method
to forecast future electricity demands based on the state of the economy
at any given time and a probability assessment of its future potentials.
In this method interrelationships between several economic sectors and
their effect on power demands are determined by using multiple regression
and each sector's present state is defined by its present value and its
growth rate. Transition probabilities are assigned to each sector repre-
senting the likelihood of increasing, decreasing or stable growth rate.
The method thus gives a power demand forecast based not on past trends but
on the future outlook of the economy. The methodology was considered
particularly suitable for Indonesia where actual demands in the past do not
represent the real demands. By using this method, the consultants predicted
that a 5% reduction in the growth rate of electric demand in Indonesia would



ANNEX 7
Page 5
result in a decline of approximately 1.5% in the growth rate of economy.
Since the power demand in Central and West Java is expected to reach 1,000
MW in 1980, the Muara Karang No. 3 unit would represent about 10% of the
total system demand and, according to this method, would affect the growth
of economy by about 3%. Assuming that the combined area of Central-West
Java represents one-third of the country's economy (1972 actual), the Project
would have an effect of about 1.0% or about US$400-500 million, on the
total expected GDP of US$40-45 billion in 1980. Although this amount does
not necessarily represent the real benefit, it gives a good indication of
the importance of electric power to the growth of the economy.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Construction Cost of Muara Karang Project (Unit 1 &2)
Analysis of Cost Overruns
1.   Introduction
1.01       The Muara Karang project (Unit 1 & 2) was appraised in November
1972. The cost estimate for the project, originally prepared by consultants
(C.T. Main), was discussed with PLN and the consultants and accepted as
adequate. The total cost of the project was estimated at US$52 million,
US$44 million representing the foreign exchange portion and US$8 million
the local cost, including necessary transmission facilities.
1.02       An IDA credit financing the foreign cost of the project was
approved in May 1973, and in lovember 1973 Black & Veatch International
(BVI) were appointed by PLN as the consultants for project engineering and
supervision. In April 1974, BVI reestimated the project cost based on their
preliminary design. This increased both foreign and local cost to US$54.8
million and US$16.3 million equivalent, respectively, resulting in the
total cost of US$71.1 million.
1.03       Surprisingly high bidding prices received for the Semarang
thermal power project (2 x 50 'IW), Central Java, in mid-1974 forced BVI
to re-examine the cost estimate for the Mtuara Karang project. Their
October, 1974 revision further increased the estimate to US$68.3 million
and US$37.2 million for the foreign and local component, respectively,
and the total to US$105.5 million.
1.04       Bids were received on November 15, 1974 for the supply of major
equipment. Although the response to the bid invitation was favorable with
sixteen suppliers well spread throughout the world participating, prices
offered revealed additional cost increases. The sum of the lowest evaluated
bid for each schedule is now US$37.8 million, which compares with US$22.8
million in the appraisal for these items; US$27.2 million in BVI's estimate
in April 1973 and US$34.4 million in their October 1974 estimate.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
1.05      The final cost estimate will have to wait until remaining bids
have been received on control and instrumentation, structural equipment,
site development, general construction and transmission lines. In the
meantime, Bank staff, working with the consultants, have spent considerable
time in attempting to anticipate the final cost.
1.06      This Annex discusses the revised cost estimate and tries to
analyze to the extent possible causes for the overruns.
2.   Conclusions
2.01      The present cost estimate stands at US$106 million, consisting of
the foreign component at US$74 million and the local component of US$32
million equivalent. This is an increase of 68% in foreign and 300% in local
cost compared to the original appraisal estimate.
2.02      Out of a USS30 million foreign cost increase, one-third is traceable
to physical changes in project scope. The remaining two-thirds is due to
the world-wide inflation which took place during the period of economic
turbulance in 1973-74.
2.03      The increase in local costs by 300% can be attributed roughly to
physical changes in the scope of the project (130%) and to price escalation
(170%). Local inflation has been caused largely by soaring prices of
locally procured materials. Local labor costs, although significantly
increased, have a secondary effect.
2.04      Although the total cost of the project has gone up substantially,
it includes considerable investment on common facilities necessary for
the ultimate 5 unit development of 700 NW.  After making adjustment for
these costs and adding the estimated cost of Unit No. 3 (100 MW), the
installed cost of the initial three units of 100 1'1 each would be $397/kW
excluding transmission facilities and interest during construction on
Unit No. 3. This is considered a reasonable representation of the early
l9,5 narket price for 100 MW oil-fired units.
3.   Revised Cost Estimate
3.01      Tenders were received on November 15, 1974 for the supply of
major equipment in four schedules; namely, steam generators, turbine/
generators, electrical equipment and transformers. Local bids for piling
and site development were opened in December 1974. Remaining items still
to be tendered are: (i) control and instrumentation; (ii) transmission
line materials; (iii) structural materials; (iv) general construction
(mechanical, electrical and structural construction and submarine oil line);
and (v) local contracts for erection of transmission facilities.
3.02       Attached Table 1 and 2 show the comparison of the previous and
the latest estimates of the foreign and local component of the project cost.

This reflects not only the results of the bidding for the Muara Karang
major equipment but also prices offered recently by local contractors for
the Semarang and Muara Karang project. The total cost of the project as
now estimated at US$106 million equivalent exceeds the original estimate
by US$54 million (104%).
4.   Analysis of Cost Overruns
It is difficult to pinpoint causes of cost overruns with precision.
In general, there are four factors which contribute: (i) exchange rate
changes; (ii) physical modification of project scope; (iii) higher than
anticipated inflation; and (iv) delayed project implementation. In the
case of the Muara Karang project effects of (i) and (iv) are so far
negligible; hence the following analysis focuses on (ii) and (iii).
Foreign Cost
4.01      After being retained, BVI reviewed the original project plan
prepared by C.T. Main. Although main features of the project remained the
same, BVI proposed, and PLN agreed to, some modifications in project design
and its implementation scheme. These resulted in additional costs.
Firstly, the original plan envisaged the maximum utilization of
local labor; that is, not only civil and architectural work but also
erection of major equipment would be carried out by local contractors under
supervision of foreign suppliers. However, after reviewing local capability
and to ensure better construction management to meet the very tight schedule,
it was decided to have at most only two contracts for structural, mechanical
and electrical construction. This will include the supply of about US$10
million worth of equipment, so the contract(s) will require sophisticated
management. This will probably be beyond the capability of local contractors
although they will most likely participate as subcontractors. The revised
estimate for this phase of the project increases the estimated foreign cost
by about US$7.12 million. Secondly, a larger capacity and longer trans-
mission lines were required. The line capacity has been doubled by adopting
a bundled-conductor design and the line length is now 45 km instead of the
original 30 km because of expansion of the Jakarta urban area. This design
change, coupled with a change in the bus arrangement at Muara Karang, has
contributed to another cost increase of about US$2.03 million. Thirdly,
the original underestimate of engineering man-months accounts for an increase
of US$1.15 million, and finally, design changes of control system from an
electronic type to pneumatic type which offers higher reliability and
simpler maintenance has reduced the cost by US$0.77 million.
These cost increases, which are due to change of scope and
summarized below, represent 32% of the total foreign cost increase of US$30
million:

General Construction                     7.12
Transmission Facilities                  2.03
Engineering                              1.15
Control and Instrumentation             (0.77)
Total                    9.53
4.02      The remaining cost increase of US$20.5 million can be attributed
to inflation. The original estimate was based on late 1972 prices and
included price escalation of only 5% per annum which was considered adequate
at the time. The major economic crisis and world-wide inflation took place
in 1973, and, exacerbated by the oil crisis, continued in 1974. According
to the consultants, price escalation of basic materials in USA during the
one-year period from late 1973 to late 1974 is as follows:
Item                      % escalation
Pipe - Material                        50 -  55
Valve - Mfaterial                      40 - 100
Structural Steel                       50 -  60
Heat Exchanger - Material              65 - 100
Condensers - Material                     60
Pump - Material                           80
Control Equipment                      25 -  40
Electrical Equipment                      30
Thus US$20.5 million increase (47% of the original estimate) is considered
to be within the range of general inflation.
Local Costs
4.03      The local cost overrun is far more serious, amounting to US$24
million equivalent or a 300% increase. About one-third of this can be
attributed to the scope change of a single work items - marine work (cooling
water intake and submarine fuel pipeline). C.T. Main's original plan was
based on oqeanographic charts then available but further investigations
were recommended before finalizing the design. When this was done in early
1974, the ocean bay in front of the site was found to be much shallower
than indicated on the charts. Consequently BVI had to extend the intake
canal from 400 m to 900 m and the fuel pipeline from 2.5 km to 4.3 km.
Another survey revealed that the original land-transport scheme for equip-
ment, which assumed reinforcing only a few bridges, was not feasible.
Transport by barges direct]? from the harbor to the project site is required.
This means that the intake canal will have to be widened to handle the
barges. All these changes in the marine work including additional dock
facilities at the site have increased the local cost by US$8.3 million over



ANNEX 8
Page 5
the original estimate. Other design changes account for a local cost in-
crease of US$2.0 million, including US$1.2 million for transmission facilities.
4.04      The balance of the local cost overrun of US$13.7 million or 170,'
of the original estimate is mainly a result of local inflation. Acute
price increases occurred in early 1974 for goods and materials normally
purchased locally. Cement has quadrupled from $45/ton to $170/ton as
compared with the world market prices of $40-70/ton, and reinforcing bar
now costs $600/ton. These are certainly black market prices, but local
contractors have little choice other than going to the black 'narket because
of severe shortage of these materials.  Although the government set a ceiling
on the cement price at $100/ton in 1974, this was not reflected in the latest
bidding prices. Labor costs also increased by about 47% during the
first six months of 1974, but it is still inexpensive at $2.50 per day for
a foreman, $1.80 for a skilled worker and $1.00 for an unskilled worker.
The unit cost of concrete in place for pile caps is now USS270/m as compared
to US$190/m in US. Since the major local cost items are concrete related
such as pile and pile caps (US$2.9 million), marine works (US$7.4 million),
structural construction (US$6.1 million), it would not be unreasonable to
assume overall inflation of 170% during the last two years.
5.   Unit Cost
5.01      The total cost of the project for the first two units of 100 MW
is now estimated at US$106.00 million or $530 per kW installed. However,
the scope of the project includes certain items which are common to the
final 5 unit 700 MW development. To get a better idea of the unit cost
of a 100 MW unit, adjustments as follow are required.
(1) Cost of Unit No. 3
total cost                                 $50.78 million
less provisions for Unit 4                ($5.95 million)
Total                $44.83 million
(2)  Common Facilities Included in Units 1 & 2
kite fill                                  S 0.77 million
access road, docks                         $ 1.70 million
intake canal                               $ 8.54 million
submarine fuel line                        $ 4.70 million
Total                $15.21 million
Cost proportioned to the future 2 x 200 MW is:
$15.21 x 4/7         =          $ 8.69 million



ANNEX 8
Page 6
(3) Less Transmission Facilities
substation at Cawang & Angke              $ 4.10 million
transmission lines                        $ 5.35 million
Total                $ 9.45 million
(4)  Adjusted Cost for 3 x 100 MW
cost for Unit 1 & 2                      $106.0 million
add Unit 3                               $ 44.8 million
deduct common facilities                ($  8.7 million)
deduct transmission facilities          ($  9.5 million)
Total               $132.6 million
The unit cost for 100 I4W is, therefore, $442/k6W. This includes escalation
and engineering but not interest during construction. If price escalation
is excluded, the unit cost becomes $397/kW.
5.02      A recent international competitive bidding confirms a unit cost
of over US$400/kW for this unit size. Bids were opened in March, 1974 for
two units of 150 MW each for the Meharcleh thermal power plant in Syria.
The total cost of this project is now estimated at US$124 million; US$104
million for the foreign component and US$20 million for the local cost.
The unit cost is US$413/kW. A slightly lower unit cost could be attributable
to a larger unit size and a half-year difference in the bidding timing.

I.   Introduction
1.        On June 12, 1973 a new electricity tariff became effective.  In
addition to an increase of 40% in revenues it introduced a cost oriented
tariff structure based on the voltage level of service.

Above schedule indicates the basic charges. In addition PLN is permitted
to charge fuel transportation cost depending on the location of the power
generating source.  Furthermore, extra charges can be levied for:
(a) additional fuel cost, if thermal generation exceeds
10% of total generation; and
(b) additional current cost of more than 10%.
III. Considerations for Tariff Revision
3.        Prior to the revision it had been generally agreed that the tariff
structure did not meet PLN4's requirements: It did not generate sufficient
funds to cover cash expenses and it was not cost related. For instance, in-
dustrial consumers paid an energy charge higher than domestic consumers.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
Furthermore, it was designed as a block tariff with increasing unit prices
on increasing consumption. The latter, although basically not undesirable
from an energy conservation and income redistribution point of view, was
considered detrimental to PLN's and the country's interest since it en-
couraged installation of uneconomic captive plant, particularly on the part
of large consumers.
4.        SOFRELEC prepared a tariff study in 1972 and recommended:
(a) introduction of low and medium voltage tariffs to conform
with the cost of service;
(b) changing the bloc tariff to decreasing unit prices for
incremental consumption; and
(c) raising the tariff level immediately by at least 25%
with additional increases in later years.
IV. PLN's Tariff Effective June 12, 1973
5.        PLN adopted SOFRELEC's recommendations in principle and introduced
the following tariff schedule to yield an overall revenue increase of 40%:

PLN is entitled to add to above tariffs:
(a)  transportation cost of fuel from the supplier's terminal
to the location of consumption;
(b)  increases in the price of fuel; and
(c)  increases of other current expenses.
The tariff decree provides that increases under items (b) and (c) above be
distributed "equally" among the various tariff classes. However, no expla-
nation is given on how the increase should be spread within the classes



ANNEX 10
Page 5
(A1/A2, B1/B2, C1/C2). For political reasons (not to create too heavy a
burden for the low income groups) PLN has chosen in the past to allocate
an equal amount to each unit sold rather than apply percentages commensurate
to the various tariff classes. This has the disadvantage of partially
eliminating the differences between the tariff classes watering down the
principle of charges based on cost of service.

Notes and Assumptions on Income Statements
With the exception of fuel, all financial projections have been
made on the basis of constant 1975 prices. Fuel costs include the latest
increase effective April 2, 1975 (see paragraph 4 of this Annex). No future
escalation has been assumed since only judgement has to be passed at present
on PLN's ability to meet the operating targets required in the financial
recovery plan and the electricity tariff contains a cost adjustment clause
(particularly for fuel) which has been applied efficiently in the past.
1. EngSa
As shown in Annex 5, generation and sales development was erratic
during the past several years (possibly some of the data were not accurately
recorded). Consequently, predictions on the future trend of sales are
difficult to make. Although demand potential is high, it will continue to
be suppressed during the next several years due to PLN's inability to meet
it. Based on projected demand PLN is likely to be able to satisfy, the
following production forecasts have been assumed:
West Java:     14% increase in 1975/76 to 20% in 1978/79
Other Areas:   14% increase in 1975/76 to 16% in 1978/79
These assumptions result in overall sales increases of 13.8% in 1975/76 to
18.82 in 1978/79, after a low increase of 7.1% in 1974/75 which is due to
lack of supply capacity.
2. Average Revenues per Kwh Sold
At the time of the introduction of the financial recovery plan,
preliminary agreement on basic tariff increases of 20% in 1975/76 and 15%
in 1978/79 was reached with the Government.  These adjustments would help
assure PLN's financial recovery by 1978/79 on the basis of late 1972 prices.
Inflationary trends necessitated a basic tariff adjustment of about 40% in
mid-1973 (Annex 10). Fuel cost increases which occurred since were offset
through application of the cost adjustment clause included in PLN's tariff.
On the occasion of the recent fuel cost increase (para. 4) PLN chose again to
use the cost adjustment clause rather than applying for an increase in the
basic tariff for compensating not only for the higher fuel cost but also for
increases in other costs. The expected average revenues for 1975/76 are about
32% above the 1974/75 level covering more than the preliminarily agreed 20%
increase plus allowing for the required fuel cost adjustment. On the basis
of today's prices, a tariff increase of only about 10% is required in 1978/79.
3. Purchased Power
The bulIk of projected power purchases is from the Juanda hydro
station (Jatiluhur Authority), presently at Rp 1.47/kwh. This expense
increases in step with PLN's tariff adjustment.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
4.  Fuel
Present fuel prices (effective April 2, 1975) are::
High Speed Diesel (HSD): Rp 22/1 (increase 15.8%)
Industrial Diesel (IDO): Rp 19/1 (increase 46.2%)
Bunker "C" Oil:           Rp 19/1 (increase 58.3%)
plus transportation cost, if any:
On average, PLN's annual fuel expenses have increased by about 24%. Despite
the substantial increase, fuel prices are still subsidized (for instance
the price for Bunker "C" oil is equivalent to US$7.28 per barrel).
5.   Personnel Expenses
The assumed increases for personnel expenses are proportionately
higher than the ones for the other expenses. This is due to expenditures
for newly recruited personnel and training. In April 1974 PLN's personnel
received a 200% increase on basic salaries (impact on total personnel cost
only about 16% because of large fringe benefits which were not increased);
in addition a 25% increase was granted on fringe benefits selected groups
of personnel are entitled to. The remunerations in PLN are now above the
average Government level, but still below private industry.
6.  Material
Large increases have been assumed in the cost of material due to
the need for a heavy spare part replenishment program.
7.  Depreciation
5% per year have been assumed as average depreciation rate. This
is based on past experience.

CONSTRUCTION
34-36         All Activities                   With ane exeeptioa (quarterly budget rnlease), only eomparatively aniaportant probl-e=  in eoanecticn with performanae ieprvenet have been attacked.  Initial eark hba  been dane on the establishment of
67                                            basic tieciael standards, disco:sions acre held on regolations for obtaining power connections, etc.; howeer no real progress has yet beea made on  nttlers  -uch bs p-a3eat iaple-satation, nantra-t
ad=tnistrctioa and pr-aureneat.  C....qa ently, the originally envisaged ausistanee progran was net maintained and a sew series of nativities has to be andertaken.
Presently the following is eavisaged:
1.  Procorement:  SOFRELEC sill delegate a pro.urenoat aspect she sill first train PLN personnel in proso et procedur-s and later provide advi-e in day to day problems.  This assignmnt,
seheduled to start in early 1975, ill take about one year to -emplete.
2.  oanran-nt Budget:  I_ the past los-en-neat budget proeed--'s, partie-larly the  -eehanien e,ployed  n releo.siog thz budgeted local funds,  erse one of the maJor obstaelns to efficient project
impleneatation.  Reneatly the Gocer.-nent agreed to release in cdynace so a quarterly basis the budgeted local fands through oemmercial banks and administered by PLN headqsarters;
befoe evry  iagle budget ites had to be applied fo r through '1 d trsry  ffic    aeni-osly delaying iapl-enati.  ThIs  ppear: to be a Step in the eight direstian.
3.  Planning and loaateuttoa  -irhings  Training  la-se  for senir offisars on "hydra", "thcral" and "plant -o              -iaining" (for instance acepta-c tests) will be held.  Training is aehdoled
to start in early 1975.
The largest obstacle to s-rioos improvenent in the field of ooantructlon is the lack of qunlified engineers. Nevertheless, improvenent in the speed and qanlity of pr-ejet impleneatation is cruoial
for PLN's recsvery and all means available will have ts con-estrate on thia goal.
