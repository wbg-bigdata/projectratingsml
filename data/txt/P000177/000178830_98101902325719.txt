INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$2.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Technical Assistance
Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic memorandum on Burundi (1838-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on April 25, 1978. Updated country data are pro-
vided in Annex I.
3.        With an average GNP per capita of about US$130, Burundi is one of
the poorest countries in the world and is designated as "least developed" by
the United Nations. Of a population of about four million, only 121,000 are
wage earners; the remainder depends mainly on subsistence agriculture. The
Government is facing several critical problems in its efforts to develop the
economy: the capability to prepare and manage programs and projects is weak;
the agricultural labor force is largely untrained; and population growth keeps
straining Burundi's productive resources, particularly in agriculture.
Despite the recent adoption of a policy of "spaced births", the problem of
population pressure cannot be solved in the immediate future; therefore,
a major effort must be made to increase agricultural productivity. Agri-
cultural yields have been declining, because more and more marginal land has
been brought under cultivation. The search for more arable land has caused
large-scale deforestation, resulting in a severe lack of firewood in the
rural areas and forcing the development of alternative energy sources.
4.        Improvements to the internal transport system will be of limited
effect unless reliable external links can be established. Shipments of
imports and exports through the principal outlet via Tanzania have tradi-
tionally encountered frequent delays and losses because of theft. However,
some action is being taken to improve the situation. For example, several
donors (Canada, Belgium and the European Development Fund) are considering
financing the rehabilitation of railway and port infrastructure in Tanzania.
The link via Rwanda and Uganda to the former East African Railways and the
port of Mombasa (Kenya) is becoming increasingly attractive with the con-
tinuing improvement in national highways between Bujumbura and Mombasa.
Recent hostilities in Uganda have illustrated the vulnerability of Burundi's
external transport lines, as imports of heavy bulk goods (gasoline, construc-
tion materials, etc.) and equipment came to a standstill, affecting prices,
production, trade and development work.



- 2 -
5.        Recent Economic Developments.  Over the period 1970-77, Burundi's
GDP grew at a rate of only 2.2 percent per annum in real terms, (about the
same as population), and per capita income stagnated. Growth was concentrated
mainly in the capital city, particularly in manufacturing and construction
activity. Food crop production grew significantly slower than did population,
averaging an increase of 1.3 percent annually, while the production of export
crops, including coffee, fluctuated around a declining trend.
6.        The overall investment rates of the economy rose considerably in
1977, when it accounted for 11.0 percent of GDP, but it is still below the
average for low-income countries. The allocation of investment between
production and infrastructure, one-third and two-thirds, respectively, has
not changed noticeably in recent years. The bulk of investment in the rural
areas has been to a large extent financed by official external aid and has
been allocated mostly to export crops. In 1977, the public sector accounted
for about 90 percent of gross fixed capital formation. This has been accom-
plished largely by government investment in social and transport infrastructure
and by the activities of public corporations. Investment by private enter-
prises has been relatively weak, reflecting in part the excess capacity
prevailing in certain industries and the limited financial and managerial
capabilities of most private firms.
7.        Burundi's coffee production has become increasingly important for
its foreign exchange earnings: the share of coffee in total exports rose from
79 percent in 1965 to 88 percent in 1977-78. Owing mainly to the sharp
increases in the world coffee price and large coffee crop in 1976-77, average
prices for Burundi's exports more than doubled in 1976 and again in 1977. For
the first time since 1970, the current account balance registered a surplus,
amounting to US$16.9 million in 1977. By the end of 1977, Burundi had accumu-
lated about US$86 million in net foreign reserves, equivalent to 11 months of
imports. The improvement in the terms of trade resulted in income gains
equivalent to an increase of about one-fourth of GDP over 1975. Including
these gains, gross national savings, which averaged only 5.4 percent of GDP in
1970-75 and were below the level for most developing countries, increased to
11 percent and 16 percent of GDP in 1976 and 1977 respectively. The increases
in income have accrued primarily to the Government through higher export
taxes; the rest was shared by the small coffee producers. Producer prices
were increased two-and-a-half-fold from 1975 to 1977, but the export tax on
coffee more than quadrupled in 1976 and was raised by another 300 percent in
June 1977. This resulted in an increase in tax revenues from coffee exports
from a level of BuF 154 million (4.4 percent of total current revenue in 1975)
to an unprecedented BuF 1,250 million in 1976 and BuF 3,500 million (43
percent of current revenue) in 1977.
8.        The increase in Government revenues allowed substantial increases
in current and investment expenditures. During 1976-77, ordinary budgetary
expenditures shot up by about 58 percent to BuF 5.1 billion, owing to signif-
icant increases in the basic salary scale, the effects of a 14 percent devalu-
ation which took place in May 1976, and the establishment of new ministries.
The salary increases were the first since the mid-sixties, although in real
terms, the average salary has increased very little if any since that period.



-3-
Revenues allocated to ministries which provide economic and social services,
which had declined in real terms up to 1975, were increased by 57 percent in
1976-77. Nevertheless, budgeted amounts for agriculture in 1977 were still
low and constituted only 3.8 percent of the ordinary budget. Although in 1976
only half of the investment budget was spent, investment expenditures were
three times higher than in 1975. In 1977, Government investment doubled to
about BuF 2 billion. In spite of the substantial increases in expenditures,
overall budgetary transactions, which showed a small deficit in 1975, registered
a surplus of BuF 170 million and BuF 890 million in 1976 and 1977 respectively,
due to the higher growth of tax revenues.
9.        Although Burundi still holds a comfortable net international
reserve position (US$69 million at the end of 1978, equivalent to over eight
months of imports), the situation is less favorable than it was 18 months ago.
During 1978 Burundi lost US$17 million of its reserves, and this despite a
large increase in net disbursements of external loans. According to preliminary
information, several factors were responsible for this deterioration. Despite
a one-third increase in exports of coffee, total merchandise exports dropped
by one fourth to US$67 million, mainly as a result of a 50 percent decline in
the average unit price of this commodity. Although part of this decline was
attributable to unfavorable sales in the forward market, most of it was due to
deteriorating world market conditions. Additionally, in the wake of rapidly
increasing public investment, strong consumer demand, a 12 percent increase in
import prices and rising insurance and freight costs, Burundi's merchandise
imports shot up by one-third to US$98 million. Faced with a significant
decline in revenues from coffee exports, as well as rapidly rising expendi-
tures, after two years of surpluses, the Government was forced to borrow close
to BuF 1,196 million from the banking system (2 percent of GDP) to finance its
overall deficit.
10.       Government Development Strategy.  Since 1977 the Government has
designed a new strategy to achieve social justice, ethnic reconciliation
and improved living conditions in the rural areas. The poll tax, which
was levied on all males, was replaced by compulsory deposits which can be
withdrawn after three years. In addition, small farmers no longer have to
provide services to landowners in exchange for land, as they have acquired
exclusive rights to the land they cultivate. Likewise, land which was
obtained in an irregular manner for speculative purposes has been returned
to the state or to the farmers who cultivated it. Other aspects of the new
policies, which are embodied in the Third Five-Year Plan (1978-82), are:
(a) to emphasize agricultural production to face the increasing needs in
food supplies of the fast-growing population; (b) to increase the rate
of economic growth substantially in order to provide greater employment
opportunities and more income to the poorest segments of the population;
(c) to raise the investment rate significantly; (d) to give the Government a
more active role in mobilizing financial and manpower resources an in parti-
cipating in mixed enterprises in the commercial and productive sectors; and
(e) to foster decentralization of economic and social activity away from the
capital city and achieve a more balanced geographic distribution through the



-4-
creation of development poles, voluntary settlement of the peasant population
in villages, and migration from densely populated areas. To facilitate the
implementation of its strategy, the Government has strengthened the role of
planning by elevating the planning organization to the rank of ministry and by
giving it a key role in the allocation and monitoring of public investment.
I1.       External Assistance and Prospects.  Economic prospects are less
favorable than during 1976-77 as a result of rapid declines in coffee prices.
The major issues which the Government currently faces are how to limit the
loss in reserves, preserve its revenue base, and contain inflationary pres-
sures. This will require cautious budgetary policies and a significant
reduction of the Government's investment targets for the remainder of the
Third Five-Year Plan. In addition, the producer price for coffee will have
to be reduced in real terms, as the world market price for this commodity is
expected to average in real terms, during 1979-82, only 38 percent of the
1977 level. The government is currently revising its policies in all these
areas as well as considering the use of IMF facilities.
12.       If the government continues to focus on development and strengthens
its administration, it may achieve a steady, albeit slow, improvement in per
capita income. If mining of Burundi's nickel deposits proves feasible, the
prospects over the next ten years would be much better. However, the commer-
cial viability of exploiting these deposits has yet to be established.
Regional development in Central Africa will also be important to Burundi's
economy. On September 20, 1976, Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire signed a conven-
tion establishing the "Economic Community of the Countries of Great Lakes".
The Community, which has its seat in Gisenyi, Rwanda, aims inter alia at
stimulating and intensifying intra-regional trade and cooperation in a wide
range of activities. A major objective of the Community is the electrifica-
tion of the Great Lakes region. The three countries have also agreed to set
up a joint development bank, exploit methane deposits around Lake Kivu, and
develop a fishing industry around Lake Tanganyika. They also instructed the
Secretariat to investigate ways of improving the transport system around the
lakes in order to ease the enclavement of Burundi and Rwanda.
13.       Disbursements of official loans and capital grants averaged US$21
million per annum during 1976-77, most of it coming from Belgium, IDA, the
UN agencies and the European Development Fund. In the 1973-77 period, total
net foreign capita]L inflows amounted to about US$95 million, of which US$66
million was in the form of grants. On December 31, 1978, Burundi's external
medium and long-term debt amounted to about US$55.6 million (excluding
undisbursed amounts), of which IDA held 26 percent. Debt service averaged
3.7 percent of export earnings during 1976-77, with IDA receiving 18 percent
of all debt service payments. Due to the large grant element in external
assistance, the Bank Group will probably continue to hold an important
proportion of Burundi's debt. Notwithstanding the low debt service ratio,
Burundi is unable to absorb any borrowing on commercial terms, because of its
poverty and the instability of its export earnings. External aid should
therefore be on grant or very concessional terms and continue to include a
substantial share of local cost financing.



-5-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Since IDA lending started in Burundi in 1966, ten credits have
been made totalling US$48.4 million. One credit (US$1.1 million) helped
improve water supply to Bujumbura; three credits (US$13.0 million) were for
agriculture (coffee production and fishing); three credits (US$19.4 million,
including an engineering credit of about US$400,000) helped start a highway
maintenance and improvement program; a US$10.0 million credit is supporting
the improvement of primary education; a US$1.5 million credit was made for a
technical assistance project and the National Economic Development Bank
received a credit of US$3.4 million. Seven of these credits (US$44.1 million)
were made after 1973 since civil strife in the years before made lending
difficult. The Second Coffee Project and the Fisheries project are being
cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.0 million) and the Abu Dhabi Fund (US$1.2
million). The Second Highway Project is cofinanced by the Arab Bank for
Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) in an amount of US$6.0 million. Annex
II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and notes on the execution of
projects and the status of disbursements as of March 31, 1979.
15.       Project performance has been uneven, reflecting the lack of local
management capacity and technical skills which is likely to remain a stumbling
block for some time to come. This situation has particularly delayed the
execution of the Fisheries and the Second Coffee projects, although recently
the implementation of both projects has improved. Disbursement of the credit
to the National Economic Development Bank has been lagging because of the
general sluggishness of the industrial sector. On the other hand, implementa-
tion of the Education project and the Second Highway project is satisfactory.
Following a slow start - mainly because of recruitment difficulties - the
First Technical Assistance Credit is entirely committed. Nearly all key staff
envisaged to be hired under the project are in post and several studies have
been completed (see paras. 23-26).
16.       Future IDA operations in Burundi will continue to focus on improving
agricultural productivity, transportation and education. Documents regarding
a proposed forestry project, which is designed to help Burundi rebuild its
depleted wood resources, will be circulated to the Executive Directors
shortly. Preparation of an agricultural development project which would
aim at improving the living standards of the rural population in one of the
poorest areas of the country, is being completed and the project is expected
to be appraised early next year. Further improvements of the road sector will
be envisaged under a third highway project to facilitate the distribution of
foodstuffs between surplus and deficit areas and reduce regional price differ-
ences. A second education project is being appraised to improve and expand
technical education and an urban project is being prepared to help improve the
living conditions of the urban poor in Bujumbura. We also intend to provide
further assistance to the industrial sector by supporting the activities of
the National Economic Development Bank. Lending will continue to include
assistance for project management and technical expertise.

PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
17.       During a Round Table Conference held in 1978 by the Government of
Burundi and foreign aid agencies active in Burundi, the Government stated that
it faced two basic problems in absorbing foreign aid: (i) a lack of suitable
projects prepared by the Government and (ii) a limited number of competent
local counterpart-personnel to help execute projects and to take over project
management once the investment period had been completed. Because of the long
period it requires to establish a sufficiently large national base of managers,
administrators,at independence in 1960 only a few secondary and university
students had graduated. and skilled workers, qualified staff is still scarce
and includes at present about 700 high-level staff, most of whom are employed
in the Government to carry out administrative tasks. Middle level personnel
is also scarce which in turn limits the efficiency of high level staff.
18.       As a result, Burundi needs substantial technical assistance and to
meet this requirement external financing for this purpose has risen steadily
in the past years. In 1977, funds committed for technical assistance (see
table below) reached nearly US$30.0 million (about 40 percent of total
external aid) of which about US$20.0 million was provided under bilateral
programs, US$6.0 million by the UN and US$4.0 million by other multilateral
agencies. About US$19.0 million of the technical assistance funds were
committed for education and agriculture. Teachers constitute the largest
single group of technical assistants. In agriculture, most technical assis-
tants are engaged in research or project implementation. The largest provider
of bilateral technical assistance is Belgium, followed by France and the
Federal Republic of Germany. The European Development Fund provides mainly
project related assistance, while assistance of UN institutions is spread over
a variety of different activities.

19.       Belgium provides a substantial amount of technical assistance
to the education sector. The number of Belgian teachers in all levels of
education was expected to reach 200 by the end of 1978. In addition, tech-
nical assistance is provided to the Bureau of Rural Education, to the Project
Unit which implements the IDA financed Education project, to the Burundian
institute of agricultural research (ISABU) and several Belgian financed
agricultural and livestock projects. Belgium is also financing the prepara-
tion of a large rural development project in the North-East of Burundi (Kirundo
region).
20.       France provides teachers and experts in education management and
has a substantial number of medical personnel attached to various hospitals
established with French financing. In agriculture, it provides technical



-8-
expertise in forestry development, livestock improvement and food production.
The Federal Republic of Germany has provided several experts to the government
agency responsible for electricity and water distribution (REGIDESO), the
Ministries of Planning and Agriculture and the Mechanical Workshop of the
Ministry of Public Works. It also finances several preinvestment studies in
infrastructure.
21.       Technical assistance provided by the European Development Fund
(EDF) is concentrated in agriculture. Several experts are assigned to the
Tea Bureau to help manage EDF financed tea projects, to a large irriga-
tion project in the Rusizi valley, and to a forestry project. EDF also
intends to finance additional feasibility studies regarding Burundi's
international transport links with Dar es Salaam. Technical assistance
provided by the UN has been spread over many sectors with main emphasis on
health and on mineral research, which has led to the discovery of nickel
deposits.
22.       The overall focus of technical assistance on agriculture and educa-
tion is expected to remain unchanged. While the Government encourages foreign
aid agencies to provide qualified experts to fill the gaps in local expertise,
it has on occasion voiced criticism of the quality of experts, their ability
to cooperate with local officials and the limited choice the Government has
been given in their recruitment. Often technical assistance is limited to the
execution of projects financed by the individual aid giver. While recognizing
that it is not always capable of assigning suitable local staff to foreign
experts, the Government complains that counterpart personnel is sometimes
treated as "second-best" and given too little responsibility. It maintains
that the expert and his local counterpart should form a team to avoid that the
national staff - as is often the case - becomes disinterested. Training of
local staff by experts hired under foreign aid programs appears to have had
limited results thus far and under the proposed Second Technical Assistance
project an effort will be made to improve this situation at least within the
scope of this project (see paras. 42-43). The Government plans to provide
greater continuity in the assignment of nationals to foreign experts, as they
are too frequently transferred to more important executive functions before
they have actually had the time to improve their technical knowledge suffic-
iently and broaden their experience at staff level.
23.       To overcome some of the difficulties described above, the First
Technical Assistan,ze project was designed to provide the Government with
access to additional untied aid for requirements that could not be met ade-
quately by technical assistance available from existing bilateral and multi-
lateral sources.  It was particularly aimed at improving Burundi's economic
planning mechanism.  It also provided for the implementation of feasibility
studies for specific agricultural and industrial projects. The project has
proved useful in improving government performance in these areas, although
not all of its objectives could be achieved. The new Ministry of Planning
was strenghtened with a senior economist, whose contribution was instrumental
in preparing the Third Five-Year Development Plan (1978-82) and the 1978

economics, who previously contributed on an individual basis with limited
guidance and coordination, were grouped as a team under the general super-
vision of the senior economist and as a result overall performance of the
Ministry has markedly improved. For the first time in Burundi, the Ministry
established a macro-economic framework in preparation of the Third Five-Year
Development Plan. A beginning was made with conducting project identification
and sector work more systematically through interministerial working groups at
various levels.
24.       In addition, a senior statistician was recruited to help improve
the efficiency of the Department of Statistics, which has resulted in a
considerable improvement of the Department's output of statistical surveys
and information on agriculture, national accounts and various sectors of the
economy. A junior statistician was employed to help carry out a statistical
survey in an agriculturally rich area to examine yields and potential improve-
ments and contribute to other programs undertaken by the Department. Moreover,
three experts were recruited to assist, respectively, in the development of
Burundi's peat resources, the management of a national savings bank and the
organization and management of a government agency responsible for the
financing of low cost housing. Several studies were carried out under the
project,including a prefeasibility study regarding a possible sugar project in
the Mosso regioLu and the preparation of an agricultural development project
(see para. 19).
25.       The main problems experienced during the execution of the project
resulted from difficulties in identifying and recruiting suitable experts
and delays in the signing of their contracts. As a consequence, the hiring
of two experts who were to assist in the preparation of a possible nickel
project (a metallurgist and a mineral economist) was postponed and their
financing will be continued during the proposed Second Technical Assistance
project. A number of short term consultancies for preinvestment studies of
specific agricultural and industrial projects which were envisaged under the
project did not materialize because of a lack of competent staff in the
planning units of the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry and also because
of a general lack of entrepreneurial activity in Burundi. As a result the
pipeline of feasible projects has remained very limited. Even in the area
where the project was relatively satisfactory, i.e. in the improved performance
of the Ministry of Planning, execution was adversely affected by the weakness
of the administration. For example, technical assistants had to devote too
large a portion of their time to carrying out basic administrative and manage-
ment tasks which should normally be handled by local personnel As a consequence,
the professional capacity of technical assistants was not always fully utilized.
26.       In summary, execution of the project proved that the Government
has still some distance to go before it can be expected to have the capac'ity
to identify, prepare and implement feasible and justified projects and that



- 10 -
it will require continued assistance for quite some time. In recognition of
the above, the Government has requested further support from the Association
in the provision of technical expertise to help it implement its current
five-year development plan as well as is realistically possible.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The project was appraised in September 1978.  Negotiations were
held from April 16-20, 1979. The delegation of Burundi was led by H.E.
Donatien Bihute, MiLnister of Planning.
28.       The purpose of the project is to assist in the further strengthening
of the Government's economic planning mechanism started under the first
Technical Assistance project (credit 613-BU). In addition, the project will
help improve the p:Lanning and project preparation and implementation capacity
of the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry. It also provides funds for
feasibility and preinvestment studies to help establish a pipeline of feasible
and justified projects. However, the number of studies resulting from the
project is not expected to be very large. This can only be improved very
gradually with the strengthening of the organization and staffing of the
planning and operating Ministries. The Ministry of Planning will have the
prime responsibility for carrying out the project.
29.       Specifically the project would comprise:
(i) continuation of the technical assistance to the Ministry
of Planning presently provided under the First Technical
Assistance project;
(ii) reorganization and strengthening of the planning units of
the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry;
(iii)  selective training, either on-the-job or in foreign
educational institutions;
(iv) feasibility and preinvestment studies in selected fields;
(v) short-term expertise to advise in project preparation,
implementation and management of specific projects;
(vi) provision of equipment and vehicles to enable foreign
experts to carry out their tasks.
The project would provide about 16 man-years of long term advisory services
and about 140 man-months of short and medium term consultancies for specific
studies and project preparation. Profiles of advisers which have already
been identified are detailed in Annex IV.



- 11 -
30.       Attention has been paid to the technical assistance programs fi-
nanced by other agencies to avoid overlapping of the proposed project with
activities underway or planned by those agencies (see paras. 18-21). Gen-
erally, the project will provide the Government with additional untied and
flexible resources for purposes which are not adequately met by existing
bilateral and multilateral aid. In areas where the project will supplement
the assistance provided by other aid agencies, efforts will be made to in-
crease the efficiency of the experts through reorganizing and streamlining the
respective planning and project preparation units. The proposed credit is
expected to be committed by mid-1981.
Detailed features
31.       Ministry of Planning:  The Ministry of Planning receives technical
assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany (five experts, in agricul-
ture, industry, infrastructure and sectoral planning) and France (one energy
expert). Under the project, the position of the senior economist presently
financed under the First Technical Assistance project will be continued. As
principal adviser to the Director-General of Planning and Statistical Studies,
the senior economist will continue to head the General Planning Division and
coordinate the activities of the other foreign experts each of whom heads a
sub-division in their respective fields of competence. The senior economist
will be given the additional tasks of liaising with the planning units of the
Ministries of Agriculture and Industry. He will supervise the activities of
the advisers hired under the project and coordinate their work when necessary.
In addition, the position of the senior statistician financed under the first
project will be continued. Under the direction of the Director of the Depart-
ment of Statistics, he will lead a team of four foreign statisticians. Two of
these will be financed by the proposed credit and one of them will be specif-
ically recruited to prepare and supervise agricultural statistical surveys in
consultation with the planning unit of the Ministry of Agriculture.
32.       Ministry of Agriculture:  Presently, the planning unit of the
Ministry of Agriculture is understaffed and its management is weak. It
is headed by a Director-General, an agronomist by profession, assisted by five
staff members, two national agriculturalists and three foreign experts (an
agronomist, an agricultural economist and an expert in animal husbandry).
The limited capacity of the planning unit is partially responsible for the
lack of well prepared agricultural feasibility studies and the formulation of
an adequately documented pipeline of possible projects. Since development of
the agricultural sector is the immediate priority of the Third Development
Plan, the Government attaches great importance to the strengthening of the
planning unit.
33.       To meet this objective, a senior agricultural economist with exten-
sive experience in agricultural planning and project preparation will be
recruited; his main task will be to direct the planning team, organize and
guide its work program and devise an efficient system of overall project
supervision and evaluation to generate feedback to be used for improved
design and implementation of future projects. As head of the planning team



-12 -
he will be reporting directly to the Director-General of the planning unit.
Two additional agriculturalists, one of whom could be an animal husbandry
expert, will be recruited to support the team. The team will also be res-
ponsible for the coordination of agricultural projects financed by foreign
aid.
34.       In view of the expected increase in agricultural project financing,
the Ministry needs to establish an efficient system of project accounts to
enable it to oversee overall spending for agricultural projects, forecast
the need for local currency, achieve uniformity in data information and con-
trol individual project accounts more effectively.  This will be necessary,
in particular, for rural development programs with multiple project activities
such as the agricultural development project (Kirimiro region) currently being
prepared with financing under the First Technical Assistance project as well
as other projects covering large agricultural areas which are being envisaged
for financing by Belgium (Kirundo region) and the Saudi Fund for Development
(Rumonge region).
35.       Improvement of agriculturaL planning and project preparation would
not be meaningful if it were not accompanied by a strengthening of extension
services. Presently, extension services consist of about 800 extension
agents, i.e. a ratio of one agent for about 1000 farmers. They are insuffi-
ciently trained and ill-equipped to carry out their tasks adequately. The
Government's objective is to improve the quality of extension and increase the
number of extension agents per farmer family. As part of the implementation
of the objectives of the Third Development Plan, the Government is pursuing
the improvement of the extension services simultaneously with the strengthening
of the planning and project preparation unit. The improvement of the extension
system is of vital importance if the projected expansion of agricultural
investments is to be attained. Under the project, the Government intends to
carry out a study to improve the training of extension agents and the effi-
ciency of the regional services of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Govern-
ment's efforts to improve extension services will be closely monitored during
execution of agricultural projects financed with IDA assistance.
36.       Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  In the industrial sector,
the Third Development Plan places emphasis on the creation of new jobs,
using labor intensive technologies, and on activities providing foreign
exchange savings or earnings. The objective is to give priority to industries
which process local raw materials (agro-industries) and supply tools and local
construction materials. Thus far, the Government has not been very successful
in achieving these objectives, although the possibilities for the establishment
and expansion of small and medium scale enterprises were identified when
the Association extended a US$3.4 million Credit to Burundi in 1977 in support
of the National Economic Development Bank (Banque Nationale de Developpement
Economique, BNDE). At present, only about one third of this credit has been
committed. Burundi's landlocked location and its limited market are partially
responsible for this situation. However, the Government has not yet agreed on
a clear set of poLicies toward the industrial sector. In addition, BNDE's



lending has been hampered by inadequate project preparation and insufficient
cooperation between the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and BNDE. Although
the Credit to BNDE includes technical assistance to its Investment Unit for
project preparation and appraisal, BNDE remains to a large extent dependent on
the Ministry for project proposals. Presently, the Ministry's planning and
project preparation unit is assisted by three UNIDO experts (two engineers
and a small scale enterprise expert); however, it lacks sufficient technical
expertise in industrial development to carry out its task satisfactorily.
37.       As a first step towards improving this situation, consultants will
prepare a study on the operations of the planning unit of the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry, its requirements to plan and prepare industrial projects
in cooperation with BNDE and make recommendations regarding its organization
and the need for technical expertise to be financed under the proposed Credit.
This should allow the Ministry to improve the preparation of economically
justified industrial projects, establish monitoring mechanisms for their
implementation and evaluation and train national staff in project analysis and
control techniques. The Credit will also provide funds to hire specific
technical expertise on short term assignments as required by the individual
projects to be prepared. However, the implementation of industrial projects
will also depend on the establishment of clear government policies regarding
the development of the industrial sector. This question is being reviewed
with the Government in the context of the implementation of the National
Economic Development Bank project (Credit 731-BU) to ensure that such policies
will be developed simultaneously with the strengthening of the Ministry's
project preparation capacity.
38.       Nickel development:  A UNDP-financed prefeasibility study concerning
the possible exploitation of Burundi's nickel deposits was completed in 1978.
The identified deposits, which are located in the south east of the country in
an area without any infrastructure, amount to about 300 million tons of which
about two thirds are reportedly of medium grade nickel content. The total
cost of the nickel exploitation (including infrastructure requirements) has
been estimated at close to one billion dollars at 1978 prices. The The
Government of Burundi intends to carry out a feasibility study to determine
the real potential of the project, since, should the project prove feasible
and justified, it would mean a substantial change in the country's economic
outlook. Because of the complexity of large size mining operations, the
Government has requested the assistance of the Bank Group in discussions with
potential investors and in the financing of key personnel to help analyze the
studies and negotiate appropriate contracts for studies with interested
parties. The project will finance the services of a metallurgical expert, a
mineral economist and a legal adviser, who would be assigned to the Ministry
of Geology and Mines, to provide the Government with objective advice in
technical, financial and legal matters.
39.       Additional assistance and studies:  The project will continue
to provide long term management assistance and training to the National
Savings Bank begun under the first project. The operations of the Savings
Bank have substantially increased since the Government inaugurated in 1977,
a system of compulsory savings (which can be withdrawn after three years). In



- 14 -
principle, all income-receiving persons need to contribute to the savings bank
a minimum of 500 Burundi francs per year. The system is designed to en-
courage savings among the population and requires a considerable expansion of
the Bank's administrative staff and local offices. A consulting firm has been
hired to provide expertise and to supervise the Bank's operations at regular
intervals. In addition, the project will provide continued assistance to a
newly created government agency, which will be responsible, inter alia, for
the provision of credits for and credit management of low cost housing. The
agency is expected to play an important role in the execution of an urban
development project, which is currently being prepared with IDA assistance.
40.       Several feasibility studies expected to be financed under the
project have been identified, in particular for the establishment of an
agricultural credit system, the marketing of industrial and agricultural
products and the establishment of technical service centers in the interior
(carpenting, plumbing, etc.). Other feasibility studies are expected to
result from the planning and project preparation activities of the Minis-
tries of Agriculture and Commerce and Industry; additional suggetions may
also be made at a Round Table Conference on Agriculture expected to take
place in late 1979.
Training
41.       Because of the high cost of foreign expertise, it is important
that Burundi draws as much as possible from the technical know how to be
provided under the project. Since the results of training efforts during
the first project have been limited (see para 22), greater care will be taken
by the Government to ensure that suitable Barundi staff be assigned to foreign
experts for the duration of their services (see Section 3.03(b) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement). In addition, when recruiting foreign experts,
due attention will be paid to their experience with working conditions in
developing countries and their ability to relate to national staff. Their
training duties will be clearly defined in their terms of reference and
monitored during project supervision.
42.       Since existing bilateral and multilateral programs make ample
provision for training, financing of scholarships under the proposed project
is limited to specific needs arising in the field of statistics, planning,
project preparation and analysis. Priority will be given to training in
institutions located in Africa. It is also expected that Barundi staff
will be given an opportunity to make continued use of EDI courses to enhance
their education and experience. In addition, staff will benefit from study
tours to Bank Group financed projects in other African countries that are
similar to those carried out or planned in Burundi.
Project Implementation
43.       The Ministry of Planning will be responsible for the overall imple-
mentation of the project (Section 3.01 of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment)and will coordinate its execution with the government agencies concerned
by the project. It will also formulate specific proposals for the use of



- 15 -
the Credit inasmuch as its utilization has not yet been defined and submit
these proposals to the Association for prior approval (Section 3.06 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). Contracts with consultants and individual
experts will be subject to the approval of the Association (Section 3.03(a) of
the draft Development Credit Agreement). Because information on qualified
consultant firms and experts is not readily available in Burundi and in order
to avoid delays due to slow international communications, the Association will
assist the Government in the recruitment process. Funds will be provided to
permit the Government to interview selected candidates in Bujumbura to ensure
that the Government is satisfied with their qualifications and their suitability
for the job. Final selection of both individual candidates and of firms will
be made by the Government
Project Cost and Financing
44.       The total cost of the project has been estimated at US$3.0 million
(including a negligible amount of taxes) of which US$2.5 million or 83 percent
is foreign exchange. The costs by category of expenditure are summarized as
follows:
Foreign
Exchange
Local      Foreign      Total    Component
--US$ thousands equivalent--         %
Long term advisory services          300         1,310       1,610       81
Short term advisory services         170           940      1,110        84
Training                              -            150         150      100
Equipment & Vehicles                  10            50          60       83
Unallocated                           20            50          70       71
500        2,500       3,000        83
The cost of one expert-year has been estimated at about US$84,000 correspond-
ing to US$7,000 per month (including overhead costs). About US$20,000 has
been allocated for recruitment activities, such as advertisements and inter-
views. The project also provides for the purchase of a limited number of
vehicles and office equipment and supplies to support the activities of the
advisers. The Government will finance office accommodation, secretarial
assistance and counterpart salaries estimated at about 20 percent of the total
emolument of the advisers. The proposed credit will finance 83 percent of the
total cost of the project. It is expected to be fully committed by mid-1981.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       The selection of consultants will be in accordance with the Associ-
ation's normal procedures. Procurement of equipment and vehicles will be in
accordance with the Borrower's normal procedures which include soliciting
competitive bids from local suppliers and are considered satisfactory.
The Association will disburse 100 percent of foreign expenditures for salaries
and emoluments of advisers, consultancy services, and of the foreign costs of
training; in respect of equipment and vehicles, the Association will disburse
100 percent of foreign expenditures or 80 percent of local expenditures.



- 16 -
Benefits and Risks
46.       The technical expertise to be provided under the proposed project
will help the Government to continue its efforts to formulate more effective
development programs and to identify and prepare specific investment projects.
It will help strengthen the Government's planning and project preparation
capacity by alleviating the critical shortage of experienced economists,
agriculturalists, individual experts and statisticians. It will also permit
the Government to make more efficient use of the foreign aid extended to
Burundi in the field of economic planning in general and agricultural and
industrial planning and project preparation in particular. Optimally, the
project would result in the identification and preparation of a number of
viable investment projects. However, given the fact that Burundi is still at
an early stage of development and facing critical socio-economic constraints,
the time frame within which substantial results can be realistically expected
remains uncertain. Moreover, some delays in execution of the proposed project
may be expected in recruiting suitably qualified experts and the assignment of
counterpart staff.  To minimize such delays, the Association will closely
supervise the project and assist in the recruitment of advisers and consulting
firms.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III of this report.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

Xote:  The adjusted group averages for each indicator are population-weighted geometric means, excluding the extreme values of the indicator and the most
populated country in each group.  Coverage of countries among the indicators depends on availability of data and is not uniform.  Due to lack of data,
group averages for Capital Surplus Oil Exporters and indicators of access to water and excreta disposal, housing, income distribution and poverty are
simplo p-oulatios-weighted geometric means withu-t the exclusion of extrcme values.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 467-BU      Highway Maintenance Project:  US$5.0 million of
March 27, 1974; Effective Date: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The Highway Mlaintenance Project is the first phase of a long-term
program to establish an efficient highway maintenance organization. The
project which has been substantially completed consists of the purchase of
maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel and construction materials, the
construction of a workshop and consultant services for technical assistance
and training, a study on the development of the road sector and feasibility
studies. The project is cofinanced by the UNDP (US$1.05 million for technical
assistance), Germany (US$1.33 million for the construction of and technical
assistance to the mechanical workshop in Bujumbura) and Belgium (US$400,000
for local cost financing). Execution of the project has been satisfactory,
except for some early delays caused by a procurement problem concerning the
award of a contract for the purchase of 36 tipping trucks (about US$1.3
million). All equipment has now been procured and mechanical road maintenance
is well under way. However, the recent hostilities in neighboring countries
has led to shortages of fuel and cement thus causing some delays in mechanical
maintenance operations. Several manual road maintenance crews and one mecha-
nized maintenance unit have been established resulting in a substantial
improvement in the quality of road maintenance works. The construction of the
workshop in Bumjumbura has been completed. Good progress has been made in
training road maintenance personnel.
Credit No. 593-BU      Second Coffee Improvement Project:  US$5.2 million
of December 5, 1975; Effective Date: October 7, 1976
Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The Project is a continuation of the first Coffee Improvement
Project (US$1.8 million Credit No. 147-BU of April 11, 1969). It is being
co-financed by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.2 million) on a parallel basis and by
Belgium (about US$600,000). The Kuwait Fund finances the construction of
ten coffee washing stations, and Belgium assists in the carrying out of a
coffee research component. The project is designed to support the development

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

of coffee and food production by strengthening and expanding extension services
and distribution of agricultural inputs; it includes a pilot rural development
program to improve livestock and food crop production. Start up of the
project was slow because of frequent changes in foreign and local project
staff. Recently, a new team of foreign experts was appointed and project
management is now improving. Coffee extension work is showing favorable
results but food crop development is behind schedule because of a lack of
selected seeds and past management problems. Construction of the ten coffee
washing stations is expected to be completed by the end of 1979.
Credit No. 613-BU      Technical Assistance Project:  US$1.5 million of
March 19, 1976; Effective date: July 13, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project provides financing for hiring long term advisers
and short-term consultants to assist in planning, collection of statistics
and project preparation. Several long term advisers (including a senior
economic adviser and a senior statistician in the Ministry of Planning, a
savings bank expert and a peat expert) are in post. Experts to advise the
Government on the processing of nickel ore are being recruited. Several
short-term studies and consultant services relating to the preparation of
projects in the agricultural sector have been carried out and are being
completed.
Credit No. 626-BU      Fisheries Development Project; US$6.0 million of
June 11, 1976; Effective Date: February_22, 1977
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This project is designed to increase the production of fish through
the provision of training, equipment and materials to fishermen and to improve
the distribution of fish throughout Burundi. The project also provides
for the preparation of an integrated rural development plan for the coastal
region along Lake Ianganyika and the implementation of pilot development
activities. The project is co-financed by a US$1.2 million loan from the
Abu Dhabi Bund. Initial project execution was slow because of difficulties in
recruiting adequate foreign experts for administration and finance and boat
building, causing delays in the purchase of fisheries equipment and boat
construction. All foreign technical assistants are now in post and project
management is expected to improve. Several newly constructed fishing stations
are in operation. Procurement of fishing equipment is being accelerated and
boat building is underway. Terms of reference for several studies regarding
the development of the coastal lake area have been defined and the studies are
expected to start soon.
Credit No. 679-BU      Education Project:  US$10.0 million of April 28, 1977;
Effective Date: September 1, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
This project assists the Government in continuing and consolidating
the reform of primary education. It aims at substantially expanding primary

Page 4
school enrollments and improving equal opportunity for education. It provides
technical and material assistance to the Rural Education Bureau responsible
for the execution of the reform of primary education as well as for teacher
training. Project implementation is satisfactory despite a chronic shortage
of cement. Twenty-one out of 100 primary schools are under construction and
at various stages of completion. The construction of a printshop has been
completed.
Credit No. 731-BU      Development Bank Project; US$3.4 million of
September 30, 1977; Effective Date: March 27, 1978
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The project aims at providing funds for investment in medium size
productive entreprises and technical assistance to the National Economic
Development Bank (BNDE). Project execution is slow as a result of limited
activities of Burundi's industrial sector (only one sub-project, the financing
of the purchase of trucks for a Government/private owned trucking company
"INTRACO" has been approved). The newly established Industrial Development
Unit of BNDE which is to promote and appraise industrial projects has not yet
been fully staffed because of the difficulty of finding suitable experts.
Credit No. 773-BU      Second Highway Project; US$14.0 million of
March 29, 1978; Effective Date: July 27, 1978
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
This project provides for the construction of the Bujumbura-Rugombo
road (65 km), improvement of roads and bridges, technical assistance and
procurement of maintenance equipment. Project implementation is well under-
way and disbursement has thus far been faster than anticipated at appraisal.
The main road construction has started. However, the recent hostilities in
neighboring countries, which are causing transportation problems resulting
in shortages of fuel, cement and steel, are slowing down project execution.
Supervision consultants for the road construction and consultants for engineer-
ing (road and bridge improvement) have been selected. Consultants providing
technical assistance to the Ministry of Public Works, Equipment and Housing
are in post. Two mechanized units have been set up and have started the road
improvement program.
