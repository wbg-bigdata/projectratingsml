PEFACA
1.   This is the Project Con   -- Report (PCR) for the New Halfa Irrigation Rehabilitation
Proiect in Sudan for which C.   22-SU, in the amount of US$40 million, was approved
on 15 May 1980. The credit 0: r  on June 30, 1989, three years behind schedule. It was
98% disbursed, and the last disbursement was made on January 11, 1990 and the remaining
balance of US$0.84 million was canceled. The cofinanciers, International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the African Development Fund (ADF) provided
financing in the amounts of US$15 million and US$10 million respectively.
2.   The PCR was prepared by FAOIWorld Bank Cooperative Program (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and I). IDA staff revised the draft and completed the final PCR. The
Borrower has nct submitted a Part II. ADF comments are Annex B.
3.   The PCR, which was prepared following a mission to the Sudan in December 1989, is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA), the Project Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower and internal Bank memoranda.

EYALUA3IQN SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The project objectives were to: a) improve agricultural production on about 400,000
feddans; b) assist Sudan's Export Action Program (EAP) in its goal of increasing foreign
exchange earnings; c) improve living conditions in the project area, and d) strengthen the
financial and technical capabilities of the New Halfa Agricultural Production Corporation
(NHAPC).
Im_emnato Exieg
2.     The project was implemented generally in accordance with the SAR. The main
variations from the appraised project were the omission of the road construction contract, the
addition of civil engineering work at the Kashm-el Girba dam, and increases in the quantities
of equipment, vehicles, spares, insecticides and health supplies.1/ The project was
substantially completed three years later than estimated in the DCA, mainly due to: delay in
the credit becoming effective, delays in the start of the components not implemented by
NHAPC; temporary suspension of disbursement by IDA and ADF due to GOS's repayment
default; slow procurement and administrative delays; and the floods of 1988 which delayed
the works at Kashm-el Girba dam.
3.    Most of the variations were caused by oversight in the project design which did not
pay enough attention to the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. If dam inspection had
taken place before appraisal and not during the project period, the requirements for
rehabilitation could have been built into the project. Also, although MOI was given the
responsibility for the safety and operations of the dam, the original project design failed to
provide it with adequate transportation and facilities. Bank supervision missions detected
these shortcomings and subsequently adjusted the project to correct them. The estimated total
cost at completion was US$69 million (exc!uding taxes and duties), some 73% of appraisal
(Part III, Table 5-b).
Re-sults
4.       The project has to some extent achieved its objectives of improving agricultural
production, increasing foreign exchange earnings, improving living conditions, and
strengthening NHAPC. However, the agricultural production is substantially less than
1/ Ihe quantity of equipment provided by the project was increased until all available foreign
exchange was used.



- iv -
sdmated In tOm SAR for cotton and groundnuts. The estimated rate of return is 12.2%,
although it could be higher if horticultural crops, for which no data was available, were
factored in. This return falls short of the SAR estimate of 75% because the area harvested,
crop yields and economic prices were lower than SAR projections. Also, wheat and
sorghum, which were economically not as profitable, continued to be grown in large irrigated
areas, contrary to the SAR projection. Nevertheless, increased yields and financial crop
prices caused tenant incomes to rise significantly. NHAPC is not yet a financially sound
corporation, largely because GOS determines the amounts NHAPC charges tenants for
services and fixes the charges at less than costs.
sustalnahWIy
S.    Sustained agricultural production will depend on continued serviceability of the
Corporation's agricultural machinery, the availability of water and other inputs, the dedicated
and qualified management of NHAPC, regular dam and canal maintenance, prompt payment
for output and the continuation of good collaboration between PEWC, MOI and NHAPC.
Tho project for the most part has put the agricultural machinery on a firm base (most
machinery is new and there is a large supply of spares), which should enable NHAPC to meet
their obligations for about five years before substantial replacements become necessary.
Efficient production is possible in the futura only if GOS addresses effectively the following
key issues: (i) timely provision of foreign exchange for imported annual inputs; (ii) an
appropriate level of operating & maintenance funding; (iii) continued improvement of
NHAPC's financial performance, which was included as a component under the third
Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1866-SU); and (iv) retention of skilled managerial as
well as technical staff.
6.    The sustainability of the benefits from the health component depends not only on the
continued ava;!ability of chemicals and drugs but a well trained and responsible staff. Present
supplies should suffice for most of 1990, but the source of supplies after that is not
established. The rural water supply component is already suffering from lack of operating
funds. There are several plants not operating adequately due to lack of operators and
chemicals for sterilization.
Lessons Learned
7.    The major lessons learned are:
one cannot assume that farmers would stop growing the crops that provide
their staple food, In this case wheat and sorghum, just because an alternative
crop is recommended; the needs of the farmers deserve attention and the
right incentives and policy framework should be available to influence
farmers' behavior;
all participating ministries and corporations should be involved in project
design early on, in order to ensure their cooperation and that their needs are
adequately addressed by the project; the soundness of bypassing existing
administrative structures (without first giving then: a chance to perform)
should be carefully appraised;



-v-
In a project that depends heavily on the supply of irrigation water, greater
atention should be paid to the state of the irrigation infrastructure during
design and appraisal stages; more generally, wlen the success of a project
depends on the viability of existing infrastructure, a thorough appraisal of
the physical condition and expected life of such infrastructure should always
be conducted;
creative supervision by IDA and timely correction of project design flaws
are vital to the success of the project.
sustainability of project results is contingent on macroeconomic conditions;
to ensure project effectiveness, economic reforms should go hand in hand
with project implementation but this is often beyond the control of lonors,
and even when a country embarks on an economic reform program at the
time of project design and approval.

2.    Macroeconomic Situation. Sudan was facing a crisis in its balance of payments in the
mid-1970s at the time of project formulation. Gross official reserves fell from a level
equivalent to two months' imports in 1974 to only a few days worth of imports. Debt service
obligations mounted and external payments arrears accumulated to about $1.2 billion in
September 1979. The crisis was largely the consequence of inadequate economic management
policies compounded by external factors (such as the oil price rise). The country experienced
a rapid increase in the value of imports and decline in the value of exports due to lower
cotton production. The area of land under cotton and yields fell and the volume of cotton
exports in 1977 was about 35% lower than in 1971. The disincentives t.o growing cotton (eg.
an unfavorable exchange rate and the disproportionate share of production costs charged to
cotton production in the public irrigation schemes) as well as transport difficulties and the
deterioration of the irrigation system due to many years of poor maintenance were reasons for
the decline.
3.    Against this backdrop, Bank Group lending during this period emphasized agricultural
and infrastructural investments, in order to help the country generate increased export
earnings to support the recovery effort. The focus in the near term was on rehabilitation and
increasing irrigation intensity in existing irrigation schemes, which produced 95% of the
cotton exports. At the same time, the Government embarked on a stabilization program
agreed with the IMF and included policy actions to abolish disincentives to cotton production,
a revamping of agricultural production relationships and reform of the exchange rate system.
(Ihe stabilization program was, however, shortlived.)
4.    The Agricultural Sector dominates the Sudanese economy. It provides the livelihood
for 80% of the population and in 1979, contributes about 40% of gross domestic product,



-2 -
95% of exports and almost all inputs for the industrial sector. The sector includes rainfed
and irrigated crop production and livestock. Crop production involves both traditional and
modern mechanized farming methods. Cotton is the major cash and export crop, accounting
fbr some 52% of all exports in the late 1970s; groundnuts, sesame, and gum arabic follow at
18, 9, and 6 percent respectively. Crop diversification has also concentrated on import
substitution, with cortaiderab'e expansion in wheat and sugar output, in part at the expense of
cotton.
5.    The Irrigated Subsector. With about 4 million feddans (1.6 million hectares) under
irrigation, Sudan has the largest irrigated area in Sub-Saharan Africa. Irrigated agriculture
produces about half of the crop output, and almost half of merchandise exports. The main
crops in that sub-sector are cotton, sorghum, groundnut and wheat. The irrigated schemes are
managed by parasratal corporations, which provide most inputs and services. The Ministry of
Irrigation (MOI) is responsible for delivering irrigation water; the tenants supply the labor.
Cotton output deteriorated during the 1970s due to a number of technical and institutional
constraints that caused yields to decline. These Included the absence of land levelling or
drainage, insufficient water, spare parts and other inputs and increasing neglect of
maintenance. These deficiencies were caused by shortages of foreign exchange, the
unavailability of scheduled budget allocations and poor management. In addition, the profit-
sharing system (the "joint account system") stifled farmers incentives by lowering possible
incentives to the more productive cotton growers. Cotton became less and less attractive to
tenants, who devoted increasing attention to other crops and off-farm activities.
6.    Recognizing the severity of the problem, the Government devised a Six Year Plan
(1977-83) which gave priority to the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and, with the help of
MDA, drew up an Export Action Program (EAP) in 1980 to restore production to the early
1970s level. The EAP contained provisions for: financing urgently needed spare parts,
machinery and equipment; allocating foreign exchange to finance increased imports of inputs;
introducing policy and institutional reforms, revising the incentive systems, and taking other
actions to stimulate production. IDA support consisted of a series of rehabilitation projects to
be carried out during the 1980s, principally in the major agricultural schemes where cotton is
grown. In line with the strategy embodied in the EAP, IDA financed projects for the
rehabilitation of the New Haifa (Credit 1022-SU), Blue Nile (Credit 11 18-SU), White Nile
(Credit 11 19-SU) and Gezira (Credit 1388-SU) schemes and a Sugar Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1201-SU) for the four sugar units in the public sector. All rehabilitation projects
included measures to improve management capabilities.
7.    The New Ha1fa Irrigation Scheme (447,000 fd) in Kassala Province, was developed
between 1962 and 1969 with Egyptian grant funds, primarily to resettle people (the
Halfawyeen) displaced when the town of Wadi Haifa was flooded by Lake Nassar. The
scheme was designed to use 1620 million m3 (mcm) of water each year which it draws from
the Kashm-el Girba reservoir on the seasonal Atbara River. Kashm-el Girba dam was
completed in 1964 with an initial reservoir capacity of 1,300 mcm. The average annual
inflow was about 12,000 mcm varying between about 6,000 mcm in August to nothing in
March to May. The reservoir capacity was rapidly reduced by siltation to about 800 mcm in
1976 and despite flushing measures introduced in 1971 continued to decline. MOI has
reduced the loss of storage capacity by increasing the maximum normal storage level by 1 m
(to 474 m above sea level). Water is conveyed to the Project area from the dam through a
main canal with a design capacity of 100 m3/sec and is distributed through a network of
smaller canals.

8.    Tbe scheme area was divided as follows:
(a) 22,000 tenancies         330,000 fd
(b) Halfawyeen freehold land   24,000 fd
(c) Reserved areas           19,000 fd
(d) Research Sub-station     1,000 fd
(e) Afforestation            2,500 fd
(f) Sugar estate             42,000 fd
(g) Infrastructure and waste    29,500 fd
The project area comprised the scheme .ea excluding the sugar estate. New Halfa
Agricultural Production Corporation (1980) (NHAPC) provides agricultural services to the
330,000 fd of tenancies and to the research substation. Cotton, wheat, groundnuts and
sorghum are grown on the tenancies; vegetables and fruit are grown on the freehold land.
9.    When the resettlement of the 7,000 Halfawyeen families was completed, the
remaining tenancies were allocated to local pastoralists (nomads), making a total of 22,000
tenants. The population in the Project area was estimated in 1978 at about 300,000 of whom
68,000 were Halfawyeen, 148,000 nomads, 50,000 migrant laborers and 34,000 inhabitants of
New Halfa town. The rural population is distributed over about 25 planned villages and many
spontaneous settlements. There is little integration between the Halfawyeen and nomads.
They have different origins and customs and, because of this, were settled separately. The
staple food crop of Halfawyeen is wheat and of the nomads sorghum.
10.   The organization of the scheme reflects an intended partnership between the
Govermnent, NHAPC and the tenant. NHAPC, a statutory corporation established by
legislation, has a board representing the various interested parties and is responsible for
supplying goods and services wo the tenant. The tenants cultivate their 15 feddan farms in
accordance with prescribed cropping patterns using family and hired labor. They repay the
Corporation for the goods and services it supplies out of crop proceeds and have their own
organization in the form of a tenants union.
11.   The contract machinery services provided by NHAPC are primarily for cotton
cultivation but extend to wheat and groundnuts because of insufficient private and cooperative
contractors.
PMoeet Objectives and Description
12.   The Project objectives were to: (a) improve agricultural production on about 400,000
feddans; (b) assist Sudan's Export Action Program (EAP) in its goal of increasing the foreign
exchange earnings of the Sudan; (c) improve the living conditions in the project area, and (d)
strengthen the management and administration of NHAPC.
13.   Eriect Components. The project was, over five years, to rehabilitate NHAPC by
providing it with the means to quickly incre-'e and sustain agricultural production through the
efficient use of the available land, water and human resources. Specifically the project was to
include the provision of: (a) agricultural machinery, workshop facilities and fuel storage; (b)



- -
buildings comprising field staff housing, stores and a training center; (c) road making and
amal maintenance equipment and spares; (d) vehicles and spares; (e) electro-mechanical
equipment for the dam; (f) improvement of telecommunications by installation of a VHF radio
tVelphone system, comprising a base station at New Haifa and about 10 solar-powered
substations at strategic points, including the dam, within the New Haifa Irrigation Scheme; (g)
a mechanical delinting plant; (h)training of tractor and harvester drivers and workshop skilled
staff and provision of furniture, equipment and teaching aids for such training; (i)technical
assistance and consultancy; (j) improvement in health services, including rural water supplies,
field health centers, malaria and bilharzia control programs; (k) initial rehabilitation of the
tertiary and quartenary canal system; and (l) cash required by NHAPC during the first three
project years, including the Corporation's departmental costs, working capital for farm input
and cash advances to tenants for land preparation, canal maintenance and irrigated water
supplies. Total projece cost was estimated to be US$105 million (Part III, Table 5-a).
Prolect Design and Orzanication
14.   The project was prepared on the basis of a good feasibility report by fore.v, 
consultants. The project concept and design were generally appropriate to achieve the
objectives. However, given the recurrent problems (in particular logistics and procurement)
of past IDA projects in the Sudan, the appraisal mission war overly optimistic in terms of
potential output achievable within the projected time horizon.
15.   The conceptual foundation was well grounded, yet not clearly understood by the
participating agencies. GOS failed to comprehend why the project included such a large
health component, and it was never clear under whose auspices the responsibility fell.
Consequently this component suffered from lack of funding and trained staff, as well as
agency or ministry commitment. Alse the objective of making NHAPC a financially viable
corporation has not been shar.4 by GOS and NHAPC management.
16.   Roles and responsibilities of the various government institutions involved were in
general clearly defined; however, disagreements between NHAPC and the Ministry of Health
over responsibility for the health component caused delay. NHAPC was responsible for
implementing most of the project. This worked well, making use of the existing staff and
organization. The Public Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC) was responsible for the
electrical and mechanical works at the dam. The Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) was
responsible for the safety, operation and maintenance of the dam. The Project Steering
Committee, which was supposed to review and approve the annual work program, was never
effective. Even so, the aniual work program proved to be a very useful tool which reported
on the previous year's work and formed the basis for the future year. IDA missions generally
discussed and approved the AWP.
17.  'One flaw in the project design was that only about 4% of the project cost was
allocated for irrigation infrastructural rehabilitation. Shortly after the project began, it was
realized that the infrastructure at the Kashm-el Girba dam was precarious and needed major
rehabilitation. In addition, the repair of electro-mechanical equipment, which was supposed
to be carried out by PEWC by late 1981, turned out to require much more than the project
provision of $3 million. (At appraisal, there was already a new generator at the dam and all
that was needed was its installation. Later, it was discovered that the generator had been
removed and a new generator had to be procured under the project.) The project was adjusted
to include a complete rehabilitation of the downstream stilling basin and the electro-



-5 -
mochanical plant at the dam, at a total cost of about US$12 million. Although completed five
years late, these works were vital to the ensure an adequate suipply of irrigation water and
hence the success of the project.
18.   The project design also assumed that the tenants would follow the cropping patterns
reconu_ended by NHAPC, which encouraged the growth of export crops such as cotton and
groundnuts. The SAR projected a decline in the area grown to wheat because of the reduction
In the stored water for wheat production, and omitted the growth of sorghum because
irrigation of sorghum was against GOS policy. However, as sorghum provides the staple
food of two-thirds of the population of the project area and provided good financial returns, it
continued to occupy more than a third of the irrigated NHAPC area, competing against cotton
for water and labor. Wheat accounted for about 16% of the planted area.
Prioj inglementation
19.   The physical works were generally implemented in accordance with the SAR. The
main variations were:
(a)            omission of the raised (earth/gravel fill) road construction contract
because of the problems in maintaining such roads on heavy clay
soils. Instead, road grading and compaction equ.pment were
provided, and the grading and maintenance were carried out by a
NHAPC task force;
(b)            At Kashm-el Girba dam, the provision of seals and steel
waliplates for seven sluicegates; new intake gate trash racks and a
mobile crane, electrical equipment for the compensatory gate and
the bottom gate, lighting and water level gauges, the repair of the
downstream apron and stilling basin;
(c)            provision of a new 3 MW generator at the dam, rewinding of the
Kaplan generators and installation of automatic voltage regulation
for 3 pump-turbines;
(d)            the provision of vehicles and a stone crushing plant for MOI;
(e)            the provision of a 0.75 MW generator for the NHAPC ginnery to
solve the problem of electrical outages; and
(f)            increased quantities of agricultural equipment, vehicles,  spares,
insecticides and health supplies.
Most of the variations were caused by oversight in the project design and its appraisal which
did not pay enough attention to the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. Inspection of the
dams should have been carried out before appraisal and not during the project period. Also,
although MOI was given the responsibility for the safety and operations of the dam, the
onginal project design failed to provide it with adequate transportation and facilities.
Additional equipment and vehicles were later financed under project savings. The estimated
total cost at completion was US$69 million (excluding taxes and duties), some 73% of
appr&isal (Part III, Table 5-b). The main difference was in the category of NHAPC cash



-6 -
requirements which amounted to US$16 million in actual expenditures compared with the
SAR provision of US$36.7 million. The purpose of this component was to provide NHAPC
with working capital and operating funds in the first three years before it became financially
self-sustaining. However, this concept did not take root within  OS and these funds were
used only for the purchase of farm inputs.
20.   The risks foreseen at appraisal (start-up, debt and cost recovery problems and inability
to realize estimated yields) materialized, particularly with regard to yields, to a greater extent
than estimateui (para. 25). The delay in repairing the electro-mechanical equipment and
installation of a new generator at the dam made it impossible to provide adequate water on a
timely basis during the first six years of the project, and yields suffered. Also, the large
areas planted to sorghum and wheat at the expense of cotton and groundnuts were unforeseen.
21.   As expected at appraisal, NHAPC performance in debt and cost recovery lagged
behind target because GOS was reluctant to increase land and water charges, and for the first
six years of the project, there was no cost recovery for non-cotton crops. Although measures
to improve debt and cost recovery were introduced towards the end of the project, they were
not sufficient to offset the accumulated debts. At the end of the project, NHAPC had not yet
become financially self-sustaining.
22.   Another unforeseen problem was the confusion over responsibility for the health
component, causing delays in budget approval and shortages of trained staff. Health services
were normally provided by 4 local councils in the project area. However, the project's two
health components (general and malaria, and bilharzia control) were designed to be
implemented by NHAPC, thus ignoring the traditional mechanisms. The component took off
in the last two years of the project following a redesign in its organization.
23.   The project was substantially completed four years later than estimated in the DCA,
mainly due to:
- delay in obtaining GOS legal opinion in order to declare credit effectiveness;
- temporary suspension of IDA and ADF disbursement due to arrears;
- slow procurement and administrative delays;
- delays in the starts of components not implemented by NHAPC;
- addition of civil works at the Kashm-el Girba dam, which were subsequently delayed
by the floods of 1988.
Eict Reslts
24.   The project has to some extent achieved its objectives of improving agricultural
production (Part III, Table 6a), increasing foreign exchange earnings (Part III, Table 6c),
improving living conditions and strengthening NHAPC. The economic rate of return in the
NHAPC area was estimated at 12.2% but would have been higher if benefits from
horticultural crops were taken into account. These were thought to be substantial but could
not be factored in because of the lack of data. The SAR estimated rate of return is 75%.
The reasons for the discrepancy are: (a) the area harvested was only 210,000 feddans per year
compared with 300,000 feddans projected at appraisal; (b) crop yields were lower than
projected (para. 23); (c) economic prices of cotton, wheat and groundnuts were lower than
projected; and (d) wheat and sorghum continued to account for large areas, contrary to the
SAR projection. Nevertheless, tenants' incomes were raised by about 750% due to the



project (Part III, Table 6c). This was caused by higher yields for cotton and wheat and
increases in harvested areas for sorghum and cotton (Annex A).
25.   Lower than expected yields were attributed to many causes, not all of which occur
every year:
- the uncertain supply of inputs and their untimely application due to late delivery to
site;
- attack by termites (1987-88 season) due to adoption of a different cottonseed treatment
and national shortages of fuel and lubricants which affected land preparation and
insecticide spraying;
- sorghum yields were low because farmers did not like the taste of the high-yielding
hybrid varieties nor the short stalks which were unsuitable for house building and
gave less animal fodder than traditional varieties;
- unreliable electricity supply which meant that ginning was not completed on time thus
incurring post harvest losses of seed cotton; and
- insufficient irrigation water and distribution.
26.   Living conditions in the project area were improved by the increased production and
by the health component which, on the basis of statistics provided by the health authorities,
appeared to have lowered the percentage of positive results from people tested for malaria and
schistosomiasis. Five new water treatment plants were constructed and 41 were improved.
However, these improvements wonld be only temporary if adequate budget (or provisions for
self-financing) for supplies and operations were not made available in the future; there is a
high risk that this will be the case.
27.   The project had little effect on sectoral growth and policies, on the physical and
technological environments and on national institutions. At the end of the project, NHAPC
was still not yet a financially sound corporation. Nonetheless, the project increased annual
agricultural employment by about 1.7 million man-days. It improved the capabilities of
NHAPC by provision of equipment, vehicles, buildings and other facilities as well as training
for staff. Until 1983, NHAPC was unable to offer services on time and up to standard and
was therefore unable to enforce the agreements with tenants. NHAPC's performance is now
satisfactory. Similarly, MOI capability has been improved by the provision of buildings,
equipment, vehicles and training as well as supply of drugs and chemicals.
project Sustainability
28.   The project achieved its objective of arresting the deterioration in the New Halfa
scheme and increasing production. However, in order for the impact to be sustained, the
NHAPC needs to be financially sustainable. Although this was a main objective of the
project, it was not achieved and the NHAPC continues to be financially dependent on
Government. If it remains on this course, it would eventually face the same problems as
before: a lack of funds, particularly foreign exchange, to finance spares and materials to
maintain the system. The Bank is giving further assistance to the Government under other
operations, such as the Third Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1866-SU) and the Public



- 8 -
Enterprise Economic Management Project (Cr. 1789-SU). Diagnostic studies have been done
on selected state enterprises and the Government is now considering privatizing a number of
them, possibly including agricultural corporations.
29.   Secondly, the right macroeconomic conditions need to be in place. These include
appropriate exchange rate, trade and marketing regimes. Although the Sudanese pound had
devalued substantially between 1978 and 1987, the changes in the level of the nominal
exchange rate generally failed to translate int'o increases in real incentives for exporters. Due
to weak demand management and the consequent inflation, the real exchange rate did not
depreciate despite the nominal devaluations. Given the overvalued exchange rate, the
domestic equivalent of proceeds from cotton export is sometimes less than what the
Government pays farmers for their cotton. Regarding marketing, Government continues to
monopolize cotton sales: tenants sell all their cotton to the scheme management, and receive
their sale proceeds according to the price fixed by the Government less deductions towards
recovering some of the costs of the NHAPC. Because of this arrangement, tenants tend to
regard cotton as the "government crop' and are generally reluctant to grow it. Another area
where extensive government control works to the detriment of productivity is the procurement
of imported physical inputs - fertilizers, pesticides, spare parts and others. The cumbersome
procedures have led to the unavailability of essential production materials at the time they are
needed.
30.   The sustainability of the benefits from the health component depends not only on the
continued availability of chemicals and drugs but a well trained and responsible staff. Present
supplies should suffice for most of 1990, but the source of supplies after that is not
established. The rural water supply component is already suffering from lack of funds to
operate the system. There are several plants not operating adequately due to lack of operators
and chemicals for purification.
I12A P-erformance
31.   At Government's request, IDA arranged for foreign consultants to prepare a feasibility
study, which resulted in a generally well prepared project. However, the omission of
irrigation rehabilitation and funds for a new generator at the dam was detrimental to the
project. This was later corrected through responsive supervision, although delays in
implementation and a reduction in project benefits resulted.
32.   About 16 IDA missions visited the Sudan between September 1980 and November
1988 for general supervision of the project: other missions supervised individual components,
particularly health. The missions adopted a constructive attitude and enabled several changes
to be made to the project and to the DCA and funds to be reallocated between disbursement
categories. The NHAPC staff received valuable advice and assistance from supervision
missions. In common with other projects in the Sudan, the auditing of project accounts was
never in compliance with the covenants of the DCA and IDA was unable to correct this.
Supervision missions failed to ensure that separate project accounts were maintained by
NHAPC. The main consequence of this is that no adequate record of local costs of the
project was readily available to the PCR mission.

Borwer Performarc
33.   The main executing agency (NHAPC), generally performed satisfactorily but GOS
failed to set the framework to enable NHAPC to become a financially viable corporation.
GOS fixes the price of cotton paid to farmer, the amount farmets pay NHAPC for land and
water charges and the charge for irrigation. None of these reflects the true costs.
34.   NHAPC had an effective organization and management before the project and
preserving this with only minor alterations enabled smooth implementation of the project.
Other agencies involved with the project performed less satisfactorily. The inability of MOI
to agree with the Bank design criteria for some canal rehabilitation during project preparation
caused the omission of all rehabilitation of the main canal system from the project. PEWC
did not meet critica' deadlines for repair of the electrical and mechanical works at the dam.
Lack of cooperation with NHAPC by the health and the telecommunication authorities delayed
the health component and the installation of the telecommunication systems. Other delays
were caused by slow approval of contracts by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
and shortage of local currency to pay local contractors. Compliance with covenants is
described in Part Ill, Section 7.
Project Relationships
35.   The relationship between the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory with respect to this
project. There was continuous dialogue concerning matters such as the prices to be paid
farmers for cotton, cost recovery and the land and water chargvs and auditing of NHAPC
accounts. The relationships between the cofinancing agencies were good. IFAD joined two
supervision missions and agreed on all changes to the project documents.
Consulting Services
36.   Consultants were extensively used during the project. NHAPC employed short-term
foreign consultants for urgent work to prepare the first annual work programs, advise on the
tenants credit units and financial matters and to develop a workable cost accounting system.
Later, foreign procurement specialists, a secretarial training officer, a financial services
consultant and consultants for the Development Planning Unit were appointed. While most
consultants performed satisfactorily, there were two disappointments as follows: (a) the
consultant for the dam civil work rehabilitation incorrectly designed dimensions of the
undersluice gates which led to delays in implementation and cost overruns; and (b) the
consultant agronomist and irrigation engineer failed to establish appropriate field model of on-
farm water management. NHAPC terminated both experts and the related technical assistance
from the consulting firm and instead hired a Sudanese team from the Agricultural Research
Corporation, which performed satisfactorily.
proiect Documentation and Data
37.   Tle legal agreements were satisfactory. The SAR provided a useful framework for
the Bank and Borrower during implementation. Most data relevant to the PCR were readily
available, but the absence of project specific accounts made it very difficult to estimate the
local components of costs.

38.   'he major lessons learned are:
one cannot assume that farmers would stop growing the crops that
provide their staple food, in this case wheat and sorghum, just
because an alternative crop is recommended; the needs of the
farmers deserve attention and the right incentives and policy
framework should be available to influence farmers' behavior;
all participating ministries and corporations should be involved in
project design early on, in order to ensure their cooperation and
that their needs are adequately addressed by the project; the
soundness of bypassing existing administrative structures (without
first giving them a chance to perform) should be carefully
appraised;
in a project that depends heavily on the supply of irrigation water,
greater attention should be paid to the state of the irrigation
infrastructure during design and appraisal stages; more generally,
when the success of a project depends on the viability of existing
infrastructure, a thorough appraisal of the physical condition and
expected life of such infrastructure should always be conducted;
creative supervision by IDA and timely correction of project design
flaws are vital to the success of the project.
sustainability of project results is contingent on macroeconomic
conditions; to ensure project effectiveness, economic reforms
should go hand in hand with project implementation but this is
often beyond the control of donors, and even when a country
embarks on an economic reform program at the time of project
design and approval.

2/ The project was substantially complete by 30 June 1989. Delays were
due to: the delay in the credit becoming effective; delay in the
start of some components not implemented by NHAPC; temporary suspension
of disbursements by IDA and ADB; procurement and other administrative
delays, and the floods of 1988 which delayed completion of the works
at Kashm-el-Girba Dam.

Economic Rate
of Return (ERR)                  75%                            12.2%
Underlying Assumptions: 1/
1.  Project life                  20 years                    20 years
2.  Full development               1984/85                      1989/90
3.  Labour valued at               LS 1/MD                     LS 9.9/MD
4.  Standard conversion factor    0.435                           0.6
5.  Base year of constant prices  1980/81                       1989/90
6.  Land and water charges         Undercharged                 Upward
adjustment
made
i.   Crop production includes      Fodder                     Sorghum
but rio sorghum            but no fodder
Comments:   The main reasons for the difference between this rate of
return and the rate of return estimated at appraisal are:
a) At project completion,only 210,000 feddans were
harvested compared to 300,000 feddans as projected
at appraisal.
b) Lower yields than projected
c) Lower projected prices
d) Upward adjustment of land and water charges to reflect the
amount tenants should be charged.

A.  financial Analvsis
1.       In  order  to  quantify  the  financial  impact  of  the project on
tenants, a partial analysis of average tenancy was carried out. The analysis
was partial in that it was restricted to crop production and no account was
taken of off-tenancy incomes which were not expected to change due to the
project.
Analvsis of Averaae Tenancy
2.       At  full  development,  the  harvested  area  of an average tenancy
increased by about 28% from 7.45 feddans to 9.54 feddans due to project
intervention. 1 /  This  increase  was  mainly  for cotton (14%) and sorghum
which  has  more  than  doubled  in  the  harvested  area' (119%).   Project
intervention also resulted in increased yields for cotton (85%), groundnuts
(6%), wheat (61%) and sorghum (13%).

3.       The  impact  of increased yields and harvested area, and changes in
cropping pattern on an average tenant's income and returns to family labour
are shown in Tables 1-12. These tables also include debt service payments.

4.       The  tables  show  that  the  project increased gross margin of the
average tenancy by a factor of 6.7 at full development. The increase was
mainly due to higher yields for cotton and wheat, and increases in harvested
areas for sorghum and cotton. As a result of project intervention man-day
return in an average tenancy increased by just under 5 times from LS 8.9 to
LS 44.1.
1 /     A total of 22,000 tenants benefited from the project as envisaged
in SAR.

Economic Re-Evaluation
Aqsumotinn
5.       A project  life  of  20  years  (1981/2-2000/1)  was  assumed.  The
incremental benefits due to the project were taken as negligible for the
first two years (1981/2 to 1982/3). Full development with the project was
assumed to be achieved in 1986/87 and was taken as the average of the areas
and production achieved in 1986/7 and 1987/8. The year 1988/9 was excluded
from this average because of very unusual weather. Tne incremental benefits
due to the project were assumed to be 50% of full development in 1983/4,
increasing to 67% and 83% in the following years.
6.       Full  development  without  the project was based on the average of
the years 1978/9 to 1981/2.

7.       Wheat area was assumed to decline from 33,000 feddans in 1989/90 to
nil in the last year of project life due to the lack of irrigation caused by
siltation in the reservoir. Areas for other crops and all yields were
assumed to remain constant.
8.       Owing  to  the  absence of project specific accounts, project costs
were estimated on the basis of disbursement applications. The foreign
currency expenditure was converted to USS using the average exchange rate
applicable in the calendar year of the letter of credit. This was entered as
a cost in the financial year beginning on 1 July in the year of the letter
of credit.  1 /For equipment and materials local costs, excluding duties and
taxes, were estimated to be 15% of foreign costs.
1 /     For example, the letter of credit number 18/84 related to 30,200
pounds sterling disbu'rsement application number 81 for spraying
machines. This was converted to USS using the average exchange rate
in 1984 (PDS1 equals USS 1.34) and entered as a project cost in
1984/5.

9.       Costs and benefits were expressed in 1989 prices. Foreign costs and
traded goods were converted into border prices at the official exchange rate
of USS 1.0 a LS 4.5 in 1989. Local costs and non-traded goods were converted
into border prices by using the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.60,
which is generally used for the economic evaluation of agricultural projects
in Sudan. Incremental costs included direct investments which were converted
to 1989 constant USS using World Bank MUV index (Table 32). Inputs were
excluded in the calculation of direct investments as they were already
included in the incremental cost of production. Replacement costs were
included based on the assumed economic life of 7 years for agricultural
machinery, equipment and motor vehicles. Prices for fertilizer (urea) and
crops  produced  by  the  project  were  based  on  the  world market prices
projected to 1995 in 1989  prices  with  adjustments  for. local  costs,  as
presented  in  Tables  13-17,  to arrive at export parity prices for cotton,
groundnuts and sorghum and import parity prices for wheat and urea. For  the
period 1995 - 2001, the 1995 projected prices expressed in constant 1989
prices are used. A complete list of prices is presented in Table 18,
quantities of inputs and ouputs in Table 19 and economic crop average
tenancy and all tenants budgets in Tables 20-31.
10.      An upward adjustment of land and water charges is made  to  reflect
the amount tenants should be charged. The following methodology was used:
Water charge per feddan for crop (c      [        T       ]Ni
Ai Ni
Where T - Total operating cost of irrigation for the project,
Ai- Harvested area of crop c (expressed in feddans)
Nis Number of irrigations per feddan of crop c;
Summed over all irrigated crops of the project
Water charge per feddan =              [ E- W + D - R ]
t ~A 
Where E = Total expenditure of NHAPC
W a Water charge included above
D * Depreciation
R - Revenue
A * Harvested area of the project.
The number of irrigations per feddan used for each crop were: 12, 8, 10
and 4 respectively for cotton, groundnuts, wheat and sorghum.

Ecnnomic Rat. cf Return
11.      In order to summarize the  economic  impact  of  the  project,  the
economic  rate  of return (ERR) was calculated for a period of 20 years. The
net incremental revenue and direct investments, together with  the  economic
cash  flow  of  the  project  are  presented in Table 33. With the foregoing
assumptions, the project's ERR is estimated to be 12.2%.
12.      The main reasons for the difference between this rate of return and
the rate of return of 75% estimated at appraisal are:
a) At project completion, only 210,000 feddans were being harvested
each year compared with 300,000 feddans projected at appraisal.
b) Crop yields are lower than orojected.
c) Economiv prices of cotton, wheat and groundnuts are lower than
projected.
Foreign Exchange Earninas/Sav'
13.      As  a  result  of  project  intervention  net  incremental  foreign
exchange, earnings/savings 1 /from crop production at full development are
estimated to be USS19.3 milTion per year in 1989 prices. This was due to
increased production of export crops: cotton (111%), sorghum (147%) and
groundnuts (6%) and also increased output of wheat (612) which would
otherwise tb  imported.
Other Economic Benef_ts
14.      The project, as a whole, provided around 1.687 million man/days  of
extra employment. This means an increase of 36.6X at full development.
Family labour employment increased by 79.9% and hired labour by 24.2%.

Dear Mr. Shivakumar,                                          For Aot1o0
sUDpA-Nsw HALFA IRRICATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
We refer to your letter of 29 January 1991 concerning the Project
Completion  Report  for the above project.   We were unable to complete our
review of the report before the end of March as requested due to other
commitments. However, our comments are given below.
We find that the report covers the project implementation very well
and the project clearly made some positive achievements even though it did not
fully meet all the objectives.
We  feel   that  the  impact  of  the  Agricultural  Rehabilitation
Programmes, financed by IDA, ADB and other bilateral agencies, on the project
should have been discussed, especially as the report states that one of the
lessons learned is the importance of macro-economic reforms.  The ARP's were
Implemented at the same time as the New Halfa Project and they caused many
policy changes, such as price liberalisation, tenant account system etc.
These policy changes were probably as much responsible for production
increases as the project itself.
The exogenous factors such as drought, floods, sanctions against
Suean whi.-h di.crunted disbursements and political instability could also have
been cited as reasons for slow project implementation and a failure to fully
meet the targetted production.
The ADF loan for this project has not yet been fully utilised. We
therefore do not envisage carrying  out  a PCR  until  1992.   However,  once
completed we will send you a copy for your information and comments.
Yours sincerely,
S. D. CHIRWA
Division Chief
Agriculture and Rural
Development Department - North Region
